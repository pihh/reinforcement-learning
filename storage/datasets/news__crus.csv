13895,235410,CRUS,Renewed Trade Talks Boost Tech Stocks  5 Solid Buys,opinion,The U S  China trade war has been a major concern since mid 2018  Both countries have been imposing billions of dollars of tariffs on each other  This has impacted American tech stocks mostly due to their high exposure to China However  after several ups and downs  it seems that the phase one deal is coming soon thanks to positive comments from both China and President Donald Trump  In case this happens  tech stocks are sure to gain Phase One Deal in MakingThe United States had scheduled 15  tariff on consumer goods worth  156 billion from China on Dec 15  And the market turned highly volatile on Dec 3 after President Trump said that a trade deal with China is unlikely before the 2020 U S  elections  But the very next day  a Bloomberg report indicated that a partial trade deal would be completed before Dec 15 Some communication on Dec 5  eased tensions  Beijing said   China s trade negotiations with the United States remain on track   offering official assurance  Additionally  on the same day  Trump said that the U S  China trade talks are  moving right along   He also clarified that  on December 15th  something could happen but we are not discussing that yet  We are having very good discussions with China  however  Tech Stocks Climb NorthThe report on trade talk progress not only snapped Wall Streets  three day losing streak  but also indicated that both the United States and China are closer on agreeing on how much tariffs would be rolled back in a  phase one  trade deal Evidently  a rise in tariff increases the price of U S  goods sold to other countries  In this case  an additional 15  tariff means that Chinese consumers will have to pay extra for American products  The technology sector that is highly exposed to China has been bearing the brunt of a protracted trade war  Tech giants like Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  had to suffer revenue loss as increased tariffs hiked the price of iPhones and other devices Semiconductor and chip stocks like Texas Instruments  NASDAQ TXN  and Nvidia had seen stocks declining by nearly 5  in a single day due to tariff war  Chip manufacturers generate more than 50  of their revenues from China  So  higher tariffs have them looking for new customers as finished goods keep piling up Nonetheless  with positive developments on the trade front  the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund  XLK  closed 0 4  higher on Dec 5  while the iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF  SOXX  rose 0 5  Grab These Stocks NowGiven the positive developments on the trade

13907,235422,CRUS,90 Day US License Extension To Boost Chip Stocks  5 Picks,opinion,The United States had blacklisted Huawei Technologies earlier this year  which weighed heavily on American chipmakers  After all  U S  semiconductor companies were selling products to the Chinese telecom giant and Trump s administration s allegations hampered their businesses to a large extent  However  the country s third 90 day license extension will not only help Huawei s customers  but also boost the company s American suppliers  operations Huawei to Enjoy 90 Day Extension for Third TimeOn Nov 18  the U S  Department of Commerce granted a new 90 day extension that allows U S  companies to continue doing business with China s Huawei Technologies  This Temporary General License or TGL will let firms sell products to Huawei that do not pose national security concerns  Earlier on Aug 17 and Oct 9  U S  companies had got license extensions to sell goods to Huawei The Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross  made is quite clear that this extension is intended to primarily benefit the rural telecommunication companies that are dependent on Huawei s equipment  Meanwhile  the U S  regulatory committee continues crafting rules on foreign telecom firms that pose national security risks Why Does Huawei Impact U S  Chipmakers Huawei Technologies is a major customer of U S  chip companies  the company alone purchased  11 billion worth of software and chips in 2018  With the company being blacklisted  American firms were having a hard time to find customers Semiconductor firms like Micron Technology  NASDAQ MU   Inc   Skyworks  NASDAQ SWKS  Solutions  Inc  and Qorvo  Inc    NASDAQ QRVO   witnessed a steep decline in sales in recent quarters  On Oct 9 midnight  Trump s administration had issued licenses to some U S  companies  permitting them to sell non sensitive products to Huawei  This had boosted chipmakers hugely Now  this 90 day extension will help the semiconductor space

Micro Devices  NASDAQ AMD   Inc  climbed 4 6  and 3 5   respectively  on Nov 18 Why Invest in Chipmakers Sales of chips highly depend on sales of smartphone  personal computers  and servers for data centers as chips play a vital role in any technology development  As the world shifts toward automation  and trends like IoT  5G  self driving cars and artificial intelligence emerge  the demand for chips increases Amid the trade tiffs  companies like Applied Materials  NASDAQ AMAT   Inc   Advanced Energy Industries  Inc  and Inphi Corporation are some that topped third quarter earnings and

13914,235429,CRUS,5 Relative Price Strength Stocks To Buy For Optimum Returns,opinion,Investors generally gauge a stock s potential returns by examining earnings growth and valuation multiples  At the same time  it s important to measure the performance of such a stock relative to its industry or peers  or the appropriate benchmark If you see that a stock is underperforming on fundamental factors  then it would be prudent to move on and find a better alternative  However  those outperforming their respective sectors in terms of price should be selected because they stand a better chance to provide considerable returns Then again  it is imperative that you determine whether or not an investment has relevant upside potential when considering stocks with significant relative price strength  Stocks delivering better than the S P 500 over a period of 1 to 3 months at the least and having solid fundamentals indicate room for growth and are the best ways to go about this strategy Finally

13938,235453,CRUS,5 Top Tech Picks As Trump Finds Trade Deal Going  Very Well ,opinion,The U S  China trade war seemed to ease on Oct 11 after the high level trade talk pointed toward a  phase one  deal to be signed in November  However  terms worsened as geopolitical tension cropped up and dampened investors  sentiments But  the Trump administration s positive comment on the trade front on Oct 21 seems to have cheered up investors  With major benchmarks trending north  it is a good time to invest in trade sensitive tech stocks as they seem to grow with the advancement of healthy trade between the two economic giants in the world Optimism on Trade FrontA sign of relief came on Oct 21 after a week long roller coaster ride  due to weak economic data and pessimism over rising geopolitical tension  President Donald Trump told reporters  the deal with China  is  coming along very well  and also claimed that U S  tariffs have taken a toll on China s economy and impacted the supply chain A series of good news followed after Trump s comment  U S  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer reported that the administration aims to finalize the  phase one  deal first  before the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting  which is scheduled on Nov 16 and 17 in Chile White House adviser Larry Kudlow also added to the optimism in his report saying   tariffs scheduled for December could be withdrawn if talks go well   China on the other hand said they will work with the U S  administration to address each other s core concerns On Oct 15  IMF had downgraded the global economic growth to 3   the slowest in a decade  It had warned of worse consequences if the U S  China trade war continues  Hence  any news of easing trade war induces optimism among investors and boosts markets The positive effect could be clearly seen as the trade sensitive technology sector of the S P 500 rose 1 1   pushing the major benchmark to notch its first close above 3 000 since Sep 18 Why Tech Stocks Suffered the Most in Trade WarTech stocks have been bearing the weight of the prolonged trade war between the United States and China  U S  companies that are involved in memory chips  semiconductors  peripherals and software licenses business are impacted deeply with Chinese companies being blacklisted and increase in tariffs A major customer of U S  tech companies  Huawei Technologies  purchases around  11 billion worth the foresaid goods every year  With the company being blacklisted  American firms are not finding customers for their products Chip manufacturers like Texas Instruments  NASDAQ TXN  and Nvidia had seen stocks declining nearly 5  in a single day due to tariff war and loss of customers  Tech giants like Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  had to suffer revenue loss

13986,235501,CRUS,5 Tech Stocks To Buy On A Likely US China Interim Trade Deal,opinion,After a rough August  when the year old trade conflict between the United States and China heightened  it seems that tensions are now cooling on both sides  Several initiatives have been taken by the economic giants to restart the negotiation process  Although neither is thinking of an immediate solution to the trade dispute  these developments should help in defusing growing trade related concerns Possibility of an Interim Trade Deal  On Sep 12  President Donald Trump told reporters that he is not averse to an interim trade deal with China although his preference will be to have a full agreement resulting in a complete trade deal with the Asian economic powerhouse Earlier that day  Bloomberg reported that high level officials of the Trump administration are considering offering an interim trade deal to China  Bloomberg cited five internal sources that say the U S  government would like to delay imposing new tariffs on Chinese goods or it may even roll back some tariffs which are already levied on China for the first time since the trade dispute started in March 2018 In return  the U S  government wants China to substantially increase imports of domestic agricultural products  Also  more importantly  the Chinese authority must comply with their earlier commitments related to the use and application of intellectual properties  before the trade negotiation broke down in May Notably  intellectual property theft by Chinese companies in the guise of producing goods for the American tech giants is the rationale behind the Trump administration s imposition of these tariffs  Safeguarding of the highly valuable patents of the American tech heavy companies from China is of foremost importance to the United States Pressure on Both Countries Neither the United States nor China has appeared victorious in the trade battle so far  Instead both countries along with the global economy have been suffering over the past one year owing to slowing growth and exports In the second quarter of 2019  China s economic growth fell to lowest level in 27 years  China s imports have fallen in six out of first seven months this year  indicating its sluggish economic growth  China s manufacturing PMI for July came in at below 50  reflecting contraction of Chinese manufacturing On the other hand  the U S  economy is currently witnessing a dichotomized character  While consumer centric data and labor market data revealed a solid foothold in the U S  economy  the business segment is bearing the brunt of tariff war Higher input costs  shrinkage in exports  and lack of proper government policies  resulted in a plunge in business investments  Moreover  the new tariffs will be levied mostly on consumer goods  which is likely to dent consumer spending  the brightest spot in the economy  to a large extent  Additionally  the U S  general election is due in November 2020  compelling Trump to reach some sort of a deal Consequently  from the beginning of September  both sides have shown eagerness to defuse trade related tensions On Sep 11  China s Ministry of Finance said in a statement on its website that it will exempt some U S  products in the areas of cancer drugs  lubricants  pesticides and shrimp meal from tariff for one more year  These products were scheduled to be under the new tariff effective next week On the other hand  President Donald Trump has tweeted that he will delay imposing 30  tariff replacing the existing 25  on  250 billion of Chinese goods from Oct 1 to Oct 15 as a  gesture of good will  after Chinese vice premier Liu He requested the same as  the People s Republic of China will be celebrating their 70th Anniversary  Technology Stocks to Benefit the Most China plays the role of a low cost supplier of intermediary products and other inputs to high tech U S  industries  At the same time  China is also the largest market for U S  high tech products  Repeal of tariffs on Chinese intermediary goods will raise the profit margin of U S  tech giants and a will boost demand for their products At this stage  we have narrowed down our

14006,235521,CRUS,5 Great Chip Stocks To Buy On Fresh Trade Deal Hopes,opinion,The Dow advanced more than 250 points on Aug 26 following encouraging comments on trade from President Trump  The U S  President revealed that China was willing to recommence trade talks following telephonic discussions on Aug 24  The news provided a much needed respite to the embattled American investor  following the heavy losses suffered on Aug 23 As a result of Trump s announcement  semiconductor stocks surged  staging a strong rebound after Friday s reverses  This is one of the sectors on which the trade war has weighed heavily since it derives a large chunk of its business from China  But fresh trade deal hopes have reminded investors that the sector has a bright future  Investing in select semiconductor stocks makes for a smart choice at this point Trump Says China Ready to Return to NegotiationsOn Monday  Trump said China was willing to restart trade talks  citing two  very good calls  from Beijing  The U S  President was speaking to reports on the sidelines of the G 7 meeting in Biarritz  France  Trump indicated that serious negotiations between the two trade rivals would likely begin in earnest very soon According to Trump  China held an important telephonic call with U S negotiators and said  let s get back to the table   The U S  President thinks that the world s second largest economy has been hurt very badly but they understand this is the right thing to do   Trump said that he respected China s decision  describing it as  a very positive development for the world  Chip Stocks Surge on Deal HopesSemiconductor stocks surged following Trump s comments with Micron   NASDAQ MU   and Advanced Micro Devices   NASDAQ AMD   ending the day 1 1  and 2 5  higher  respectively  Meanwhile  Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  led gains for the Dow  advancing by 1 9   This was in sharp contrast to events on Friday when chip stocks plunged after China announced the imposition of retaliatory tariffs on U S  goods This is because the semiconductor space has a heavy exposure to the Chinese economy  For instance  AMD derives nearly 26  of its total revenues from China  per data from Goldman Sachs   NYSE GS   released in March 2018  Similarly  Qualcomm   NASDAQ QCOM   generates 69  of its revenues from China while NVIDIA   NASDAQ NVDA   derives 56   This is why fresh trade deal hopes have boosted the sector s fortunes Our ChoicesAfter facing heavy reverses last Friday following the imposition of retaliatory tariffs by China  renewed trade deal hopes revived the fortunes of the semiconductor space  Trump will likely push for a near term trade deal ahead of the presidential polls since fresh tariffs are hurting large sections of loyal voters This is why it makes sense

14008,235523,CRUS,Marvell  MRVL  Q2 Earnings   Revenues Outpace Estimates,opinion,Marvell Technology Group Ltd    NASDAQ MRVL   reported second quarter fiscal 2020 non GAAP earnings of 16 cents  which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 15 cents  However  it declined 43  from the year ago quarter Marvell s revenues of  657 million surpassed the consensus estimate of  650 million  However  the figure declined 1 2  year over year Strong year over year growth in networking business positively impacted the top line  Key deal wins across applications like infotainment  ADAS  telematics  central gateway and body domain controllers also acted as a tailwind However  due to the export restriction on Huawei  and other persistent macroeconomic challenges  the top line was affected on a sequential basis Further  higher operating margins put pressure on the bottom line Marvell Technology Group Ltd  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Quarter DetailsIn the end markets  storage revenues  42  of total revenues  dropped 18  year over year to  275 million  and 1  sequentially  due to pressure from the export restriction  Nonetheless  significant demand from storage controller customers in the HDD  SSD and fiber channel end markets positively impacted revenues from this segment  The slow but steady depletion of excess inventory in supply chains of certain storage controller customers was also a tailwind The networking business  50   jumped 16  year over year to  329 6 million  driven by seasonal growth  Relatively higher demand from Chinese enterprise and data center customers who were not affected by the Huawei ban was a breather  However  the Huawei ban and negligible demand from base station OEMs that are currently migrating 4G to 5G  led to a 3  sequential decline in revenues from this segment Other product  8   revenues during the fiscal second quarter increased 13  on a year over year basis to  52 1 million During the fiscal second quarter  the company also successfully reached its operating expense reduction goals post the Cavium acquisition MarginsMarvell s non GAAP gross profit came in at  415 5 million  down 2  on a year over year basis reflecting a weaker product mix due to impact of export restriction and low storage revenues  Non GAAP gross margin contracted 40 basis points  bps  to 63 3  Non GAAP operating expenses rose 13 7  year over year to  279 8 million  However  due to the cost synergies achieved from the integration of Cavium  Non GAAP operating expenses declined 5 1  sequentially  Non GAAP operating margin contracted 600 bps to 20 7  Balance SheetMarvell exited the quarter with cash  cash equivalents of  573 5 million compared with  571 9 million in the previous quarter The company s long term debt totaled  1 69 billion compared with  1 73 billion in the previous quarter  Cash from operating activities amounted to  73 14 million compared with  165 8 million in the prior quarter During the quarter  Marvell paid dividend of around  40 million to shareholders and bought back  60 million of its shares GuidanceMarvell projects third quarter fiscal 2020 revenues of  660 million  up or down up to 3  In the fiscal third quarter  demand from enterprise networking end market storage controllers is expected to remain soft due to continued weak macroeconomic conditions  Impact of the export restrictions and accounting for the customer factory transition is expected to lead to an approximate low single digit sequential decline in networking revenues Seasonal decline in Wi Fi revenues is also expected to be an overhang for the fiscal third quarter An increase in demand for storage controllers from the data center and enterprise markets is likely to be a positive  Demand  particularly from high capacity nearline drives  combined with some improvement in the SSD market after a period of under shipment  is expected to drive storage revenues  Demand for fiber channel adapter is also expected to rise in the fiscal third quarter However  demand for HDDs for PCs in gaming is expected to remain weak  but with slight seasonal growth  resulting in an approximate high single digit sequential growth in fiscal third quarter storage revenues Management expects non GAAP gross margin between 63  and 64  for the quarter  reflecting a weaker product mix due to impact of export restriction and low storage revenues Non GAAP operating expenses are estimated to be  280 million  which can be further stretched by  2 5 million up or down The company anticipates non GAAP earnings per share in the band

14065,235580,CRUS,Flex Prices Public Offering Of  450M Senior Notes Due 2029,opinion,"Flex Ltd    NASDAQ FLEX   has priced a public offering of  450 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes  The note carries an interest rate of 4 875   The notes will mature on Jun 6  2029  subject to customary closing conditions  The company has filed for registration under the Securities and Exchange Commission  the  SEC    
J P  Morgan Securities LLC  BNP Paribas  PA BNPP  Securities and Citigroup  NYSE C  Global Markets Inc  are acting as joint book running managers for the purpose  The offering is made under the company s shelf registration statement 
Net proceeds from the planned offering along with available cash will be used to fund the concurrent cash tender offer for any and all of the  500 000 000 outstanding aggregate principal amount  carrying an interest rate of 4 625  and due 2020 
Share Price
The company s share price movement has been quite favorable  On a year to date basis  its shares have returned 21 8   outperforming the  s growth of 15 3  

Factors in Favor of Flex
The company has a diverse end market as well as customer base  courtesy of its  Sketch to Scale  approach  Moreover  based on its growing intellectual property   IP   portfolio  the company is well positioned to address the needs of customers  who are looking to leverage the proliferation of Internet of Things  IoT   autonomous connected cars  artificial intelligence   AI    Industrial automation  augmented   virtual reality  AR VR   and 5G technologies 
As of Mar 31  2019  cash   cash equivalents were  1 697 billion  up from  1 503 billion at the end of the previous quarter  Flex generated  245 6 million as net cash from operations during the reported quarter compared with  283 3 million in the previous quarter  Free cash flow came in at  119 6 million compared with  128 3 million reported in the third quarter 
During the fourth quarter  the company repurchased approximately 6 6 million shares for  65 million  With share buybacks  the company intends to return 50  or more of its annual free cash flow to shareholders 
The public stock offering is expected to boost the company s financial flexibility and help meet its financial obligations in an efficient way  Moreover  it provides ample scope to deploy capital for long term growth opportunities and rewarding higher returns to stockholders  at the same time 
Bottom Line
Flex is benefiting from robust performance across edge and hyperscale computing end markets  New bookings primarily from medical group deserve a special mention  Strength in the company s IP portfolio and low cost manufacturing are other positives  Moreover  stringent cost measures are aiding margin expansion 
However  sluggish demand from China  soft demand from networking customers  and weakness in semiconductor capital equipment and energy verticals negatively impacted the last reported financial performance 
The company had reported fourth quarter fiscal 2019 adjusted earnings of 27 cents per share  which came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  The figure declined 3 6  from the year ago quarter 
Revenues also declined 2 9  from the year ago quarter to  6 226 billion  lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  6 481 billion 
Nonetheless  the company has an expected EPS growth rate of 16 5   Notably  the stock has delivered positive earnings surprises in two of the trailing four quarters  with average beat of 4 2

14066,235581,CRUS,5 Mid Cap Semiconductor Stocks To Buy Right Now,opinion,"The semiconductor market has historically been highly cyclical as it is closely connected to various other markets  This normal fluctuation along with the current U S  China trade war has created a market that has done significantly worse than the S P YTD  That being said  here are some semiconductor stocks that still appear strong even with the current situation 
All 5 stocks in this article have a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  or better  Additionally  all stocks are mid cap  Market Capitalization between  1 and  10 billion  
Lattice Semiconductor   NASDAQ LSCC  
Zacks Rank   2  Buy 
Lattice is ranked third in the world for its market share of  field programmable gate array devices   YTD  Lattice is up 78   That significant jump can make investors hesitant to buy as it seems there is no way the stock could continue to go higher  but with Lattice that does not seem to be the case  Lattice has an  A  grade for Growth in our Style Scores system and our Zacks Consensus Estimates call for 48  and 31  year over year EPS growth for fiscal 2019 and 2020  respectively with EPS expected to be  0 64 by the end of fiscal 2020 compared to its EPS of  0 33 in 2018  This  along with the recent product releases related to AI and a market that continues to grow  could help to fuel Lattice s future growth and success 
Cirrus Logic Inc    NASDAQ CRUS  
Zacks Rank   1  Strong Buy 
Cirrus Logic is a semiconductor company that mainly deals in audio related technology  Cirrus on paper seems very similar to Lattice in that both seem to have good growth prospects  Cirrus is up 14  YTD which is clearly not as good as Lattice  But our Zacks Consensus Estimates call for its earnings to drop 14 4  during the current fiscal year and then quickly rebound 11 8  in fiscal 2021  CRUS starts its fiscal year in March   And CRUS  current year earnings estimate revisions have trended heavily in the right direction recently  This means at least some analysts are more positive about Cirrus Logic s bottom line than they were before the quarter began 
Cypress Semiconductor Corp   NASDAQ CY  
Zacks Rank   2  Buy 
Cypress has a variety of automotive related semiconductor products and is based in San Jose  CA  Cypress is up over 15  since market open on Wednesday  This sudden jump came from speculation of a possible buyout or merger  Cypress claimed to have received a buyout offer and seem to be using this information to help leverage a better deal from the initial company or another company  A buyout could provide quick profit for investors as Cypress hopefully would not accept a buyout offer less than its market value  If a buyout were not to occur  there is still reason to invest  Zacks Consensus Estimates put year over year EPS growth for Cypress at over 11   fueled by projected revenue growth of 5  for fiscal 2020 
Power Integrations Inc   NASDAQ POWI  
Zacks Rank   2  Buy 
Based in Silicon Valley  Power Integrations develops and produces semiconductors for multiple industries  The company has had multiple positive earnings estimate revisions as of late which helps it earn a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   Along with these revisions  the industry it s in  Semiconductors Power  is currently ranked No  1 out of over 250 Zacks industries  which is a positive sign for all the companies in the industry and helps Power Integrations stand out as a possible good addition to a portfolio  Our Zacks Consensus Estimate has Power Integrations  EPS surging 27  along with a 14 7  revenue increase for fiscal 2020  This would  however  come after a projected 12 5  earnings decline this year and 0 72  revenue growth 
Semiconductor Manufacturing Intl Corporation   NYSE SMI  
Zacks Rank   2  Buy 
Headquartered in Shanghai  Semiconductor Manufacturing International provides manufacturing services for certain integrated circuit process technologies  Zacks Consensus Estimates has SMI s revenue decreasing around 10  for fiscal 2019  but is then supposed to jump back up 6 5  in fiscal 2020  This  coupled with the recent upward earnings estimate revisions for fiscal 2019 and 2020 make it look like SMI may be able to build upon the stock s 38  YTD growth

Consensus Estimate of 60 cents  However  the figure was wider than the year ago quarter s loss of 21 cents Revenues decreased 0 6  from the year earlier quarter to  287 6 million  and also missed the consensus estimate of  296 million Transition from device based to a subscription based business model led to compression in the top line  However  continued deal wins and increased adoption of AHV hypervisor were positives Quarter DetailsProduct revenues fell 16 4  year over year to  184 8 million  Support  entitlements   other services revenues soared 50 5  to  102 8 million Total software and support revenues climbed 17  from the year ago quarter to  266 million Billings were down 1  year over year to  346 million  Software and Support billings rose 11  to  324 million Subscription billings accounted for 65  of total billings  up from 57  in the previous quarter  New customer bookings represented 25  of total bookings compared with 29  a year ago  Software related bookings from the company s international regions were 45  of the total software and support bookings  flat year over year The bill to revenue ratio was 1 2  slightly lower sequentially During the fiscal third quarter  Nutanix sealed several large deals on the back of its consistent execution in product  customer support and enterprise selling  which also led to a deeper penetration into existing customers  It signed 50 deals worth more than  1 million including eight deals worth above  3 million Nutanix now has 18 customers with a lifetime spend of more than  15 million  and about 850 customers with a lifetime investment exceeding  1 million The company s hypervisor  AHV  experienced 42  increase in adoption on a rolling four quarter basis Continued shift to a recurring revenue business model resulted in 65  of billings coming from subscriptions  up from 41  a year ago  Subscription revenues represented 59  of total revenues in the fiscal third quarter  up from 28  Nutanix clinched a  6 million deal with a Global 2000 French multinational hospitality company that has a lifetime spend more than  7 million  This company spent about  4 million on new term based subscription licenses in the quarter  Under the new agreement  this customer will replace its existing traditional infrastructure with Nutanix s enterprise cloud platform During the quarter  a deal worth more than  1 million was signed with media  marketing and publishing company Meredith Corp    NYSE MDP   Also  Nutanix partnered with Hewlett Packard   NYSE HPE   to enable channel partners to directly sell fully integrated HPE servers combined with Nutanix s enterprise cloud OS software The company continued to witness a strong adoption of its products  including a  3 million plus deal with the U S  Department of Defense However  selling impact due to the ongoing transition slowed down and extended the sales cycles  The company expects this headwind to gradually dissolve as customers get used to the new term  based subscription offerings MarginIn the fiscal third quarter  the company delivered non GAAP gross profit of  725 4 million  significantly up from  197 8 million  Non GAAP gross margin of 77 1  was higher than 68 4  in the year ago quarter Operating expenses rose substantially from  232 4 million in the prior year quarter to  895 1 million Operating loss widened to  169 7 million from a loss of  34 6 million in the year ago quarter Balance Sheet   Cash FlowAs of Apr 30  2019  cash and cash equivalents plus short term investments were  941 million  down  25 million sequentially Cash outflow from operations was  36 million against inflow of  46 4 million in the previous quarter  A  17 million ESPP outflow resulted in this unfavorable comparison Free cash outflow was  59 million against inflow of  32 4 million in the prior quarter Deferred revenues jumped 7 5  sequentially to  838 3 million in third quarter fiscal 2019 GuidanceFor the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019  revenues are projected between  280 million and  310 million  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at  296 5 million Nutanix anticipates billings to be in the range of  350  380 million Non GAAP gross margin is predicted to be around 77   Moreover  management forecasts operating expenses in the  340  350 million band Nutanix estimates non GAAP loss per share to be 65 cents  wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 60 cents Leadership changes  which impacted the fiscal third quarter  are expected to affect the fiscal fourth quarter as well  Nutanix expects an impact on fourth quarter fiscal 2019 results from imbalance and lead generation spending  coupled with a slower than expected sales hiring  The company also expects extended sales cycles due to the transition  to be an overhang on the top line Moreover  during the fiscal third quarter  Nutanix ramped lead generation  and thus improved sales execution  These efforts are expected to take a couple of quarters to reflect in its top line performance However  the company remains positive about its transition to software based revenues as the same is likely to expand its margins significantly

Questions and Answers 
Operator
 Operator Instructions  Your first question comes from Tore Svanberg with Stifel  Your line is open 
Tore Svanberg    Stifel    Analyst
Yes  thank you and congratulations on the strong results  and congratulations to John on his promotion  I was hoping you could address the transition from 55 to 22 nanometer  I don t know if you re prepared to share any timelines or the types of products that will be using that next generation node 
Jason Rhode    Chief Executive Officer
Yes  sure happy to  Yeah  it s  we think 22 is going to be a really great mixed signal node for us as 55 has been  It s certainly not the case that everything we do would need to migrate to 22 nanometer going forward  Generally speaking  it s very different dynamic than a fully digital piece of silicon in that   the analog componentry generally doesn t shrink anywhere near as much as the Moore s Law curve would imply for digital  So  if you just took the same device and shrunk it from 55 to 22  you d most likely make it more expensive  So  there needs to  number one  be a real reason for doing that  which could be in our domain could be power  it could be silicon area or board space  But more often it s related to being able to embed a lot more digital signal processing content and the amount of processing power that we can bring to bear in 22 nanometer is really remarkable  So  it s a great result that we ve got our first test chip back a while ago  this fall  really remarkable performance out of the box  Of course there s things to work through and such  but that s the bulk of our IP down to 22 nanometers  so that we ll be able to do things like really even more exciting smart codecs and such in the long run  So  really not a lot of commentary about exactly what the first products would be and so forth  but you can imagine that we re doing that because we want to about a lot more DSP capability 
As far as timeline  that s still something that s a couple of years out  We re excited about the new stuff that we ve got going on this year  we ve got further new content that we re excited about for the following year and most likely the 22 nanometer stuff would be beyond that 
Tore Svanberg    Stifel    Analyst
That s very helpful and as my follow up  you make several references in the shareholder letter to signal processing opportunities beyond the audio and voice domain  I know you ve talked a little about    a little bit already about closed loop controller  But any other things that you re working on beyond the audio and voice domain 
Jason Rhode    Chief Executive Officer
Yeah  I mean we ve    the only thing we ve really talked about is just kind of the haptic example of where we ve taken our existing technology and broaden that out beyond audio  The closed loop controller we don t  we definitely don t have anything further we want to say about that  other than that that continues to be on track  There are additional things beyond that that are in an entirely different domain again non audio  non voice for handsets that we re extremely excited about that would be in the year beyond  So  I think that s about as good a lineup as I can ever remember us having and continued    and as kind of the 22 nanometer  The answer to the 22 nanometer question implied there s kind of other good things in audio and voice as well long term

Your next question comes from Matt Ramsay with Cowen  Your line is open 
Matthew Ramsay    Cowen    Analyst
Thank you very much  Good afternoon  First off  John  congrats  well deserved  The first thing I wanted to ask about  I think Jason or John  One of the things I saw that you mentioned in the shareholder letter was    and it was in the discussion around haptics and amps is a portion to I think the top four Android OEMs and I know you guys had mentioned significant traction with top three before  Is there something to read into that that there is an expansion  I know  Jason  you described it as sort of singles and doubles with Android folks outside of Samsung in the past  but are things progressing there  And I guess what are the levers that you are or what products are driving the expansion across OEMs presumably in China  Thanks 
Jason Rhode    Chief Executive Officer
Well  certainly the most traction we ve had in China is with the audio amps followed by the haptic device    devices  There is    we ve made good progress there  it is    I would definitely still characterize it as kind of model by model  Those accounts are definitely more singles and doubles than they are home runs  And we ve been shipping to the bulk of the top 10  So there is always some movement  both with    within the ranks of who composes the top 10 if you guys move up  if you guys move down it s a little bit noisy but we re doing quite well with the bulk of them  It s definitely not the same kind of dynamic as we would have with our larger customers  for example  where there is kind of a much more logical long term kind of plan that we can march to  It s an area where we need to be a lot more opportunistic  but those parts    part of the reason  those parts are doing so well there is that they were architected specifically to enable that kind of flexibility and let our teams add new functions via software support and tools and of course tuning and so forth is a critical element of a number of those devices both for audio  acoustic kind of tuning  as well as haptic kind of what s the feel of the device is going to be  So  that s all been well received in China  there was a wide array of customers there  They ve all kind of got their own drummer that they are marching to  and then of course the biggest guy in China s got its own complexity to it  obviously  this past year 
Matthew Ramsay    Cowen    Analyst
Got it  got it  Thanks for that  I guess as my follow up  I wanted to  to ask Thurman about opex  There is a chart that you guys always put in the shareholder letter around head count and opex and it looks like headcounts down  I don t know 100  150  160 people over the last seven  eight quarters  There is some reallocation and restructuring around MEMS and a few moving parts  Maybe just talk about sort of opex in the medium term contrasting some of those actions versus the guys have been talking about quite a bit of investment for new products going forward  That d be helpful  Thank you 
Thurman K  Case    Chief Financial Officer and Vice President  Finance
Yeah  with a real    we ve reallocated those resources  But that is  as Jason has noted  we haven t seen as many opportunities as this in quite some time  So we ll continue to invest in R D  When you start looking at SG A that should mean    should remain relatively flat for us  Our infrastructure is good and we don t see a lot of investment on there  So  in terms of how does it look on a year over year basis when you re looking forward to next year  Just in general  we don t expect it to grow significantly because it will still be catching up from the effects of what has happened over the partial pieces of this year that will be reductions that will show up for the entire year next year  So  with that happening  you won t see us just because we re hiring or things like that to increase revenue or increase expenses on a quarter over quarter basis  significant 
Jason Rhode    Chief Executive Officer
I would add to that  we ve talked about the MEMS thing a little bit last on the last call  And at this point that    the people that we were wanting to redeploy on that have successfully been redeployed which was a big victory for the company  I think the team did an awesome job of doing that  The folks that we moved to while they are disappointed to not follow up on the carry on following up on the microphone stuff they ve moved on to one of these new  these kind of new things that we re talking in response to Tore s question  And this is really tricky  fancy mixed signal stuff  They re excited to be working on it  It s got a very good prognosis of success  And I think that was probably you never want to stop activities like that  but the redeployment of a very large percentage of those folks is a particular highlight in my opinion

Your next question comes from Blayne Curtis with Barclays  Your line is open 
Thomas O Malley    Barclays    Analyst
Hey guys  this is Tom O Malley on for Blayne Curtis  and I want to pass my congratulations to John as well  At first  just looking at the slide deck  You guys lay out a  1 billion SAM opportunity in 2024 for haptic drivers and closed loop controllers  Most of the time  particularly with this new closed loop  you start with the lead customer and that works its way down into the Android ecosystem and sometimes that presents challenges given the custom design work you do for some of those lead customers  in particular the big one  Can you talk about if you see opportunity elsewhere for products like the closed loop controller and particularly where in the Android ecosystem you may target 
Jason Rhode    Chief Executive Officer
I mean that particular thing that we re developing  We will certainly keep our eyes on it  We don t    that s not a primary focus of that investment  It would be to trickle that down  There are certainly    there are many things that we sell that  haptic for example  or audio amplifiers that are in fact closed loop controllers that obviously we do see opportunity  Again  that particular label has taken on a little bit of a life of its own that wasn t entirely intentional  But that particular thing that we ve been talking about ramping later this fall is not    it s not really intended to be an Android thing at this time 
Thomas O Malley    Barclays    Analyst
Okay  And then just on the same chart  just right above you talk about SAM for about  1 billion for further adjacent mobile opportunities  Obviously part of that historically could have been those MEMS might  What other areas are you targeting there just because billion bucks is still a pretty big SAM there 
Jason Rhode    Chief Executive Officer
Yeah  sure  Yeah  that s another one of these areas that we re not going to want to get too far ahead of our skis on  but it s just yet another thing in a handset  non audio  non voice that directly leverages our advanced mixed signal and deep sub micron capabilities  So  it s something we re really excited about and wish very much that we can tell you more about it

Your next question comes from Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna  Your line is open 
Christopher Rolland    Susquehanna    Analyst
Hey guys  congrats on the good report  Congrats  John  Talking about  let s see  haptics for a second here  You mentioned the letter something for media consumption  So  do we think about that is like a vibrating remote or is it something still with the handset  And then I think you also mentioned gaming  Is that an opportunity for something like 10s of millions of units over the next 18 months or so  or is this just really starting with a small volume win  Thank you

This is John  Let me take that  So  I think specifically what we re referring to there is the level of enrichment of the user experience that we can deliver through haptic beyond the simple button replacement  So it s    when we talk about gaming and media consumption  where we re talking in the first instance about enhancing the smartphone experience that can for sure extend beyond that  but that s the primary area that we re talking about  And to give examples of that  We ve seen customers very interested  for example  in    in technologies we ve developed which provides haptic feedback during playing video games  even if the game developer didn t necessarily incorporate those functions within their products  the end user  when they re playing the game still get a lot of tactile physical feedback through the device which deepens the experience  We can provide the smarts to enable that kind of functionality and add that kind of richness to the user experience alongside the more traditional use of haptics in terms of providing the virtual button feedback and so on

Okay  great  And then to the 22 nanometer codec  I know  Jason  you mentioned potentially more expensive silicon  I don t know if that was just the silicon  if it only included analog or if that s an expectation for digital and perhaps  you can talk about differences in ASPs and margins versus your 55 nanometer  I know sometimes these changes caught investors by surprise in the past  Are there any changes there in ASPs or margins  Thanks 
Jason Rhode    Chief Executive Officer
So  I would generally    there is always ebbs and flows from a margin perspective  I generally would I    my usual answer on that is not to think about node changes as being margin drivers  one way or the other  They can be to a minor degree  but it shouldn t be a primary impact  The    as I say  if you took our smart codec today and didn t change anything else about it other than move it from 55 to 22  that would  that would generally make it more expensive on the from an ASP basis  Certainly  though the motivation to move it to 22 is to add additional digital content as well  So that should also be an ASP play in the long run as well

Your next question comes from Charlie Anderson with Dougherty   Company  Your line is open 
Charles Anderson    Dougherty   Company    Analyst
Yeah  thanks for taking my questions  My congrats on the strong results and my congrats to John on the promotion as well  Yeah  so I wanted to start with    Jason  we ve only got a few months left in the year for you guys  And there s a lot of talk about content increases  So  I wonder maybe if you had any big picture view on fiscal  21 in terms of how that shapes up in terms of growth or otherwise  And then I ve got a follow up 
Jason Rhode    Chief Executive Officer
Well  yes  I do actually  So  as you know  I mean we don t  we don t provide annual guidance  There is a lot of moving parts  of course  it s harder  probably impossible for us to know how they would net out  We would love to be able to do that  But that said  to add some color on the moving pieces is probably helpful for you  And I ll just say here s some of those probably forward looking statements that Thurman mentioned earlier  So  we said last fall  we expected incremental new progress in hearables  wearables  tablets and laptops  Thus far  our silicon has been seen in untethered earbuds out there from multiple different customers  That s clearly a form factor that    that everybody is excited about  We re excited about it  We think it s a great platform to build on in the long run  The rest of those new applications  meaning wearables tablets  laptops  Those appear to be on track  So  we should be able to benefit from those during the year and going forward  a lot of that s completely new content from us  And those are form factors that are getting a lot of attention as well  So  we continue to expect to deliver new content in the handsets later this year  Further opportunities we ve kind of refer to that over the last couple of questions  Further opportunities over the next several years  That said  there are often puts and takes to the overall content story that we re not able to get into for obvious reasons  This year is no exception to that  We re very    we re very pleased overall with our position in handsets  I just don t want anybody to interpret that as meaning that every individual element of our business is up into the right  Obviously  the largest driver of our revenue and revenue variability is handset volumes which from other new sources  are obviously doing very well currently  Of course  when new models are launched it s one of those harder and impossible things for us to know how they will actually do which makes it hard for us to call the full year  But we currently have a very robust outlook there  So    and then all of that of course is against the backdrop of this Coronavirus issue  trade wars  the overall economy and tons of other things that are out of our control and beyond our ability to forecast  So  we take a conservative view of what will happen and plan accordingly  And I think that s a good approach for investors as well  we do put a lot of thought  by the way into our Risk factors and we ve added one specifically related to things like the Coronavirus  So  I ll just add a reminder for investors to have a look at those 
Charles Anderson    Dougherty   Company    Analyst
Excellent  thank you so much for all the color  And then sort of it for my follow up  you ve identified the closed loop Controller  I think going into calendar  20 and then there is this other opportunity is sort of sounds like potentially that you re after  I wonder is that the proper cadence as you move into these adjacencies as another one a year or is that just this year or how it looks  just kind of thinking about your plan this long term  Thanks 
Jason Rhode    Chief Executive Officer
I think that s just kind of how it fell out  I mean we would certainly    and those are incidentally  both of these kind of new things that we re talking about our platforms that we would expect it to be very strategically important and things that we will be able to continue to build around  in the long run  So  you may be    I mean this is actually just me speculating that that s the kind of thing that we would expect to get on to a continuous improvement curve of being able to adapt and modify them and improve them kind of like we do with the audio codecs or amplifiers  which is to say  not every year  but the cool thing  One of the many cool things about shipping into very high volume handsets is that you ve got so much unit volume that you can afford to revise the devices pretty frequently with such   which lets you add new value for customers  And then kind of not always be on the same part to the same customer year end and year out  which has got obviously some good dynamics to it from a pricing perspective

 Operator Instructions  Your next question comes from Adam Gonzalez with Bank of America  Your line is open 
Adam Gonzalez    Bank of America    Analyst
Hi guys  thanks for taking my question and congrats  John  on the promotion  In the opportunities that you alluded to beyond your core audio and voice domain  are these engagements broad based or more narrowly focused across your top one or two customers  let s say  And then if you were to talk about it in terms of years of visibility into potential design wins  How far out do    does your visibility extend at this point  Thanks 
Jason Rhode    Chief Executive Officer
So  yeah  that s    our current level of investment is definitely heavily focused at the top tier of our    of our customer    of our customer base  As far as visibility  the bulk of    the bulk of our business  I think that s probably one of the least well understood things or maybe it s understood but not believed or something  but when we do a custom piece of silicon for somebody we re often working on things that are three years away from actually shipping for revenue and that s a big investment by customers in us  There is a lot of back and forth and supervision and making sure everything is lined up I s are dotted and the T s are crossed and so forth  Customers generally are actually pretty good about not wasting our time but they are always very meticulous about not wasting their own time  So that    it s generally much the bigger moving pieces for us are generally much more  one at the design in phase rather than the shipment phase  which means we ve got quite a lot of visibility of a particular sort  And what I mean by that is we know we re working on important things and we sometimes know what they go into  if it s a completely new form factor  Sometimes we know exactly what it goes into  but we don t actually know what end feature the customer is going to enable with it  especially with our devices where there s a lot of programmability involved  And then of course we never know the customer s marketing decisions that they re going to be able to make or promote more heavily or in this market or bundles or things like that that we don t always have that we don t have any long term visibility because they can change their mind on a much shorter timeline than say a new audio codec we kind of    if you ve designed your phone around an audio codec  we kind of know you re going to need one  for example  and so forth  So yeah  I would say we ve got great visibility and a big picture sense  There is definitely some moving pieces that that we often don t know until quite late in the game  But relative to most semiconductor companies  I would say it s    that s definitely a strength for us 
Adam Gonzalez    Bank of America    Analyst
Great  that s really helpful color  Appreciate that  And then my second question  I noticed in your corporate presentation that I think you added a slide which put some context around the market opportunities you re addressing  And it looks like you put it in the context of a  45 billion mixed signal opportunity  I m just hoping maybe if you can explain the rationale behind doing that  Is it just a signal that there could be opportunities beyond the  1 billion in adjacent mobile that you identified across the near term  Thanks 
John Forsyth    President
Yeah  that s exactly right  This is John here  That s exactly right and is really just reflective of increasingly how we see our range of growth opportunities within the business  You will see within that that picture that we re portraying there that we see no shortage of opportunities for growth within audio and voice itself  But as we ve  as we ve gone through the past few years  we ve expanded initially into haptics as a beyond audio application of our core IP  We ve made it clear that what we refer to as the closed loop controller is kind of again fits into that category of being leveraging a lot of our core advanced mixed signal capability into a new domain 
As Jason indicated  we have reasonable line of sight of some additional opportunities  very much following the same pattern  But again  in new domains beyond those we ve spoken about previously  and you can expect to see us continuing that progress  I think it s certainly trying to  as we move forward  as we are increasingly seeing the opportunities around bringing low power  advanced low latency  mixed signal and signal processing to a variety of product types  It was the case if you go back three or four years ago  I think we were fully occupied just serving the audio demand in the market as the company has grown and as we ve engaged with customers more broadly in new areas that range of opportunities is    has grown into other mixed signal areas  So  we see there is being pretty significant opportunity to continue that progress and that evolution as we go forward in the coming years

Ari Shusterman    Needham    Analyst
Hi  this is Ari  I m taking the question for Rajiv Gill  And my first question is about ANC adoption in the unfettered headset market  Can you kind of talk about what you ve been seeing in that  What do you view this trend moving forward  Thank you 
Jason Rhode    Chief Executive Officer
Well    so  we do have headsets overall that Bluetooth headset specifically that ship with our ANC  the untethered ear buds that are out there currently  still do not the performance that we targeted  When we originally developed our ANC was targeted at being the absolute pinnacle from a performance perspective  And the issue with untethered ear buds is  you really got a constrained battery life and so  customers are much more focused on what do they need to do to get the useful battery life of the product to be something sensible  And so  it s a pretty different approach to noise canceling  Longer term  we do think that s something of interest  We ve got some activities there  We see a wide array of things that we can continue to focus on  from a content expansion in the untethered ear bud space  I wouldn t say that  that s the primary one of them  but it s potentially something we can work on over time 
Ari Shusterman    Needham    Analyst
Got you  And as a follow up  what you ve been seeing in gross margins and how do you expect them to trend throughout 2020  So  kind of a rough idea would be very helpful 
Jason Rhode    Chief Executive Officer
I mean  we don t see a ton of major drivers  one way or the other there  I just continue to model it  We guide a quarter at a time  So that is what it is  but I would just kind of take that as the middle of the fairway and not be looking for a whole lot of excitement on that front

Tore Svanberg    Stifel    Analyst
Yes  thank you  Just two quick follow ups  First of all  we talked about sort of opex to support the opportunities in signal processing  but what about capex requirements  Are you sort of fine with what you have right now or will there be some new capex spend especially for fiscal   21 
Thurman K  Case    Chief Financial Officer and Vice President  Finance
No  I don t see this year seeing an uptick in our capex  We don t spend a whole lot  There might be some tools that will buy for certain groups that are working on certain things  But beyond that  no  you wouldn t expect a big uptick in our  in our capital expenditures 
Jason Rhode    Chief Executive Officer
Yeah  And I would think too  Just from a run rate perspective of our various businesses  the MEMS stuff was probably a little bit more capex intensive than the rest of it  So that piece  obviously is a tailwind for us from that perspective  but as usual  it s not a    not a big driver  It s usually a really good opportunity  If we find areas where if you do see our capex tick up  I would generally regard that as a good thing because it s us turning cash into something that is hopefully a sustainable long term advantage like the failure analysis and reliability lab 
Tore Svanberg    Stifel    Analyst
That s helpful  And last question  and correct my perception here  but it just sounds like you sound a bit more certain about getting more traction in the wearables  is that perception correct  And if so  is it primarily for boosted apps or something else 
Jason Rhode    Chief Executive Officer
We kind of    I think we re    I mean things    again forward looking statement  things can    things can always go wrong  but I mean plan of record  we should have some good progress in wearables  something we re really excited about  I don t want to get in there real specifically exactly what we re doing there  but things that are within our warehouse  So yeah  this is definitely a    clearly an exciting segment of the market that s getting harder as time goes on  And I think there is multiple cases where I can point to in the past where whatever it is we might not be in the very first generation  But usually by the time it gets real interesting then we ve trained our custom silicon deliver on time  really excellent execution machine on the opportunity and start picking these things off as they get ready for prime time

139 2  on a year to date basis compared with the   Nasdaq and S P 500 s rally of 45 7   33 8  and 27 2   respectively The outperformance can be attributed to robust adoption of the company s EPYC and Ryzen desktop and mobile processors  This helped AMD withstand sluggishness and volatility in the semiconductor market amid headwinds pertaining to the U S  China trade war and related tariffs Additionally  robust demand of AMD s GPUs especially Radeon processors has been a key catalyst  Strength in GPU ASP  primarily driven by higher datacenter GPU volume  drove the top line  which increased 9  year over year to  1 80 billion in third quarter fiscal 2019 Moreover  notable customer wins on the back of its high performance portfolio of processors and continued innovation in high

126947,348462,CRUS,3 Stocks With Momentum Anomaly To Buy Amid Coronavirus Scare,opinion,The Coronavirus epidemic  which originated in China  seems to have stumped the U S  market rally that gave us spectacular gains last year  and pushed the major indexes to all time record highs just a couple of weeks back  Market bulls see the current slowdown as nothing more than a temporary breather that will allow investors to take stock of the problem before resuming the surge  The other side of the divide is less optimistic about what s happening in the market and sees this as the catalyst that will result in a long overdue market downturn On the other hand  China s central bank said that it will pump  174 billion worth of liquidity by way of reverse repo as the stock market reopens on Monday  Investors are bracing for a volatile session when onshore trades resume after a break for the Lunar New Year  which was extended by the government  China s stock  currency and bond markets have been closed since Jan 23 Notably  the U S  GDP growth has remained in the 2  plus range over the last few quarters despite trade centric uncertainties weighing on the factory sector  Economic growth should improve with the easing of trade issues following the signing of phase one of the U S  China trade deal  and the USMCA trade deal Earnings growth was anemic in 2019  primarily because of the tough comparisons to the all time record corporate profits the year before  which had received a boost from the tax cut legislation  But growth is likely to resume in the first quarter of 2020  and accelerate in the second half of the year  Analysts expect company earnings to impress on the back of robust business investment and emerging market economies However  concerns about the impact of higher corporate taxes on profits could rise in the run up to the U S  presidential election  This apart  rising wages are likely to reduce profit margins over the next several years  The Fed left interest rates unchanged last week and will likely remain on the sidelines for now  But  the outlook beyond the U S  shores is a lot less positive  with concerns about growth momentum in China  India  Germany and other key markets Against this macro backdrop  reacting emotionally to volatile trends can cause more damage to a portfolio s return than a downturn  When value or growth investing fails to fetch sustained profits  one should explore another time tested winning strategy that simply bets on the frontrunner stocks  This is known as momentum investing At the core  momentum investing is buying high  selling higher  It is based on the idea that once a stock establishes a trend  it is likely to continue in that direction  There s a whole list of behavioral biases that most investors exhibit  For instance  there are investors who are anxious about booking losses and hence hold on to losing stocks for too long  hopeful of a rebound in prices On the other hand  a few investors sell their winners way too early  Momentum investing is one of the best strategies to avoid making such mistakes  So  basically  it s a way to profit from the general human tendency to extrapolate current trends into the future  Momentum investing is  thus  based on that gap in time  which exists before the mean reversion occurs i e  before prices become rational again Here  we have created a strategy

126948,348463,CRUS,Super Bowl Results Show Stock Gains In February  5 Picks,opinion,The Super Bowl Predictor was discovered in 1978 by Leonard Koppett  a sports writer for the New York Times  The Super Bowl effect was later popularized by Robert Stovall  the president of investment firm Stovall Twenty First Advisors  By the way  Super Bowl is the final game in the National Football League  NFL   which generally takes place in the month of February  Champions of the two conferences  the original American Football League  AFL  and the NFL  meet at the Super Bowl Theoretically  the Super Bowl Predictor states that the U S  stock market will climb north if the winner is from the NFL and an AFL win would bring about the opposite  But in reality  the stock market has performed better in the years AFL teams have won than in years when the victors have been from the NFL  Take a look   And this time  since Kansas City Chiefs from the AFL have won the competition  we can expect the stock market to scale upward  Cheifs won the competition by beating the San Francisco 49ers  31 20  at Hard Rock Stadium Nonetheless  investors have plenty of reasons to be optimistic about the stock market this year  Primarily  investors shouldn t fret about the coronavirus outbreak  After all  the Chinese government has promised to provide adequate stimulus measures  China s central bank said it will supply  21 7 billion to money markets and has advised banks to lend more to curb the influence of the virus on markets  Lest we forget  the outbreak shattered the U S  stock market and has overshadowed a solid earnings season The phase one partial deal between the United States and China  in the meantime  will further drive business confidence  driving capital expenditure and in turn stocks  America s ailing manufacturing sector could also recover from an uptick in business spending  which took a hit last year due to the trade war The current low interest environment should make the cost of borrowing reasonable  helping companies invest and grow  This in turn should help the economy gain momentum  The Fed has kept its benchmark interest rate steady and has shown no signs of raising rates in the near term  The Fed holds the fed funds rate at the range of 1 5 1 75   Fed Chair Jerome Powell has categorically said that the central bank is quite comfortable with its current monetary policy as it provides cushion against weak global economic growth  In fact  the Fed is more likely to trim rates as the central bank continues to find it difficult to achieve the desired inflation target of 2  5 Top Stocks to Own This FebruaryCourtesy of the Super Bowl outcome  China s moves to stimulate the markets  completion of the phase one deal and Fed s dovish stance  we are

126950,348465,CRUS,Zacks com Featured Highlights Include  Pilgrim s Pride  Cirrus Logic And Darling Ingredients,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   February 4  2020   Stocks in this week s article are Pilgrim s Pride Corp    NASDAQ PPC    Cirrus Logic  Inc    NASDAQ CRUS   and Darling Ingredients Inc    NYSE DAR   3 Stocks with Momentum Anomaly to Buy Amid Coronavirus ScareThe Coronavirus epidemic  which originated in China  seems to have stumped the U S  market rally that gave us spectacular gains last year  and pushed the major indexes to all time record highs just a couple of weeks back  Market bulls see the current slowdown as nothing more than a temporary breather that will allow investors to take stock of the problem before resuming the surge  The other side of the divide is less optimistic about what s happening in the market and sees this as the catalyst that will result in a long overdue market downturn On the other hand  China s central bank said that it will pump  174 billion worth of liquidity by way of reverse repo as the stock market reopens on Monday  Investors are bracing for a volatile session when onshore trades resume after a break for the Lunar New Year  which was extended by the government  China s stock  currency and bond markets have been closed since Jan 23 Notably  the U S  GDP growth has remained in the 2  plus range over the last few quarters despite trade centric uncertainties weighing on the factory sector  Economic growth should improve with the easing of trade issues following the signing of phase one of the U S  China trade deal  and the USMCA trade deal Earnings growth was anemic in 2019  primarily because of the tough comparisons to the all time record corporate profits the year before  which had received a boost from the tax cut legislation  But growth is likely to resume in the first quarter of 2020  and accelerate in the second half of the year  Analysts expect company earnings to impress on the back of robust business investment and emerging market economies However  concerns about the impact of higher corporate taxes on profits could rise in the run up to the U S  presidential election  This apart  rising wages are likely to reduce profit margins over the next several years  The Fed left interest rates unchanged last week and will likely remain on the sidelines for now  But  the outlook beyond the U S  shores is a lot less positive  with concerns about growth momentum in China  India  Germany and other key markets Against this macro backdrop  reacting emotionally to volatile trends can cause more damage to a portfolio s return than a downturn  When value or growth investing fails to fetch sustained profits  one should explore another time tested winning strategy that simply bets on the frontrunner stocks  This is known as momentum investing At the core  momentum investing is buying high  selling higher  It is based on the idea that once a stock establishes a trend  it is likely to continue in that direction  There s a whole list of behavioral biases that most investors exhibit  For instance  there are investors who are anxious about booking losses and hence hold on to losing stocks for too long  hopeful of a rebound in prices On the other hand  a few investors sell their winners way too early  Momentum investing is one of the best strategies to avoid making such mistakes  So  basically  it s a way to profit from the general human tendency to extrapolate current trends into the future  Momentum investing is  thus  based on that gap in time  which exists before the mean reversion occurs i e  before prices become rational again Here  we have created a strategy that will help investors get in on these fast movers when there is a short term pullback in price  and rake in handsome gains For the rest of this Screen of the Week article please visit Zacks com at Disclosure  Officers  directors and or employees of Zacks Investment Research may own or have sold

127139,348654,CRUS,SAP SuccessFactors Solutions Deployed By Eversheds Sutherland,opinion,"SAP SE  DE SAPG    NYSE SAP   recently announced that SAP SuccessFactors solutions for human capital management  HCM  were deployed by Eversheds Sutherland Ltd  a provider of legal service worldwide 
Eversheds Sutherland is of the opinion that adoption of HCM solutions will enable it to drive digital HR transformation globally  The implementation of SAP SuccessFactors solutions has achieved an HR platform which offers better insight throughout the company s legal operations and improves efficiency of HR processes 
With the solution  Eversheds Sutherland is well poised to help store employees  managers  HR and corporate office to better manage data  It will also aid in deriving meaningful insights and decision making capabilities  With the aid of this solution  the company will be able to provide finest in class user experience for employees 
We believe incremental adoption of SAP s SuccessFactors solutions on the back of robust visibility and traceability features is expected to favor the top line 
Adoption of SAP s Solution  A Key Catalyst
SuccessFactors Employee Central  which forms the backbone of the company s Human Capital Management offerings  now comprises around 3 000 employess across the U K   France  Luxembourg  Middle East and Asia  Robust market traction of these solutions remains a key growth driver for SAP SE  Additionally  the company is well poised against its key HCM peers  even in markets outside the United States 
Moreover  SAP s SuccessFactors Employee Central surpassed the 3 200 customer mark in first quarter 2019 
Management is optimistic on conclusion of SuccessFactors  migration to SAP HANA platform  This move is anticipated to enhance SuccessFactors solution with integrated predictive analytics and other capabilities  Notably  SAP SuccessFactors suite is available across 96 countries in 42 languages 
Bottom Line
The company is also anticipated to strengthen presence in the customer relationship management market against peers including salesforce com   NYSE CRM    Oracle   NYSE ORCL    among others 
Additionally  continued market traction of the SAP S 4HANA platform is aiding the company significantly  SAP HANA Cloud Platform and its partners have been gaining rapid popularity  assisting clients in extending functionalities  building new applications  and integrating across cloud and on premise platforms  in turn fueling growth 
It has been acting as a catalyst since its introduction  The company constantly upgrades existing products and launches fresh ones to gain customers 
Cloud still remains an expanding market with high growth prospects  In a recent report  Gartner projected the public cloud market to reach  411 4 billion by 2020  According to International Trade Administration  the Chinese cloud market is likely to touch  20 billion mark by 2020 at a CAGR of 40  
We believe that SAP  with its ongoing initiatives  is well poised to capitalize on the opportunities  In fact  the cloud computing is likely to be one of its major growth drivers in the long run 
The company has been focused on expanding cloud business to become one of the leading players in the category  Further  SAP has a competitive edge over its cloud competitors as its processes are designed to be industry specific and can be customized to meet corresponding business requirements 

 
However  the company s stock has yielded a return of 11 7  in a year  underperforming the  s growth of 22 1   Continued investment in a standardized converged HANA based cloud platform and expenses incurred for new technologies resulted in a revenue mix shift effect between its cloud and on premise business

127270,348785,CRUS,Is Cirrus Logic  CRUS  A Great Stock For Value Investors  ,opinion,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value 
One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Cirrus Logic Inc    NASDAQ CRUS   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks 
PE Ratio
A key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole 
On this front  Cirrus Logic has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 12 9  as you can see in the chart below 

This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 7  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Cirrus Logic s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months 

Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the broader industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 21 6  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers 

P S Ratio
Another key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings 
Right now  Cirrus Logic has a P S ratio of about 5 9  This is a bit lower than the broader industry average  which comes in at 2 4x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years 

Broad Value Outlook
In aggregate  Cirrus Logic currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Cirrus Logic a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too 
For example  the P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 10 8  which is far better than the industry average of 15 6  Clearly  CRUS is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles 
What About the Stock Overall 
Though Cirrus Logic might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of C and a Momentum Score of B  This gives CRUS a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  
Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen three estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to two lower  while the full year estimate has seen four up and one down in the same time period 
This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen by 0 6  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has increased 2 1   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Cirrus Logic  Inc  Price and Consensus
     
This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term 
Bottom Line
Cirrus Logic is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Furthermore  a strong industry rank  among Top 45  of more than 250 industries  boosts investor confidence  In fact  over the past two years  the broader industry has clearly outperformed the market at large  as you can see below 

So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick 
Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars 
Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge 
With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply  one company stands out as the  1 stock to buy according to Zacks research

127323,348838,CRUS,Hewlett Packard Enterprise Shows Promise  Time To Hold  ,opinion,Stocks showing momentum and with enough prospects are the ones that investors like to add to their portfolio  Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company   NYSE HPE   is one such stock that looks quite promising on the back of its strong fundamentals and strategic initiatives  Though the stock faces several headwinds at the moment  these are transitory in nature  There is enough scope for this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company to rebound in the long run So far in 2016  Hewlett Packard Enterprise has increased 57 6  compared with the Zacks categorized Computer Integrated Systems industry that has increased 26   We believe there is still much momentum left in the stock  which is quite evident from its VGM Score of  A  and long term earnings growth rate of 5 8  What s Driving Hewlett Packard Enterprise Hewlett Packard Enterprise was spun off from the Hewlett Packard Company  NYSE HPQ  in Nov 2015  We believe that the decision enabled a customized approach for two different kinds of businesses  which might not have been possible as a single entity Hewlett Packard Enterprise has done considerably well in the enterprise class server and storage markets  The company concentrates its resources on the high margin software and security markets as well  We believe that the company s traction in the cloud  security and Big Data segments will enhance its growth trajectory  going forward Furthermore  Hewlett Packard Enterprise s strategic divestments and initiatives to return value to shareholders in the form of dividend and share repurchases bode well Since the split  Hewlett Packard Enterprise s Chief Operating Officer  CEO   Meg Whitman  has been looking to reduce the company s large portfolio of non core businesses that are now struggling to maintain their growth In keeping with this effort  the company  in September this year  announced that it will spin off the software business and merge the same with British software firm  Micro Focus International Plc  in a cash stock deal worth  8 8 billion The transaction  which is subject to certain regulatory approvals  is anticipated to be tax free for the company  Per the agreement  the company will receive  2 5 billion in cash and a 50 1  stake in the merged entity  which is currently estimated to be worth  6 3 billion Also  Hewlett Packard Enterprise completed the sale of 84  of its 60 5  equity stake in Mphasis Limited  an IT service provider in Bangalore  India  to The Blackstone  NYSE BX  Group in September  The transaction has fetched the company around  700 million Furthermore  this May  it announced the spin off of its struggling IT services segment   Enterprise Services   and entered into an agreement to merge the same with Computer Sciences Corporation  NYSE CSC  The primary motive behind such a massive restructuring drive is to reassure investors of the company s sustained focus on improving profitability and returning value to shareholders in the form of dividend and share repurchases We believe that Hewlett Packard Enterprise s ongoing business overhaul will yield long term benefits by supporting innovation and leading to cost savings  We also believe that successful deployment of the company s products will boost its top line  going forward Moreover  the company provided encouraging first quarter and fiscal 2017 earnings guidance  For first quarter fiscal 2017  the company expects non GAAP earnings of 42 46 cents  The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at 44 cents The company expects non GAAP earnings per share in a range of  2 00  2 10 for fiscal 2017  The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at  2 05 The company also provided earnings outlook for future HPE  post spin off and divestitures   The company anticipates fiscal 2017 non GAAP earnings to come in the range of  1 25 to  1 35 for future HPE while reported earnings are likely to come between  1 45 and  1 55 Moreover  over the past 30 days  two earnings estimates have gone higher for the full year 2017   These revisions pushed the Zacks Consensus Estimate up from earnings of  1 98 per share to  2 05 over the same time frame Risks PersistHowever  macroeconomic challenges and tepid IT spending remain near term concerns  Competition from International Business Machines   NYSE IBM   and Oracle   NYSE ORCL   add to its woes Bottom LineWe expect the aforementioned factors to help the company sustain its strong momentum and stay afloat even amid difficult times  Hence  we suggest investors to hold on to the stock as the rest is a wait and watch story Stock to ConsiderA better ranked stock in the broader technology sector is Cirrus Logic Inc    NASDAQ CRUS    which sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy

Our Take
Ciena s revenues are expected to benefit from growing demand for packet optical transport and switching products  integrated network and service management software  Also  Ciena remains positive about its North America business  The company anticipates overall global market to improve in mid single digits 
Ciena s Wave Server continues to expand the company s customer base and the trend is likely to continue in 2017  In the submarine cable upgrade market  Ciena occupies a leading position  It recorded growth in the Caribbean and Latin American market in the fiscal fourth quarter and the trend islikely to continue in 2017 
Moreover  the Verizon project remains a long term growth driver along with higher number of orders from international customers  its Tier 1 contract wins and robust backlog  Ciena s focus on cost cutting initiatives is also expected to boost its bottom line 
Nonetheless  Ciena s highly leveraged balance sheet may affect its profitability  The company is also likely to be affected by global macroeconomic uncertainty and intense competition from Cisco   NASDAQ CSCO    Juniper Networks   NYSE JNPR   and others 

Ciena carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Year to date  Ciena shares have underperformed the broader market  Shares are up 4 40  compared with 57 07  growth in Zacks Fiber Optics Industry

127354,348869,CRUS,SAP Improves SuccessFactor Portfolio  Tough Times Ahead ,opinion,"In a bid to fortify its human capital management   HCM   solutions  German software giant SAP SE  DE SAPG    NYSE SAP    has recently boosted its SAP SuccessFactors portfolio  The company announced  intelligent mentoring  which will now be part of SAP SuccessFactors Succession   Development solution and also launched a career site builder that will aid easy maintenance of responsive career sites 
Numbers Signals Bleak Times Ahead
Despite a string of launches to boost its business  SAP s shares have declined 3 9  over the past three months  in stark contrast to the Zacks categorized Computer Software industry which yielded an average positive return of 2 1   In addition  the company has a dismal track record  having missed estimates thrice in the trailing four quarters with an average negative surprise of 1 8  
Moreover  the company is faring poorly on the estimate revision front as analysts have become increasingly bearish on the stock over the past couple of months  With two downward revisions compared with no upward revision in the past two months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2016 earnings has declined from  3 35 to  3 12 per share  Dull prospects of the global IT industry  as well as flat customer spending projections are largely attributable for this negative broker sentiment SAP AG ADR Price

   HCM Product Upgrades to Stoke Growth
Despite the macroeconomic sluggishness  SAP has been constantly making upgrades and pursuing diligent launches in its human resource solutions to expand its customer base  The latest  intelligent mentoring  feature  which has been added to the SAP SuccessFactors Succession   Development solution  will improve employee engagement and retention by eliminating the need for cumbersome administrative work 
SAP believes that the present mentoring programs offered by business enterprises lack accountability and tracking  The company s latest mentoring program seeks to match mentors with appropriate skills with mentees to make the process more equitable and inclusive  In addition  the company s latest career builder website will offer consumer style website design and management for human resource and recruiting personnel 
As per Deloitte s research  two third of job seekers search for jobs on mobile devices  of which 40  apply through the same  SAP s career builder will help recruiters address this market by creating mobile friendly career sites with a content management system  It can eventually transform the talent acquisition process of business enterprises from simplifying the hiring process to sourcing candidates across the globe 
Encouragingly  SuccessFactors solutions have acted as one of the major profit churners for SAP over the past few quarters  SuccessFactors Employee Central  which forms the backbone of the company s Human Capital Management offerings  surpassed the 1 350 customer mark in the third quarter 
These offerings have been increasingly helping clients manage both permanent and temporary workforce  We believe the Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company s dominant position among HCM peers  coupled with constant product upgrades  bode well for future growth

127395,348910,CRUS,Ride The Momentum With These 5 Fast Paced Stocks,opinion,It has been two decades since academics zeroed in on what we today call the  momentum effect  in stock markets  Momentum is basically the tendency of winning stocks  i e  stocks that have outperformed the market in recent times  to keep winning and losing stocks to keep losing It is based on the idea that once a stock establishes a trend  it is more likely to continue in that direction instead of moving against the drift  Unlike the hugely followed Value or Growth styles  this strategy has barely anything to do with the fundamentals of a company  and instead works with the human penchant to extrapolate current trends into the future At the core  momentum investing calls for investors to  Buy High  Sell Higher  Why Does Momentum Strategy Work There is a simple reason behind this  It works because we are humans There s a whole laundry list of behavioral biases that most investors exhibit  and these emotional responses and mistakes are the very reason that momentum strategy works  For instance  we all know of investors who are afraid to book losses  and hence hold onto losing stocks for too long  hoping that they will springback to their original prices  On the other hand  investors sell their winners way too early Furthermore  investors initially tend to under react to news  events or data releases  However  once things gain clarity  they tend to go with the flowand overreact  causing dramatic price reactions These behavioral problems extend trends  and thusopen up huge opportunities for momentum players  So basically  it s a way to profit from the general human tendency to extrapolate current trends into the future Momentum investing is based on that gap in time that exists before the mean reversion occurs  i e  before prices become rational again Momentum versus Other StylesIt is worth reflecting over how the momentum strategy compares to the other styles of investing over time  Recent research indicates that the size premium for small cap stocks has shrunk dramatically since the 1980s and value premium has also declined radically since the 1990s  Academics are of the opinion that once research on factor premiums  like size and value  become known to public  the investment world catches on and the premium gradually erodes However  unlike other investment styles  momentum premium has stood the test of time  remaining remarkably robust ever since it was identified by financial academics in the 1990s Chase the AlphaMomentum strategies have been known to be alpha generative over long periods of time and across markets  So obviously  this strategy is quite tricky to implement  as detecting these trends is no child s play Here  we have created a strategy that will help investors get in on these fast movers and make handsome gains  Our screen will help you take advantage of both long term price momentum and a short term pullback in price  which would

127435,348950,CRUS,3 Reasons Why Cirrus Logic  CRUS  Is A Great Momentum Stock,opinion,Many investors like to look for momentum in stocks  but this can be very tough to define  There is great debate regarding which metrics are the best to focus on in this regard  and which are not really quality indicators of future performance  Fortunately  with our new  we have identified the key statistics to pay close attention to and thus which stocks might be the best for momentum investors in the near term This method discovered several great candidates for momentum oriented investors  but today let s focus in on Cirrus Logic Inc    NASDAQ CRUS   as this stock is looking especially impressive right now  And while there are numerous ways in which this company could be a great choice  we have highlighted three of the most vital reasons for CRUS s status as a solid momentum stock below Short Term Price Change for Cirrus LogicA great place to look for finding momentum stocks is by inspecting short term price activity  This can help to reflect the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand right now  It is especially useful to compare it to the industry as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area With a one week price change of 6 9  compared to an industry average of  0 4   CRUS is certainly well positioned in this regard  The stock is also looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the four week price change compares favorably with the industry at large as well Longer Term Price Change for Cirrus Logic While any stock can see a spike in price  it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market  That is why looking at longer term price metrics such as performance over the past three months or year   and comparing these to an industry at large can be very useful And in the case of CRUS  the results are quite impressive  The company has beaten out the industry at large over the past 12 weeks by a margin of 6  to 2 8  while it has also outperformed when looking at the past year  putting up a gain of 70 3   Clearly  CRUS is riding a bit of a hot streak and is worth a closer look by investors CIRRUS LOGIC Price   CRUS Earnings Estimate Revisions Moving in the Right DirectionWhile the great momentum factors outlined in the preceding paragraphs might be enough for some investors  we should also take into account broad earnings estimate revision trends  A nice path here can really help to show us a promising stock  and we have actually been seeing that with CRUS as of late too Over the past two months  1 earnings estimate has gone higher compared to none lower for the full year  while we are also seeing that 1 estimate has moved upwards with no downward revision for the next year time frame too   These revisions have helped to boost the consensus estimate as two months ago CRUS was expected to post earnings of  2 89 share for the full year  though today it looks to have EPS of  3 73 for the full year now  representing a solid increase which is something that should definitely be welcomed news to would be investors Bottom LineGiven these factors  investors shouldn t be surprised to note that we have CRUS as a security with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and a Momentum Score of  A   You can see  So if you are looking for a fresh pick that has potential to move in the right direction  definitely keep CRUS on your short list as this looks be a stock that is very well positioned to soar in the near term Confidential from ZacksBeyond this Tale of the Tape  would you like to see Zacks  best recommendations that are not available to the public  Our Executive VP  Steve Reitmeister  knows when key trades are about to be triggered and which of our experts has the hottest hand ,2016-11-02,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-reasons-why-cirrus-logic-(crus)-is-a-great-momentum-stock-200162651,200162651

127530,349045,CRUS,Hewlett Packard s Split To Be Effective From November,opinion,"According to Reuters  Hewlett Packard Company  NYSE HPQ  or H P plans to split into two companies after about a year of consideration from Nov 1 this year  CEO Meg Whitmann made the announcement in an event  HP Discover 2015  in Las Vegas on Tuesday 
H P had announced in Oct 2014 that it will split its enterprise facing hardware and service business and its consumer facing computer and printer segments  with both companies trading publicly  The business oriented company will be called Hewlett Packard Enterprise while the PC focused businesswill be called HP Inc 
Reportedly  in Meg Whitman s communication at a customer conference in Las Vegas  she also emphasized that the company will focus on four planned areas  namely  cloud computing  security  software and mobility 
We believe that these strategic initiatives will provide both the companies with the focus  financial resources and flexibility to quickly get used to changing market and customer dynamics  We also believe that these steps will add long term value for its shareholders 
In fact  H P has undertaken a good many steps for this shift including a blend of research and development  partnerships  and acquisitions 
Recently  the company announced that it will acquire networking company Aruba Networks Inc  for  2 7 billion 
The purchase of Aruba should help H P improve its role in the wireless local area network  WLAN  market  as more and more companies allow their employees to access work systems through their personal wireless devices  Once the deal closes  Aruba will function as a subsidiary of Hewlett Packard 
The current separation of the units comes at an opportune moment for the company as it is trying to diversify its revenue base from its legacy PC and printing operations to the enterprise segment  which consists of computer servers  data storage devices  networking  software and services 
It is worth noting that the PC and printing segment contribute more than 50  of H P s revenues and the rest come from Enterprise Group  Enterprise Services  Software and HP Financial Services  Nonetheless  the PC and printing business contribute less in profits 
Bottom Line 
We believe that the biggest benefit that H P will derive from splitting its two business units will be the ability to focus on the core fundamental business This will enhance shareholders  value  The separation will also enable the company to turn around Enterprise Services and strengthen its go to market capabilities 
Also  the split is intended to notify shareholders that the company will attempt to tap into high growth businesses such as the 3 D printing business that will hopefully return sustainable cash flow and earnings multiples for years to come 
We believe that H P s traction in the cloud  security and Big Data segments will be growth catalysts  going forward  The split would enable a customized approach to two different kinds of businesses  which might not have been possible as a single entity  Nonetheless  H P s enterprise segment will now compete directly with International Business Machines  NYSE IBM  and Oracle  NYSE ORCL   which means that a lot still depends on execution
