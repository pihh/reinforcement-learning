107327,328842,SINA,Day Ahead  Top 3 Things to Watch ,news,"Investing com   Here s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow
1  Wholesale Inflation in Focus
A report on wholesale inflation will likely warrant close attention as it is due a day ahead of the consumer inflation report slated for Thursday 
Inflation growth at the wholesale level as measured by the producer price index due 08 30am ET is expected to have cooled to 0 2  in April from 0 3  in the prior month 
Market participants are likely to scrutinise the report amid expectations that higher input prices for manufacturers would be passed onto consumers  triggering a boost in consumer inflation 
The Federal Reserve last week expressed confidence inflation would meet its 2  target  keeping the central bank on track to maintain its gradual pace of rate hikes 
The dollar rose to a 2018 high on Tuesday against a basket of major currencies supported by an ongoing slump in EUR USD amid renewed geopolitical uncertainty in the Eurozone 
2  Oil Reaction to Trump s Iran Deal Announcement  Weekly US Crude Supplies Data
The reaction in oil prices following U S  president Donald Trump s decision to withdraw the United States from the Iran nuclear deal will remain in focus on Wednesday 
Inventory data from the Energy Information Administration  EIA  on Wednesday will also garner investor attention amid expectations U S  crude stockpiles will fall for the first time in three weeks 
Economists forecast crude inventories fell by about 0 719 million barrels in the week ended May 4 
Crude oil prices settled lower on Tuesday but pared some of their losses heading into settlement as traders digested Trump s announcement to withdraw the US from the Iran nuclear deal  and institute the highest level of economic sanctions on Iran 
3  Boeing  Earnings in Focus
Shares of  Boeing Co   NYSE BA  came under pressure Tuesday amid fears the aircraft maker s multibillion dollar deals with Iran could come under pressure after the United States pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal 
Boeing and Iran s Aseman airline penned a  3 billion agreement for 30 737 Max jets  Bloomberg reported  The aircraft maker also struck a  16 6 billion deal with national carrier Iran Air for 80 aircraft  taking the total value of its agreement with Iran to roughly  20 billion 
Boeing said it would  consult with the U S  Government on next steps   following Trump s announcement 
Meanwhile  on the corporate earnings front  a slew of quarterly earnings due Wednesday are expected from

 This is an era of accounts being obliterated   the group said   It went from a single article being blocked  to the censorship of some prohibited speech    then today all of a sudden  we have no account  ",2018-11-13,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/china-scours-social-media-erases-thousands-of-accounts-1685241,1685241

107330,328845,SINA,Should Investors Cheer SINA s  500 Million Buyback ,news,"SINA s  NASDAQ SINA  stock recently rallied after the Chinese tech company announced a new  500 million buyback plan for the next 12 months  which replaces its previous  500 million buyback plan for 2019 
 500 million equals about 17  of SINA s current market cap  which could give the stock a big boost if it s fully executed  However  investors should note that SINA only spent  82 1 million of its prior authorization to buy back 2 2 million shares last year 

SINA s stock also declined about 20  over the past 12 months alone  due to its decelerating growth and concerns about the Chinese economy  So should investors be so eager to cheer on SINA s new buyback plan 
An authorization isn t a promise
Investors shouldn t confuse buyback authorizations with actual buybacks  When a company authorizes a buyback  it merely sets aside money for potential buybacks    it s not obligated to actually buy back any shares 
Furthermore  companies often use buybacks to offset the dilution of a stock from stock based compensation  SBC  plans for employees  SINA paid out  89 9 million  or 6  of its total revenue  on SBC expenses in the first nine months of 2019    which is comparable to the  82 1 million in buybacks it executed throughout the year 
Meanwhile  its total number of outstanding shares declined 4  annually in the first nine months  Therefore  if SINA didn t repurchase any shares in 2019  its SBC plans would likely have boosted its total share count 
These facts indicate that SINA s new buyback plan isn t aimed at boosting shareholder value or tightening up its valuations  Therefore  I d be surprised if SINA spends anywhere close to  500 million on buybacks in 2020 
SINA should focus on its other problems
Generally speaking  buybacks are ideal for mature  stable companies that can t find other practical uses for their free cash flows  SINA is a mature tech company  but its core business is unstable  due to its overwhelming dependence on Weibo s  NASDAQ WB  ad revenue 
SINA spun off Weibo  its higher growth social networking platform  in an IPO in 2014  However  it still generates most of its revenue from Weibo  and retains a majority voting stake in the company  SINA and Weibo s revenue growth decelerated significantly over the past year 

YOY   Year over year  Source  Quarterly reports 
That slowdown was caused by two main headwinds  First  Chinese companies reined in their advertising spending as the Chinese economy grew at its slowest pace in nearly three decades Second  both platforms faced stiff competition from other advertising platforms like Baidu  Tencent s WeChat  ByteDance s Toutiao and TikTok  and Bilibili  ByteDance and Bilibili  which both cater to younger Gen Z users  generated much stronger ad growth than their older tech rivals 

Instead of allocating  500 million to buybacks  SINA should consider investing in the expansion of its core portals and apps to reduce its dependence on Weibo  So far  SINA s only major expansion of its core business is its finance platform  which is struggling due to tighter government regulations of the fintech market 
Instead of focusing on fintech  SINA could acquire promising apps in higher growth markets like short videos  online dating  and games  which would mirror the moves of faster growing tech companies like Tencent and Momo 
The key takeaways
SINA s  500 million buyback sounds impressive  but I suspect that it s sound and fury which signifies nothing  SINA likely announced such a high figure to avoid another activist battle    like its clash with Aristeia Capital  which demanded that it back more shares in 2017    and to offset the dilution from its SBC expenses  Therefore  investors should ignore this announcement and wait for more visible improvements in SINA s core business ",2020-01-04,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pdj9k,2052400

107388,328903,SINA,Why Does Sina Corp Want Weibo On A US Exchange,news,"By    Sina Corp  NASDAQ SINA   an Internet company based out of Shanghai  is planning to raise about  500 million by listing its social media platform  Weibo  in the U S   news reports said Monday 
Weibo  which is similar to microblogging site  Twitter  NYSE TWTR   is expected to face a tough and crowded market once it is listed in the U S   where it would directly compete with Facebook  NASDAQ FB   Twitter and Google s  NASDAQ GOOG  Google Plus service 
According to the Wall Street Journal  Sina Corp  plans to list Weibo in the second quarter and has hired Credit Suisse  NYSE CS  and Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  to handle the listing  The Journal also reported that Alibaba Group Holding Ltd   a Chinese e commerce company  is also planning to increase its stake in Weibo from the current 18 percent  which it acquired in April for  586 million  to 30 percent  if an Initial Public Offering  or IPO  happens  
According to Bloomberg  Chinese companies raised about  907 million through the IPO route in the U S  last year 

WeChat  another social media platform  owned by Shenzhen based Tencent Holdings  HKG 0700   poses a major challenge to Weibo because its users are reportedly spending more time on WeChat  Further complicating matters for the social media application  according to the Journal  is the Chinese government s crackdown on Weibo  following unflattering chatter about government officials on the site 
Charles Chao  Sina Corp s CEO  said on Nov  12 that the micro blogging site has 60 2 million active daily users  Bloomberg reported  According to an estimate by a government research agency  the total number of people who are actively micro blogging dropped 9 percent in 2013  but Sina Corp  reported a jump of 11 2 percent to 60 2 million active users in its third quarter results 
Chao had reportedly attributed Weibo s slowdown to increased competition in the segment  as it made its first operating profit of  3 million in the fourth quarter  the Journal reported  Sina Corp  reported profits for the fourth quarter at  44 5 million with a 49 percent surge in net revenues

In spite of this slump  Michael Binger  president of Gradient Investments  believes there is still hope for one of the BATS stocks  Binger commented   I don t think the BATS stocks are untouchable  I think you need to tread lightly   further cementing his optimism about the group  Binger went on to say that his top choice for a stock to make a turnaround in the right direction would be Alibaba 
Alibaba is currently the leading e commerce company in China and one of the leading e commerce companies in the world  The company boasts 600 million plus active users and is growing fast  Binger believes that in around 10 years the company could reach the same altitudes as that of Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   Let s take a further look into how the Chinese ecommerce giant can do in the future 
Bottom Line
Alibaba is currently listed at a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   and last quarter  was able to beat our previous Zacks Consensus Estimates of  1 05 by 23 cents to post an EPS surprise of 21 90   The e commerce giant has been able to beat our consensus estimates three times in the previous four quarters for an average EPS surprise of 12 52   Alibaba also has a Zacks Style Score of B in Growth  and the Zacks Consensus Estimates is calling for a 18 03  increase in earnings to go along with a 35 13  spike in revenue for the current quarter  Our consensus estimates are projecting double digit revenue increases through the following fiscal year as well 
On the other hand  Alibaba does hold some valuation issues  The stock has historically traded at a premium relative to its respective industry  Over the past three years  at its peak  the Chinese stock traded over 49X its forward 12 month earnings  and at its lowest  it s traded 27X its forward 12 month earnings  The broader non food retail wholesale market traded at 30X its F12M earnings and traded at 19X its F12M at its lowest 
Alibaba has shown promise to take some strides in the right direction despite it being in a slump along with the rest of the Chinese BATS stocks  Alibaba and the BATS stocks as a whole can be heavily dependent on the current trade dispute between the U S  and China  and whether it escalates or not  The progress made  or lack of progress made  at the G 20 summit could either push or pull these stocks  If healthy discussions can emerge from the upcoming meeting  Alibaba has the potential to surge past its BATS peers as it has done the past three years

in China Looks GoodU S  China trade tensions have stirred up again despite the partial deal agreed upon last Friday  Optimism surrounding the trade truce faded  primarily due to unrest in Hong Kong China recently criticized the United States for passing a bill at the House of Representatives  which would support protestors in Hong Kong  The House legislation is expected to review whether Hong Kong should be separate from China  and if it deserves a special trading status under U S  rules and regulations Lest we forget  the Hong Kong international airport  known to be one of the busiest cargo airports  was shut down some time back due to heavy protests  In fact  almost 5 000 protestors had flooded the airport  leading to cancellation of many flights  Protestors have been opposing a proposal that would allow extradition to mainland China  something that would threaten their judicial protection China  in the meantime  has condemned the bill as  arrogant and dangerous   and accused U S  lawmakers of a political plot to spoil China  Beijing has now warned that it may resort to retaliatory measures if the legislation gets implemented President Trump  in the meanwhile  has said that China can only buy  40 billion to  50 billion of U S  agriculture products   something that had been agreed on in the phase one trade deal   provided there is a rollback of  50 billion in tariffs Such developments no doubt have hampered the progress made in the protracted trade issue  impacting the global economy and squeezing corporate profits  But  investors shouldn t freak out  Once the miserable trade environment clears  the negativity shrouding China will take a backseat  But  if you still don t trust what s happening on the trade front  there are various reasons to place your bets on China stocks Let s admit  China is the second largest economy in the world  as is its stock market when measured by market cap  Needless to say  it has huge state run energy players like Sinopec  All these show that despite odds  the China market is growing and if you are a long term investor  Chinese stocks must be part of your portfolio Skeptics may argue that China s GDP growth has touched the lowest level this year in almost three decades  Then again  it is still expanding at an astounding 6  to 6 5   more than other major emerging economies like India and also developed nations like the United States and Japan There is also a direct link between London and Shanghai stock exchange  created to help both Western and Chinese investors trade on the counterpart s stock market  This means that structural hazards related to investments in China stocks are falling apart Thus  the next obvious question is which are the best China stocks to keep an eye on  Here re three  JD comJD com

107441,328956,SINA,Should Investors Buy China s FANG Stocks ,opinion,"Welcome to Episode  104 of the Zacks Market Edge Podcast 
Every week  host and Zacks stock strategist  Tracey Ryniec  will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks  bonds and ETFs and how it impacts your life 
In this episode  Tracey is joined by Zacks Editor Ryan McQueeney to discuss China and its Internet and social media stocks 
It s no secret that Tracey has not been a big fan of investing in Chinese stocks over the last several years  She was among those burned by the Chinese scam companies about 6 years ago with companies that  it turned out  didn t really exist 
But last week  she bought her first Chinese stock in her own personal portfolio in 6 years 
Making the Case for China
1       The Chinese economy has been weaker than the official economic data has indicated  While technically not in a recession  for an economy used to hyper growth  it sure looked like one  But it appears like the Chinese economy may be coming out of that slow period 
2       The Chinese government has picked its winners in every industry and sector  including the Internet and social media stocks  These  winners  have the full backing of the government  which allows them to dominate the huge Chinese market 
3       Transparency appears to be better among these huge companies versus the smaller Chinese companies that went public just a decade ago  After all  Alibaba was the largest IPO of all time 
For investors who already own the American social media companies  why not add in the world s most populous country and buy the Chinese equivalent 
China s FANG Stocks
1       Baidu    NASDAQ BIDU    is the Google  NASDAQ GOOGL  of China  It gets ignored by investors but sales are expected to be up double digits this year and next and it trades with a forward P E of just 35 
2       Alibaba    NYSE BABA    needs no introduction  But it s also not a pure online shopping platform as it also owns video platform Youku  which it bought in 2015 for  4 billion  as well as Alipay  It also has made a push into expansion outside of its Chinese home market  specifically into India and Southeast Asia 
3       JD com    NASDAQ JD    is the lesser known of China s online shopping sites  Shares aren t cheap  as they re trading at 86x forward earnings but you should see sales growth over 25  this year and next 
4       Tencent    OTC TCEHY    owns the Facebook  NASDAQ FB  of China  which is called WeChat  As of the second quarter  the company was approaching nearly a billion users on that platform  It is also big in smart phone gaming as well as other hot areas like video and AI research 
5       Sina Corporation    NASDAQ SINA    is the smallest of these companies with a market cap of just 7 6 billion  It s an online media company which is the parent of Weibo  Weibo is the Twitter of China  In the second quarter  gross margins were 74   It saw strong advertising demand on the Weibo platform 
As Tracey can attest to  there are certain risks to investing in Chinese stocks  Tracey and Ryan discuss the regulatory issues and possibility of government interference  among other risks 
But with double digit sales growth expected for the next few years  it s hard to stay away from this group of stocks completely 
What else should investors know about the Chinese Internet and social media stocks 
Find out the answer to all of these questions and more on this week s podcast 
The Other Market Edge Podcast on China
In August 2017  Tracey talked with one of Zacks millennial interns who had just spent a year studying in China 
What are Chinese Millennials buying  Where are they shopping  Where are they eating out  And how are they ordering  Is cash still king or are online payments the norm in China s biggest cities 
Find out the answers to these questions and more in this fascinating discussion on China 
You might change the way you think about investing there   

 In full disclosure  the Chinese stock that Tracey recently bought for her personal portfolio was TCEHY  Find out why she chose that one on the podcast

107447,328962,SINA,Is A Surprise Coming For Sina Corporation  SINA  This Earnings Season ,opinion,Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Sina Corporation   NASDAQ SINA   may be one such company  The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon  and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report That is because Sina Corporation is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late  which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat  After all  analysts raising estimates right before earnings with the most up to date information possible is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for SINA in this report In fact  the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 85 cents per share for SINA  compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 79 cents per share  This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for SINA  giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of  7 60  heading into earnings season Sina Corporation Price and EPS Surprise   Why is this Important A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises  and outperforming the market  Our recent 10 year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better show a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and have returned over 28  on average in annual returns  see more   Given that SINA has a Zacks Rank  3 and an ESP in positive territory  investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings  You can see  Clearly  recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Sina Corporation  and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of AllLast year  it generated  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  47 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce  the world s first trillionaires   but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early ,2018-02-08,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-a-surprise-coming-for-sina-corporation-sina-this-earnings-season-200288967,200288967
107449,328964,SINA,Equifax  EFX  To Post Q4 Earnings  Disappointment In Store ,opinion,"Equifax Inc    NYSE EFX   is expected to report fourth quarter 2017 results this week  The question lingering in investors  minds is whether this credit information providing company will be able to post a positive earnings surprise in the to be reported quarter Last quarter  the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 2 7   Notably  Equifax outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 2 4  Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement Factors to ConsiderWe believe last year s data breach will continue to hurt Equifax s fourth quarter s financial results  Notably  in September 2017  the company announced that very sensitive personal data of approximately 143 million consumers has been stolen from its database Since then  the brand image and creditability of Equifax has been in question and has been facing huge customer criticism  while cybersecurity companies are questioning the company s preparedness and response to the massive data breach  Moreover  with lawmakers and investigating agencies probing the mishap  its troubles are unlikely to end any time soon We believe the entire issue might result in loss of customers and the company will also have to make huge compensation to its clients  This will have an adverse impact on the company s financial performance in the near term It should be noted that in third quarter 2017 the company had witnessed the slowest revenue growth rate in the last several years  This was mainly due to the dismal performance at its U S  Information Solutions  USIS  division which registered a year over year 3  decline in revenues to  307 7 million  reflecting massive impact due to the data breach scandal Furthermore  escalating expenses related to the cyber attack will remain a drag on the company s profitability  Per its 10 Q filing  the company expects to incur more expenses in the form of legal and professional services associated with the data breach incident  Furthermore  it had stated that its expenses might flare up due to increased investments in IT and security solutions as well as insurance services Equifax  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise

   What the Zacks Model Unveils Our proven model does not conclusively show that Equifax is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or at least 3  Hold  for this to happen  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Equifax carries a Zacks Rank  3  which increases the predictive power of ESP  However  the company has an Earnings ESP of  0 29   The combination of Equifax s Zacks Rank  3 and a negative Earnings ESP makes surprise prediction difficult The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at  1 35  representing year over year decline of 4 9   We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has remained unchanged over the past 30 days  Additionally  analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly  824 9 million  down approximately 3  from the year ago quarter Some Stocks With Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat Applied Materials  Inc    NASDAQ AMAT   has an Earnings ESP of  0 57  and a Zacks Rank  2  You can see  SINA Corporation   NASDAQ SINA   has an Earnings ESP of  7 60  and a Zacks Rank  3 HubSpot  Inc    NYSE HUBS   has an Earnings ESP of  1 32  and a Zacks Rank  3 Wall Street s Next Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time  It s a once in a generation opportunity to invest in pure genius ",2018-02-11,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/equifax-efx-to-post-q4-earnings-disappointment-in-store-200289476,200289476

107480,328995,SINA,Here s Why Chinese Internet Stocks  WB  SINA  FENG  Are Tumbling Today,opinion,"On Thursday  shares of hot Chinese Internet stocks are tumbling in morning trading after government regulators ordered three major platforms to shutdown all video  audio  and streaming services 
China s State Administration of Press  Publication  Radio  Film  and Television said that Weibo   NASDAQ WB    one of the biggest social media platforms in the country  or  China s Twitter   NYSE TWTR     was operating without the proper licensing  and publishing content that went against government regulations  regulators also alleged that Weibo was  propagating negative speech  
As a result  shares of Weibo fell 10  soon after the opening bell  but are currently down about 8 6  in mid morning trading 
Phoenix New Media   NYSE FENG    another company affected by the shutdown and owner of ifeng  has fallen over 2  so far today  video streaming site ACFUN was the other Internet platform ordered to stop operating 
The crackdown has affected other Chinese Internet stocks  SINA Corp    NASDAQ SINA    which owns a majority stake in Weibo  is currently down 5 3   while Momo Inc    AX ADR    a mobile based social networking platform  is down roughly 1 4   Shares of YY Inc    NASDAQ YY    too  have declined 2 3  today as well  YY is a leading online social entertainment platform 
Even Alibaba  NYSE BABA   which also owns a large stake in Weibo  slipped downward about 0 8   though the company has now rebounded  and is currently up 0 59  in mid morning trading 
It is unclear at this time if the shutdown is temporary or permanent  but the streaming ban is a reflection of China s continued control over its online content

107482,328997,SINA,Weibo  WB  Stock Hits All Time High Ahead Of Q2 Earnings,opinion,"Shares of Weibo   NASDAQ WB   skyrocketed to a new all time high on Monday  just days before the company is set to report its second quarter earnings 
Weibo  which is often referred to as the Chinese Twitter   NYSE TWTR    has more than doubled its share price since the start of the year  The company climbed from  40 60 a share at the end of December 2016 to the nearly  86 per share it rests at today 
Shares of Weibo were up 10  in afternoon trading on Monday  with the company reaching a new 52 week and all time intraday trading high of  86 87 per share  Weibo is currently a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and scored a  B  grade for Growth in our Style Score system 
Chinese internet and media company SINA Corporation   NASDAQ SINA    which owns Weibo  was up 4 64  on Monday  E commerce power Alibaba   NYSE BABA    which holds a reported 31 5  stake in the company  saw its stock price gain 2 98  
The Chinese social media powerhouse is set to announce its second quarter earnings before the opening bell on Wednesday  August 8  Now  let s take a further look into the company s current financials and growth opportunities 
Recent Growth
Weibo s net revenues jumped 67  year over year to  199 2 million in the company s first fiscal quarter of 2017  Massive advertising and marketing revenues  which climbed 71  from the year ago period to  169 3 million  helped to spur the company s growth 
Weibo s annual   and over the last three quarters  the company s earnings grew by an average of 179  
Wall Street  to post earnings of  1 51 per share for full year 2017  which would mark an 84  jump from last year  The company is also projected to report  1 05 billion in revenues  up 60  from the year ago period 
User Growth   More
Based on Weibo s May report  the Chinese mircoblog is now bigger than Twitter  The company boasts 340 million active monthly users  which marks a 30  gain year over year 91  of new users were mobile based  Twitter has around   On top of that  Weibo s daily active users climbed 28  from the year ago period to 154 million 
An estimated 731 million people use the internet in China and more than 90  of them have access via smartphones  according to a China Internet Network Information Centre report  China added  
The massive overall growth in Chinese internet use has and might continue to help Weibo expand its reach  Weibo is already the most popular Chinese microblogging company  and  by most mainland Chinese news outlets and TV stations 
Sina recently partnered with the PGA of America to help grow golf in China through greater web and social media exposure  and Weibo will be used to help promote content  The company worked with the NFL last season to live stream a few games on its Twitter like platform 
In March   on a multi year deal  The social media platform will provide daily game highlights  statistics  photos  and original programming  Weibo will  become NBA China s official social media platform  
Government Intervention 
Weibo has been able to grow quickly because some of the biggest social media companies are barred from entry into one of the largest markets in the world  The Chinese government blocks or regulates the use of many apps and websites  including Twitter  Facebook   NASDAQ FB    Google   NASDAQ GOOGL    and YouTube  But Weibo and its platform have also felt the reach of the government 
The company s stock price fell in late June after reports surfaced that the Chinese government was set to further regulate web use  The Chinese government will stop all audio and video content that deals with political matters from being published on the platform  especially matters that the government finds sensitive 
Weibo was told to stop streaming video and audio content that was  not in line with national audiovisual regulations and propagating negative speech    
However  Wall Street analysts aren t extremely worried that the regulations will hurt the company s bottom line because Weibo s most popular categories are entertainment  celebrity news  and fashion

107546,329061,SINA,5 China Stocks To Buy As Economy Recovers,opinion,"Consumer sentiment surged substantially in China  according to a private survey in fresh signs that domestic demand has experienced a significant increase  This in keeping with the raft of economic data released recently as well as during last month which indicates that the economy is on a firmer footing than before  This includes encouraging data on retail sales  manufacturing and fixed asset investment 
Given these developments  the luster of the world s second largest economy seems to have been restored  Picking select stocks which are poised to gain from a resurgent Chinese economy seems to be a good option at this point  
Consumer Sentiment Hits 6 Month High
Fresh signs emerged that China s domestic demand was showing resilience  The Westpac MNI China Consumer Sentiment Indicator increased from last month s level of 115 2 to 117 1  its highest level in six months  Most of this increase was attributable to substantial increases in the current household finance and improving durable buying conditions  According to Westpac Banking Group  consumers were ready to pay more for phones  appliances and other technology related products 
Meanwhile  Standard Chartered  LON STAN  Plc s Small and Medium Enterprise Confidence Index increased from 56 to 56 1 in October  According to market watchers  this was an indication that the labor market was in good health and investor momentum was being sustained  Experts believe that the government will continue to provide a significant level of liquidity and utilize appropriate economic policy to prop up growth over this year 
Multiple Indicators Encouraging
Earlier this month  official data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed that growth had increased for the third successive quarter  by 6 7   This was in line with the official target for the year  Such a reading has dispelled fears of growth falling under the 6 5  mark  Other economic indicators released recently have been equally encouraging 
For instance  the official manufacturing PMI was flat at 50 4 for September  In August  the country s manufacturing activity had touched its best level since October 2014  Fixed asset investment rose from 8 1  to 8 2   in line with forecasts  Retail sales increased at 10 4  on a year over year basis  powered by significantly high online sales 
China s government can now focus on reining in some of the support measures which have helped boost economic activity  Attempt to cool down the country s overheated property market seem to be already bearing fruit  New home prices declined by 3 7  in Beijing and also moved lower in Shanghai and Shenzhen 
Our Choices
Fresh data indicates that China s economic health has improved significantly  In fact  authorities are likely to utilize such a scenario to undertake structural adjustments which are essential to sustain long term growth prospects 
Adding stocks from China may be a prudent option at this time  We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and other relevant metrics

107556,329071,SINA,Top Trade Ideas For The Week May 26  2015  APC  CBOE  IBKR  LULU  SINA,opinion,"Here are the Rest of the Top 10 
Anadarko Petroleum  NYSE APC 
Anadarko Petroleum pulled back with the selloff in Crude Oil the second half of 2014  But since December it has been trending higher in a broad rising channel  Last week looks to have marked another bottom in that channel  with a Doji reversal candle confirmed higher and then follow through Friday  The RSI turned back up and the MACD is turning toward a positive cross 
CBOE Holdings Inc  NASDAQ CBOE 
CBOE retraced about 61 8  of the run higher from July to the peak in January before finding support  Since then it settled sideways for 2 months before starting back higher  The first leg consolidated in a bull flag and broke higher Friday  The RSI is in the bullish zone and rising and the MACD also rising  both supporting more upside 
Interactive Brokers Group Inc  NASDAQ IBKR 
Interactive Brokers has been trending higher since October 2014  The latest leg has been against rising tend support  It touched that again last week and turned back higher  The RSI and MACD are also both rising  supporting the upside continuation 
lululemon athletica inc  NASDAQ LULU 
Lululemon athletica based for a long time in 2014 before a jump higher started in December  That led to consolidation in a Diamond top that is currently breaking down  The RSI is in the bearish zone and the MACD falling as well 
Sina Corporation  NASDAQ SINA 
SINA peaked in late 2013 and then pulled back throughout 2014  It finally found a bottom in April this year and made its first higher high to start May  Since then it has pulled back in a bull flag  It broke that flag to the upside Friday  and has support from a bullish RSI for more  The MACD has stopped falling as well and is leveling 

After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad  picture reviewed Friday which  heading into the unofficial start of summer sees the equity markets looking positive and better in the longer timeframe than the shorter one 
Elsewhere look for gold to continue to hold near 1200 while crude oil consolidates with an upward bias  The US dollar index is biased to the upside but it is still too soon to declare a reversal higher while US Treasuries are biased lower but showing signs of consolidation  The Shanghai Composite is moving higher in renewed strength and Emerging Markets are biased to the downside in the uptrend  debating whether it is a bull flag or a reversal 
Volatility looks to remain subdued keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETF s SPDR S P 500  ARCA SPY   iShares Russell 2000  ARCA IWM  and PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1  NASDAQ QQQ   Their charts agree with that on the weekly timeframe  but show better strength on the SPY and QQQ on the daily timeframe than in the IWM  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

107580,329095,SINA,Sina Revenues Exceed Expectations In 2013,opinion,Sina Corp   SINA  pushes forward with its plan on improving Weibo monetization and the recent agreement with Alibaba will cause a spike in stock prices  Pleasant SurprisedInvestors were anxiously waiting for the Chinese online media company to post its first quarter results and when the numbers came in  they were pleasantly surprised  Sina s revenues were above expectations and with a growth rate of more than 19   all that it needs to do is to also improve its profitability  This is something that the company has been struggling with for a couple of years now due to a weak Internet advertising market  There are though some positive signs suggesting that Sina could finally address this issue in 2013  with non advertising and Weibo services revenues on the rise  The Upsides Of The Alibaba Sina DealOne of the projects that the Chinese online media company is a part of involves Alibaba  another important player in the e commerce industry  The deal consists in a 18  stake acquisition of Weibo  which translated into almost  600 million revenue for Sina  Perhaps the most important game is the fact that if the two companies join their forces  the project will advance into the right direction much faster  So far  Sina was only marginally successful in monetizing Weibo but with Alibaba they could achieve much more in a relatively short period of time it The joint venture will better position Weibo in the mobile and social commerce industry in China and will result into higher advertising revenues  Investors who play the long game shouldn t be worried by the prospect of cannibalization between Sina and the other services or merchants that make up Alibaba s inventory  Instead of a competition  there will have a symbiosis and if everything goes according to the plan  the profitability issue will be resolved by the end of the year  Sina Focuses On Mobile Strategy On one hand  the Chinese company tries to increase the user base of Weibo and in this area it is fairly successful as more players have joined the network  Users login more often and spend more time  after the figures went into the opposite direction one year ago  Sina can extract more value from added services provided by Weibo  the annual growth will once again surpassed optimistic expectations  The other direction that Sina is pursuing is a more effective mobile strategy as this is essential for enhancing mobile monetization  The development of a mobile platform is costly but although binary options traders shouldn t expect immediate gratification  the investment will pay off on medium and long term  Obvious improvements were made for enhancing user experience and a mobile app was released as well  As the advertising revenues for Weibo are expected to further increase after a leap of 9  from the last quarter of 2012 to the first quarter of 2013  mobile monetization should also improve ,2013-06-20,Martin Kay,https://www.investing.com/analysis/sina-revenues-exceed-expectations-in-2013-172203,172203

107583,329098,SINA,Growth Of Weibo Expected To Fuel Sina Earnings ,opinion,"Sina Corp   NASDAQ SINA  is set to report FQ1 2014 earnings after the market closes on Wednesday  May 21st  Sina is a Chinese online media company which operates Sina net and micro blogging website Sina Weibo which is similar to Twitter  Sina stock has been plummeting since  early January highs and has now fallen 47  this year  According to a pre announcement from the company itself revenue is expected to come in around  171 million with much of the growth coming from increased monetization of Weibo  This quarter Wall Street expects earnings to come in 2 cents higher per share than last year and for revenue to grow year over year by 35   Here s what investors expect from Sina on Wednesday 
The information below is derived from data submitted to the Estimize com platform by a set of Buy Side and Independent analyst contributors 

The current Wall Street consensus expectation is for Sina to report 4c EPS and  169 59M revenue while the current Estimize com consensus from 16 Buy Side and Independent contributing analysts is 8c EPS and  169 6M in revenue  This quarter the buy side as represented by the Estimize com community is expecting Sina to report in line with Wall Street s revenue consensus but exceed earnings expectations by 4c per share 
Over the previous 6 quarters the consensus from Estimize com has been more accurate than Wall Street in forecasting Sina s EPS and revenue 5 times and twice respectively  By tapping into a wider range of contributors including hedge fund analysts  asset managers  independent research shops  students  and non professional investors Estimize has created a data set that is more accurate than Wall Street up to 69 5  of the time 
More importantly it does a better job of representing the market s actual expectations  It has been confirmed by Deutsche Bank Quant  Research and an independent academic study from Rice University that stock prices tend to react with a more strongly associated degree to the expectation benchmark from Estimize than from the Wall Street consensus 
The magnitude of the difference between the Wall Street and Estimize consensus numbers often identifies opportunities to take advantage of expectations that may not have been priced into the market  Here we are seeing a larger than usual differential in earnings expectations but no difference in revenue projections 

The distribution of earnings estimates published by analysts on the Estimize com platform range from 5c to 22c per share and from  160 00M to  171 50M in revenues  This quarter we re seeing a wide range of estimates on Sina 
The size of the distribution of estimates relative to previous quarters often signals whether or not the market is confident that it has priced in the expected earnings already  A wider distribution of estimates signals less agreement in the market  which could mean greater volatility post earnings 

Throughout the quarter the Wall Street EPS consensus fell from 25c to 4c while the Estimize consensus dropped from 14c to 8c  Meanwhile the Wall Street revenue consensus remained flat at  169 59M while the Estimize consensus rose from  167 23M to  169 6M  Timeliness is correlated with accuracy and the directionality of analyst estimate revisions going into an earnings report are often a leading indicator 

The analyst with the highest estimate confidence rating this quarter is turbinecity who projects 6c EPS and  170 19M in revenue  turbinecity was our Winter 2014 season winner is ranked 2nd overall among over 4 450 contributing analysts  This season turbinecity has been more accurate than Wall Street in forecasting EPS and revenue 60  and 51  of the time respectively throughout a massive 1 073 estimates 
Estimate confidence ratings are calculated through algorithms developed by deep quantitative research which looks at correlations between analyst track records and tendencies as they relate to future accuracy  In this case turbinecity expects Sina to beat the Estimize revenue consensus but come up short against the community s EPS forecast 

While all eyes on Chinese web businesses are focused on the upcoming Alibaba IPO  the growth of Weibo has fueled earnings growth for SINA while the company s stock has been getting crushed  This quarter Sina s earnings per share will need to come in at 8c  double Wall Street s projection of 4c just to satisfy the expectations of the Estimize community  For now Sina remains another online company with a high price to earnings ratio of 73  and the market has not been kind to those companies lately

107670,329185,SINA,Securities Regulation  Can U S  And China Avert Accounting Armageddon ,opinion,China and the U S  appear to be an a collision course over accounting  That s a lot more serious than it sounds  By the end of this year  unless a compromise can be reached  there is a very real chance that U S  securities regulators may end up employing the  nuclear option    forcibly delisting every Chinese company currently listed on a U S  stock exchange   such as Sinopec  SHI   SINA Corp   SINA   China Life  LFC   and China Unicom  CHU   It s a potential catastrophe in the making that few investors or politicians have given any serious thought to    Last year  the US listed stocks of more than a few Chinese companies took a beating following accusations by short sellers and research shops like Muddy Waters that SinoForest and other companies   many of which had avoided IPO scrutiny by arranging reverse mergers with already listed entities   were grossly exaggerating their real assets and business performance in their official financial statements  These accusations prompted the Securities and Exchange Commission  SEC  to launch several fraud investigations into the Chinese companies in question    Rather than assisting the SEC in its cross border probes   as other countries regularly do   the China Securities Regulatory Commission  CSRC    insisting that audit materials on Chinese firms fall under China s ambiguous yet draconian State Secrets Law  This April  when the SEC issued a subpoena to the Chinese arm of Deloitte  demanding the audit records of Longtop Financial  which collapsed last May after Deloitte resigned as its auditor     noting that the CSRC directly ordered them not to turn over such papers  The firm argued it could be dissolved and its partners jailed for life if they were to comply  In May  the SEC  for violating its duties under the 2002 Sarbanes Oxley Act  Penalties could include suspending the firm s authority to perform audits for US listed companies  which are required under U S  securities laws   to each of the other  Big Four  global audit firms  E Y  KMPG  and PWC   and have met with similar replies    There is a further complication  The Sarbanes Oxley Act established the   a five person body appointed by the SEC  Public accounting firms that wish to perform audits on US listed companies must register with PCAOB  and PCAOB is required  by law  to conduct inspections of those firms  So far  Chinese authorities have refused PCAOB permission to inspect auditors based in China  including the local arms of  Big Four  global audit firms  Last month  it looked like  that would let it observe Chinese regulators perform their own inspection  but the SEC action against Deloitte China appears to have derailed that plan  The stage is set for a deadlock with serious  potentially disastrous implications  as my fellow CPA and Peking University counterpart     The PCAOB faces a December deadline to complete inspections of Chinese accounting firms that are registered with the PCAOB  It seems highly unlikely that they will meet this deadline  since Chinese regulators will not let them come to China  While the PCAOB could extend the deadline  they have already been under political pressure to act   Without resolution  the only meaningful option for the SEC  and the PCAOB  is for the PCAOB to deregister the firms and for the SEC to ban them from practice before the SEC The consequence of those actions would be that U S  listed Chinese companies would be without auditors and unable to find them  Having an auditor is a listing requirement of the exchanges  so under exchange rules the companies face delisting  The U S  listed Chinese companies would be unable to file financial statements as required  That should lead the SEC to eventually deregister the companies with the SEC Paul notes that shareholders in the delisted Chinese companies would still own their shares  but would be unable to trade them on U S  exchanges  The companies would probably try to list their stock on other non U S  exchanges such as Hong Kong  which could prove an expensive and cumbersome option  The effect on US China relations  and on investor confidence in cross border investments in either direction  would be devastating  Yet the alternative would be to allow Chinese companies to trade their shares on U S  exchanges while openly flouting U S  securities laws   not just Sarbanes Oxley  which is somewhat controversial  but anti fraud provisions dating back to the 1930s In the meantime  Chinese regulators have been moving to exert even greater secrecy and control over companies  financial information  Local bureaus of the State Administration for Industry and Commerce  SAIC    after short sellers and analysts used information gleaned from those filings to call company financial statements into question  Of more immediate concern  the Ministry of Finance is following through on plans to force the  Big Four  global audit firms to surrender majority control of their Chinese operations over to local CPAs  and dramatically reduce the number of foreign certified CPAs they employ  As Paul Gillis     One of the unintended outcomes of the restructuring of the Big Four in China will be that the firms will likely be required to re register with the PCAOB  That could pose a problem  since the PCAOB has said they will accept no  until the issue of inspections is resolved    I was pondering the irresistible force meets immovable object dilemma here last night when I happened across a seemingly unrelated passage in Jim Fallows    which offered a glimmer of hope    In 1997  Jim relates  three Chinese airlines   Air China  China Eastern  and China Southern   had just been awarded or applied for very prestigious and strategically important routes to the United States  and had purchased brand new state of the art Boeing planes to fly those routes  with many further orders expected  However  the safety record of Chinese airlines in the 1990s was atrocious  In order to actually fly those routes  the airlines required approval from the U S  Department of Transportation  DOT   the parent body of the FAA  The DOT  at the FAA s urging  demanded  confirmation that China s regulatory standards  as applied by the CAAC  conformed to the worldwide guidelines laid out by international agreements    Until then  it was no fly  The Chinese were furious  believing the Americans had double crossed them by selling the planes and then reneging on the routes  The whole thing could have concluded in respective chest beating and a very ugly  damaging stand off  Instead  Boeing took the initiative  since its future sales were on the line  through a series of seminars  tours  and training sessions to reconcile the two points of view  Key to its success was the way it handled Chinese sensitivities    One  way  was to present all their recommendations in terms of meeting international standards for air safety and airline procedures  rather than seeming to say  This is how we do it in the U S  of A  Presenting the challenge this way made it far more palatable to the Chinese side  Learning to comply with international standards was one more sign of modernization in China  doing things the  American way  could seem like a sign of continued subservience  The examples were  of course  from American practices at the FAA or the operational details of Boeing and United Airlines  but the leitmotif was that Americans had learned how to make their practices meet international standards  and they could help the Chinese do the same thing    Bridging the gap in securities regulation will surely be more difficult than fine tuning some phrases   especially since Chinese companies that truly are fraudulent have a lot to hide  But Chinese aviation officials had a lot to hide too  back then  Many of them  once they realized how far they fell short of  international standards   doubted whether they could ever make the grade  and feared losing face and making others lose face if they tried  But working with their American partners  they succeeded   China s airline industry today has an admirable safety record  which has laid the foundation for ambitious plans for China to claim a leading role in the global aviation industry   that at least some officials at CSRC are sympathetic to what the SEC is trying to achieve  and they certainly don t want to seem too far out of step with their international  and much more cooperative  peers    If China wants Shanghai to become a  global financial center   or the Renminbi to develop into an  international currency   it has to do the same thing in securities regulation that did in airline safety regulation  It has to win the confidence of global investors just as it successfully won the confidence of global travellers  China closing the windows and battening the hatches to avoid embarrassment is not a solution  but neither is Americans telling the Chinese  it s our way or the highway    The U S  has to make a forceful  compelling argument that adopting international norms of openness and cooperation on securities fraud investigations will help China achieve its ambitions   but that until then  it s  no fly  for unsafe stocks on U S  markets ,2012-06-18,Patrick
