possible Now it s my pleasure to turn the call over to Roger Roger C  Hochschild    Director  Chief Executive Officer and PresidentThanks  Craig  and thanks to our listeners for joining today s call I ll begin by reviewing the highlights and key performance metrics for the full year  then turn the call over to John to review fourth quarter results as well as our guidance elements for 2020 2019 was another very good year for Discover  with net income of  3 billion after tax or  9 08 per share and a healthy return on equity of 26   These results reflect our business model that brings together the positive attributes of high return consumer lending and direct banking with the benefits and long term potential of owning our own global network  Our robust returns allowed us flexibility to return excess capital to our shareholders  while continuing to make important investments in the Discover brand s advanced technology and expanding our acceptance globally  These investments have further strengthened our competitive position in 2019 and set us up for continued strong returns in 2020 and beyond Looking at some of the specifics Total loans grew 6   in line with our expectations  and credit performance was also on target as we benefited from the continued strength of the US consumer and ongoing advances in our risk management and servicing capabilities  We achieved a robust net interest margin of 10 41   and operating expenses remained in our targeted range  Economists are forecasting continued growth in the economic environment in 2020  However  given the unprecedented duration of the economic expansion  we will manage credit with that in mind We continued to invest in our global payments business in 2019  focusing on expanding acceptance by adding network partners and relationships with acquirers in key markets like the UK  New Zealand  France and Spain  Our Payment Services segment generated a 24  increase in pre tax income  primarily driven by strong volume gains from our PULSE business  The team at PULSE had a great year  adding volume from acquirers and both existing and new issuers Turning to slide 4  We had solid loan growth in all our products  with total loans and card loans both up 6   In our card business  the majority of this growth was in higher yielding merchandise balances as opposed to promotional activity  reflecting strong card member engagement  We continue to introduce features and service enhancements that are relevant to customers and prospects  including  for example  leveraging merchant partnerships to provide even greater value to our card members We also had a good year in our student lending business  with organic receivables up 9   Loan growth is benefiting from increased awareness of the Discover brand  enhancements to acquisition models and improvements in the conversion process  We continue to benefit from our strong position as the second largest provider of private student loans Our personal loan portfolio grew 3  in 2019  a touch above our expectation  Our investments in analytics and modeling have had a significant impact on our personal loan credit performance  enabling us to increase originations while maintaining an acceptable level of credit risk Turning to slide 5  Credit performed very well in 2019 and was in line with our expectations  The seasoning of loans from recent vintages was the primary driver  as the impact of normalization in the consumer credit industry continues to abate  As I said earlier  we feel good about the underlying economic and credit trends as we enter 2020 and we ll have more to say about the overall credit environment when we discuss fourth quarter performance and 2020 guidance later in the call Before I turn the call over to John  I want to wrap up by saying how excited I am about our prospects for continuing to create value for Discover s customers  team members and shareholders  We finished 2019 on very solid footing  generating outstanding returns by combining solid loan growth and effective credit risk management I ll now ask John to discuss our financial results in more detail John T  Greene    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial OfficerThank you  Roger  and good afternoon  everyone I ll begin by addressing our summary financial results on slide 6  Looking at key elements of the income statement Revenue  net of interest expense  increased 5  this quarter  driven primarily by a 6  increase in average loans  Provisions for loan losses increased 5   mainly driven by loan growth and to a lesser extent by ongoing supply driven normalization in the consumer credit industry  Operating expenses were up 7  due to higher compensation expense and continued investments to support growth in collections  digital platforms and advanced analytics Moving to slide 7  Roger already covered the key loan metrics  but I wanted to emphasize that the majority of the growth in card receivables came from standardized merchandise balances  with a smaller contribution from promotional balances  We expect merchandise balances will continue to be a primary driver of card growth in 2020  Just under 70  of the increase in receivables was from new accounts  with the remainder from existing card holders Looking at student loans  Total receivables were up 3  from the prior year  with the organic student loan portfolio increasing 9  year over year Turning to slide 8  Volume on the Discover Network rose 5  from the prior year  in line with growth in the Discover card spending  Within our Payment Services segment  PULSE volume increased 6  over the prior year  driven by strong performance in key products Moving to slide 9  Net interest income of  2 4 billion increased  122 million or 5  from the prior year  The increase was driven by higher loan balances  a higher revolve rate  lower promotional balances and a favorable funding mix as we continue to grow lower cost  direct to consumer deposits  This was partially offset by the impact of a lower average prime rate in the quarter  an unfavorable funding rate  reflecting maturities of lower coupon brokered and direct to consumer deposits  and higher interest charge offs Total noninterest income was  520 million for the quarter  up  15 million or 3  year over year  The primary drivers of the increase were higher loan fees and an increase in transaction processing revenue  Net discounts and interchange revenue was up  Phonetic   281 million or 1  Turning to slide 10  Our net interest margin was 10 29  for the fourth quarter  consistent with our expectations  This was down 6 basis points year over year and 14 basis points sequentially  Relative to the prior year quarter  the decrease in NIM was due principally to three factors  first  the unfavorable funding rate I just mentioned  second  the impact of a lower prime rate  and third  higher interest charge offs  These were partially offset by a higher revolve rate  BT fees and a favorable promotional balance mix  Relative to the third quarter  NIM decreased 14 basis points due to the impact of lower prime rate and an unfavorable funding rate  partially offset by a higher revolve rate and BT fees Total loan yield decreased 7 basis points from a year ago to 12 52   primarily driven by a 12 basis point decrease in card yield  reflecting prime rate decreases and higher interest charge offs  This was partially offset by a higher revolve rate  BT fees and lower promotional balances On the liability side of the balance sheet  average consumer deposits grew  3 billion in the quarter and now make up 55  of total funding  Consumer deposit rates decreased 13 basis points from the third quarter as we actively managed our funding costs lower  Although market observers expect a stable Fed funds rate this year  we will remain vigilant for opportunities to prudently manage our deposit and other funding costs Turning to slide 11  Operating expenses increased  74 million or 7  from the prior year  Employee compensation was  33 million higher  reflecting staff increases in technology as well as higher average salaries and benefit costs  Professional fees were  24 million higher  mainly driven by third party recovery fees  Cost to support investments in analytics also contributed to higher professional fees  The  20 million increase in information processing was driven by our continued investment in advanced analytics and infrastructure costs Turning to credit on slide 12  The takeaway here is that overall credit performance remains stable and well within our risk and return expectations  Total net charge offs increased 11 basis points from the prior year  with the primary driver continuing to be the seasoning of loan growth and  to a lesser extent  the supply driven normalization in consumer credit Credit card net charge offs increased 18 basis points from the prior year and 9 basis points from the prior quarter  The credit card 30 plus delinquency rate was 19 basis points higher year over year and 12 basis points sequentially  This was another solid credit performance in our card business  reflecting our disciplined underwriting and line management We saw a modest uptick in student loan charge offs as the portfolio seasoned  Student loan credit performance continues to be aided by efficiency gains in collections  including expanded outreach to co signers In personal loans  charge offs rose in the quarter consistent with typical seasonal patterns  The 30 plus delinquency rate was down 23 basis points from the prior year and 12 basis points compared to the third quarter  We continue to see credit improve as a result of our prior credit tightening and improved fraud detection Before leaving the subject of credit  I wanted to preview and additional disclosure on troubled debt restructuring you ll see in our 10 K  To provide greater clarity on the growth in our TDR receivables  we will now report the balance of receivables that have successfully completed programs  At December 31  we had total credit card TDRs of  3 4 billion  up  1 1 billion from the prior year  But in fact  over half of the  1 1 billion increase was from customers who had successfully completed a program  In account number terms  this equates to about an 80  success rate  This demonstrates that our modification programs are an important aspect of helping customers through temporary hardship and also benefit Discover by reducing overall credit costs and enhancing revenue Let s turn now to slide 13  Our common equity Tier 1 ratio decreased 20 basis points sequentially  reflecting loan growth and capital returns  partially offset by strong earnings  Our payout ratio  which includes buybacks  was 77  over the last 12 months  And as we noted earlier  average consumer deposits now make up 55  of total funding Slide 14 provides a summary of 2019 business performance compared to our guidance for the year and against 2018 performance  You will see green check marks against each of the metrics  and I want to congratulate the team for its solid execution against all of our key financial objectives for 2019 The following slide provides a summary of our outlook and guidance for 2021  First  we share the consensus view that the macroeconomic environment will remain stable  We do not see any indicators that point to a recession in the next 12 months  We expect the US consumer to remain healthy and unemployment remaining near the current levels  We also note that household debt service levels are at a 40 year low  an indication that consumers remain financially resilient  Based on these factors  we ve assumed no Fed rate changes in our 2020 business plan  This backdrop sets us up for another year of profitable growth and strong returns Now turning to the specific guidance elements  First  we expect loan growth to be in the range of 5  to 7   Next  we expect operating expenses to be in the range of  4 7 billion to  4 9 billion as we continue to invest for future growth with incremental spending on our brand to increase awareness and consideration  We expect net charge offs to be in the range of 3 3  to 3 5  this year  reflecting a stable credit environment and the seasoning of our growing portfolio  Our target CET1 ratio continues to be 10 5   which remains an achievable target under CECL due to the phase in for regulatory capital purposes and our capital generative business model I m sure you ve noted our list of guidance elements for 2020 is a bit shorter  In fact  we ve taken a fresh look and decided to no longer provide specific guidance on rewards rate or NIM  The rewards rate can vary quarter to quarter depending on the 5  category  The annual rate has been increasing by around 2 to 3 basis points due to the ongoing shift from the More card to the It card  and we expect this trend to continue In terms of NIM  the single largest driver of changes in net interest margin has been Fed actions  Given this  we ve elected not to provide specific guidance  but we ll comment on the other drivers such as deposit beta and spending patterns as part of our quarterly earnings calls So with that  I ll move on to the topic of CECL  On the last earnings call I indicated the Day 1 adjustment would be toward the north end of the 55  to 65  range we had guided to  We now expect our adjustment to be approximately  2 5 billion or 75  above the year end incurred basis In terms of the Day 2 impact  the reserve change will depend upon the mix of the business  economic outlook  overall credit performance and the point in time in which quarterly estimates are determined  Additionally  the seasonality of our business will impact quarterly reserve changes and could introduce some volatility from one quarter to the next  As you ve seen  our business model is capable of generating high returns  which should enable us to largely offset the capital implications of CECL over time Wrapping up on slide 16  In 2019 we generated 6  total loan growth and delivered a robust 26  return on equity  We had a very strong year in our consumer deposit business with growth of 22   Credit remained in line with our expectation and return targets  and we executed on our capital plan by allocating capital to loan growth and share buybacks In conclusion  2019 was a strong year and we re very pleased with our performance and positioning for 2020 That concludes our formal remarks  So I ll turn the call back to our operator  Erica  to open up the line for Q A Questions and Answers Operator Operator Instructions  We ll take our first question from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs Ryan Nash    Goldman Sachs    AnalystHey  good evening  guys Roger C  Hochschild    Director  Chief Executive Officer and PresidentHey  Ryan  Good evening Ryan Nash    Goldman Sachs    AnalystHey  John and Roger  So  John  thanks for the updated Day 1 outlook on CECL where you said 75  increase  I guess  first  what is driving that higher from the initial guidance  And then second  on last quarter s call  you mentioned the Day 2 impact on the reserve bill could be higher than Day 1 since you re adding new accounts that don t have any incurred loss The message is slightly different from what we ve heard from others  So I just wanted to get a sense  one  how should we think about    does the fact that you re growing faster and adding more accounts factor into that faster Day 2 impact  Or is there something else that s impacting it  Thanks  And I have a follow up John T  Greene    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial OfficerOkay  Thank you  Ryan  Thanks for the question  So let me start with Day 1 impact  So I think as I said on the last call  my take was  the team did a fantastic job in terms of modeling and preparing for CECL implementation  and that view still holds very  very strongly  The initial guidance  55  to 65   included a number of factors And as we came through the fourth quarter we took a look at the modeling  the performance of the portfolio and specifically recovery assumptions  And we ended up revising a recovery assumption that had to do with overall recoveries  taking a look at most recent history  which was certainly stellar performance and we moved it back to the middle point of the observable history on recovery  So that was the primary driver of the change in Day 1 In terms of Day 2  I said on my first call  third quarter  that Day 2 would be higher  And certainly in the third quarter  it was higher as we modeled  and that increase had to do with the amount of volume we put on the books related to our student loan products  which  in terms of Day 2 impact  has a significantly higher impact than Day 1 would under an incurred basis Now  that actually points to some of the volatility that we re seeing in CECL  So  as we take a look at all our product and the relative mix throughout the year  I would say a good proxy for Day 2 would be that range around 75   So it s a slight nuance on the initial message that I provided  but I would also caution that that s a preliminary number  and we re working through it and there is a bunch of dynamics that impacts CECL  including the macroeconomic outlook  portfolio performance  mix of products that we re putting on the book in any one quarter and obviously the delinquency and roll rates that we re observing So  a lot to consider there  but I hope I ve provided enough specificity to be helpful as you think about how to model this business Ryan Nash    Goldman Sachs    AnalystGot it  Thanks for all the color  And then I guess a follow up for the both of you  So if I look at the expense guide  it implies about 7 5  to 12  expense growth  which is ahead of  I guess  expectations and where you are running  So first  John  can you maybe size what are some of the incremental investments  And Roger  are there any one off investments in here that you feel you need to make for this year or are we entering into a new phase of elevated investing  And then second  how should we think about seeing the payback from these investments  Thanks John T  Greene    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial OfficerOkay  Hey  Ryan  I ll start and then Roger  I m sure  will have a follow up  So I m going to start with it by editorializing a little bit here  So  if you look at the efficiency ratio that this company has generated over time  it s among the lowest in the industry  And then if you also look at the returns in terms of return on equity  we are among the highest in the industry  And one could use those two data points and make a simple argument that perhaps we ve underinvested over time given the returns that we re generating So  as we put the plan together for 2020  we looked at where it was appropriate to invest  where we thought we d generate the best long term returns for our shareholders  And there was two items specifically  So  investments in brand around awareness and consideration  and that s a meaningful number  it d be around  100 million  believe it or not  And then also continued investment in our infrastructure to add functionality and ensure it s appropriate from a scale and resiliency standpoint going forward Roger C  Hochschild    Director  Chief Executive Officer and PresidentYeah  And maybe just to build on what John said in terms of the payback  some will be more immediate and so drive our continued strong loan growth  but others we also expect multi year returns  And as you think more broadly about our expenses  I d say it s sort of a dual story of efficiency  but then also investments  And so the vast majority of the expense lines are close to flat year over year As John and I look across the P L  we re looking for efficiencies in terms of our marketing expenses  so our CPAs that we re targeting across the different products  But we are investing significantly around building the brand and also building brand awareness of some of our non card products as well as some investments in technology that we think will be very helpful in driving growth in the future John T  Greene    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial OfficerYeah  And then just one follow up comment  This company has a rich tradition of effectively managing costs  And certainly my background  I ve had my share of cost management and analytics to ensure we re going to get a payback on these investments  So  as Roger said  some of these are longer term  some of these are shorter term  We ll continue to monitor and ensure that for every dollar we re spending we re getting appropriate paybacks for our shareholders Ryan Nash    Goldman Sachs    AnalystThanks  I appreciate the color OperatorWe ll take our next question from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW Sanjay Sakhrani    KBW    AnalystThanks  I guess I wanted to dig in again on Day 2 impact related to CECL  I was wondering  John  if you could give us a little bit more to help us sort of triangulate on how we should think about the provision for 2020 John T  Greene    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial OfficerYeah  So  I guided around that 75  figure as a  call it a poster  an anchor  as you think about Day 2  It s still early  as I mentioned on my last comment  Sanjay  So I would say for the year that s a decent way to think about it  Might be a little higher  might be a little lower And in terms of quarter over quarter    the third quarter we originate a lot of student loans and that Day 2 will certainly exceed the 75  number that I just mentioned  So mix will be an important factor on it  But beyond that  I don t know if I d be doing any one a service by being more specific Sanjay Sakhrani    KBW    AnalystOkay  Fair enough  And then on the other guidance data point around loan growth and not getting a whole lot on NIM and rewards rate  I was wondering  if we think about loan growth and what revenue growth might do in relation to loan growth  is it fair to assume that it should be fairly commensurate  i e   there s no significant factors that would lead to a different direction than loan growth would suggest  Or am I thinking about it incorrectly John T  Greene    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial OfficerNo  I think you re definitely in the right direction  So there is a couple of things that I just want to point out  So  as I said in my prepared remarks  we assume no Fed rate changes in our planning assumptions  So  if that changes  that certainly  as it has done historically and been a problem from a forecasting standpoint  that would impact NIM  We re also    I alluded to this in the prepared remarks  In terms of our focus around deposits and increasing the level of overall funding from directly consumer deposits which are a cheaper funding source I also mentioned that I think there is    over time  we will continue to work to see what we can do in terms of the cost of deposits  making sure that we re originating the deposits that add an appropriate level to fund the balance sheet toward our longer term target  but also being very mindful of the cost of funding  So  if things went well  there could be a basis point or 2 on the deposit side  It s your call whether you want to put that into your models And then  in terms of pricing actions  the Company has been pretty stable  but we ll continue to look for opportunities on the pricing side Sanjay Sakhrani    KBW    AnalystThank you OperatorWe ll take our next question from John Pancari with Evercore John Pancari    Evercore    AnalystGood afternoon Roger C  Hochschild    Director  Chief Executive Officer and PresidentHey  John John Pancari    Evercore    AnalystI just have a question on the TDRs  I know you ll be giving us more disclosure in the in the K  but I wonder if you could give us the    of the  85 million loan loss reserve build that you recorded for the quarter  how much of that was related to TDRs  And then separately  do you have what the delinquency ratio was for the TDRs for the quarter John T  Greene    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial OfficerSo  for the quarter    we ve previously said this  and it remains consistent  that from a TDR standpoint only 5  are more than 90 days delinquent  So that s remained consistent performance there  No major change In terms of reserve provisioning  we re probably not going to break that down on this call  I don t know that it would be super helpful  And if I did  it would take the balance of the call to kind of walk through the nuances of it  So we ll pass on that one  if you don t mind  Sorry I can t be more specific  John John Pancari    Evercore    AnalystNo  I got it  That s fine  I guess one more on the TDR topic  Just given the increase that you cited  the up  1 1 billion year over year  that s about under 50  increase  And then TDRs were up 9  linked quarter  it looks like  I mean  what are you seeing differently in your    the make up of your card base that you    that Discover is seeing a much larger increase in the usage of TDRs versus a lot of your peer institutions  I know you can t really talk too much about what the peers are seeing  but the increase in TDRs has certainly outpaced that of other lenders in the space John T  Greene    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial OfficerYeah  So let me start off by saying that we have some really solid analytics around our TDRs  and we test populations  And then once those tests come back and show that indeed cash flows are improving  we ll open it up to a certain population  And then we ll observe that and then we ll adjust accordingly based on any differences we see between the test population and when the TDR specific program is in process So  I m not really going to talk about what other folks are doing  There also is an approach that we take where we think that    and we ve seen real differences in terms of outcomes for our customer base in terms of helping them work through some difficulty and they end up    some 80  of them end up sticking with us  have their credit lines open back up and continue to be very  very satisfied customers So around the edges  we re going to take a look at smaller accounts and see if the effort to make a TDR is worthwhile based on our belief in terms of what s going to happen in those particular populations  But these are good programs  The financial impact is taken as soon as we TDR them  They remain in the delinquency buckets that they re in unless they ve made three successive payments  So what you re seeing flow through the financials is exactly what you would hope in terms of overall good credit performance and a solid book  and TDRs is an approach to work with customers and help cash flows Roger C  Hochschild    Director  Chief Executive Officer and PresidentAnd maybe just to build on that  There has been a lot of noise around this  And so that s part of why we decided to add the disclosures  to help provide you more information and kind of give us more insight into where we see it  A better way to classify it might be not just TDRs but customers who have ever been in a TDR  And so the growth    really some of them will have returned to prime will be getting line increases  etc  and are well into the book  It just happens to be the way we account for these is once a TDR  always a TDR  So that s why we think these new disclosures that you see in the K will be very helpful John Pancari    Evercore    AnalystGot it  Okay  Thank you OperatorWe ll take our next question from Mark DeVries with Barclays Mark DeVries    Barclays    AnalystYeah  Thank you  My question is  what are the implications of the 10 5  CET1 target for the end of 2020 which I believe is kind of what you guys have indicated you think you should operate longer term on the payout ratio as we look beyond 2020 and sort of factor in the continued phase in of the CECL impacts along with continued loan growth John T  Greene    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial OfficerYeah  Okay  So I ll take this and maybe Roger will have a comment if appropriate  So  when the team set up the original target for CET1 they did that with the idea that indeed CECL would be implemented and would impact the overall capital plan for the year 2019 through the first half of 2020  So we are going through our    beginning our CCAR work and we re going to make the submission and we ll get some feedback likely in June  And we ll use that  coupled with our overall plan around capital allocation that will review with the Board to make a determination of what the future dividend payout ratio and buyback programs will look like I would say this  So  as we look at CECL for 2020 and our capital generative business models  we can likely absorb over the short term  based in the phase in  and long term  the impact of CECL  Now  there is questions regarding our regulators and how CECL will impact the consumer finance industry  especially given its pro cyclical nature and the fact that products with longer lives such as student loans and certain home equity products  and even to a lesser extent personal loans  in a tough economic environment  certain lenders might not look like the profile and that will impact the availability of credit I will say this  We like our products under CECL under the current FAS 5 methodology  It s based on the cash flows  CECL is not impacting the cash flows  And we like the return profiles that we ve generated historically and will in the future Roger C  Hochschild    Director  Chief Executive Officer and PresidentYeah  And to build on that  from our discussions with regulators  I wouldn t interpret the phase in as just delaying the pain  The Fed has indicated to us that it s designed to give them time to see how CECL is impacting different financial institutions and that actually they feel like the amount of loss absorption in the system currently  i e   pre CECL  which is capital plus provision  is appropriate  So we ll see how that comes out  But again  I wouldn t just necessarily view it as something that s going to phase in and that s that Mark DeVries    Barclays    AnalystOkay  Sorry  Roger  Does that imply that there is some room for the Fed to potentially say now that you ve got greater loss absorption capacity kind of post CECL that maybe the 10 5  is the right level that maybe you could go a little bit lower Roger C  Hochschild    Director  Chief Executive Officer and PresidentI would not predict what the Fed is going to do  I can just say what I ve heard directly from them  which is they feel like pre CECL the loss absorption is right for the system as a whole  and that the phase in is not just spread it out over time  but it actually give them time to figure out what they want to do  So I would say we re all going to have to stay tuned John T  Greene    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial OfficerYeah  And then   Mark DeVries    Barclays    AnalystOkay John T  Greene    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial OfficerThe other kind of party that will help on this will be the rating agencies  right  We spent some time with the rating agencies in December  and the view there is    at least my personal takeaway is that they re going to take a look at equity and reserves in the aggregate  So I don t see any major implications  at least in the short term there Mark DeVries    Barclays    AnalystOkay  Thank you OperatorWe ll take our next question from Eric Wasserstrom with UBS Eric Wasserstrom    UBS    AnalystThanks very much  Gentlemen  I have a question just about credit  I heard your commentary about broad based stability  But also  we re seeing a few other trends too such as higher interest charge offs  investment in collections  higher late fees  the TDR experience that you cited  the success rate seems high  but as others have pointed out  just the growth in TDRs is also very large  So I m just trying to put all of those pieces together to understand kind of how to really think about the credit experience over the near term horizon Roger C  Hochschild    Director  Chief Executive Officer and PresidentYeah  I would worry about stringing a bunch of things together  I think we ve talked about the TDRs and are adding more disclosures so that hopefully that will help you see them the way we do  In terms of investing in collections  I think that s something that makes a ton of sense just about any time but certainly late cycle  But that s something we ve talked about I think pretty consistently for multiple years there  So if you re trying to string those kind of data points into a bigger story  I m not sure that s something I would agree with Eric Wasserstrom    UBS    AnalystOkay  And maybe just transitioning topics for a moment  In terms of the investment expense that you ve highlighted  is this an expense that you re thinking about over a specific horizon  Or should we just think about the overall efficiency ratio of Discover as just being a little bit different going forward than maybe what the recent historical experience has been Roger C  Hochschild    Director  Chief Executive Officer and PresidentI think we provided guidance for what to expect for 2020  My guess is  going beyond that  we ll continue to invest in growth  But I m also optimistic about our ability to find efficiencies as well  especially leveraging some of those investments on the technology side around robotic process automation  around advanced analytics  So we re not prepared to really give guidance beyond 2020  But you can rest assured we ll be looking to see what we can find on the efficiency side to help fund investments in growth Eric Wasserstrom    UBS    AnalystOkay  Thanks very much OperatorWe ll take our next question from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse Moshe Orenbuch    Credit Suisse    AnalystGreat  Sort of following up    and I appreciate  Roger  that you re not interested in giving guidance beyond that  But if you put together the comments that you do expect the payback from those investments and obviously the efficiency ratio  given you re likely to see revenue growth between 5  and 6  at most there is going to deteriorate in 2020  I mean  should we take from that the inference that at some point it should be improving  I mean  can you kind of discuss that a little bit Roger C  Hochschild    Director  Chief Executive Officer and PresidentActually it sounds like you re asking for long term guidance  No  again  as I said earlier  we re not giving guidance beyond next year  But I did want to make it clear that you shouldn t necessarily take that as a run rate number  And we do believe  to the point John made  as efficient as our model is compared to the rest of the financial services industry  we believe there are further efficiencies to be gained by deploying some of these advances in technology  So we re not also saying that you can just continue to print the number for 2020 Moshe Orenbuch    Credit Suisse    AnalystRight  And maybe just to take that idea    because I m not a huge fan of the idea that well because it s lower than others we should want to necessarily to be higher for some period of time  I mean  you talked about the high level of returns  but it s not like we re seeing a degradation in that  right  It s not like that was running down  So maybe talk a little bit about what are the things you saw that kind of made this the right time to take that stand on expenses Roger C  Hochschild    Director  Chief Executive Officer and PresidentYeah  I think it s a very good point  Moshe  We don t manage the business to an efficiency ratio  We manage our expenses to be as efficient as possible  but then also look to invest and drive growth  And the sum of those two really is the entire expense base and drive the calculation of the efficiency ratio  But to the extent we see opportunities to make investments to drive accelerated growth and we feel good about the payback  as John talked about  we will do that and communicate that as appropriate  But I think your point s a good one  You don t want to just manage the business to an efficiency ratio Moshe Orenbuch    Credit Suisse    AnalystNo  I don t think so  And I guess I look forward to having a future discussion about seeing some of those gains coming in there on the revenue side Roger C  Hochschild    Director  Chief Executive Officer and PresidentSure OperatorWe ll take our next question from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America Maher    Bank of America    AnalystHi  This is Maher for Jason  I just had a    maybe we could start with just CECL  Just wanted to make sure we understand  Given    I think you had mentioned like CECL has a differential impact on some of your products  particularly on Day 2 and as we go into the quarters  Does that change the way you think about those products  And also just relatedly in terms of just the disclosures you ll be providing  are you going to provide disclosures for the next several quarters so we can compare results on a more apples to apples basis John T  Greene    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial OfficerYeah  Thanks for the question  So  in terms of how we think about our products  we think about them from a cash flow standpoint and on a risk and return basis  And we continue to like all our products  whether we are on an incurred basis or under this new regime  CECL  So no change in the thinking there  Now  in terms of disclosure  what we ve said previously  and we continue to be in the same spot  that we will provide disclosures that will create transparency between CECL incurred for the next four quarters Maher    Bank of America    AnalystGot it  Now  that makes sense  Thank you  And then just real quick  if I can go back to just the opex guide  maybe I guess clearly it s topic du jour on this call  But maybe we could get    if you could give us a little bit of more color on just the kinds of investments you re making and just maybe just help us understand    your loan growth next year is 5 5  to 7  is a little bit I guess in the range similar to this year  and it sounds like some of these investments have a little bit longer payback period  But is it also supporting that 5  to 7  loan growth this year and do you need to make those investments to achieve that growth  I guess  Thank you John T  Greene    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial OfficerSo here s how we think about it  So there is the investment in brand to drive awareness and considerations  We haven t actually baked it in  but we think that over time will lower our acquisition cost    our per unit acquisition cost as people find greater awareness of Discover  the product offerings  the customer experience and frankly a fair value exchange  So that is one aspect  but that is over time and to be determined The other piece around technology investments    we re going to be very judicious about those and with those to make sure that we are deploying functionality that help make a difference to either our growth trajectory or our expense profile  So over time  I would expect that indeed we ll see efficiency gains  either top line or through the expense base  And some of them are  as Roger said  longer term  some are shorter term  but there is thorough process to make sure we re getting the bang for the buck Maher    Bank of America    AnalystOkay  Thank you OperatorWe ll take our next question from Rick Shane with JPMorgan Rick Shane    JPMorgan    AnalystHey guys  thanks for taking my question  When we think about the sort of normal factors that cause hardship  loss of job  death  unemployment    or illness and divorce  is there anything idiosyncratic that you re seeing that s changing in the portfolio  Or is there a policy shift that s driving this John T  Greene    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial OfficerNo  there is no change in terms of  I ll say  customer behavior  What you re seeing here is frankly the benefit of frankly some solid analytics by our collections team in terms of when a customer is experiencing difficulty and helping that customer manage through it  The only process change we ve made is  it used to be someone had to call in and talk to a rep  For large balances that continues to be the case  For certain customers who meet certain criteria  they can do it online on their mobile app  And we ve tested those populations versus the call in populations and actually the mobile populations are performing as well or better than when someone talks to a rep So  what you re really seeing here in the growth is a couple of factors  One is the    I think there is a difference in reporting versus some competitors  Two is  we ve done an analytical exercise and made sure we understand paybacks and where it can make a difference to cash flows positively and we ve opened those up  So it s a combination of those factors  and we re going to keep doing them as long as we re cash flow positive Rick Shane    JPMorgan    AnalystGot it  And to the extent it is constructed from an NPV perspective  does the transition to CECL and the lifetime reserve make it easier because there is less accounting sort of penalty to do with this John T  Greene    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial OfficerYou know what  in terms of the P L impact  right when you take a TDR you basically take the net present value of the cash flows compared to your balance  and that s the P L impact  CECL  you basically do the same thing on life of loan losses  So yeah  the relative kind of decrement to the P L  if you are growing TDRs  is smaller under CECL  But that s not how we make decisions here Rick Shane    JPMorgan    AnalystGot it  All right  Thank you so much OperatorWe ll take our next question from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo Donald Fandetti    Wells Fargo    AnalystHi  John  Couple of follow ups on the Day 2 or conceptual accounting  Can you clarify what you mean by the 75   not under Day 1  but on Day 2  Are you talking about incremental gradation on just the loan growth  And then also  can you talk once your allowance rate sort of is set  will it remain relatively stable through the year if there is no change in sort of mix or economic outlook John T  Greene    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial OfficerYeah  So  in terms of the 75  on Day 2  it would be relative to what they would be on an incurred basis  So an incremental 75  versus incurred  Now  loan growth will create incrementality versus an incurred basis  It s just the nature of taking a lifetime loss upfront in a provisioning standpoint The team did a really good job in terms of modeling  and we feel like we re appropriately reserved from a Day 1 standpoint  And going forward  if we re seeing better recoveries through a cycle or better performance from an overall portfolio standpoint  then we ll adjust and correspondingly  if we re challenged somewhere  we ll adjust the other way Donald Fandetti    Wells Fargo    AnalystBut conceptually  what do you think about sort of the reasons  all else equal  that the allowance rate would remain relatively stable throughout the year despite mix or economic change  And are we talking about sort of CECL being an incremental couple of percent GAAP EPS impact  all else equal John T  Greene    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial OfficerI m not sure I m totally clear on the question  but I ll try to answer it  and if I miss we ll come back  So  in terms of    if we re seeing a change in the economy or outlook of the economy or a change in the performance of our portfolio or a change in mix  all those will have an impact on the CECL reserves Donald Fandetti    Wells Fargo    AnalystNo  Speech Overlap  not what I m saying  If those were not to change  would the allowance rate  all else equal  kind of stay the same throughout the year John T  Greene    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial OfficerYeah  So it would build for loan growth at that rate  But in terms of kind of relative difference to incurred would be fairly consistent Donald Fandetti    Wells Fargo    AnalystOkay John T  Greene    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial OfficerThank you Donald Fandetti    Wells Fargo    AnalystAppreciate it OperatorWe ll take our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley Betsy Graseck    Morgan Stanley    AnalystHi  good evening  Couple of questions   Roger C  Hochschild    Director  Chief Executive Officer and PresidentGood evening  Betsy Betsy Graseck    Morgan Stanley    AnalystHey  So  Roger  just wanted to swing back to the investment spend  I think during the    some of the comments you were mentioning that with the investment spend  you re expecting to be able to enhance the brand awareness  Maybe used the words  in particular or especially in non card product  I m wondering if your messaging to us that you think that you re under represented in either the personal loans or in the student loans or if there s other products that you re looking to get into  Maybe you can touch base on what the implications for that is  and if the payback for the investments should come in the form more in loan growth  in NII or should there be any fees associated with it as well  Just like to understand how you think about that Roger C  Hochschild    Director  Chief Executive Officer and PresidentOkay  So the investment in brand there  two parts  right  Part of it is just increasing consideration on the card side  You ve seen some work around building awareness that we offer products other than just cash back so we put ad money behind miles as well  But we look at consumers out there  There is a gap in terms of what I ll call top of funnel  right  people who consider Discover and have us top of mind  So that s why  as we think about our marketing mix  we re going to heavy up a bit on top of funnel brand type advertising There also was an opportunity for our non card products  in particular  some of the deposit products  We ve made great strides in terms of the products themselves  went out with no fees across any of our deposit products  But there still are huge amounts of consumers that don t understand  for example  we re even in the student loan business  let alone we are the second largest originator of private student loans  And the same holds true with understanding that Discover offers the savings account and checking account  So it s a mix of both of those  building and enhancing consideration on the card side and building awareness for our non card products Betsy Graseck    Morgan Stanley    AnalystAnd then this investment spend should kick off in 1Q  like  should I take the  200 million and just divide by 4 and throw that through the model linearly or is this going to be back end loaded  Kind of in a 4Q environment  how should I think about the pace of that spend throughout the year Roger C  Hochschild    Director  Chief Executive Officer and PresidentWe cannot comment on the seasonality of the spend  Sorry Betsy Graseck    Morgan Stanley    AnalystOkay OperatorWe ll take our next question from Bill Carcache with Nomura Bill Carcache    Nomura    AnalystThank you  Good evening  Roger and John  I had a high level question on the guidance for you  I think everyone would agree with your earlier point that you guys have a rich history of generating high returns and industry leading operating efficiency  But within that there has also been a commitment to positive operating leverage that we are not seeing in this year s guidance with your revenue growth and expense guidance suggesting that you re explicitly guiding to negative operating leverage And so when we think about what s changed  it seems like in the past what we ve seen from Discover is a commitment to managing expenses for the revenue environment and achieving positive operating leverage by finding cost improvement opportunities in one area to the extent that you need to make investments in another as opposed to the approach that you guys seem to be taking now which is more along the lines of making the investments upfront with the expectation that you ll get the efficiency improvements later  So is that an accurate way of thinking about it  I was just hoping you could comment on that and just share any high level thoughts  And that s my only question  Thanks Roger C  Hochschild    Director  Chief Executive Officer and PresidentYeah  So first I d say  by and large  John is new  but you ve got the same team that s been here for decades making the investment decisions  And I think you ve seen a lot of discipline from us over the years  whether it s on the credit side or the expense side  It isn t necessarily a trade off where we sort of manage to an expense budget and then sort of if we can generate more efficiencies then that frees up more money for growth  We try and be disciplined and consistent So our investments in growth  they re really more driven by the opportunities we see to put our shareholders  money to work to drive good organic growth with strong return profiles for that  And I mentioned that we expect our unit costs on the investments in account acquisition to be coming down next year  But we do feel like there is an opportunity to put some money to work with a bit of a longer payback on the brand side  in particular  sort of top of funnel brand advertising  driving that awareness and consideration  and on technology  That reflect some specific decisions we are making for 2020  I would not read into it any change in discipline or philosophy from the team here at Discover Bill Carcache    Nomura    AnalystUnderstood  Thanks for taking my question OperatorWe ll take our next question from Bob Napoli with William Blair Robert Napoli    William Blair    AnalystThank you and good evening  I guess trying to follow up on just on the loan growth and revenue growth  Is there the potential through some of the positive  Phonetic  products  the consumer banking products  the growth of AribaPay B2B that you could get revenue growth higher than loan growth over time  Is that a goal and is there potential to do that  It seems you ve made a lot of investments in the network and B2B payments over the last several years Roger C  Hochschild    Director  Chief Executive Officer and PresidentYeah  B2B payments have benefited us probably so far more in terms of volume than profitability  The margins can be very thin  But we ve been clear that we would love to see more of our earnings come from the payments segment and are very focused on driving that  That can be a multi year initiative  So I wouldn t necessarily expect something transformational in 2020 But we have a unique collection of payments assets if you look at PULSE and Diners Club and sort of the fact that we ve built the third largest global network in terms of acceptance  So the team is very focused on monetizing that  But again  you re talking about a B2B sales cycle  and so that will take some time Robert Napoli    William Blair    AnalystOkay  Maybe a follow up on the competitive environment and with the    maybe with the entrance of the Apple Card  which  I mean  maybe is going after your demographic  The growth of neobanks probably going after the deposit space in your target segment  several of them  some of those companies getting super high valuations as private companies  What are your thoughts on the Apple Card  on the neobanks and then some of your investment in brand in response to the competitive environment Roger C  Hochschild    Director  Chief Executive Officer and PresidentSo  our investments in brand are much more driven by our traditional competitors  And as we ve seen those super high private company valuations appear to come and go  As I think about competition  competition in the card space is always intense  right  It tends to be rational  but you have some large sophisticated players  It s a high return business  It s challenging  but always intensely competitive  So I would view the Apple Card as    you can t underestimate anything that Apple does  It s a new competitor and one that I m sure will be formidable  But I don t think it s transforming the overall competitive environment in the card space On the deposit side  it s a different decision in terms of who you take a loan from  who you give your money  And so brand and trust remain key elements of that I think as you saw from the very strong direct to consumer deposit growth we posted  We feel like we have the product set and the ability to compete  We really just need to build awareness  And a lot of the focus is on moving deposits from some of the traditional branch based players as opposed to necessarily going head to head with some of these emerging online players Robert Napoli    William Blair    AnalystOkay  Thank you OperatorWe ll take our next question from John Hecht with Jefferies John Hecht    Jefferies    AnalystYeah  Hi  Thanks very much for taking my questions  Actually most of my questions have been asked  but a couple that I ll throw out  Number one is  you mentioned some unfavorable funding triggers in the quarter  And I m wondering  are those    are you able to unwind those  Are those kind of permanent aspects of the funding going forward John T  Greene    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial OfficerYeah  So  actually what that was is  if you go back about a year and a half ago  we had some really cheap CDs on the books  And then there was Fed rate actions and more expensive deposits came on the books  And over time  if there is no Fed action you d see favorability come through into the P L on that  And if you look at   John Hecht    Jefferies    AnalystAnd what duration should we expect that and where you ll get that favorable outcome on the deposit costs John T  Greene    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial OfficerYeah  So  it s throughout this year and into next year John Hecht    Jefferies    AnalystOkay  And then a follow up question would be  you ve taken deposit as a percentage of funding up 200 basis points in the 2019 period  How should we think about funding mix over the course of 2020 John T  Greene    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial OfficerYeah  So our    we enjoyed great growth there  and I think it s a testament to both the team and the products and Discover in general  We have a longer term target of 70  direct to consumer deposits  thereabouts I would say next three to five years on that  So one way to do it would be to draw a line and plot it accordingly John Hecht    Jefferies    AnalystGreat  That s very helpful  Thank you  guys  very much OperatorWe ll take our next question from David Scharf with JMP David Scharf    JMP    AnalystHi  good afternoon  And once again  pretty much all my questions have been answered  except that I did want to just follow up on what I hope is not a repetitive topic  On the investment spend  it seemed like collections was highlighted a couple of times  I think backward looking in the fourth quarter  I have written down that you had more third party professional fees  and then going forward  it was more of a broader investment light cycle Just curious  I mean  should we be thinking about sort of under capacity with in house collectors  Is that why you defaulted to more third parties or are you finding any challenges with recovery rates internally  Can you give us a little color besides just the cyclical factors Roger C  Hochschild    Director  Chief Executive Officer and PresidentSure  So just to be clear  in terms of collections  which we define as sort of prior to charge off  we do 100  of that in house  And so that s with our own US based employees  It is very scalable  A lot of our investments have been in the area of analytics as well as    if you think about collections as marketing  we re seeing great impact from sort of building out digital collections  There are a lot of people who may not want to talk about the situation they re in  but like seeing the options they have online  And so I think collections is an area where you can achieve competitive advantage  So it s been something that    there hasn t been a change in our investment strategy there  It s been a multi year journey and we expect to continue On the recovery side  we do work with third parties  And so  to the extent recoveries are more successful because of the commission structures  we will pay more in recovery fees  But that usually means there is a net benefit John T  Greene    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial OfficerRight  And just adding onto that  So the recoveries are up year over year about 28   So what you re seeing is  that s I think a factor of portfolio  but probably more reflective of where we are in the economic cycle and the fact that the consumer strength is probably frankly increasing and as well distribution is also improving mildly  So not a bad story there on the professional fees whatsoever David Scharf    JMP    AnalystGot it Roger C  Hochschild    Director  Chief Executive Officer and PresidentAnd one thing I d point out on the recovery side  We do not sell any of our charge off paper  and haven t for well over 10 years  So you do enjoy a stream from those recoveries as opposed to people who just sell and take the NPV David Scharf    JMP    AnalystRight  And as far as    just a quick follow up  I assume embedded in your net charge off range you provided for 2020 is a consistent recovery rate as a percentage of gross charge off rate  Or is there any modification or conservatism built in there John T  Greene    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial OfficerSo overall charge offs    I mean  we gave the range  That s a net range  and I think we re pretty comfortable with that as guidance David Scharf    JMP    AnalystGreat  Thank you OperatorWe ll take our next question from Meng Jiao with Deutsche Bank Mengxian Jiao    Deutsche Bank    AnalystGood afternoon  guys  Most of my questions have been answered already  I just have two    one quick question I guess on deposits  It looks like I guess the brokered deposits were pretty down this year  Is that the I guess the run rate going forward as we should see more I guess runoff in the brokered deposits range as well as continued expansion in the direct to consumer John T  Greene    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial OfficerYeah  in general  that s the plan  We re going to keep that open as a channel  But in terms of our funding stack that should continue to decrease as an overall percentage of the funding stack as the DTC increases Mengxian Jiao    Deutsche Bank    AnalystGot you  Okay  And then I guess the second question is  in terms of M A  I know you guys are focused on B2B partnerships and noting that less interested in a bank deal  Has that changed materially from prior quarters  Or is that still the same message going forward Roger C  Hochschild    Director  Chief Executive Officer and PresidentYeah  I think we feel good about the businesses we re in and our ability to grow that organically  And I think if you look on the banking side  I don t see any gaps in our model that we would need to fill Mengxian Jiao    Deutsche Bank    AnalystGreat  Thank you OperatorWe ll take our next question from Bill Ryan with Compass Point William Ryan    Compass Point    AnalystThanks for taking my question  A question on student lending  If you could maybe give us some idea of what your origination volume was in 2019 versus 2018  dollars and or percent and maybe what your outlook is for 2020 and maybe a little bit of color what you re seeing in terms of pricing  your market share and borrower profile  Thanks John T  Greene    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial OfficerSo  in terms of growth  we said organically we had 9  organic growth in student loans  not on originations but the loan balance  and we provided overall guidance on loan growth which is inclusive of student loans  So we re not going to get into kind of origination levels  We just don t think that s probably the most helpful information William Ryan    Compass Point    AnalystOkay  Any color on pricing or where do you think your market share is and things like that Roger C  Hochschild    Director  Chief Executive Officer and PresidentYeah  I think we feel good about the season of originations we ve had  So again  a little harder to get market share data  but we certainly feel like we held our position as the second largest originator even in environment where there were some new entrants  And in terms of kind of who we target and credit  we remain very disciplined William Ryan    Compass Point    AnalystThank you OperatorWe ll take our next question from Dominick Gabriele with Oppenheimer Dominick Gabriele    Oppenheimer    AnalystHi  Thanks so much for taking my question  When you talk about the investment spend  how much of the investment spend    or are there plans to use this period of time to significantly invest in the global network in particular and how much is the focus there given what you ve talked about on investment spend  Thanks Roger C  Hochschild    Director  Chief Executive Officer and PresidentYeah  I think we highlighted the two areas where we want to call out a significant increase  One was around the brand and advertising  The other one was on technology  We did not highlight a significant change in spending  And again  as we look at building our global acceptance  some of it is working with acquirers  some of those very cost effective  we ve built through these network to network agreements and that will remain a core part of the strategy Dominick Gabriele    Oppenheimer    AnalystOkay  Great  Thanks so much OperatorAnd there are no further questions at this

161859,383375,DFS,Why Shares of Discover Financial Are Trading Down Today,news,"What happened
Shares of Discover Financial Services  NYSE DFS  fell about 10  on Friday morning following the financial services company s fourth quarter earnings report  Discover actually beat the consensus earnings estimate by a penny  but investors were more focused on the company s cost forecast for 2020 
So what
After markets closed Thursday  Discover Financial reported fourth quarter earnings of  2 25 per share on revenue of  2 94 billion  compared to Wall Street expectations for  2 24 per share in earnings on sales of  2 95 billion  But the company s total net charge off rate of 3 19  was up 11 basis points year over year  and Discover raised its provision for loan losses to  836 million  from  799 million in the third quarter and  800 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 

Total operating expenses were up  75 million year over year due to higher employee compensation costs and investments in technology 
Discover management on a post earnings call with investors said to expect expenses to remain on the upswing in 2020  as the company focuses on marketing the brand and building its technology  Chief Financial Officer John T  Greene said that Discover expects those investments to pay off over time but admitted there could be some lag in that payoff 

There is the investment in brand to drive awareness and considerations  We haven t actually baked it in  but we think that over time  we  will lower our acquisition cost    our per unit acquisition cost as people find greater awareness of Discover  the product offerings  the customer experience  and frankly a fair value exchange      The other piece around technology investments    we re going to be very judicious about those and with those to make sure that we are deploying functionality that help s  make a difference to either our growth trajectory or our expense profile  So over time  I would expect that indeed we ll see efficiency gains  either top line or through the expense base 

Now what
We re in a tricky environment for bank stocks  with interest rates remaining stubbornly low and competition between financial institutions driving down margins  Discover s investments might be wise long term moves  but in the near term the extra costs figure to affect 2020 earnings  A number of Wall Street analysts lowered 2020 estimates following the call  and the stock is acting accordingly

161953,383469,DFS,Why The Earnings Surprise Streak Could Continue For Discover  DFS ,opinion,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well positioned to maintain its earnings beat streak in its upcoming report  It is worth considering Discover  DFS   which belongs to the Zacks Financial   Consumer Loans industry 
When looking at the last two reports  this credit card issuer and lender has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates  The company has topped estimates by 6 50   on average  in the last two quarters 
For the most recent quarter  Discover was expected to post earnings of  2 29 per share  but it reported  2 36 per share instead  representing a surprise of 3 06   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  2 11 per share  while it actually produced  2 32 per share  a surprise of 9 95  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Discover lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Discover currently has an Earnings ESP of  2 49   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on January 23  2020 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2020-01-06,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-the-earnings-surprise-streak-could-continue-for-discover-dfs-200496693,200496693
161954,383470,DFS,Discover  DFS  Surpasses Q4 Earnings Estimates,opinion,"Discover  DFS  came out with quarterly earnings of  2 25 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 23 per share  This compares to earnings of  2 03 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 0 90   A quarter ago  it was expected that this credit card issuer and lender would post earnings of  2 29 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 36  delivering a surprise of 3 06  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
Discover  which belongs to the Zacks Financial   Consumer Loans industry  posted revenues of  2 94 billion for the quarter ended December 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 10   This compares to year ago revenues of  2 81 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Discover shares have added about 0 6  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 2 8  
What s Next for Discover 
While Discover has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Discover was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  2 28 on  2 91 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  9 48 on  12 01 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year 
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  Financial   Consumer Loans is currently in the top 44  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2020-01-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/discover-dfs-surpasses-q4-earnings-estimates-200501168,200501168

161967,383483,DFS,Is Discover Financial  DFS  Stock A Suitable Value Pick Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Discover Financial Services   NYSE DFS   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Discover Financial has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 9 47  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 19 35  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Discover Financial s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 14 30  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Discover Financial has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 9 28  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Discover Financial stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Discover Financial has a P S ratio of about 1 90  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 36 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  DFS is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Discover Financial currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Discover Financial a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Discover Financial might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of C and a Momentum score of D  This gives DFS a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen two estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to three lower  while the full year estimate has seen six upward and one downward revision in the same time period As a result  the current quarter consensus estimate has remained unchanged in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched up by 0 4   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Discover Financial Services Price and Consensus    This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineDiscover Financial is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  a strong industry rank  Top 35  out of more than 250 industries  further supports the growth potential of the stock However  with a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the industry has underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Just Released  Zacks  7 Best Stocks for TodayExperts extracted 7 stocks from the list of 220 Zacks Rank  1 Strong Buys that has beaten the market more than 2X over with a stunning average gain of  24 5  per year These 7 were selected because of their superior potential for

161972,383488,DFS,Is Alliance Data  ADS  Doomed To Have A Terrible 2020 Too ,opinion,Alliance Data Systems Corporation   NYSE ADS   seems to be in rough waters as the company is plagued by high debt level  rise in operating expenses  loss from its Epsilon divestiture  weak performing Card Service segment  et al is affecting the industry In a year s time  the company has lost nearly 43  of its market capital  which now stands at  5 1 billion  Year to date  the stock has shed 26 9  of value against its industry s growth of 44 1   This share price depreciation looks more grave in the light of other players  performances  such as Visa Inc    NYSE V    Discover Financial Services   NYSE DFS   and Mastercard Incorporated   NYSE MA    which have surged 40 6   46 6  and 56 9   respectively  over the same time frame What is Bothering Alliance Data After delivering solid performances in the past few years  the Card Service segment has been putting up a dismal show over the first nine months of 2019  Revenues from this segment dropped due to high royalty payments made to retailers associated with new clients  In fact  the company s Loyalty One segment is unable to meet expectations lately due to decline in both the euro and the Canadian dollar relative to the U S  dollar and decreased revenues on account of outsourcing of additional rewards inventory  During the first nine months of 2019  revenues from Card Services and Loyalty payments dipped 1  and 6  year over year The company has been reporting sluggish results  Its adjusted earnings per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last three quarters Alliance Data has also been facing challenges in the retailer customer base  mainly because of the dominant private label credit card business  The company has catered to mall based merchants over the years  However  the retailers struggled due to stiff competition from online entities  Instead  the company penetrated new industries like travel and beauty products It took significant measures in 2019  which sadly had a negative effect on its performance  For example  it sold its Epsilon business in July 2019  which was a marketing services firm providing end to end  integrated marketing solutions  Revenue contribution from this segment represented 27  and 29  of total 2017 and 2018 revenues  This action only aggravated its problems  Although the move has been taken by the company to focus on its market leading high growth and an ROI driving Card Service segment  it still remains a concern for the company In fact  its underperforming LoyaltyOne business can also be divested to target more profitable lines of business as that has been providing little synergy to the company For 2019  the company expects its adjusted core EPS in the range of  16 75  17  the mid point indicating a 3 5  dip from the year ago reported figure  This projection was provided by the company after it considered its Epsilon divestment  anticipated Dutch tender and cost reductions at the corporate location The company has also been enduring an elevated expense level over the past few years due to higher cost of operations and an increased general and administrative expense  Total operating expenses escalated 40 2  in the last five years  In the first nine months of 2019  operating expenses rose 5 7  to  3 1 billion  Escalating expenses might weigh down the company s margins going forward Alliance Data s ballooning long term debt has also been a concern  which has increased 43  in five years  time  Consequently  interest expenses have more than doubled over the same time frame  Its times interest earned stands at 2 3  much lower than the industry average of 23 3  reflecting its inefficiency to pay back debt  The company has been grappling with high debt level  which exposes it to greater financial risk With more than 60  of the Canadian households collecting reward miles  the AIR MILES Reward Program cemented its position as Canada s premier coalition loyalty program  In the event of actual redemptions by AIR MILES Reward Program being more than expected or if there is an increase in costs related to the redemption of AIR MILES reward miles  profitability will likely take a beating  In addition  AIR MILES reward miles issued is directly proportional to AIR MILES reward miles available for redemption in the future  This  in turn  might dent revenues  AIR MILES issued slipped 4 3  and 0 4  in 2017 and 2018  respectively  In the first nine months of this year  the same dipped 0 2  year over year Remedial Steps TakenThe company has devising an expense reduction plan  which is expected to result in more than  100 million incremental cost savings for 2020 Though ADS has been witnessing its retailer base upgrade and although it has a major advantage over its bank like and private label credit peers  analysts are still worried  The new management team is revamping the company into a tech enabled  marketing services oriented  private label credit card company It has also been forging alliances to strengthen its portfolio and retain customer loyalty  For instance  it is selected to provide co brand credit card services for Sony  which would likely boost customer loyalty and improve digital engagement  In October  the company s card services business inked a long term deal with Lands  End to provide co brand and private label credit card services Can the Stock Stage a Comeback in 2020 Shares of the company have lost 16  in the past three months  underperforming the industry s rise of 3 6  The current year scenario does not appear encouraging for the company that currently has a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 earnings is likely to suffer a downward revision  suggesting a 25 6  fall from the prior year reported number  The consensus mark for revenues is expected to move 27 9  south over the same time frame  Moreover  its long term growth rate stands at 11 7   lower than the industry average of 13 7  Hence  investors should wait and see how the stock fares in the months ahead You can see Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2020In addition to the

	It looks like high level meetings between U S  and China negotiators will be taking place early next month in Washington D C 
	You may remember that such talks were originally expected to happen this month  but that was before this latest round of tariffs 
	The market decided   Better late than never  
	A strong day for technology launched the NASDAQ higher by 1 75   or nearly 140 points  to 8116 83  while the Dow jumped 1 41   or about 372 points  to 26 728 15

	This makes two strong sessions in a row for stocks  Yesterday  the market took off after Hong Kong withdrew the extradition bill that sparked several months of huge protests 
	But not all the good news of late stems from trade or China  On Thursday  the ISM Services report rebounded from a three year low by blowing past expectations to 56 4 in August 
	It was a nice change of pace from the manufacturing index on Tuesday  which showed the first contraction in over three years   For both reports  a reading above 50 indicates expansion while below 50 indicates contraction  
	We also got a strong ADP  NASDAQ ADP  report today that said private payrolls in August rose by 195 000  which easily topped expectations 
	While it s a nice number  investors are really hoping that it s a sign for a stellar Government Employment Situation report tomorrow  Last month  the economy added 164 000 jobs  which was inline with expectations

162011,383527,DFS,Will Discover  DFS  Beat Estimates Again In Its Next Earnings Report ,opinion,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well positioned to maintain its earnings beat streak in its upcoming report  It is worth considering Discover  DFS   which belongs to the Zacks Financial   Consumer Loans industry 
This credit card issuer and lender has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 8 73  
For the most recent quarter  Discover was expected to post earnings of  2 11 per share  but it reported  2 32 per share instead  representing a surprise of 9 95   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  2 per share  while it actually produced  2 15 per share  a surprise of 7 50  
Price and EPS Surprise

For Discover  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Discover currently has an Earnings ESP of  0 20   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on October 22  2019 
With the Earnings ESP metric  it s important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power  however  a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-10-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-discover-dfs-beat-estimates-again-in-its-next-earnings-report-200474150,200474150
162017,383533,DFS,American Express To Cut More Than 4 000 Jobs,news,"By   

 Reuters    American Express Co  will cut more than 4 000 jobs this year  an executive said  after the credit card company also reported higher quarterly expenses and provisions for bad loans 
The planned redundancies  from a workforce of nearly 63 000  contributed to a  313 million pre tax restructuring charge taken by the world s largest credit card issuer during the fourth quarter 
The company s shares fell 2 3 percent to  85 62 after the bell 
American Express  which in recent years has been reining in costs to counter sluggish revenue growth  said expenses rose 3 5 percent to  3 60 billion in the fourth quarter  driven mainly by marketing costs and salaries 
Total provisions for loan losses increased 21 5 percent to  582 million 
Another credit card issuer  Discover Financial Services Inc  reported a 33 percent drop in quarterly profit as it set aside more money to cover bad loans 
The job cuts announced by American Express will take place in the United States and abroad 
 The actions we are taking will impact over 4 000 people at a cost of  313 million in the quarter   Chief Financial Officer Jeff Campbell said on a post earnings conference call  referring to the planned job cuts 
The company had 62 800 employees at the end of 2013  according to its latest annual report  Four thousand jobs would constitute about 6 percent of its workforce  but Campbell said the cuts will be offset partly by the creation of some new jobs 
Despite higher expenses  fourth quarter profit rose 10 7 percent as customers in the United States spent more using their AmEx cards  The company also earned higher net interest income 
Net income rose to  1 45 billion  or  1 39 per share  in the fourth quarter ended Dec  31  from  1 31 billion  or  1 21 per share  a year earlier 
Total revenue  net of interest expense  rose 6 6 percent to  9 11 billion 
The results included a pre tax gain of  719 million on the sale of the company s investment in expense software maker Concur Technologies Inc   which Germany s SAP SE agreed to buy for about  7 3 billion in September

162036,383552,DFS,Discover  DFS  Upgraded To Buy  Here s What You Should Know,opinion,"Discover  DFS  could be a solid addition to your portfolio given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   This rating change essentially reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates    one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices 
A company s changing earnings picture is at the core of the Zacks rating  The system tracks the Zacks Consensus Estimate    the consensus measure of EPS estimates from the sell side analysts covering the stock    for the current and following years 
Since a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near term stock price movements  the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors  They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time 
As such  the Zacks rating upgrade for Discover is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  and the near term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated  The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship  as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock 
Fundamentally speaking  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Discover imply an improvement in the company s underlying business  Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
As empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Discover
This credit card issuer and lender is expected to earn  9 02 per share for the fiscal year ending December  2019  which represents a year over year change of 15 8  
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Discover  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 2 7  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term 
You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here    
The upgrade of Discover to a Zacks Rank  2 positions it in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions  implying that the stock might move higher in the near term ",2019-08-18,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/discover-dfs-upgraded-to-buy-heres-what-you-should-know-200456337,200456337

What s Next for Discover 
While Discover has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock

162062,383578,DFS,McGrath  MGRC  Hits Fresh High  Is There Still Room To Run ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of McGrath RentCorp  MGRC   Shares have been on the move with the stock up 8 3  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  70 88 in the previous session  McGrath RentCorp has gained 32 3  since the start of the year compared to the 12 6  move for the Zacks Finance sector and the 37 2  return for the Zacks Financial   Leasing Companies industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on July 30  2019  McGrath reported EPS of  0 79 versus consensus estimate of  0 73 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 3 95  
For the current fiscal year  McGrath is expected to post earnings of  3 51 per share on  531 4 million in revenues  This represents an 8 33  change in EPS on a 6 64  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  3 65 per share on  551 3 million in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 3 99  and 3 74   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
McGrath may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
McGrath has a Value Score of C  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are A and B  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of A 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 19 4X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 10 4X versus its peer group s average of 3 2X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 1 94  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to consider the stock s Zacks Rank  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  McGrath currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if McGrath passes the test  Thus  it seems as though McGrath shares could still be poised for more gains ahead 
How Does McGrath Stack Up to the Competition 
Shares of McGrath have been soaring  and the company still appears to be a decent choice  but what about the rest of the industry  Some of its industry peers are also impressive  including Aercap Holdings N V   AER   Discover Financial Services  NYSE DFS   and Credit Acceptance  CACC   all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least  2 and a VGM Score of at least B  making them well rounded choices 
The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 2  of all the industries we have in our universe  so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for McGrath  even beyond its own solid fundamental situation ",2019-07-31,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/mcgrath-mgrc-hits-fresh-high-is-there-still-room-to-run-200449000,200449000
162076,383592,DFS,Discover  DFS  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"The market expects Discover  DFS  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 23  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This credit card issuer and lender is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 12 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  11  
Revenues are expected to be  2 80 billion  up 7 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 35  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Discover 
For Discover  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 00  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Discover will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Discover would post earnings of  2 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 15  delivering a surprise of  7 50  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

162109,383625,DFS,Should Value Investors Pick Discover Financial  DFS  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Discover Financial Services   NYSE DFS   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Discover Financial has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 9 45  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 17 13  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Discover Financial s current PE ratio somewhat below its midpoint  which is 11 01  over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Finance sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 13 75  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Discover Financial has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 8 48  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Discover Financial s stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Discover Financial has a P S ratio of about 1 91  This is substantially lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 07 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is somewhat below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms    Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Discover Financial currently has a Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes DFS a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Discover Financial might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of B and a Momentum score of D  This gives DFS a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current quarter has seen four estimates go higher in the past sixty days and one lower  while the full year estimate has seen seven upward and no downward revisions in the same time period This has had a favorable impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen 2 9  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has nudged up 1 5   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Discover Financial Services Price and Consensus    The stock holds a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   which indicates expectations of in line performance from the company in the near term  However  Discover Financial is enjoying bullish analyst sentiment  as indicated by the positive estimate revisions  and this works in the company s favor Bottom LineDiscover Financial is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  a strong industry rank  top 7  out of more than 250 industries  further supports the growth potential of the stock  However  with a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past one year  the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for industry trends to turn favorable in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Will you retire a millionaire  One out of every six people retires a multimillionaire  Get smart tips

162110,383626,DFS,GB Group  Growth And Profits On Track,opinion,"GB Group  LON GBGP  reported FY19 results in line with recently upgraded estimates  It continues to deliver on its strategy to grow organic revenues at double digit rates while delivering operating margins in excess of 20   Recent acquisitions are performing well and helped drive the 56  growth in international revenues over the year  We make minor changes to our forecasts  resulting in small upgrades to normalised EPS estimates 



Business description
GB Group is a specialist in identity data intelligence  Its products and services enable its customers to better understand and verify their customers and employees  and are used across a range of fraud  risk management  compliance and customer on boarding services  With headquarters in the UK  GB operates across 16 countries  has customers in 72 countries and generates more than 45  of revenues internationally 
FY19 results meet GBG s growth targets
GBG reported revenue growth of 19 9  for FY19  or 11 5  on an organic constant currency basis  at the upper end of GBG s 10 12  target organic growth range  Adjusted operating profit of  32 0m grew 22  y o y  with a margin of 22 3   and normalised EPS grew 15  y o y  The three focus businesses grew organic revenues at rates in the mid  to high teens and provide the engine for future growth  The company has started to pay down some of the debt put in place when IDology was acquired and finished the year with a net debt position of  66 3m  We make no material changes to our revenue or EBITA forecasts  reductions in interest expense and tax result in EPS upgrades of 2 2  in FY20 and 2 6  in FY21 
Organic growth the immediate priority
GBG s immediate focus is on integrating recent acquisitions and capitalising on its increased presence in the US and Asia Pacific  with investment in sales and customer support  It is also investing in technology to enable the group to scale up securely and develop integrated solutions across the different product areas  with a combined Identity Location solution the first to be launched later this year  With c  54m headroom from current debt facilities and strong cash generation leading us to forecast a net cash position by the end of FY22  the group has adequate funding to pursue additional acquisitions in the medium term 
Valuation  Profitable growth warrants premium rating
At a P E of 35 6x FY20e and 31 8x FY21e  the stock trades at a premium to the UK software sector  Looking at more directly relevant sub sectors  including global peers  the stock trades more in line with cyber security peers  with similar levels of profitability and growth  We believe this premium rating is warranted  considering the group s historic track record of profitable growth and strong cash generation combined with the opportunity from structural growth in identity data intelligence services and the potential for accretive acquisitions 

Review of FY19 results
We recently upgraded our forecasts on the back of the April trading update  factoring in better performance than originally forecast for the two recently acquired businesses  VIX Verify and IDology   Consequently  FY19 results are marginally ahead of our forecasts for revenue  adjusted operating profit  EBITA  and normalised EPS 
Group revenues increased 20  on a reported basis  8 7  an organic reported basis and 11 5  on an adjusted organic  constant currency basis 1 Adjusted operating profit increased 22  and normalised EPS 15  over the same period  The company continues to expense R D as incurred and highlighted an additional  5m investment during FY19 related to improving the fraud platform  moving to hosted solutions  and developing joint solutions 
Reported EPS was ahead of our forecast due to lower than expected exceptional costs  The company incurred costs of  3 75m relating to acquisitions and a further  0 26m in reorganisation costs  This compares to our forecast for exceptional costs of  9 8m which included the costs of the fundraising   costs of  3 3m were set off against the proceeds raised 
EBITDA to operating cash conversion  pre exceptionals  was 92 7  for the year and the company expects this to be 90 95  in the future 
The company announced a dividend of 2 99p for FY19   12 8  y o y 

Divisional revenue performance substantially in line
The group saw strong growth in its three main focus areas of Identity  Location and Fraud  which combined made up 79  of group revenues in FY19  Customer numbers grew from more than 17 000 to over 19 000 during the year  of which c 900 would have come from the acquisitions  assuming no customers in common   the remaining 1 100 were new customers to the group 
The largest business line  Identity  grew 37  on a reported basis and 13  on an organic  constant currency  cc  basis  after adjusting for the perpetual licence signed in FY18  Acquisitions contributed revenue of  12 0m  VIX Verify s contribution and a month and half contribution from IDology   New customer wins include fintechs  Revolut  Coinbase  and on demand businesses  Deliveroo  that are expanding at pace but need support with KYC processes as they sign up new customers  This is particularly true of Revolut  which has been in the press as a result of problems with its compliance procedures 
The Location business grew 17  on a reported basis  with 14  organic cc growth and a  1 4m contribution from acquisitions  the full year effect of PCA  which was acquired in May 2017   New customers in the year included Kohls  eBay  NASDAQ EBAY   Sephora  N26 and HelloFresh 
The Fraud business  which includes Trace   Investigate  grew 14  on a reported and organic basis  with 17  organic cc growth  This business is more focused on Asia Pacific  but it also signed Discover Financial Services  NYSE DFS   its first US customer  during the year 
The two other businesses are UK focused and saw similar performance to the prior year  Employ   Comply grew 3  in FY19 after similar growth in FY18  Engage continued to decline  down 8  after a decline of 3  in FY18 and 16  in FY17 
The Fraud  Risk   Compliance division reported adjusted operating profit of  20 4m   28  y o y  and a margin of 23 3   30bp higher than in FY18 but slightly lower than we forecast  The Location   Customer Intelligence division reported adjusted operating profit of  12 6m   10  y o y  and a margin of 22 6   ahead of our forecast and 40bp lower than in FY18  All of the VIX revenue was reported in the Identity business  whereas we had assumed a split between Identity and Location  As the VIX operating margin was lower than the group average  this explains the difference in divisional profitability compared to our forecasts  Combined  group adjusted operating profit was marginally ahead of our forecast 

Acquisition progress
The company is pleased with the performance of both acquisitions made in FY19 
VIX Verify  since being acquired on 23 October 2018  VIX has contributed revenues of  7 67m and operating profit of  1 33m  equating to a margin of 17 4   This compares to a margin of 3 6  for the year to 30 June 2018  highlighting that the company has managed to achieve cost synergies sooner than expected 
IDology  since being acquired on 13 February 2019  IDology has contributed revenues of  4 28m and operating profit of  1 89m  equating to an operating margin of 44 1   This compares to an EBITDA margin of 42 7  for CY18  The integration is performing in line with management s expectations   the integration between GBG s location and identity solutions is going well  and proposals and customer visits are being undertaken on a joint basis where relevant 
When it acquired IDology  GBG arranged a  110m credit facility with a  30m accordion and interest payable at LIBOR plus 1 5   By the end of FY19 it had used  85 4m of this facility  with  54m still available for future acquisitions 
Making good progress with growth strategy
The company targets double digit organic revenue growth and adjusted operating margins of at least 20   It achieved this in FY19 and continues to work towards these targets for FY20 and beyond  GBG needs to achieve organic growth in excess of 10  for the three focus areas to compensate for lower growth in the UK centric businesses  such that the 10   organic growth rate is maintained for the group 
Key areas of strategic focus to drive this growth include 
Maximise growth internationally from the three focus areas  45  of revenues were generated outside of the UK in FY19  up from 34  in FY18  with growth of 56  y o y compared to 1  growth in the UK  A full year of revenues from the IDology acquisition should take international revenues above 50  in FY20 
Optimise growth in specialist UK businesses  we expect Engage revenues to gradually decline and the other two businesses to show mid single digit percentage growth 
Join up GBG with customers at the centre  staff have been recruited across the group to strengthen customer support and accelerate product innovation  The goal is to provide a seamless experience no matter which products customers are using  The company will soon be launching a combined Identity Location solution 
Use M A to enhance capability and reach  acquisitions are considered if they add technology  geographic coverage  additional datasets and or new customers  This was the case for the recent VIX and IDology deals  which have given GBG access to multi national customers in North America and Asia Pacific as well as new datasets and new technology  While short term  the company is focused on integrating recent deals and we expect M A activity to resume in the medium term 
Outlook and changes to forecasts
Trading year to date has been in line with management s expectations  We make minimal changes to our revenue and adjusted operating profit forecasts  We have reduced our net interest cost forecast to reflect the reduction in debt prior to year end and reduced our tax rate assumption from 22  to 21  

Valuation
We compare GBG s financial performance and valuation metrics to the median of four peer groups  averages not used as peers include many loss making companies   GBG s revenue growth is at the top end of the group and its operating profitability is also towards the upper end of peers  On EV and P E multiples  GBG trades more in line with cyber security peers  We believe this premium rating is warranted  considering the group s historic track record of profitable growth and cash generation and its high level of recurring revenues  combined with the opportunity from structural growth in identity data intelligence services 

We also perform a reverse DCF to estimate what growth rates and margins are factored into the share price  Using our explicit forecasts to FY22  a WACC of 8 4  and long term growth of 3   we estimate that revenue growth of 13 8  pa from FY23 to FY28 and EBITDA margins of 24   in line with FY19  are required to support the current share price  We expect management to continue to make accretive acquisitions to boost growth  which should provide further support to the share price ",2019-06-06,Edison,https://www.investing.com/analysis/growth-and-profits-on-track-200428944,200428944

162168,383684,DFS,Discover  DFS  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"The market expects Discover  DFS  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 25  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This credit card issuer and lender is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 00 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  9 9  
Revenues are expected to be  2 75 billion  up 6 7  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 54  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Discover 
For Discover  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 59  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Discover will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Discover would post earnings of  2 09 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 03  delivering a surprise of  2 87  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Discover appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/discover-dfs-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200408391,200408391
162169,383685,DFS,Discover  DFS  Q1 Earnings And Revenues Top Estimates,opinion,"Discover  DFS  came out with quarterly earnings of  2 15 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 per share  This compares to earnings of  1 82 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 7 50   A quarter ago  it was expected that this credit card issuer and lender would post earnings of  2 09 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 03  delivering a surprise of  2 87  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times 
Discover  which belongs to the Zacks Financial   Consumer Loans industry  posted revenues of  2 76 billion for the quarter ended March 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 57   This compares to year ago revenues of  2 58 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Discover shares have added about 30 6  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 16 8  
What s Next for Discover 
While Discover has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Discover was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  2 09 on  2 79 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  8 62 on  11 37 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year

162170,383686,DFS,Credit Acceptance  CACC  Soars To 52 Week High  Time To Cash Out ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Credit Acceptance  CACC   Shares have been on the move with the stock up 8 9  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  509 99 in the previous session  Credit Acceptance has gained 30  since the start of the year compared to the 14 8  move for the Zacks Finance sector and the 29 8  return for the Zacks Financial   Consumer Loans industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on April 29  2019  Credit Acceptance reported EPS of  8 08 versus consensus estimate of  7 93 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 0 55  
For the current fiscal year  Credit Acceptance is expected to post earnings of  33 83 per share on  1 46 billion in revenues  This represents a 15 14  change in EPS on a 13 35  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  37 per share on  1 55 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 9 36  and 6 5   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Credit Acceptance may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Credit Acceptance has a Value Score of C  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are B and A  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of B 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 14 7X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 16 7X versus its peer group s average of 6 4X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 0 92  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Credit Acceptance currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Credit Acceptance fits the bill  Thus  it seems as though Credit Acceptance shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term 
How Does Credit Acceptance Stack Up to the Competition

162171,383687,DFS,Discover  DFS  Is Up 5 24  In One Week  What You Should Know,opinion,"Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock s recent trend  which can be in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   And for investors following this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks  this can be very tough to define  There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance  The Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Discover  DFS   a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of A  We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions  two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Discover currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
Let s discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for DFS that show why this credit card issuer and lender shows promise as a solid momentum pick 
A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short term price activity  as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand  It is also useful to compare a security to its industry  as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area 
For DFS  shares are up 5 24  over the past week while the Zacks Financial   Consumer Loans industry is up 0 61  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 10 45  compares favorably with the industry s 2 52  performance as well 
While any stock can see a spike in price  it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market  Over the past quarter  shares of Discover have risen 17 79   and are up 15 56  in the last year  On the other hand  the S P 500 has only moved 9 4  and 13 29   respectively 
Investors should also pay attention to DFS s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  DFS is currently averaging 1 517 342 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions  in addition to price changes  Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well  A nice path here can help show promise  and we have recently been seeing that with DFS 
Over the past two months  7 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost DFS s consensus estimate  increasing from  8 64 to  8 76 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  5 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 1 downward revision in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Given these factors  it shouldn t be surprising that DFS is a  2  Buy  stock and boasts a Momentum Score of A  If you re looking for a fresh pick that s set to soar in the near term  make sure to keep Discover on your short list ",2019-04-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/discover-dfs-is-up-524-in-one-week-what-you-should-know-200413690,200413690

162217,383733,DFS,DFS Vs  CACC  Which Stock Is The Better Value Option ,opinion,"Investors interested in stocks from the Financial   Consumer Loans sector have probably already heard of Discover  DFS  and Credit Acceptance  CACC   But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors  We ll need to take a closer look to find out 
We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends  while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits 
Both Discover and Credit Acceptance have a Zacks Rank of   2  Buy  right now  This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions  so investors should feel comfortable knowing that these stocks have improving earnings outlooks  But this is only part of the picture for value investors 
Value investors are also interested in a number of tried and true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics  including the popular P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors 
DFS currently has a forward P E ratio of 7 44  while CACC has a forward P E of 13 28  We also note that DFS has a PEG ratio of 0 60  This popular metric is similar to the widely known P E ratio  with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company s expected earnings growth rate  CACC currently has a PEG ratio of 0 77 
Another notable valuation metric for DFS is its P B ratio of 1 87  The P B is a method of comparing a stock s market value to its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  CACC has a P B of 3 72 
Based on these metrics and many more  DFS holds a Value grade of A  while CACC has a Value grade of C 
Both DFS and CACC are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks  but based on these valuation figures  we feel that DFS is the superior value option right now ",2018-12-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/dfs-vs-cacc-which-stock-is-the-better-value-option-200371958,200371958
162218,383734,DFS,Discover  DFS  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"Discover  DFS  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 24  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This credit card issuer and lender is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 09 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  34 8  
Revenues are expected to be  2 81 billion  up 7 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 4  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Discover 
For Discover  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 99  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Discover will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Discover would post earnings of  2 05 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 05  delivering no surprise 
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Discover doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/discover-dfs-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200376714,200376714

162292,383808,DFS,Should Value Investors Pick Discover Financial Services  DFS  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Discover Financial Services   NYSE DFS   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Discover Financial has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 13 1 as you can see below This level compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE ratio for the S P 500 comes in at 21 4  If we focus on the long term trend of the stock the current level puts Discover Financial s current PE among its highs  This suggests that the stock is overvalued compared to its own historical levels Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with its sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 16 8  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Discover Financial has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 12 6   which is faintly lower than the current figure  So it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Discover Financial stock in the near term P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  the company has a P S ratio of about 2 5  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 4x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Discover Financial currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Discover Financial a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the EV EBITDA for Discover Financial is 9 2  a level that is lower than the industry average of 12 3  The EV EBITDA multiple  Enterprise Value  Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization  is capital structure neutral  as it takes into account the level of debt on a company s balance sheet  not just its equity What About the Stock Overall Though Discover Financial might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of C and a Momentum score of C  This gives DFS a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mostly trending upwards  The current year has seen five estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to two lower  while the next year estimate has seen six upward revisions and one downward revisions in the same time period As a result  the current year consensus estimate has increased by 0 7  in the past two months  while the next year estimate has inched higher by 0 9   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Discover Financial Services Price and Consensus   Even though Discover Financial has a better estimates trend  the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   That is why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineThe Finance   Consumer Loans industry is characterized by stiff competition that weighs on the individual companies  financials  The adverse impact of currency fluctuation has also been hurting the industry  Also  the future success of this space is dependent on the companies  ability to adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards  any failure in which might cause major decline in revenues Currently the industry carries a sluggish industry rank  Bottom 23  out of more than 250 industries   which dims the sparkle on Discover Financial stock too  As you can see below  the industry has also widely underperformed the broader market over the past three years Thus  value investors might want to wait for broader factors to favorable before investing in it Zacks Editor in Chief Goes  All In  on This Stock Full disclosure  Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any

162344,383860,DFS,Why I Am Selling The S P 500,opinion,"The S P 500 is very rich and it should be faded as much as possible  The U S  market is richly valued with a Total Stock Market Value to GDP of 132 9   The FED has started to tighten  and with delinquency rates are currently low  lending standards have started to loosen again  Insiders are very cautious and the Baltic Dry Index is not indicating a pending recovery  
The Buffett indicator
Buffett famously proclaimed the total stock market value to GDP ratio as the best  one  indicator of future stock market returns  Currently Total Stock Market Value comes out to 132 9  of GDP which is very high in a historic context  Huge successful startups like Uber  Airbnb and Palantir are not even going public which is a headwind to total stock market value or it would have been even higher 

I picked this particular fundamental value ratio but it s actually hard to find a ratio that doesn t rate the market as expensive  The famous CAPE ratio would have worked just fine and the S P is richly valued judging by mean PE s or price to cash flow ratios as well when put in a historical context  
Bulk shipping
The Baltic Dry Index is a great proxy for dry bulk shipping prices  Prices are a result of available transporting capacity and demand for said capacity  Capacity enters the market through ships delivered and exits the market when vessels are scrapped  Because it takes some time to build ships it is rather obvious when supply is entering the market  It s not as obvious when ships get scrapped as it can happen fast once scrap rates jump  The higher steel prices  the more vessels get scrapped 
Demand is very unpredictable but it is a necessity for emerging markets to get going  Emerging economies require a multiple of commodities to power their infrastructure build outs compared to mature economies  This results in the Baltic Dry Index being an interesting indicator because when rates go up this indicates construction is going to pick up  After the materials arrive  builders get hired and sometimes the resulting infrastructure actually enables additional economic activity after it is finished

Consumer delinquency rates

Consumer delinquency rates are currently just very  very low  It is almost reminiscent of 2007 and it looks like  may be at work once more  Gresham law states   bad money drives out good money   I pulled a large number of consumer credit offers through  and low and behold  SoFi is offering the best rates in a number of categories  SoFi happens to be a private venture backed lender in the hot fintech space taking a spread that s a fraction of what more traditional financiers like Discover Financial Services  NYSE NYSE DFS  take 
SoFi isn t just winning in one category but besting others offers in poor credit  good credit  small loans and large loans  I m quoting SoFi here  emphasis mine  
 We look behind just credit scores and debt to income ratios to consider factors like estimated cashflow  career and education  So while other leaders charge higher rates to account for the possibility that borrowers won t pay back their loans  our unique underwriting process helps ensure our members have a high likelihood of making their payments  
Other leaders charge higher rates but we don t because of our unique underwriting process 
I m predicting these will turn out to be some famous last words  Credit scores and debt to income ratios aren t just old fashioned  They are time tested predictive attributes  I m betting Fintechs aren t going to do better issuing credit based on number of friends on Facebook  NASDAQ NASDAQ FB   I really do have faith in big data and credit distributed through the internet but before we get to a healthy market we ll see some real trainwrecks among venture backed finance startups  
Insider Buying
Everyone knows how important it is to watch insider buying at the company level  But it is also indicative of future returns when applied to the aggregate  Insiders  as a whole  are usually net sellers  They often take part of their salary through shares or options to incentivize them to make the company a success  Gurufocus keeps a running count of the aggregate buy sell ratio  At this time we are at 0 3 which is significantly below the historical average of 0 4  Insiders are bearish and they have been so for a couple of quarters 

Summary
Fundamental value ratios show the S P 500 sports elevated ratios  There seems to be no impending boom in the world economy when judged by the Dry Bulk Index  Delinquency rates are very low which may have spurred undisciplined lending  Insiders are net sellers and more so than usual  I believe these are several important and uncorrelated signals it is prudent to decrease exposure to the S P 500 ",2017-06-22,Bram de Haas,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-i'm-selling-the-s-p-500-200196837,200196837

162419,383935,DFS,Wells Fargo  WFC  Ordered To Pay  4 Million For Illegal Student Loan Practices,opinion,"On Monday  financial services stalwart Wells Fargo   Co    NYSE WFC   has been ordered to pay  4 million to settle accusations that it engaged in illegal student loan practices like charging illegal fees  misrepresenting payments  and not updating inaccurate credit report data 
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau  CFPB  said that Wells Fargo would illegally charge consumers late fees if they made payments on the last day of their grace periods  The bank would also charge those who chose to pay through multiple partial payments  CFPB pointed out that Wells Fargo failed to correct negative  inaccurate information to credit reporting companies on these same kind of borrowers 
 Wells Fargo hit borrowers with illegal fees and deprived others of critical information needed to effectively manage their student loan accounts   said CFPB Director Richard Cordray  in a statement   Consumers should be able to rely on their servicer to process and credit payments correctly and to provide accurate and timely information  
As a result  Wells Fargo will pay a total of  4 million  including a  3 6 million penalty fee to the bureau and  410 000 to its borrowers 
CFPB said that it found over 8 million U S  borrowers are in default on more than  110 billion in student loans  and the bureau argued that breakdowns in student loan servicing may be part of the problem 
According to Reuters  CFPB said that  the bank processed payments in a way that made consumers pay more fees  If a borrower s payment was not enough to cover the total amount due for all loans in an account  the bank divided that payment among the loans in a way that maximized late fees rather than satisfying payments for some of the loans  
Wells Fargo  along with Sallie Mae and Discover Financial Services   NYSE DFS    is one of the few big financial companies that offer student loans  Citibank   NYSE C    JPMorgan Chase   NYSE JPM    and others left the student loan business after the federal government swept up most of the market in order to expand its direct lending offers to students

	Net interest income grew almost 7  year over year to  1 7 billion due to loan growth and higher net interest margin

Segment Update   Direct Banking Segment

162463,383979,DFS,Top Trade Ideas For The Week  DFS,opinion,"Here is your Bonus Idea with links to the full Top Ten 
Discover Financial Services  NYSE DFS  peaked at the end of 2014  It started a long move lower in 2015  fast at first and then saw a consolidation before another dip  In November 2015 it started to accelerate down again  finding a bottom with the market February 2016  At that point momentum had reached the early 2015 lows as well 
But then things started looking up  The stock started higher in a steady trend  It hit the 200 day SMA in April  just over a 38 2  retracement of the downward leg  and stopped  But not for long  A gap higher quickly found the 61 8  retracement of the downward leg and then it was knocked back 
This created a bull flag  The price broke the flag to the upside as 3 thing s happened  The RSI turned back higher  holding in the bullish range  The MACD crossed up while holding in positive territory  The 50 day SMA crossed up through the 200 day SMA in a Golden Cross 
This gives an upside target to 68 78 in late July using an AB CD pattern to measure  This would gain further significance if the price can get above the next level of resistance at 57 61  point B  There is resistance above that at 59 75 and 60 30 followed by 63 10 and 64 40 before 65 50 and 66 75  Support lower comes at 55 and 53 50 followed by 52 50  Short interest low at 1 5  and the company is expected to report earnings next July 20th 
Checking the options chains  this week sees the biggest open interest at 57  just overhead  June monthly options are biggest at 57 50 on the Call side  and July monthly sees a change with open interest below on both the Call and Put Side  Puts are large at 47 5 and 45  while Calls are big at 52 50  The closest contract after the earnings report is currently the October monthly  The Call open interest exceeds the Put side and is centered on 57 5 
Discover Financial Services  NYSE DFS 

Trade Idea 1  Buy the stock on a move over 57 60 with a stop at 55 
Trade Idea 2  Buy the stock and add a July 8 Expiry 56 5 53 5 Put Spread   1 00  and sell a October 62 5 Call  70 cents   A cost of 30 cents for the collar 
Trade Idea 3  Buy the July 57 5 Calls   1 20  
Trade Idea 4  Buy the June July 57 5 Call Calendar  70 cents  
Trade Idea 5  Buy the June July 57 5 Call Calendar and sell the July 52 5 Puts  30 cents  
Trade Idea 1 is a straight stock buy with a stop to protect the downside  while Trade Idea 2 adds a Put Spread to profit for the first bit of downside in exchange for capping the upside at 62 5 in October  Trade Idea 3 limits your risk to  1 25 for the upside until July Expiry  and Trade Idea 4 funds that by selling the shorter dated Calls at the Strike with the biggest open interest  looking for it to hold the stock back in June  Trade Idea 5 then adds leverage by selling the 52 5 Put  a level where the gap would fill in the chart 
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad  picture reviewed Friday which as the markets head into the Memorial Day Weekend and the unofficial start of Summer  sees equities are looking strong  but not quite free of caution 
Elsewhere look for gold to continue lower while Crude Oil continues to the upside  The US Dollar Index looks to improve while US Treasuries continue to consolidate  The Shanghai Composite is also in consolidation mode but with a downward bias while Emerging Markets are biased to the upside in the short term 
Volatility looks to remain subdued keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETF s SPY  NYSE SPY   iShares Russell 2000  NYSE IWM  and PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1  NASDAQ QQQ   Their charts also suggest more upside  and are stronger looking on the weekly timeframe  with rising pennants on the daily timeframe giving minor caution of a short term pullback or consolidation  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

162482,383998,DFS,Discovering Trade Ideas For Discover Earnings,opinion,"I suspect that only a few of you will remember back to the days when Sears Holdings Corporation  NASDAQ SHLD  was where you went on the weekend to get everything  And I mean everything  They did oil changes and new tires for your car  They had all the tools you could want  The store was packed with clothes and toys and home goods  Everyone went there  They also had an innovative idea to start their own credit card in the mid 1980 s 
Fast forward 30 years and hedge fund titan Eddie Lampert is trying to prop up Sears as a real estate investment  because that is all that is left that has any value  And that credit card company  Discover Financial Services  NYSE DFS  is a  21 billion company  12 times bigger than Sears  And they are reporting their latest earnings tonight 
The stock saw a move lower last summer but then a bounce to near 58 in November  From there it fell back to 43 in mid February  The price action since then has been nothing but stellar  Retracing 61 8  of the move lower  it is up 22  since that February low  And the chart looks healthy 
The last month the price crossed the 20 day SMA and has been riding it higher  The RSI is bullish an rising with a MACD that is positive  if starting to level  But both support more upside  The 200 day SMA overhead gives a slight pause  but for an event driven thing like an earnings report there can be a gap right through it  And speaking of gaps  the stock has moved and average of 4 28  the last 6 times it reported earnings  That is a move of  2 25 at current prices and gives an expected range of 50 15 to 54 70 
The April 22 Expiry options chain suggest a smaller  1 80 move this week by Friday  with implied volatility  IV  at 45   above the longer run IV at 22  in May  Most of the open interest in the weekly options is below the current price with the biggest at the 50 5 Strike
