hopefully you guys have found our communications very good  And there is a ton of information in the script and everything that goes into this and they ve done a fantastic job  So  I want to thank them for their 10 years Back to business Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us again this quarter  Yesterday  we reported net earnings of  51 3 million for the fourth quarter of 2019  compared with  50 4 million for the third quarter of 2019 and  43 2 million for the year ago quarter  Earnings per share were  0 37 for the fourth quarter  compared with  0 36 for the third quarter and  0 31 for the year ago quarter  The fourth quarter of 2019 represented our 171st consecutive quarter of profitability and our 121st consecutive quarter of paying a cash dividend to shareholders I also want to mention that yesterday Forbes came out with the ranking in terms of financial performance of the 100 largest banks in the United States and CVBF was rated Number 1  This is the second time in five years  we ve been rated Number 1 and it is a good way for me to go out  so to speak Net earnings were  207 8 million for the year ended 2019  compared with  152 million for 2018 and  104 4 million for 2017  We have essentially doubled our earnings over the past two fiscal years  Diluted earnings per share were  1 48 for 2019  compared with  1 24 for 2018 and  0 95 for 2017  Our tax equivalent net interest margin was 4 24  for the fourth quarter  compared with 4 34  for the third quarter of 2019 and 4 40  for the year ago quarter Total loans increased by  70 1 million for the fourth quarter or about 1  to  7 56 billion  The increase was primarily due to a  72 5 million increase in dairy   livestock and agricultural loans  Average loans for the quarter were essentially flat from the prior quarter  The majority of the increase in dairy   livestock loans was seasonal and occurred near the end of the quarter as many of our dairy owners choose to defer their milk checks into the first quarter of the following year and or prepay their feed expenses Loan yields were 5 15  for the fourth quarter of 2019  compared with 5 23  for the third quarter of 2019 and 5 22  for the year ago quarter  Excluding interest income related to purchase discount accretion and non accrual interest paid  loan yields were 5 basis points lower than the third quarter of 2019  This decline was primarily due to the impact of the Federal Reserve s three rate decreases  After excluding interest income related to purchase discount accretion and non accrual interest paid  our loan yields actually increased by 3 basis points over the fourth quarter of 2018 At December 31  2019  the allowance for loan and lease losses was  68 7 million or 0 91  of total loans  compared with  68 7 million or 0 92  of total loans at September 30  2019  The allowance for loans losses  as a percentage of non acquired loans  was 1 30  at December 31  2019  compared with 1 37  at September 30  2019 and 1 32  at the end of 2018  At quarter end  non performing assets  defined as non accrual loans plus other real estate owned  were  10 2 million  compared with  16 1 million for the prior quarter and  20 4 million at December 31  2018 Total non performing assets included  5 8 million in non performing loans and OREO originated by Community Bank  At December 31  2019  we had loans delinquent 30 to 89 days of  1 7 million or 0 02   Classified loans for the fourth quarter were  73 4 million  a  13 4 million increase from the prior quarter  The increase was primarily due to a  7 million increase in dairy   livestock loans and a  5 5 million increase in commercial real estate loans  Total classified loans included  27 million of loans acquired from Community Bank  We will have more detailed information on classified loans available in our year end Form 10 K Now  I d like to discuss deposits  Average non interest bearing deposits were  5 30 billion for the fourth quarter of 2019  compared with  5 23 billion for the prior quarter and  5 31 billion for the year ago quarter  At December 31  2019  our non interest bearing deposits totaled  5 25 billion  compared with  5 39 billion for the prior quarter and  5 20 billion for the year ago quarter  Non interest bearing deposits were 60 3  of total deposits at the end of the fourth quarter  compared with 61 2  for the prior quarter and 59  for the year ago quarter Our average total deposits and customer repurchase agreements of  9 21 billion for the fourth quarter  grew by  109 million or 1 2  from the third quarter  At December 31  2019  our total deposits and customer repurchase agreements were  9 13 billion  compared with  9 20 billion at September 30  2019  and  9 27 billion for the same period a year ago  Our cost of deposits and customer repurchase agreements for the fourth quarter were 21 basis points and our total cost of funds were 22 basis points  both slightly down from the prior quarter Interest income  Interest income for the fourth quarter of 2019 totaled  112 2 million  compared with  113 6 million for the third quarter and  117 7 million for the same period a year ago  The decrease in interest income from the third quarter of 2019 was primarily due to  474 000 in lower discount accretion on acquired loans and non accrual interest paid  We also experienced an additional 5 basis point decline in loan yields  The decline in loan yields was primarily due to the three Federal Reserve rate decreases during the third and fourth quarter  A  5 5 million year over year quarterly decrease in interest income was the result of  160 million in lower average earning assets and a decrease in yield on earning assets of 14 basis points The fourth quarter of 2019 reflected a  1 7 million decrease in loan discount accretion and non accrual interest paid over the fourth quarter of 2018  The tax equivalent yield on earning assets for the fourth quarter was 4 44   compared with 4 55  for the prior quarter and 4 58  for the year ago quarter  When loan discount accretion and non accrual interest paid are excluded  the tax equivalent yield on earning assets for the fourth quarter decreased by 10 basis points  compared to the prior quarter  and decreased by 8 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 Interest expense  Interest expense for the fourth quarter of 2019 totaled  5 2 million  a  200 000 decrease over the third quarter and a  500 000 increase over the fourth quarter of 2018  Average interest bearing liabilities increased by  31 million compared with the third quarter  while the cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased by 3 basis points  A  500 000 increase in interest expense from the fourth quarter of 2018 can be attributed to a 12 basis point increase in the cost of interest bearing deposits Net interest margin  Our tax equivalent net interest margin was 4 24  for the fourth quarter of 2019  compared with 4 34  for the third quarter  When the impact of discount accretion on acquired loans and non accrual interest paid is excluded  the adjusted tax equivalent net interest margin was 3 95  for the fourth quarter  down from 4 02  for the prior quarter Non interest income  Non interest income was  12 6 million for the fourth quarter of 2019  compared with  11 9 million for the prior quarter and  10 8 million for the year ago quarter  The  746 000 increase from the third quarter includes a  293 000 increase in fees from interest rate swaps  Non interest income grew by  1 9 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2018  Fee income from trust and investment services grew by  525 000  bank service charges increased by  332 000  international services fee income grew by approximately  175 000 and interest rate swap fees increased by  671 000  Conversely  fourth quarter 2019 debit card interchange income declined by approximately  300 000 from the fourth quarter of 2018  due to the Durbin Amendment and us reaching the  10 billion mark in assets Now  expenses  Non interest expense for the fourth quarter was  49 1 million  compared with  47 5 million for the third quarter of 2019 and  60 8 million for the year ago quarter  Salary and benefit expense grew by  1 1 million compared to the third quarter  of which there was a  430 000 increase in bonus and profit sharing expense  The  11 8 million decrease in expense for the fourth quarter of 2019 includes an  8 million decrease in acquisition expense related to the Community Bank merger and a  2 1 million decrease in occupancy and expense from the consolidation of 10 banking offices  Non interest expense totaled 1 71  of average assets for the fourth quarter  compared with 1 68  for the third quarter and 2 10  for the fourth quarter of 2018  Our efficiency ratio was 41  for the fourth quarter of 2019  compared with 39 6  for the prior quarter and 49 2  for the fourth quarter of 2018 Now  I d like to turn the call over to Allen  our CFO  to discuss our effective tax rate  investment portfolio and overall capital position  Allen E  Allen Nicholson    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Chris  Good morning everyone  Our effective tax rate was 27 4  for the fourth quarter and 28 6  for the full year  This compares to 28  for the fourth quarter of 2018 and the full year 2018  The slight increase from the prior year was due to the greater relative increase in taxable income compared with the level of tax advantaged income Looking to our investment portfolio  at December 31  2019  our combined available for sale and held to maturity investment securities totaled  2 4 billion  a  140 million increase from the third quarter and a  64 million decrease from December 31  2018  At quarter end  investment securities available for sale totaled  1 74 billion  The portfolio had a pre tax unrealized gain of  22 million at December 31  2019  In addition  we owned held to maturity investment securities totaling  674 million The tax equivalent yield on the total securities portfolio was 2 43  for the fourth quarter  compared with 2 47  for the third quarter and 2 55  for the fourth quarter of 2018  During the fourth quarter  we purchased  272 million of mortgage backed securities with an average expected yield of approximately 2 52  Now  turning to our capital position  Shareholders  equity increased by  142 9 million to  1 99 billion at the end of 2019  The increase was primarily due to  207 8 million in net earnings and a  31 million increase in other comprehensive income from the tax effected impact of the increase in market value of available for sale securities  Partially offsetting these increases to equity were  101 million in cash dividends And I ll now turn the call back to Chris for some closing remarks Christopher D  Myers    President and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Allen  Now let s talk about economic conditions Turning to the California economy  according to various economic reports  California s unemployment rate was 3 9  for November 2019  3 9  in October  2019  and 4 1  a year ago in November 2018  The California GDP grew by 2 6  in 2019  California s GDP growth is expected to outpace the U S  GDP growth for 2020  Approximately 40  of California s job growth over the past year was concentrated in two sectors  healthcare and social assistance  and leisure and hospitality  Overall  the outlook for California s economy remains bright for 2020 as job gains have continued on a sustained basis and two job sectors are likely to grow faster than those in the rest of the nation  logistics  which is propelled by the giant Southern California ports  and technology In terms of the dairy industry  milk prices are predicted to be somewhat higher in 2020  due to the strong economy and an increased demand for non fat dry milk exports  In closing  we are proud of our accomplishments and record earnings for 2019 and believe we are well positioned for future efficiency and growth  We remain committed to growing the bank in a balanced way  utilizing all three of our growth initiatives  same store sales  opening de novo centers and acquisitions Today

that concludes today s presentation  Now  Allen and I will be happy to take any questions that you might have Questions and Answers OperatorThank you  We will now begin the question and answer session  Operator Instructions And our first question will come from Jackie Bohlen of KBW  Please go ahead Jackie Bohlen    KBW    AnalystHi  Good morning  everyone Christopher D  Myers    President and Chief Executive OfficerHi  Jackie Jackie Bohlen    KBW    AnalystI wanted to touch base first on the decline in OREO that you had in the quarter  I know in the past we talked about the larger single family residents that was added in the third quarter  And I m wondering if that was sold during the quarter and that did that drop Christopher D  Myers    President and Chief Executive OfficerYes  we actually    that OREO  the largest single family resident was actually a Community Bank loan and it was secured by two pieces of property that are adjacent to each other  So  what we ended up doing is keeping the land piece of the property  which is marked at  1 8 million  and then we gave back the residents to the initial first trust deed holder  And so  that was the reduction in the OREO  So  we still hold the land and it s marked at  1 8 million  And we feel    at this point in time  we feel confident that we will get our money back and hopefully a little more Jackie Bohlen    KBW    AnalystOkay  So  there was no associated OREO gain or anything that was noticable with the transfer that took place Christopher D  Myers    President and Chief Executive OfficerNot on that piece  No Jackie Bohlen    KBW    AnalystOkay  And then  just looking at the provision expense in general  charge offs haven t fluctuated much throughout the year and it s been de minimis charge offs or de minimis recoveries  And there has been a positive expense associated with that  but then  you had a zero expense in the fourth quarter  Just wondering how you re thinking about that going forward  understanding  of course  that we re in a CECL world starting now basically Christopher D  Myers    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  that s a good question  We ve had net recoveries for the last five or six years in a row  Now  the good news is that over that period of time for the most part  gross charge offs have trended down  Actually gross charge offs were a little bit up year over year in 2019 from  18  but our recoveries still exceeded the gross charge offs  Both of them were around  0 5 million  I think  I think net recoveries were about  500 000 and gross charge offs were about  450 000 or  460 000  somewhere in there  So  as we re going into 2020  I do think that s going to start reversing itself  We actually will have a net charge off that is not a negative number  or if you don t  I mean  we ll have a real net charge off as we go forward  But credit is running very well for us right now  If you look at our 30 to 89 days past due  I think was  1 7 million or something low like that  I mean  that sounds a lot for  7 5 billion of loans  So  we feel good about it  but credit is not perfect and we are seeing a little choppiness  If you look at our classified loans  they are up quarter over quarter and some of that s due to dairy  in particular one dairy  and then some of that s due to commercial real estate  which was a former Community Bank loan  but we re not seeing a lot of loss content potential in that classified loan pool at least at this time So  the good news is those classified loans that are performing  where    I mean we re not marketing  but we re reserving for  So  we re feeling good about where we stand right now  but I do think  Jackie  that credit is starting to slowly inch  I mean  it can t get better  right  Where is it going to go  So  it s going to get a little worse and we re starting to see just very small signs of that  but nothing major Jackie Bohlen    KBW    AnalystOkay  And do you have any guidance on when you might provide any sort of an update on CECL s impact Christopher D  Myers    President and Chief Executive OfficerI m going to let Alan answer that question E  Allen Nicholson    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerHey Jackie  At this point  our day one adjustment equity proceed is always expected to be immaterial  but we will provide a lot more information  obviously  in our 10 K Jackie Bohlen    KBW    AnalystOkay  great  Thank you  I ll step back now  And congratulations on everything  Chris Christopher D  Myers    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Thanks so much  Jackie  when it comes to CECL  I m sure  Allen will like me saying this  it is that we ve got to go through that process  but I think that Chris Myers has just set the loan loss reserve and we should go on from there  But they don t let me do that E  Allen Nicholson    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerChris will join the FASB Board  when he s retiring Jackie Bohlen    KBW    AnalystThank you Operator Operator Instructions And our next question will come from Aaron Deer of Sandler O Neill   Partners  Please go ahead Aaron Deer    Sandler O Neill   Partners LP    AnalystHey  good morning everyone Christopher D  Myers    President and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  Aaron Aaron Deer    Sandler O Neill   Partners LP    AnalystJust come to maybe at the exact amount of discount accretion in the quarter  if you have that handy E  Allen Nicholson    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  Aaron  it was  6 5 million Aaron Deer    Sandler O Neill   Partners LP    AnalystOkay  And what is the remaining on accretive discount that you had at year end E  Allen Nicholson    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThe total remaining discount  I think is about  30 million Aaron Deer    Sandler O Neill   Partners LP    AnalystOkay  And the accelerated restricted stock expense  is that running at about the same level and should that end after this quarter E  Allen Nicholson    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  This quarter was very similar to last quarter  And as it relates to particularly to Chris s situation  that it will decline a bit into the third quarter  However  obviously  we will have a new CEO  So  we ll probably have some additional stock issued for that person Aaron Deer    Sandler O Neill   Partners LP    AnalystOkay  And then  it looked like there was small amount of share repurchases  What are your thoughts on that front  at this point Christopher D  Myers    President and Chief Executive OfficerWell  we have a 10b5 1 plan in place  And so  that is kind of like an automatic thing at a certain level and it kicked in during the quarter  I think the average price that we bought stock  it wasn t a lot of stock  but it was at somewhere about 45 000 shares    about 45 000 shares away in October Phonetic  and it was  I think  in the high  19s   19 99 or  20 or something like that  So  really amazing Phonetic  Aaron Deer    Sandler O Neill   Partners LP    AnalystOkay  So  it really depends on where that threshold is  that s going to trigger that Christopher D  Myers    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah and we don t disclose that threshold Aaron Deer    Sandler O Neill   Partners LP    AnalystAll right  Okay  And then     was there any FDIC assessment credit utilized in the quarter E  Allen Nicholson    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYes  there was  It was  750 000 and we have remaining  1 5 million Aaron Deer    Sandler O Neill   Partners LP    AnalystOkay  all right  That is  are all my questions  And Chris  congratulations again on your retirement and hopefully we ll get a chance to see again before you ride off into the sunset  So  take care  Thanks so much Christopher D  Myers    President and Chief Executive OfficerThanks Aaron E  Allen Nicholson    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThanks Aaron OperatorOur next question will come from Gary Tenner of D A  Davidson  Please go ahead Jackson    D A  Davidson    AnalystHey  good morning  everyone  This is Jackson on Phonetic  for Gary Tenner E  Allen Nicholson    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerHey  Gary Phonetic  Jackson    D A  Davidson    AnalystSo  thinking about NIM  does the core loan yields for the quarter capture the majority of loan repricing from the most recent rate cuts and moves in LIBOR or is there another quarter or more of repricing still to come Christopher D  Myers    President and Chief Executive OfficerCan you repeat the question  We didn t hear you very well Jackson    D A  Davidson    AnalystYeah  yeah  of course  Just thinking about NIM  does the core loan yield for the quarter capture the majority of loan repricing from the most recent rate cuts and moves in LIBOR or is there another quarter or more of repricing still to come E  Allen Nicholson    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerNo  I mean  in terms of the actions by the Fed  in terms of prime and LIBOR  I think the quarter had most of that reflected Jackson    D A  Davidson    AnalystOkay  Okay  great  And just referring to loan growth  it seems that s been a challenge for some time  With the backdrop of a slowing sector growth  where do you project loan growth for 2020 Christopher D  Myers    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  some of this recycling of our    through our acquisition    is really I d say  95  done  So  if you looked at the fourth quarter  loans are really flat  we re down  I think  if you take out the dairy  we re down about  3 million or something like that  So  loans were flat quarter over quarter  We have positive loan growth budgeted in for 2020 for the bank  I think that loan growth    the goal is certainly mid single digits  And if we could do a little better than that  it d be great  But that s kind of where we are right now in terms of what we re trying to achieve and what we think is realistic  given the economy  and given the pricing competition  I ve been a little bit surprised at some of the banks and the margin that they re willing to take on some of these loans and we re very much relationship bank oriented  So  if we don t have a good deposit relation so forth  we re not going to give them the A pricing that we might give those clients that do have a lot of deposits with us  And I think that s the right way to run your business because the funding aspect is still credit growth Jackson    D A  Davidson    AnalystOkay  Okay  Wonderful  Thank you for answering that  And just to kind of follow up on that  are you guys through the run off of Community Bank loans that have been a headwind for the net loan growth in recent quarters Christopher D  Myers    President and Chief Executive OfficerYes  Well  you know what  we still have    again  there s still a lot of pricing repressure because of the flat yield curve  So  we still are having to retain a lot of loans  but those are both Community Bank and Citizens Business Bank loans  just normal competition  But yeah  we re through kind of the    I think we re through the acquisition stages  We re all one team now  I mean  I m not even thinking and I think our team is not even thinking  whether if somebody was an ex Community employee or Citizens  we re all one  So  and I think that s pretty true And as I said before  95  plus true on the financial side as well Jackson    D A  Davidson    AnalystWonderful  Appreciate it  Thank you very much Operator Operator Instructions  And our next question will come from Tim Coffey of Janney  Please go ahead Tim Coffey    Janney    AnalystThank you  Good morning  gentlemen Christopher D  Myers    President and Chief Executive OfficerHey  Tim Tim Coffey    Janney    AnalystChris  I just had a question about the competition for your deposit customers  You ve done a great job building this and maintain the strong deposit portfolio  but you are surrounded by a lot of competitors that are willing to weigh fees on the deposits to retain those customers or attract them  So  I m wondering have you seen the pressure from the competition on the deposit side intensify or has it been kind of a steady state Christopher D  Myers    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  It s interesting because if you asked me that question six months ago or maybe eight months ago  I d say  yeah  it s pretty intense and we re really having to make decision by decision  That deposit pricing pressure has moderated tremendously with the three Fed funds rate drops  So  right now  we feel confident that we can grow deposits in 2020 and with the same kind of ratios that we re showing right now  that 60 ish non interest bearing deposits and that s our goal  It s that kind of mid single digit  maybe a little bit better growth for deposits as well  and then  the same ratio of non interest bearing to interest bearing So  actually it s moderated  We re feeling really good on the deposit side  And we have a great mousetrap here  we built here  We provide a lot of technology to our clients and a lot of individual personal support from our service team  who does a fabulous job  One of the things I want to remind all of you is the average checking account balance in Citizens Business Bank checking account  right now  at least last month was over  140 000 per account  So  think about the extra service we can provide to each client with that kind of scale  if you will  And I think that s a real benefit to our clients that we re not there dealing with the masses  We re not a retail consumer bank  We re business bank that banks the principles and key executives of the companies that we provide financing for  and provide deposit services for  So  small  to medium sized businesses  the business owners and principles  that s what we do Tim Coffey    Janney    AnalystAll right  thanks  There is no other question OperatorOur next question is a follow up from Jackie Bohlen of KBW  Please go ahead Jackie Bohlen    KBW    AnalystHi  thanks for letting me back in queue  Just a quick question on the tax rate  Allen  I understand  there were some moving points surrounding compensation in the quarter and stock vesting and all that  Do you expect a normalized rate outside of that activity in 2020  get back to historic norms E  Allen Nicholson    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerI m sorry  Were you asking about our tax rate Jackie Bohlen    KBW    AnalystYeah  That is the tax rate in the quarter  I m assuming  that was impacted by stock vesting and stuff that caused a positive benefit in the quarter  So  I m wondering it will go back to the regular level in 2020  absent more of that activity E  Allen Nicholson    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  I think our full year tax vector rate of 28 6  is really reflective of run rate Jackie Bohlen    KBW    AnalystOkay  And then  just one other one  Christopher D  Myers    President and Chief Executive OfficerHey Jackie  a lot of the year  we were running at 29   and then  in the fourth quarter  we were able to balance that out to what we think now is the run rate  which is 28 6   So  that 28 6  is our best judgment for 2020  but it could go up to 29   I think that s kind of where we peak  right E  Allen Nicholson    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  I mean it will range from 29  to 28 5  Christopher D  Myers    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah Jackie Bohlen    KBW    AnalystOkay  Okay  that s helpful  Thank you  And then  just if you had     as we sit less than two months from your retirement  Chris  if you had any update on how the search for your replacement is going  And when we might hear an announcement about that Christopher D  Myers    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I think the Board is doing a very thoughtful and thorough job of looking exactly for the right person to lead this company or right persons  In that regard  there has been an extensive process to go out there and look for that across the United States  And I think that it s narrowing down  I think we re getting closer  but I have nothing to announce for you guys at this time Jackie Bohlen    KBW    AnalystOkay  All
