TOKYO  Reuters    Global stocks extended their recovery on Thursday  cheered by record closes in Wall Street benchmarks following encouraging economic data  and after China announced a cut in tariffs on some imported goods from the United States

China said on Thursday it will halve tariffs on some U S  goods  which could help improve negotiating conditions for a second phase of trade deal after the two countries signed off on a interim deal last month 
 Under the phase 1 deal  China has to meet a tough target to increase U S  import by  100 billion this year  so a measure like this was necessary and expected   said Tomo o Kinoshita  global market strategist at Invesco Asset Management 
 But at the same time  that they did this now points to their desire to support Chinese companies as the coronavirus epidemic will obviously deal a huge blow to China s growth   he added

Traders also cited vague rumors of a possible vaccine or a drug breakthrough for the coronavirus as a trigger for Wednesday s stock rally  although they said such catalysts were likely to simply be an excuse for short covering 
The World Health Organization also played down media reports on Wednesday of  breakthrough  drugs being discovered to treat those infected with the virus 
Another 73 people on the Chinese mainland died on Wednesday from the virus  the highest daily increase so far  bringing the total death toll to 563  the country s health authority said on Thursday

181923,403439,ADP,U S  weekly jobless claims drop to nine month low,news,"WASHINGTON  Feb 6  Reuters    The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits dropped to a nine month low last week  suggesting a tightening labor market would continue to support the economy this year 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits decreased 15 000 to a seasonally adjusted 202 000 for the week ended Feb  1  the lowest reading since last April  the Labor Department said on Thursday  Claims data for the prior week was revised to show 1 000 more applications received than previously reported 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims dipping to 215 000 in the latest week  The Labor Department said only claims for Alabama and Pennsylvania were estimated last week 
The four week moving average of initial claims  considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week to week volatility  fell 3 000 to 211 750 last week  also the lowest level since last April 
The claims data has no bearing on January s employment report  which is scheduled for release on Friday  as it falls outside the survey period  Claims were lower in January relative to December  suggesting a pick up in job growth 
According to a Reuters survey of economists  nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 160 000 jobs in January after rising 145 000 in December  Employment gains could  however  exceed expectations given unseasonably mild weather  which could have boosted hiring at construction sites and in the leisure and hospitality industry 
The ADP  NASDAQ ADP  National Employment report on Wednesday showed private payrolls surged by 291 000 jobs in January  the most since May 2015  after increasing 199 000 in December 
Still  the labor market is cooling even as jobless claims are trending lower and this is likely to be confirmed when the Labor Department publishes its annual benchmark revisions to payrolls data on Friday 
The government last August estimated the economy created 501 000 fewer jobs in the 12 months through March 2019 than previously reported  the biggest downward revision in the level of employment in a decade  That suggests job growth over that period averaged around 170 000 per month instead of 210 000 
Economists say the size of the estimated revision suggests that payrolls data from April 2019 through March this year could also be revised lower 
But the pace of job gains is more than the 100 000 per month needed to keep up with growth in the working age population  The unemployment rate is forecast unchanged at 3 5  in January 
Thursday s claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid increased 48 000 to 1 75 million for the week ended Jan  25  The four week moving average of the so called continuing claims fell 13 250 to 1 74 million ",2020-02-06,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economic-indicators/us-weekly-jobless-claims-drop-to-ninemonth-low-2077885,2077885

Thursday showed worker productivity rebounding in the fourth quarter  the trend remained sluggish  indicating that the economy will probably remain on a moderate growth path  Lackluster productivity is squeezing corporate profits  Economists say this could make businesses  which have already cut back on capital expenditures  cautious about hiring    Compression of profit margins usually precedes

rate of 1 3  from 2007 to 2019  below its long term rate of 2 1  from 1947 to 2019  indicating that the speed at which the economy can grow over a long period without igniting inflation has slowed  Economist estimate the economy s growth potential at 1 8    A lot of an economy s productivity gains are dependent on investment spending and it is a concern that businesses are making fewer capital expenditures to prepare for growth later this year and beyond   said Chris Rupkey  chief economist at MUFG in New York  Despite the low level of jobless claims  there are some warning signs flashing for the labor market  Job cuts announced by U S  based employers jumped 106  to an 11 month high of 67 735 in January  global outplacement firm Challenger  Gray   Christmas said in another report on Thursday  The surge in layoffs was led by technology companies  with 13 869 planned job cuts  There were also redundancies in the retail sector last month  many because of bankruptcies and store

181963,403479,ADP,Companies in U S  Add Most Workers Since May 2015  ADP Says,news," Bloomberg     Companies in the U S  ramped up hiring at the start of the year  taking on the most workers since May 2015 and indicating the labor market remains robust  a report on private payrolls showed Wednesday 
Employment at businesses increased by 291 000 in January after a revised 199 000 gain in the previous month  according to data from the ADP  NASDAQ ADP  Research Institute  The surge in hiring  which partly reflected the benefits of warmer weather  exceeded all economists  forecasts in a Bloomberg survey that called for a 157 000 gain  The dollar strengthened and Treasury yields rose after the report 
Key Insights
The larger than expected gain was broad based and included the biggest advance in service industry payrolls since February 2016  including a record surge in hiring at leisure and hospitality companies in data back to 2002 The report is in line with last week s statement from Federal Reserve policy makers following their meeting on interest rates  The Fed said that  job gains have been solid  on average  in recent months  Economists monitor the ADP data for clues about the government s job report  The Labor Department s employment data due Friday is expected to show a 150 000 gain in private payrolls and an unemployment rate remaining at a 50 year low of 3 5  The government figures will also include annual revisions  In August  the Labor Department s preliminary benchmark projections showed the number of workers added to payrolls will probably be revised down by 501 000 in the year through March 2019  ADP s report follows a different methodology than the government s  and the two do not directly correlate with each other ADP report showed goods producing payrolls rose 54 000 in January  while service provider employment increased 237 000 Economist s View

181985,403501,ADP,Six Strategists on Why Stocks Didn t Lose It Over Tougher Powell,news," Bloomberg     Strong signals from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell that he is  for now  finished cutting interest rates failed to incite terror in the U S  stock market  Quite the opposite  the S P 500 erased early losses and rose as much as 0 4  during the final hour  sending it back to record territory  Unlike last year  when stern words from Powell ignited the worst fourth quarter for equities in a decade  investors had faith his current pause doesn t amount to an abandonment of their cause 
Chris Zaccarelli  chief investment officer for Independent Advisor Alliance 
 In essence  the Fed needs to wean the market off the drip drip drip of rate cuts while still emphasizing that the Fed has their back in the event that the economy deteriorates significantly   he said   The difference is subtle  but the net effect is that slightly good economic data will no longer be met with a rate cut  and now even slightly worse than expected economic data will not cause the Fed to change rates  Ultimately a significantly worsening economy or a much better than expected economy  or much higher than expected inflation  will be the only reason the Fed will cut or raise rates again  respectively  
Michael O Rourke  JonesTrading s chief market strategist 
 Despite signaling a pause  the FOMC delivered its third consecutive rate cut  while expanding its balance sheet with the S P 500 at all time highs  U S  GDP running above potential and unemployment at five decade lows  One can understand why the markets don t fear much these days    the Fed has ceded monetary policy decisions to market expectations  
Ellen Hazen  senior vice president and portfolio manager for F L  Putnam 
 The language has been chosen in order to definitively project that the language is balanced  and that the next move could be a cut or a raise  rather than over the last few meetings the language has been more dovish  suggesting the Fed was more likely to cut  This time  it looks more balanced   she said   This was well telegraphed  Based on the press statement  I think it was exactly as expected  
Ed Keon  chief investment strategist at QMA in New Jersey 
 If you re on the Federal Reserve right now  I think you re tempted to take victory laps  We have inflation that s very close to their target  unemployment rate is at a 50 year low  the stock market is at an all time high  I think their policy has been quite successful  This time they re signaling is  Don t assume we re going to cut in December  if the data continues more or less where it is    GDP in the 1 5 2  range  inflation around 2  or a little below  unemployment    as long as that stays where it is  we ll stay on hold in December and we ll reassess the data as it comes in   he said   Thing could turn south but he s reflecting the reality that things were much more tense a few months ago in some ways  
Jeff Mills  chief investment officer at Bryn Mawr Trust Co  
 They re trying to walk that line between somewhat leaving the door open for additional cuts  but trying to pull back market expectations  At least to me it seems they ve done a reasonable job of that   he said   The economy does not warrant a tremendous number of additional cuts and I think Powell is going to go to great lengths to moderate expectations

181986,403502,ADP,Markets Take the Under on Trump s Economic Speech,news," Bloomberg Opinion     The global stock market drifted lower on Monday  posting its biggest decline in more than three weeks  Yes  there s still plenty of time for equities to recover and gain for a sixth consecutive week  which would match their longest winning streak since they advanced for 10 consecutive weeks over the course of late 2017 and early 2018  But doing so may hinge on a critical event Tuesday  
Even with the modest decline  the MSCI All Country World Index is still up 19  this year  The surge in recent weeks is due largely to optimism that the U S  and China are close to reaching an agreement on  phase one  of a broad trade deal  It doesn t matter that the details are likely to be modest  what matters is that it would signal that the trade war isn t worsening  That s why President Donald Trump s address to the Economic Club of New York on Tuesday is so critical  No one is quite sure  which Trump will show up  Will it be the one who in recent weeks has trumpeted progress in trade talks  or will it be the one who has said that the U S   hasn t agreed to a rollback of tariffs on China  which is what the markets truly want  This is no small matter for investors  Various surveys have shown that trade uncertainty is the primary risk facing markets  In that sense  whatever Trump says on Tuesday has the potential to either  ratify the rally or bolster the case that it s built on little more than hope  And as everyone in markets learns on their first day in the business  hope isn t a strategy   Markets have been skittish waiting for any concrete information about the trade talks   Matt Forester  the chief investment officer at BNY Mellon s Lockwood Advisors  told Bloomberg News  At 15 times forecast earnings for the following year  the MSCI is trading at its most expensive level since the start of 2018 
Trump s talk is not the only big event for markets this week  Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will address the Joint Economic Committee of Congress on Wednesday  the same day as the start of public impeachment hearings against Trump  The U S  Labor Department will also provide an update on inflation for October  The week ends with data on U S  retail sales for October  which economists hope will be a reversal from September s big miss to the downside  But as already stated  hope has no place in markets 
THE BOND GAME ISN T OVER YETThe bad news for the bond market is that November isn t even halfway over and it s already the worst month for fixed income investors since April 2018  with the Bloomberg  Barclays   LON BARC  Global Aggregate Index down 1 40  as of Friday  The good news is that there s plenty of time for the bond market to rebound  And just as with the stock market  Trump s appearance at Economic Club of New York    along with Powell s testimony   may determine whether the recent sell off in fixed income assets is overdone  That s the short run prognosis  In a nod to John Maynard Keynes  bonds are dead in the long run anyway  Well  at least according to Moody s Investors Service they are  The credit ratings company put out a research report Monday saying the rising tide of populism spreading round the world has caused it to  turn  negative  on global sovereign credit for 2020  Unpredictable domestic and geopolitical risks along with a push for populist policies that weaken institutions  help slow growth and boost the risk of economic and financial shocks means governments will struggle to address credit challenges  Moody s wrote  That s scary  but the major ratings companies aren t known for their astute political science observations  Yields on 10 year Treasury notes are lower now than when S P Global Ratings stripped the U S  of its AAA rating in August 2011 
GO BIG OR GO HOMEThe thing about bond sell offs in recent years is that have tended to be short lived  thanks largely to central banks  The collective balance sheet assets of the Fed  European Central Bank  Bank of Japan and Bank of England rose to 35 7  of their countries  total gross domestic product in October from about 10  before the financial crisis  according to data compiled by Bloomberg  And judging by some of the latest moves made by the ECB  bond traders can be a little less worried about a lack of buyers  The ECB started its second round of corporate bond purchases by acquiring in a week an amount that analysts  expected it to buy in a month  according to Bloomberg News s Tasos Vossos  The central bank bought almost 2 8 billion euros   3 billion  of company debt securities in the week to Nov  8  according to data released Monday  It was the second largest weekly purchase figure since the ECB first adopted the strategy  known as quantitative easing  in June 2016  The bank suspended the program last December and restarted it at the beginning of this month as growth flagged across the euro area  It s unknown whether the faster pace of purchases is in response to the big drop in bond prices and corresponding jump in yields  but it should be comforting to know that the ECB is doing its part to stem the weakness 
CHILE GIVES INIt s becoming routine to see the Chilean peso leading the list of biggest losers in the foreign exchange market on any given day  and Monday was no exception  The peso weakened 1 72  to a record low  bringing its depreciation since Oct  18 to 6 39   To put that into context  the next biggest loser among the 31 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg  the Argentine peso  has dropped just 2 48   It s well known by now that the populist movement that Moody s warned about on Monday has erupted in Chile  where a wave of protests has disrupted the economy and government  The latest move lower in the peso came as the administration of President Sebastian Pinera said it would  overhaul the constitution drawn up during the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet to calm three weeks of mass protests  So why did the peso and Chile s equity market  which fell 1 52   take it so harshly  Many people regard the constitution  drawn up under the dictatorship of Pinochet  as the foundation of an economic system that privatized pensions and much of health care and education  a chief grievance of protesters  according to Bloomberg News s Javiera Baeza and Eduardo Thomson  It also enshrined the strict legal safeguards to private property that are behind Chile s water privatization  a controversial subject in a country struggling with severe droughts 
NATURAL GAS STUMBLESThe natural gas market cares little about trade wars or populism  To traders there  it s all about the weather  Natural gas futures slid  the most since January as forecasts showed that a cold snap descending on the U S  would peter out by the end of the month  curbing demand at the time of year when consumption of the heating gas usually surges  according to Bloomberg News s Christine Buurma and Naureen S  Malik  Gas was the worst performing major commodity Monday  tumbling as much as 6 1   Temperatures will probably be mostly normal in the eastern half of the country Nov  21 through Nov  25 as an autumn chill fades  according to Commodity Weather Group LLC  Beyond the weather  the slide in natural gas underscores how record production from shale basins continues to weigh on the market even as exports soar and the power industry becomes more reliant on the fuel  Without a sustained Arctic chill this winter  stockpiles will remain above normal for the time of year  pressuring prices lower  according to Buurma and Malik  As they point out  hedge funds are adding to the bearish momentum  holding the largest short position since 2015 for the time of year 
TEA LEAVESWhen the National Federation of Independent Business said a month ago that its small business sentiment index for September fell to near  the lowest level of  Trump s presidency  it noted that the part of the gauge measuring  uncertainty  plunged to its lowest since February 2016   More owners are unable to make a statement confidently  good or bad  about the future of economic conditions   the group said  with 30  of respondents reporting  negative effects  from tariffs  Don t expect much improvement when the group provides an update on Tuesday  The median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg is for a reading of 102 for October  little changed from 101 8 in September  Bloomberg Economics points out that small business activity has been moderating since the last report  Most notably  the ADP  NASDAQ ADP  private employment survey indicated recently that net hiring has shrunk to half the pace that prevailed last year  to the slowest since 2011

181988,403504,ADP,U S  Services Gauge Drops  Though Details Signal Stable Growth,news," Bloomberg       A gauge of U S  service industries fell more than forecast in November as business activity cooled  though gains in employment and new orders suggest the biggest part of the economy is holding up in the fourth quarter 
The Institute for Supply Management s non manufacturing index fell to 53 9  according to data released Wednesday that missed the 54 5 median estimate in Bloomberg s survey of economists  The decrease was driven by the weakest reading of business activity since 2010 
Key Insights

The composition of the report showed that declines in  components tracking business activity  which parallels the  ISM s measure of factory production  and supplier  deliveries outweighed the gains in orders and employment   The split suggests demand still has some momentum heading  into the end of the year even as overall activity  moderates 
The measure of services employment climbed to 55 5  the  highest level since July  Other measures of the labor  market s performance in November were mixed ahead of  Friday s government jobs report 
The ADP  NASDAQ ADP  Research Institute on Wednesday reported services  payrolls rose at slowest pace in six months  with overall  private employment climbing a less than forecast 67 000   IHS Markit s gauge of services employment showed growth in  November after contracting the previous two months  helping  the overall measure improve to 51 6 
While ISM s services gauge has held for almost a decade  above 50  the line between expansion and contraction  the  group s manufacturing gauge has contracted for four  straight months  The divergence underscores how the  services sector  which makes up most of the economy  has  remained a resilient force for the record long expansion  even as factories falter 
New orders for services grew at a faster pace for a second  month  lifting the index to 57 1  That helped offset the  business activity gauge falling 5 4 points to 51 6 


The report indicates trade tensions and weak global growth  continue to weigh on American service providers  Exports  rose above 50  but imports contracted for a third straight  month to the lowest level in more than seven years 
A measure of order backlogs contracted for a second month   holding at the lowest level since December 2016  and the  gauge of supplier deliveries eased  The prices paid index  rose to 58 5 from 56 6

181989,403505,ADP,U S  services sector  private payrolls growth slow,news,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  services sector activity slowed in November as lingering concerns about trade tensions and worker shortages pushed production to its lowest level in a decade  which could heighten fears about the economy s health 
Other data on Wednesday showed private employers hired the fewest workers in six months in November  The reports came on the heels of data on Monday showing manufacturing activity contracted for the fourth straight month in November and a decline in construction spending in October 
The continued manufacturing slump and second straight monthly drop in construction outlays tempered growth expectations for the fourth quarter  which had been boosted by a rush of upbeat reports on the trade deficit  housing and business investment  Still  the economy appears to be growing at a moderate pace rather than stalling 
Growth is being constrained by the Trump administration s  America First  policy  which has seen the United States embroiled in a trade war with China  and tit for tat tariffs with other nations  The trade tensions  which have eroded business confidence  come as the stimulus from last year s  1 5 trillion tax cut package is fading 
The Institute for Supply Management  ISM  said its non manufacturing activity index fell to a reading of 53 9 last month from 54 7 in October  A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the services sector  which accounts for more than two thirds of U S  economic activity 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index dipping to a reading of 54 5 in November  The survey s production index tumbled 5 4 points to 51 6  the lowest level since November 2009  as tariffs on imports  including steel and aluminum raised costs for businesses  A measure of prices paid by services industries jumped 1 9 points to 58 5 last month 
 The decline in the index in November seems to reflect the tariffs that are impacting the prices of many products that services companies use to provide their services to other companies and consumers   said Chris Rupkey  chief economist at MUFG in New York   China is not paying for all the tariffs apparently  
President Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed that China was paying the tariffs in the 17 month trade war 
The dollar fell against a basket of currencies  while U S  Treasury yields rose  Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher 
LABOR MARKET SLOWING
The ISM said services industry businesses  hope for a resolution on tariffs and continue to be hampered by constraints in labor resources   It said 12 industries  including retail trade  utilities and information  reported growth last month  Five industries  including agriculture  mining and construction reported a contraction 
But key details of the ISM survey were upbeat  New orders picked up last month  though order backlogs contracted 
A measure of services industry employment rose to 55 5 from 53 7 in October  This supports economists  expectations that the government s closely watched employment report on Friday would show a sharp rebound in job growth in November  despite the paltry job gains reported by private employers last month 
Private employers added only 67 000 jobs in November  the ADP  NASDAQ ADP  National Employment report showed on Wednesday  It was the smallest monthly gain since May when just 46 000 jobs were created  the fewest since 2010  and continued a trend of decelerating job growth that has taken hold this year 
Data for October was revised down to show private payrolls increasing 121 000 from an originally reported 125 000 gain 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast private employment rising by 140 000 jobs in November 
The ADP figures come ahead of the Labor Department s more comprehensive nonfarm payrolls report due out on Friday  which includes both public  and private sector employment 
According to a Reuters survey of economists  nonfarm payrolls probably increased by 180 000 jobs last month  boosted in part by the return of about 46 000 General Motors  N GM  workers who had been excluded while on a 40 day strike  The strike held down job growth to 128 000 in October  The unemployment rate is forecast unchanged at 3 6  in November 
The ADP report  which is jointly developed with Moody s Analytics  has a poor record predicting the private payrolls component of the government s employment report  Economists said the ADP job count was not affected by the resumption of work by the GM workers  Still  last month s private payroll gains pointed to a cooling labor market 
 This report adds to signs that the labor market is still losing momentum  suggesting that incomes growth and thus real consumption growth will slow a little further in the near term   said Michael Pearce  a senior U S  economist at Capital Economics in New York   But it would take a much sharper downturn in employment growth to raise recession fears  
Job gains have averaged 167 000 per month this year  above the roughly 100 000 needed each month to keep up with growth in the working age population 
In the wake of Monday s dour ISM manufacturing survey and October construction spending  economists slashed their gross domestic product growth estimates for the fourth quarter to as low as a 1 3  annualized rate from as high as a 2 0  pace  The economy grew at a 2 1  pace in the third quarter 
The U S  China trade war has undercut business investment  contributing to the manufacturing downturn 
Washington and Beijing are working on a  phase one  trade deal  Trump  however  said on Tuesday a deal might have to wait until after the U S  presidential election in November 2020  Trump on Monday restored tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Brazil and Argentina for  massive devaluation of their currencies

182014,403530,ADP,Jobs Report Little Help to Fed as Trump Keeps Shouting for Cuts,news,"By Kim Khan

Investing com   The U S  economy created fewer jobs than expected last month  while wage inflation rose  leaving the markets with mixed signals as far as what that means for the Federal Reserve 

Nonfarm payrolls rose 130 000 in August  the Labor Department reported Friday  The market was expecting payrolls to have risen 160 000  according to economists  forecasts compiled by Investing com 
The unemployment rate remained steady at 3 7   suggesting that the economy remains close to full employment 
Average hourly earnings rose 0 4  in the month and 3 2  from the year ago period  That was a little stronger than expectations for a monthly increase of 0 3  and a 3 1  year over year rise 
In days past  such a report would leave the Fed with conflicting monetary policy indications 
Job growth was weaker than the consensus  And  more that 20  of job gains  were  due to temporary hiring for 2020 census  with downward revision to previous two months   Grant Thornton Chief Economist Diane Swonk tweeted 



June payroll gains were revised down 15 000 from to 178 000 from 193 000 and July was revised down 5 000 to 159 000 from 164 000   a total of 20 000 
In addition  average monthly job growth for the first eight months of 2019 is 158 00  down from 233 000 in full year 2018 and the 225 000 in the year ago period  Patrick Chovanec  chief strategist at Silvercrest Asset Management  tweeted 



That weakness could support some easing of rates 
Yet  with wage growth beating forecasts  inflation hawks would probably lean more to tightening 
But these aren t normal times  as far as the Fed is concerned 
And if anyone needed a reminder  President Donald Trump tweeted before the release of the numbers  again demanding rate cuts and criticizing Fed Chairman Jerome Powell   This came a day after Trump tweeted about  great  jobs numbers from ADP  NASDAQ ADP  and might have tipped those watching that the headline number would arrive below expectations  
The Fed  were WAY too early to raise  and Way too late to cut  he tweeted  and added  Where did I find this guy Jerome  



The markets seem pretty sure that nothing has really changed from yesterday and that Trump will get his cut at the FOMC meeting later this month 
Fed fund futures are pricing in a 92  chance of a quarter point cut  just a tad lower than when the jobs report came out  according to Investing com s Fed Rate Monitor Tool

Wednesday s ADP  payroll data added to the bullish fervor in gold  The ADP numbers come ahead of Friday s all important September U S  jobs report

Bond yields continued to head lower on Wednesday  with the 2 Year Treasury yield falling to a four week low of 1 50  as traders priced in the growing likelihood of more rate cuts from the Federal Reserve  
According to Investing com s Fed Rate Monitor Tool  the implied probability of another cut before the end of the year is now around 87 5   while the chance of action already at the October Federal Open Markets Committee Meeting has risen to just under 75  from 64  a week ago 
 A particularly weak print could also see the Fed committee shift its narrative on the prospect of future cuts  In this context  investors are once again welcoming gold s warm embrace  following the  recent  sharp technically driven selloff   TD said

Data out Thursday gave a mixed picture of the U S  labor market ahead of the August jobs report  offering fodder for opposing views that employment is either holding up or slowing down because of trade tensions and global weakness 
ADP  NASDAQ ADP  Research Institute figures showed U S  employers added the most jobs in four months  topping expectations  and the Labor Department said weekly filings for unemployment benefits were little changed  In contrast  a measure of service industry employment was the weakest in more than two years and a separate report said companies announced plans to eliminate more than 10 000 jobs because of  trade difficulties  
Investors focused more on the positive signs  which came on the heels of news that the U S  and China would hold face to face negotiations aimed at ending their tariff war  U S  stocks surged Thursday  bringing the S P 500 within 1 5  of an all time high  The 10 year Treasury yield rose toward 1 6  
The Labor Department s monthly employment report  due Friday morning in Washington  will provide a more definitive take 
Analysts expect a monthly nonfarm payroll increase of 160 000  in line with July  While the jobless rate probably held near a half century low  wage gains likely cooled 
President Donald Trump tweeted  Really Good Jobs Numbers   on Thursday morning following the ADP data  The president hadn t yet been briefed on the Labor Department s Friday figures  White House spokesman Judd Deere said  Those are typically sent to the White House on Thursday afternoon 
The Institute for Supply Management said its employment gauge for non manufacturing industries fell in August to 53 1  the lowest level since March 2017  That signals service jobs are still growing but at a slower pace  The ISM s headline index of service industries topped expectations with the best reading in three months 
 The employment index can be both a leading and a lagging indicator   Anthony Nieves  chair of the ISM non manufacturing business survey committee  said on a call with reporters Thursday  Hiring can cool in the summer months and gear up again in the autumn as companies review their business pipeline  he said 
In another positive sign Thursday  the weekly Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index bounced back to a five week high as assessments of personal finances reached the second highest level since 2000  offering hope American households can continue to fuel the economic expansion

182072,403588,ADP,French business elite cut Macron slack for slower reform pace,news,"By Leigh Thomas  Sarah White and Sudip Kar Gupta
AIX EN PROVENCE  France  Reuters    Assailed by social unrest and lagging in opinion polls  French President Emmanuel Macron has for now managed to cling on to a well of support from company leaders in France even as his reform push loses momentum 
Executives attending an annual economic conference in Aix en Provence were more than happy to cut Macron slack for the setbacks the 41 year old s pro business overhaul of the country has faced 
 Macron made some mistakes but he realized it and took measures to fix them   a senior French banker told Reuters at the conference bringing together France s corporate elite in the southern college town for a weekend of lofty debates about the state of the world 
 The situation isn t as bad as some think  He s done more in two years than other presidents did in five or 10 years   the banker added 
Two years into his presidency  Macron s reform agenda has taken a backseat after several months spent rebuilding political capital and trying to quell anti government  yellow vest  protests 
That included a series of nationwide townhall debates and policy U turns on issues like planned fuel tax hikes  as Macron also sought to repair his oft cited image as an arrogant leader 
The former investment banker lost little time in his first months in office overhauling France s strict labor code to make it easier to hire and fire  as employers had long urged  and also brought in tax cuts for investors and companies to encourage job creating investment 
But plans to reform unemployment insurance were only unveiled in June after months of delay  and a well flagged pension overhaul now looks unlikely to happen before next year 
Both moves are expected to meet stiff resistance from unions  which could become a problem for Macron after he rode roughshod over worker representatives in his 2018 overhaul of indebted state run rail company SNCF 
 If there has been a mistake  it s underestimating unions and employers federations   economist Jean Herve Lorenzi  who organizes the Aix conference  told Reuters   The social partners need to be brought into the process  
But few in business circles question Macron s reform intentions 
 The unemployment insurance reform is making progress  proposals on retirement should come soon  there s no underlying change   Lorenzi added 
And with opponents on the right and left in disarray  at least in parliament there are still few chances of any hiccups 
 He s not going as fast as he could or should  but politically he s still got open freeway in front of him   a senior executive at one of France s biggest companies told Reuters 
KEEP IT UP
On the streets  a backlash over high living costs and perceived elitism has also simmered down 
 France is doing well  let s keep it up    I don t see any yellow vests   said Rodolphe Saade  chief executive of French shipping giant CMA CGM 
But the demonstrations  which descended into violent clashes last December including in Paris  have had a sobering effect for French companies too  when many are also grappling with other pressures like a U S  China trade war 
 We have to adapt  to that backdrop  without a hike in our costs  because neither our direct clients or auto consumers will accept a rise in prices  as we saw in France with the yellow vests   Jacques Aschenbroich  CEO of car parts supplier  Valeo   PA VLOF   told the conference on Sunday 
As a result of the protests  Macron shifted his policy focus from boosting business to supporting income for the poorest workers and pensioners  with a package of concessions last December worth more than 10 billion euros 
He followed up in April with a pledge to cut income tax by 5 billion euros next year  His poll ratings have begun creeping up from lows reached in the depths of the yellow vest crisis 
He has yet to detail  much less carry out  spending cuts that are supposed to finance tax cuts  much to the consternation of the central bank and the independent public audit office 
Also slipping on Macron s  to do  list is the launch of France s biggest wave of privatizations in years  with the sale of airport operator ADP  NASDAQ ADP  running into opposition as support builds for a referendum on the sell off

182073,403589,ADP,Regional power grab attempt causes rare discord in Ethiopia coalition,news,"By Dawit Endeshaw
ADDIS ABABA  Reuters    A failed regional coup in Ethiopia has exposed rare divisions in the alliance that has dominated the country for three decades  with two of the four ethnic parties that form the ruling coalition trading insults in a public feud 
While there have been disagreements among the parties in the past  analysts described the acrimonious exchange this week between the Tigray People s Liberation Front  TPLF  and the Amhara Democratic Party  ADP  NASDAQ ADP   as among the most serious yet 
The two groups have shared power with two other ethnic parties since 1991 in a coalition  the Ethiopian People s Revolutionary Democratic Front  EPRDF   that tolerated little dissent until Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed took power last year and launched political reforms 
The new tension between them arose after a rogue militia tried to seize power last month in the northern Amhara region  ruled by the ADP  The authorities blamed the June 22 attempted regional coup on Asamnew Tsige  a rogue ADP member  killed in fighting on the outskirts of the regional capital Bahir Dar 
In recent days  the TPLF has accused the ADP of having stood by while Asamnew trained and armed a militia in the lead up to the uprising  and of having failed to denounce him since 
 The TPLF would have difficulty working with its so called sister party  which hasn t even dared to stare the killer in the eye   Getachew Reda  executive member of TPLF and former national communication minister  told Reuters on Thursday 
The ADP responded by accusing the TPLF of being  responsible for the current political crisis in the country  The TPLF has no moral or practical ground to consider itself as the only guardian of Ethiopia   it said in a statement late on Thursday  It gave no further details 
FLYING IN THE FACE OF REALITY
The TPLF was angered earlier this week when the ADP chairman  Deputy Prime Minister Demeke Mekonnen  said an unidentified third group was behind the June uprising  The TPLF viewed the remarks as an attempt by the ADP to avert blame 
 How would I feel comfortable sitting next to Demeke while his remarks are flying in the face of reality   TPLF s Getachew told Reuters by telephone 
The violence on June 22 was the strongest challenge yet to the rule of Abiy  who in just over a year in power has rolled out a series of reforms allowing greater freedoms in what had long been one of Africa s most repressive states 
The reforms have made it possible for long held grievances against the government s decades of harsh rule to resurface  and have emboldened local power brokers seeking to build support by securing more power and territory for their ethnic groups 
Resulting waves of unrest have forced the government to postpone a long delayed national census and thrown doubt over whether an election next year will be held on time 
Each of the ruling coalition s four ethnically based parties faces increasing competition from newer  more strident parties in their own home provinces  and are having to become more assertive themselves to avoid being outflanked  analysts say 
 It will be difficult for the ruling coalition to maintain its current status ahead of the upcoming election   said Mulugeta Aregawi  a lecturer at the Addis Ababa University School of Law 
William Davison  an analyst from Brussels based International Crisis Group  said that if the tension among the parties were to break up the ruling coalition  it  would leave a major power vacuum   But he added that it still appeared unlikely for now   since all actors have too much to lose  ",2019-07-12,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/regional-power-grab-attempt-causes-rare-discord-in-ethiopia-coalition-1922390,1922390

Dozens were killed in fighting during the foiled coup by a rogue state militia in Amhara that claimed the life of regional president Ambachew Mekonnen and other top officials  The same night  the army s chief of staff and a retired general accompanying him were killed in the capital Addis Ababa in a related attack  the government said 
The ADP said on its Facebook  NASDAQ FB  page that it had nominated Abiy s security adviser Temesgen Tiruneh as Ambachew s successor in Amhara  The party controls the Amhara regional government and is also one of four in Abiy s national governing coalition 
The Amhara violence was the strongest challenge yet to the rule of Abiy  who has rolled out ambitious political and economic reforms in what was once one of Africa s most repressive countries since coming to power in April 2018 
Abiy has freed political prisoners and journalists  offered an amnesty for some rebel groups and opened up space for a number of parties ahead of planned parliamentary elections next year in Ethiopia  Africa s second most populous country 
But his government has also presided over a rise of ethnic violence as regional powerbrokers try to grab more power and territory and air long held grievances against the Addis Ababa coalition  More than 2 4 million of Ethiopia s 100 million citizens are displaced 
Temesgen s nomination is expected to be ratified by the Amhara regional council at a later date  according to an ADP central committee member ",2019-07-15,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/ethiopia-premiers-aide-named-to-lead-restive-amhara-region-1923755,1923755

182096,403612,ADP,Uncertainty hangs over ADP sale as Macron faces delicate decisions,news,"By Richard Lough and Inti Landauro PARIS  Reuters    Bankers are telling potential buyers of the French state s majority holding in airports operator ADP  NASDAQ ADP  that there is little clarity on the timing or size of the sale  underscoring how risky the transaction has become for President Emmanuel Macron  The proposed sale of all or part of the state s controlling 50 6  share in ADP  which operates Paris Charles de Gaulle to the north of the capital and Orly to the south  is the most eye catching of the slate of privatizations planned by Macron in a country that cherishes the protection of public services  The sell offs   utility Engie and lottery monopoly FDJ are also potentially on the block   are integral to Macron s drive to curb government involvement where he believes the private sector would better deliver investment and change  But the ADP sale has united opponents  They accuse President Emmanuel Macron of  flogging the family silver  and warn of the perils of economic liberalism  citing Margaret Thatcher s unpopular reforms in 1980s Britain  This month opponents launched a petition that could lead to a referendum on the ADP privatization next year    a risky proposition for a president shaken by a public rebellion over his pro business policies and perceived as indifferent to the working class  The ballot would be held as re election looms  Three bankers advising clients over ADP said there was no clear idea how much would be sold or when  Macron s government has put the plans on ice for at least the nine month period opponents have to try to garner 4 7 million backers   10  of the electorate    to secure their referendum   This sale is on hold for a while   said George Holst of  BNP Paribas   PA BNPP   which is advising ADP  The project  will depend on the government s will to impose its political line in a clear way   A second Paris based banker advising a potential buyer said they were not aware of any current contact between government and interested parties   We have told our client the process is delayed  perhaps even canceled  We re all on standby   they said  Macron had counted on the ADP sale to service France s debt and build up a fund to finance innovation  The state s shareholding is worth almost 8 billion euros at current market prices  Selling the entire stake would command a premium  while selling a smaller block might be more politically palatable  The weekly newspaper Canard Encha n  reported Macron had decided to scrap the sale but that no announcement would come until the referendum bid had run its course   The public does not understand the privatization   Macron is quoted as telling a visitor to his office   We must take our time  We mustn t act as if the referendum did not exist    In Japan for a G20 gathering  Macron sidestepped a question on the report   I am not going to say today what I intend to do     NEW AGE THATCHERISM  At the heart of the matter is a decades old debate in France over what role the state should have in the economy   Boris Vallaud  a Socialist Party spokesman  described the privatization plan as a  grotesque economic mistake     ADP is not a business like others  it is a tool of national sovereignty  it is the hub of Air France  it is a strategic asset   he told Reuters days after launching the petition near Charles de Gaulle airport   With Vallaud that evening was an unusual grouping of legislators  including communists and moderate socialists who accuse Macron of placing corporate profit ahead of national interest  and conservatives loyal to the Gaullist tradition of a strong government overseeing strategic assets   This plan  like others from Macron  feels like new age Thatcherism   Vallaud said  Opponents of ADP s privatization draw parallels with the sale of the motorway network in the mid 2000s  an unpopular move that still leaves many complaining of unfair toll hikes   With the highways  we saw that when you privatize it is no longer the common good that prevails  it is the pursuit of profit   said 60 year old petition signatory Martine Louaire   Conglomerate Vinci was the big winner of the autoroute privatization and wants to build upon its 8  stake in ADP  Supporters of the privatization dismiss opponent s claims that France would be handing customs and border control over to private interests  and argue the private sector is better placed to transform Charles de Gaulle into a world leading hub   On sale would effectively be the airports  shopping centers  hotels  car parks and aircraft landing tariffs  said Roland Lescure  a lawmaker from Macron s party and rapporteur on the legislation that permits the government to sell its holding   Lescure said the government would have the final say over landing tariffs if a dispute with the concession holder erupted  The plan  he said  had become mired in mistruths and wrongly politicized   It became a political fireball that everybody wanted to play with  especially in the context of the  Yellow Vest  protests   MARKET CONDITIONS ADP would be a big prize for Vinci  105 million passengers use Paris  two main airports annually  ADP booked 4 5 billion euros of revenue in 2018  But as opposition has mounted to the company s privatization  Vinci chief executive Xavier Huillard has downplayed the importance of ADP to the company s strategy  Vinci had opportunities to grow its airport concession business with or without ADP  Huillard said in February  just as he finalized a 2 9 billion pound   3 68 billion  swoop for control of Britain s London Gatwick  ADP chief executive Augustin de Romanet rejected the suggestion Macron s government is having second thoughts   The impression I have is that this  referendum bid  is not creating any trouble inside the finance ministry or the prime minister s office   Romanet told reporters this week   Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire has said he still believes in the privatization   Although the delay pushes delicate political decisions closer to an expected Macron re election bid in 2022  Lescure said the president would not stop reforming France   More of a concern  he said  will be the market

182119,403635,ADP,U S  services sector activity strengthens  eases gloom over economy,news,"By Lucia Mutikani WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  services sector activity expanded at a brisk pace in May and industries hired more workers  offering some respite for an economy that is slowing following a temporary boost from exports and an accumulation of inventories in the first quarter   The survey from the Institute for Supply Management  ISM  on Wednesday followed a raft of weak reports on consumer spending  housing and manufacturing that suggested a sharp loss of momentum in economic growth early in the second quarter   Slowing growth  worsening trade tensions between the United States and China  and looming U S  tariffs on goods imported from Mexico have led some economists to expect the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates this year  The U S  central bank early this year suspended its three year monetary policy tightening campaign  Fed Chairman Jerome Powell on Tuesday said the central bank was closely monitoring the implications of the trade tensions on the economy and would  act as appropriate to sustain the expansion    Though this won t completely dismiss the rate cut this year speculation  the much better than expected non manufacturing ISM print helps   said Jennifer Lee  a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto    The ISM said its non manufacturing activity index rose 1 4 points to a reading of 56 9 in May  A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector  which accounts for more than two thirds of U S  economic activity  Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index would be unchanged at 55 5 last month   The May increase in services industry activity reflected a jump of 1 7 points in the production subindex  Activity was also boosted by gains in the new orders measure   A gauge of services industry employment surged 4 4 points to a seven month high  The ISM said while businesses in the services sector were mostly optimistic about overall business conditions   concerns remain about tariffs and employment resources   President Donald Trump in early May slapped additional tariffs of up to 25  on  200 billion of Chinese goods  which prompted retaliation by Beijing  Trump announced last week that he would impose a tariff on all goods from Mexico in a bid to stem the tide of illegal immigration across the U S  Mexican border  The tariff would start at 5  on June 10  The ISM said 16 industries  including utilities  real estate  finance and insurance  healthcare and social assistance  information  and professional  scientific and technical services reported growth last month  The only industry reporting contraction was agriculture  forestry  fishing and hunting  Businesses in the utilities industry said they were  waiting to see the impact of Chinese import tariff   while their counterparts in the mining sector said because of the trade war   it has been very difficult to plan in a long term ahead   Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher  The dollar firmed against a basket of currencies  U S  Treasury prices rose   FADING STIMULUS The trade tensions and fading stimulus from the White House s tax cuts and spending increases are slamming the brakes on the economy  The Atlanta Fed is forecasting gross domestic product to rise at a 1 3  annualized rate in the second quarter  The economy grew at a 3 1  pace in the first quarter  lifted by increases in exports  inventories and defense spending  Goods exports fell sharply in April and the inventory overhang  which is mostly concentrated in the auto sector  is weighing on production at factories  A separate report from the Fed on Wednesday showed tariffs continued to cause anxiety among businesses  In its Beige Book report of anecdotal information on business activity collected from contacts nationwide  the central bank described economic activity as expanding at a  modest  pace from April through mid May  It said the outlook for the months ahead was  solidly positive but modest   Last month s jump in hiring by services sector businesses suggested that a sharp slowdown in private payrolls growth in May shown in another report on Wednesday was probably a fluke  The ADP  NASDAQ ADP  National Employment Report showed private employers added only 27 000 jobs in May  the fewest since March 2010  after creating 271 000 positions in April   The ADP figures came ahead of the Labor Department s more comprehensive non farm payrolls report on Friday  which includes both public  and private sector

Reuters are forecasting non farm payrolls to have increased 185 000 in May  The unemployment rate is seen unchanged at 3 6 percent    Our hunch is that the drop off in ADP s estimate of private payrolls growth is likely a blip   said Roiana Reid  an economist at Berenberg Capital Markets in New York   If the May employment report also exhibits similar weakness  that would provide a more forceful indication that companies are scaling back hiring because of concerns about the economic outlook   According to the ADP report  employment in the goods producing sector fell by 43 000 jobs in May  the first drop in nearly 2 1 2 years  Manufacturing payrolls decreased 3 000 and construction shed 36 000 positions  the most since 2010

182120,403636,ADP,U S  Jobs Report Eyed for Cracks in Labor Market,news," Bloomberg     Friday s U S  jobs report will be especially scrutinized by economists  investors and Federal Reserve policy makers watching for signs of cracks in the labor market as trade tensions weigh on the economy and spur bets interest rate cuts are coming 
The Labor Department figures are expected to show payroll gains cooled in May to a still strong 180 000  while unemployment probably held at a 49 year low of 3 6  as wage gains held up  That would offer some comfort after retail sales  factory output and home purchases showed the economy struggling this quarter after better than expected growth in the first three months of the year 
But even if the jobs numbers are solid  investors may still expect the situation to deteriorate as consumers feel pain from President Donald Trump s intensifying trade war with China and threatened tariffs on Mexican goods  Private sector reports Wednesday gave conflicting signals ahead of the jobs data  with one showing the weakest business payroll gains in nine years and another indicating strength in service industry hiring 
 I have seen some signs that we re not improving at the same rate we were even six months let alone a year ago   said Sarah House  senior economist at  Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC    Co   We are perhaps getting close to an inflection point  
Fed officials have broadly viewed the economy as solid  but they re inching toward consideration of an interest rate cut amid softer data and escalating trade tensions  Chairman Jerome Powell signaled an openness to lower rates if necessary in a speech Tuesday  after St  Louis Fed President James Bullard became the first policy maker to indicate likely support for a reduction 
 I don t tend to take too much signal from one particular data point    I like to put it in context and look over several months   Fed Governor Lael Brainard told Yahoo   NASDAQ AABA  Finance on Wednesday   But I will be paying very close attention to the payrolls number on Friday  
U S  stocks rallied for a second day Wednesday on optimism Mexican tariffs will be avoided  Treasury yields fell and the dollar strengthened 
The Treasury market will digest the latest labor market reading with benchmark 10 year yields hovering just above 2   Yields have been tumbling as trade tensions escalate and traders increasingly price in Fed easing in 2019  Fed funds futures traders expect rates to be cut by more than a half a percentage point by year s end 
Treasury yields risk sliding further if job gains disappoint  because many traders are of the view that the labor market has yet to feel the full impact of tariffs  said Peter Boockvar  chief investment officer at Bleakley Financial Group LLC 
What Our Economists Say
 The ADP  NASDAQ ADP  Research Institute s latest jobs report showed that hiring momentum slowed sharply in May      In light of this  we are lowering our forecast for May s nonfarm payrolls  to 160 000 from 205 000     Yelena Shulyatyeva and Carl Riccadonna  economists
Meanwhile  stocks strategists differed over whether a weak report would lead to declines in equities on concern that the economy is slowing  or gains amid optimism the Fed will add economic stimulus   In this case  with so much pressure on the Federal Reserve  it could spark a rally   said Mike Loewengart  vice president of investment strategy at E Trade Financial Corp 
Wells Fargo s House and others will be focusing on what the report shows on whether global weakness may be impacting U S  hiring  So far  slowing global growth and tariffs fanning the deterioration have stayed relatively contained to the goods producing sector 
The Institute for Supply Management s manufacturing index fell to the lowest level since 2016 in May  and business equipment orders dropped in April for the first time this year  Manufacturing payroll growth has averaged 7 000 jobs per month this year  down from 22 000 in 2018  Economists project a 3 000 increase for May 
 There s enough durability in labor markets  enough of a services oriented economy where weakness in manufacturing and trade have difficulty tipping the economy over   said Michael Gapen  chief U S  economist at  Barclays   LON BARC  Plc  Barclays expects the Fed to cut 75 basis points this year   One of the reasons we re not calling for anything worse is because we think there s still some virtuous cycle in labor markets left to go  
Accelerating wage gains over the last year have been another sign of labor market strength  Average hourly earnings growth is forecast to hold at 3 2  on an annual basis  near the best pace of the expansion  while the monthly gain picks up to 0 3  
Despite consistent strength across the main labor market indicators  Trump s threats against China and Mexico    the two biggest trading partners    have only grown since May jobs data were collected  Payroll growth  a lagging indicator  is forecast to slow this year as steeper levies fuel uncertainty for American businesses and consumers

182121,403637,ADP,Baffled Stock Analysts Have No Idea What They Want in Jobs Data,news," Bloomberg     While forecasting cause and effect is always hard in financial markets  Wall Street s best minds are having a particularly brutal time deciding if they want Friday s payroll data to come in high or low 
Anticipation is running hot  Anticipation of what  is a separate question  Will a weak report boost rate cut odds  Or maybe the cuts are priced in and the sight of a tanking economy will sow terror  Maybe solid data will douse recession fears  Or maybe just stiffen resolve against easing 
Good may be good  or good may be bad  Wall Street is decidedly undecided 
Mixed economic data isn t helping  A measure of U S  manufacturing activity fell in May to the lowest level since October 2016  But U S  household wealth hit a record in the first quarter and different measures of confidence have soared  Then again  a preview of private sector hiring wasn t just ominous    it was downright doomy  Data from ADP  NASDAQ ADP  Research Institute showed companies in May added the fewest U S  workers in any month since 2010 
Economists are expecting an increase of 175 000 in payrolls on Friday  according to Bloomberg s survey  with the unemployment rate staying at 3 6   Here are four views from market watchers on the differing scenarios 

Chris Gaffney  president of world markets at TIAA 

 That s the crazy thing right now    we re back in this environment where a bad jobs report may actually help the markets because they look at that and they say  Well  now the Fed s really going to come in with some more stimulus   It s a case of if we get a really bad number  you could actually see stocks rebound somewhat 
We ve seen some of that already  Valuations are decent right now  stocks aren t as expensive as they were  And again  the U S  economy is holding up fairly well  I think that a bad report  depending on just how bad it is and where we see it end up  if we see jobs decreasing that s one thing  but wages are an important factor  If we see wages start to slip again  which I don t expect  that could really come in and hurt the market because consumers are still fairly confident  

Jim Paulsen  chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group 

 If we see a really bad number  the market s going to go down  If it s anything close to the ADP number  and if it s supported by the data    pickup in unemployment and a really weak payroll number    I think the market falls quite a bit  And the bond yield  more importantly  probably drops below 2  on the 10 year  That would be spooky  We re not that far  It probably won t happen  but I do think there s a risk  
 If we get a jump in claims and a bad report on Friday with jobs  I think the stock market will be back below 2 700 and the bond yield could be below 2   There s a risk of having a series of bad reports given where the market is right now  That s why I do think the Fed needs to act    or  they ll be reacting on Friday after the fact  which won t be as good  

Ed Campbell  managing director and portfolio manager at QMA 

If the report is strong   then the case is that maybe the economy is not sinking as quickly and maybe the Fed is right to say   Hey  we ve got policy about right at this point  so bond market  you have probably overreacted and maybe that inverted yield curve needs to become less inverted   In that case  it might be good for stocks but bad for bonds  I personally would take comfort from a stronger report than a weaker report  
 It should attract outsize attention because of the current context  U S  economic growth looks like it lost momentum in the second quarter  We ve had a string of disappointing economic data and with the trade tensions escalating and the trade war looking like it could be with us for a while  the odds for a deal seem to have declined pretty significantly over the past month  That s something that could sour business and consumer confidence going forward  The U S  labor market so far has been a pillar of strength despite clear signs of manufacturing slowdown  

Hank Smith  co chief investment officer at Haverford Trust 

 You need to see multiple months of either a low print or a high print to get conviction on a trend  We re not going to be too worried about it  but it  ADP  does show that business are cautious right now because of the uncertainty  The surprise part of that ADP was small businesses are actually seeing a contraction  That was a bit of a surprise and worth paying attention to  But again  you need to see several months to gain any type of confidence that a trend is being established

182122,403638,ADP,Your Money  Make a paycheck checkup easier  despite the IRS,news,"By Beth Pinsker NEW YORK  Reuters    The Internal Revenue Service would like American taxpayers to look over their paystubs and make sure they are withholding the right amount   please  In the first year of the new tax law  2018  Americans underestimated how much they needed to withhold from each paycheck to cover their tax bill  While final IRS data is not yet available  one snapshot from the agency is that total refunds for 2018 tax returns were down 1 percent from the prior year  and the total amount given back was  7 7 billion less   The amount of taxes taken out of each paycheck  which is set by the W 4 form each employee has on file with their employer  will be off again for 2019 unless people take steps to change   Trouble is  doing a paycheck checkup is more challenging than it should be   LOTS OF MATH  After Matt Longo finished his taxes a few months ago  he realized his refund was too large  so he clicked on the IRS calculator    to figure out how he should adjust the numbers with the payroll provider at his job   To do this  he needed his tax return from the previous year  his most current paystub and a good estimate of what he would make for the rest of the year  including all his other income and deductions    It wasn t something I could do over lunch at work  or even in an afternoon   said Longo  a 28 year old single public relations worker in New York  who is also in business school   Longo spent a Saturday afternoon on the maddening process of plugging in the numbers  to finally get to an estimated result   The trouble is that withholding used to be based on the concept of exemptions  which were conveniently small  round numbers  If you were single  but had a dependent  you might claim one exemption  If you had other factors that lowered your taxes   like a property tax deduction or big charitable donations   then you might claim exemptions for each  without having to specify anything on the form or even do any math   You could work it the other way around too   claiming fewer exemptions than you were eligible for   so the government would take out more money than you actually needed to pay  This might get you a refund at the end of the year  or it could compensate for a spouse who works freelance to spare them quarterly estimated payments   But now exemptions are gone  So to figure out your withholding tax  you need to examine your whole tax picture from the year prior  your current financial position and your estimate of what you will make for the rest of the year  There are ways individuals can make the process less onerous  without having to resort to a calculator   Here are some tips     Make withholding decisions part of your tax prep process Rather than think of a W 4 as a workplace payroll issue  think of it as part of yearly tax prep   ADP  NASDAQ ADP   the largest payroll servicer  advised major tax preparation companies to bundle this into their software as just another step in the tax return process    Send the return  but don t stop there   said Pete Isberg  vice president of government relations for ADP     Go with last year s estimate If running all the numbers is too hard  just skip it  As long as you pay 90 percent of what you owed last year  you will not be charged with a penalty     Keep your details to yourself  The proposed draft for a new W 4  which will go into effect in 2020    asks for a lot more detailed information about other income and deductions  But it also has a line to put in a dollar amount of any additional money you want withheld each pay period  which you can fill out in place of offering details you might prefer to keep private

182210,403726,ADP,As Trump wages trade war  U S  goods deficit hits record high in 2018,news,"By Lucia Mutikani WASHINGTON  Reuters    The U S  goods trade deficit surged to a record high in 2018 as strong domestic demand fueled by lower taxes pulled in imports  despite the Trump administration s  America First  policies  including tariffs  aimed at shrinking the trade gap  President Donald Trump is pursuing a protectionist trade agenda to shield U S  manufacturing from what he says is unfair foreign competition  Trump  who has dubbed himself  the tariff man   pledged on both the campaign trail and as president to reduce the deficit by shutting out more unfairly traded imports and renegotiating free trade agreements  The Commerce Department said on Wednesday that a 12 4 percent jump in the goods deficit in December had contributed to the record  891 3 billion goods trade shortfall last year  The overall trade deficit surged 12 5 percent to  621 0 billion in 2018  the largest since 2008   The trade deficit exploded last year despite the Trump administration efforts to make America great again  and the trend is unlikely to get any better in 2019   said Chris Rupkeychief economist at MUFG in New York   The White House has argued that reducing the trade deficit would boost annual economic growth to its goal of 3 percent on a sustainable basis  The government also sought to stimulate the economy with a  1 5 trillion tax cut package  which jolted both consumer and business spending  helping to lift imported goods to a record  2 6 trillion in 2018  The United States last year imposed tariffs on  250 billion worth of goods imported from China  with Beijing hitting back with duties on  110 billion worth of American products  including soybeans and other commodities  Trump has delayed tariffs on  200 billion worth of Chinese imports as negotiations to resolve the eight month trade war continue  Businesses likely stocked up on imports in anticipation of further duties on Chinese goods  which ironically contributed to the deterioration in the trade deficit last year   The goods trade deficit with China increased 11 6 percent to an all time high of  419 2 billion in 2018  The United States  which also slapped duties on imported steel  aluminum  solar panels and washing machines  had record imports from 60 countries in 2018  led by China  Mexico and Germany   Perhaps Donald Trump will now discover that tweets and bluster alone won t dramatically shrink the trade deficit   said Scott Paul  president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing in Washington   The administration s fiscal policies have helped to boost the trade deficit   While goods exports hit a record  1 7 trillion in 2018  they declined in the last three months of the year  weighed by the U S  China trade dispute  slowing global demand and a strong dollar  which is making American made goods less competitive on the international market  The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies  while U S  Treasury prices rose  Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower as investors awaited fresh developments on the trade negotiations  LABOR MARKET SLOWING Economists expect exports to remain weak even if Washington and Beijing strike a trade deal   That will take time and if the Chinese growth is as soft as most economists believe  it is hard to see how they can ramp up demand for U S  products very much this year   said Joel Naroff  chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland  Pennsylvania  A 1 9 percent drop in exports of goods and services drove the trade deficit in December to  59 8 billion  the largest since October 2008  Imports of goods and services increased 2 1 percent to  264 9 billion in December   When adjusted for inflation  the goods trade deficit surged  10 0 billion to a record  91 6 billion in December   The jump in the so called real goods trade deficit suggests that the drag from trade on fourth quarter gross domestic product growth was probably bigger than the 0 22 percentage point estimated by the government last week  Economists expect the government will revise down fourth quarter GDP growth to a 2 3 percent annualized rate from the 2 6 percent it reported last Thursday  Other data on Wednesday suggested some slowing in the labor market  though the pace of job gains remains more than enough to drive the unemployment rate down  The ADP  NASDAQ ADP  National Employment Report showed private payrolls increased by 183 000 in February after surging 300 000 in January  Economists polled by Reuters had forecast private payrolls advancing 189 000 in February  The ADP report  which is jointly developed with Moody s Analytics  was published ahead of the government s more comprehensive employment report for February scheduled for release on Friday  The ADP report is not considered a reliable predictor of the private payrolls portion of the government s employment report because of differences in methodology   February s report was  however  in line with other labor market data  including weekly applications for unemployment benefits and manufacturing and services sector surveys that have suggested some moderation in job growth following hefty gains in January   It looks broadly consistent with our view that job growth remained solid in February despite cooling from the boomy figures reported for the prior several months   said Daniel Silver  an economist at JPMorgan  NYSE JPM  in New York

182212,403728,ADP,Is the U S  Jobs Report too Bad to Be True ,news,"Investing com   For traders obsessed with job creation as a reflection of the American labor market  Friday s release of the monthly employment report was a dismal message for the U S  economy  But if cooler heads prevail  one off data with a background of escalating wages could well paint quite another picture for Federal Reserve policymakers struggling to stay on hold 
 Yes  only 20 000 jobs were added in February  but please do not start freaking out about a recession  One month does not make a trend   Heidi Shierholz  director of the Economic Policy Institute  said 
She explained that harsh weather contributed to weakness in February with depressing job growth in construction  hotels and restaurants and noted that average job growth for the last three months was 186 000   a much better reflection of underlying trends  
James Knightley  ING chief international economist  also put into question Friday s report   While the U S  economy is clearly facing some headwinds  this report seems very odd since it completely contradicts other evidence such as the ISM employment indices  the ADP  NASDAQ ADP  report and the NFIB jobs number   he said 
In any case  a long expansion in the American labor market has been reducing slack  providing less and less room for further job creation in an economy that is near full employment 
That is starting to be felt in wage growth which the Fed is closely watching as it keeps open the possibility of a rate hike in the second half of the year 
Average hourly earnings rose 0 4  on the month  above forecasts for a 0 3  rise  and by 3 4  on an annualized basis  its highest in 10 years  For most of the expansion  wage increases have lagged an otherwise healthy labor market 
Former New York Fed president William Dudley warned earlier this week that investors should not assume the pause in policy tightening meant that the U S  central bank was done raising rates 
 People should be careful about jumping to such conclusions  Although the Fed is likely to stay on hold for the next few months  after that it s anybody s guess   he wrote in an opinion piece for Bloomberg published on Wednesday

1  U S  Jobs Report

The consensus forecast is that the data will show jobs growth of 175 000  after adding just 20 000 positions in February 
The unemployment rate is seen at 3 8   unchanged from a month earlier

Other top tier economic data due this week includes durable goods orders  ADP  NASDAQ ADP  private sector payrolls  as well as the ISM survey on service sector activity 
A recent batch of underwhelming data stocked worries that the economy was fast losing momentum after growth slowed in the fourth quarter

Reuters reported previously that the two sides were negotiating written pacts in six areas  forced technology transfer and cyber theft  intellectual property rights  services  currency  agriculture and non tariff barriers to trade 
5  Brexit Stalemate
British Prime Minister Theresa May is facing a new push by members of her Conservative Party to lead Britain out of the European Union in the next few months  even if it means a potentially damaging no deal Brexit 
Conservative lawmakers urged May against a long extension of the Brexit process in a letter sent after her exit deal was rejected for a third time by the House of Commons on Friday  a lawmaker said 
On Monday  lawmakers will try to agree on an alternative to May s Brexit plan  The options that have so far gathered most support involve closer ties to the EU and a second referendum 
May has less than two weeks to convince the 27 other EU countries that she can solve the impasse  Otherwise she will have to ask the bloc for a long extension or take Britain out of the EU on April 12 with no deal to soften the economic shock

182273,403789,ADP,U S  trade deficit hits 10 year high  job growth slowing,news,"By Lucia Mutikani WASHINGTON  Reuters    The U S  trade deficit jumped to a 10 year high in October as soybean exports dropped further and imports of consumer goods rose to a record high  suggesting the Trump administration s tariff related measures to shrink the trade gap likely have been ineffective  Other data on Thursday showed private employers hired fewer workers than expected in November  pointing to a moderation in the pace of job growth  That was reinforced by another report showing a small decline in the number of Americans filing claims for unemployment benefits last week   The reports added to weak housing and business spending on equipment data in signaling a slowdown in economic growth  Concerns over the health of the economy have roiled financial markets in recent days   The Commerce Department said the trade deficit increased 1 7 percent to  55 5 billion  the highest level since October 2008  The trade gap has now widened for five straight months  Data for September was revised to show the deficit rising to  54 6 billion instead of the previously reported  54 0 billion  The politically sensitive goods trade deficit with China surged 7 1 percent to a record  43 1 billion in October  The United States is locked in a bitter trade war with China  Washington has imposed tariffs on  250 billion worth of Chinese imports to force concessions on a list of demands that would change the terms of trade between the two countries   China has responded with import tariffs on U S  goods  including soybeans  President Donald Trump has long railed against China s trade surplus with the United States  and accuses Beijing of not playing fairly on trade   In addition to the duties on Chinese goods  Washington has slapped tariffs on steel and aluminum imports into the United States this year  On Saturday  Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to hold off on imposing more tariffs for 90 days while they negotiate a deal to end the trade dispute  The truce appeared to be in doubt on Thursday following the arrest in Canada for extradition to the United States of Meng Wanzhou  the chief financial officer of Chinese technology giant Huawei Technologies Co Ltd and the daughter of its founder   We remain skeptical of a substantial trade deal   said Jake McRobie  a U S  economist at Oxford Economics in New York   Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the overall trade deficit rising to  55 0 billion in October  When adjusted for inflation  the goods trade deficit increased to  87 9 billion in October from  87 2 billion in September  The so called real trade deficit is above the average for the third quarter   Trade subtracted 1 91 percentage points from GDP growth in the July September quarter  Growth estimates for the fourth quarter are around a 2 8 percent annualized rate  The economy grew at a 3 5 percent pace in the third quarter  U S  stocks were trading sharply lower as Wanzhou s arrest sparked fears of a flare up in Sino U S  tensions  Prices of U S  Treasuries were trading higher while the dollar  DXY  was weaker against a basket of currencies  In October  exports of goods and services slipped 0 1 percent to  211 0 billion  Soybean exports  which have been targeted by China in the trade dispute and have been dropping for the last several months  fell  0 8 billion  Exports of civilian aircraft and engines also fell   But exports of petroleum and consumer goods were the highest on record  A strong dollar is probably restraining overall export growth  IMPORTS HIT RECORD HIGH Imports of goods and services rose 0 2 percent to  266 5 billion  an all time high  Consumer goods imports increased by  2 0 billion to a record high of  57 4 billion  boosted by a  1 5 billion jump in imports of pharmaceutical preparations  Motor vehicle imports were the highest on record in October  as were imports of other goods  Imports are being driven by strong domestic demand as well as the strong dollar  which is making the prices of imported goods cheaper  likely offsetting the impact of tariffs  Separately on Thursday  the ADP  NASDAQ ADP  National Employment Report showed private payrolls rose by 179 000 jobs in November after a downwardly revised increase of 225 000 in October   Economists polled by Reuters had forecast private payrolls advancing 195 000 last month following a previously reported 227 000 increase in October  The ADP report  which is jointly developed with Moody s Analytics  was published ahead of the government s more comprehensive employment report for November  which is scheduled for release on Friday  According to a Reuters survey of economists  nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 200 000 in November after surging by 250 000 in October  The unemployment rate is forecast holding steady at near a 49 year low of 3 7 percent  Though the ADP report has a spotty record predicting the private payrolls component of the government s employment report  job growth could be slowing  Part of the cooling is likely because of a shortage of qualified workers  In a third report on Thursday  the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 4 000 to a seasonally adjusted 231 000 for the week ended Dec  1  Economists had forecast claims falling to 225 000 in the latest week  Claims had risen for three straight weeks  touching an eight month high of 235 000 during the week ended Nov  24    There are distinct signs that the labor market has reached its peak   said Chris Rupkey  chief economist at MUFG in New York   Job layoffs are increasing  which fits hand and glove with the uncertainty businesses are facing over tariffs  and the stock market turbulence may have also dented confidence as well for companies who may be trimming their staff just a little just in case   A fourth report showed the Institute for Supply Management  ISM  said its non manufacturing activity index rose 0 4 point to a reading of 60 7 last month  A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector  which accounts for more than two thirds of U S  economic activity

With 13 of the 19 analysts that are following it rating ADP at  hold   which often really means  sell   ADP is a contrarian play 
One reason for analysts  sour outlook was that ADP  founded in 1949  had been slow to update its software to reflect current industry practices  hurting its competitive position  However  ADP has gone a long way towards resolving those issues  including making a couple of key acquisitions  It also recently acquired an international provider of payroll management services  considerably extending its global reach 
Thanks to those efforts  ADP has beat analyst earnings forecasts in each of its last four quarters  For instance  for its most recent quarter ending in September  earnings came in at  1 20 per share   0 09 above forecasts  and up 28 percent over year ago  ADP also raised nest year s EPS and revenue guidance  
ADP  currently paying dividends equating to a 2 4 percent yield  has a strong dividend growth track record  It announced an 11 percent raise in December 2017  followed by a 10 percent hike in June 2018  and then a 14 percent raise in November  To put all of that into perspective  ADP s  0 79 per share December dividend was 25 percent above its year ago payout 
All else equal  positive EPS surprises combined with higher future guidance  beat   raise  typically pushes share prices up  Consequently  thanks to its recent track record of consistent EPS surprises  even after the market sell off  ADP s still returned 12 percent  including dividends  for 2018 
The good news is that analysts are only forecasting 7 percent EPS growth for 2019  leaving plenty of room for further upside surprises  The stock made shareholders happy in 2018 and could continue its winning ways this year

182335,403851,ADP,Pershing Square analyst Brian Welch to leave company,news," Reuters    Willliam Ackman s hedge fund Pershing Square  NYSE SQ  Capital Management LP said on Tuesday that Brian Welch  who led research efforts on Automatic Data Processing Inc  O ADP   one of the firm s recent investments  was leaving the company 
In 2017  Ackman waged and lost a bitter proxy contest at ADP but more recently the stock has helped the hedge fund deliver positive returns for its investors 
Welch s departure comes only months after Ackman told investors that he was shrinking the firm  cutting mainly back office staff  Over the last years a number of investment staff members including Paul Hilal and William Doyle have left Ackman 
More broadly  at a time where many funds have struggled to deliver strong investment returns  the payout for the staff members have been in question  prompting a number of people to leave prominent hedge funds 
William Ackman s fund has gained more than 9 percent this year while his publicly traded fund is up double digits  marking a dramatic reversal for the billionaire investor after three years of losses 
Pershing Square said its investment in ADP will continue to be overseen by Ackman along with two other analysts after Welch s departure 
Pershing Square bought ADP shares for an average price of  105 in 2017  On Tuesday the shares closed trading at  138 60 
The company said its stake in ADP has generated a total shareholder return of about 35 percent and that it will continue to manage the size of its position in these funds 
 While we have and will continue to manage the size of the position in these funds by selling stock and options in light of its increased size  we expect to continue to be a large  long term and engaged shareholder  in ADP    Ackman said in a statement ",2018-06-19,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/pershing-square-analyst-brian-welch-to-leave-company-1499555,1499555
182336,403852,ADP,U S  regulator shelves reform on voting in board fights  sources,news,"By Liana B  Baker and Michelle Price NEW YORK WASHINGTON  Reuters    The U S  securities regulator has shelved a proposed Obama era reform that would have given shareholders in companies more freedom to vote for their preferred candidates during contested board elections  people with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters  The proposal made by the Securities and Exchange Commission  SEC  two weeks before President Donald Trump s election victory would have changed how shareholders vote during activist investor led fights for board seats  an issue that has divided companies and investors for years  SEC officials have said publicly in recent months that the proposed rule change remains a priority  raising hopes among activist investors who have pushed for changes  including Pershing Square  NYSE SQ  Capital Management s William Ackman  that the SEC will finalize and implement the rule soon  However  several people familiar with the matter told Reuters the Commission s new boss Jay Clayton has in fact shelved the proposal  in what will be a disappointment for many investors who say the current system favors company management in board fights  Right now  shareholders voting remotely have to choose from a full slate of board directors nominated by the management or a competing set of nominees provided by an activist investor   Unlike in many countries such as Canada and Australia  U S  investors cannot mix and match from these competing lists unless they send a representative to vote in person at the annual meeting   According to the SEC  the vast majority of votes in the United States are cast remotely  so such constraints can influence who ultimately ends up controlling the board and company strategy  Activist investors say the present system works against them because shareholders are more likely to play it safe and vote for the management list  even if they like some of the activists  candidates  Companies say changing the rules would spark more disruptive and harmful activist led fights  In October 2016  the SEC under Clayton s predecessor Mary Jo White proposed the so called  universal proxy  rule allowing shareholders to remotely vote from a mix and match list  But Trump s victory subsequently saw the Republican party  which is eager to loosen rules it says are deterring firms from going public  take over the SEC with Republican Commissioner Michael Piwowar becoming acting chair in January 2017 until Clayton s appointment in May 2017   The people  who declined to be named because internal SEC discussions are private  said the  universal proxy  proposal was dead for the foreseeable future  They said it was unlikely Clayton  a political independent who leans toward the right  would support the rule given he has said his priority is to boost company listings   While Piwowar  who strongly opposed the rule  finished his term this month  Clayton s vote would likely still be necessary to finalize the changes  one of the people said   For a rule change to pass  the majority of commissioners must vote for it   Hester Peirce  the other Republican commissioner  told Reuters she had  not come to any conclusions  on the issue and would need to review all the industry comments before doing so   The proposal is still on the agency s official long term agenda  but has fallen off a list of its 12 month priorities drawn up in March   While some senior SEC officials would like to reprise the rule  this is unlikely to happen under the current administration  the people said  Clayton declined to comment  CORPORATE LOBBY  Tim Goodman  director at Hermes EOS  the stewardship arm of Hermes Investment Management which advises clients with  464 billion of assets  says the current U S  system causes  practical difficulties for shareholders  including ourselves  who have to take account of the time and cost of attending the meeting in person   Goodman said that Hermes  which votes on behalf on clients who invests in more than 10 000 companies globally  would vote for different directors in some U S  board fights if the rules were changed  Kai Liekefett  head of the shareholder activism practice at law firm Sidley Austin LLP  said in several recent proxy fights  including the high profile contests at Automatic Data Processing  O ADP  in 2017 and DuPont  NYSE DWDP  in 2015  several large institutional investors were interested in voting for both activist and management candidates  but were not able to do so under the current system  While investors say they are losing out  business groups  most notably the U S  Chamber of Commerce  have lobbied to preserve the status quo  The influential group has argued the new rule would increase fights  balkanize boards  and discourage listings  according to a public letter  But investors and groups representing pension funds cite academic evidence disputing the notion it would favor activist investors and prompt more fights   A Harvard Law School study of contests between 2001 and 2016 found that a mix and match ballot did not favor special interests or spark more fights  In some cases  it could even favor the management  For example  New Jersey based Destination Maternity  O DEST   which had its entire board ousted after losing a shareholder vote in May  would have seen some management nominees keep their seats had investors been able to choose from both slates of candidates  according to people familiar with the vote   In fact  even without an SEC mandate  some companies adopt a universal proxy when they fear activist campaigns to replace their entire board are getting traction  because that way they can try to have some of their nominees voted through  Investors said they are not giving up   Chris Phillips  director of institutional relations at the Washington State Investment Board  said he met Peirce in March to try to persuade her to back the rule change   
 Requiring physical attendance at many shareholder meetings in order to exercise such votes is impractical and antiquated   Phillips told Reuters in an email ",2018-07-11,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/us-regulator-shelves-reform-on-voting-in-board-fights-sources-1524790,1524790

182378,403894,ADP,Ackman says ADP provided  misleading  claims to ISS  filing,news,"By Svea Herbst Bayliss
BOSTON  Reuters    Billionaire investor William Ackman on Monday accused Automatic Data Processing Inc  O ADP  of providing misleading and incorrect claims to Institutional Shareholder Services and asked the proxy advisory firm to reconsider its shareholder recommendations 
ISS on Wednesday issued a report to guide institutional investors in a vote next week where the hedge fund manager hopes to win three ADP board seats  The proxy adviser recommended shareholders largely vote for the company s slate but supported Ackman s election 
Ackman s filing  an usual criticism of a proxy adviser by an activist  came hours after the human resources outsourcing company s board chair John Jones said in a letter to shareholders that ADP is not underperforming and plans to improve margins and profit further 
 ADP provided non public  inaccurate and misleading information  claims  and arguments which were relied upon by ISS   Ackman said in a regulatory filing made with the U S  Securities and Exchange Commission 
ADP and ISS had no immediate comment on Monday 
Ackman s unveiled his stake of 8 3 percent  including 2 percent in common shares  in ADP in August  and has since criticized the company for what he calls sluggish earnings and inefficient operations  He plans to hold another investor webinar on Nov  1 
 ISS accepted  and in its Report has publicly endorsed  certain misleading or incorrect factual assertions made by ADP management during its engagement with ISS   Ackman said in the filing 
ISS said in its recommendation that shareholders should withhold their vote for ADP director Eric Fast to make room for Ackman but that the case was not  sufficiently compelling to justify replacing three directors  
Glass Lewis and Egan Jones last week both recommended all of Ackman s directors 
Ackman took aim at the projection provided by ADP s board chair on Wednesday  in which he said the company plans to improve its operating margin by 500 basis points between 2017 and 2020 and speed up its profit growth 
 This is a new and inaccurate disclosure that we believe is demonstrably false  and is intended to mislead shareholders and others about the lack of progress implied by ADP s plan   Ackman said in the filing 
Ackman also said that ISS failed to follow its own guidelines stating that it relies only on publicly disclosed information to reach its recommendations 
He flagged ADP s labor productivity figures and the reference to an  upcoming release  of the Vantage 2 0 platform in the ISS report 
 The disclosure that ADP is close to releasing a Vantage 2 0 product offering for the Enterprise segment is material  even more so in the context of this proxy contest   he said ",2017-10-30,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/ackman-says-adp-provided-misleading-data-to-iss-filing-760367,760367

182381,403897,ADP,Ackman makes new bet against Herbalife with options,news," Reuters    William Ackman said on Wednesday he has bought options to sell shares of  Herbalife  Ltd  N HLF  as a new way to bet against the nutritional supplement company he has described as a pyramid scheme   The activist investor took a  1 billion bet in 2012 that Herbalife s shares would fall by selling loaned shares which he hoped to buy back cheaper at a later date   Herbalife s shares have instead risen since then  partly due to the company aggressively buying back its own stock  On Wednesday Ackman said that the short stock position has been closed  Usually closing out a short position when a stock price has climbed signals that an investor has taken a loss  The move to options caps potential losses he might incur in the future    We converted the short stock position and replaced it with outright put positions   Ackman told Reuters   Ackman is sticking with his negative view on the company but seeking to limit the potential losses for his fund s investors if he had held onto the short stock position   Ackman said that potential losses on Herbalife will now be limited to 3 percent of the firm s capital   We can still lose money but the loss is capped   he said  For years  Ackman has said that the company would eventually crumble under regulatory scrutiny for operating what he has called a pyramid scheme  a claim Herbalife denies   Herbalife s stock price has soared some 50 percent this year and the company has been buying back shares  piling pressure on Ackman s  10 billion hedge fund as the cost to borrow the shares rose  Short positions  in which borrowed shares are sold in hopes they can be replaced later at a lower price  have the potential for heavy losses that increase as a stock s price rises  Put options give the holder the option to sell a stock at a set price  Analysts called it a savvy move and a more aggressive bet against Herbalife s future by limiting losses for his fund and opening the potential for larger returns  Herbalife s stock price has risen in part by its decision to buy back a big chunk of its shares  a move many in the market interpreted as Herbalife trying to pressure Ackman into giving up on his years long crusade against the company  Herbalife stock dipped 1 7 percent to  71 37 on Wednesday  Pershing Square  NYSE SQ  International  the firm s hedge fund portfolio  nursed small losses for the year through the middle of October after logging double digit losses in 2015 and 2016  The fund reported a 1 5 percent loss for the first six months of 2017  Pershing Square said in its interim financial report that Herbalife was the fund s biggest loser for that period with a 4 3 percent decline  For much of the last five years  since Ackman first unveiled the position in December 2012  Herbalife has been a thorn for Pershing Square as unrealized losses mounted  
While Herbalife has played a major role in Ackman s portfolio in recent years  Ackman quickly turned back to Automatic Data Processing Inc  O ADP  where he is campaigning for three board seats  He hosted another webinar on ADP on Wednesday  aiming to underscore his claim that the company is inefficient ",2017-11-01,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/ackman-says-his-firm-restructured-herbalife-position-cnbc-761768,761768

After yet another pop to record high in Asia session trade  equity indices were muted in moring European dealing while currencies remained quiet throughout on a night of little newsflow or economic data
It s been a generally quiet night of trade with EUR USD defending the 1 1000 figure yet again as the pair remains weak  Although data in the Eurozone has improved mildly over the past month trade in the pair is ignoring the fundamental data and trading on carry trade flows alone 
With Ms  Legarde making it clear that ECB monetary policy will continue to be accommodative for the foreseeable future European rates are likely to remain negative for at least another year or perhaps more  That  in turn  has made the euro the new yen  That is the currency is now the favorite funding source for a variety of carry trades and now trades essentially on risk on risk off flows 
Little wonder then that the pair verticalized a few days back when equities sold off and has now dripped lower as equities reach fresh highs  For now  with equities in consolidation mode the EUR USD has found a modicum of support around the 1 1000 level but whether it holds that figure or not will be contingent exclusively on how stocks fare for the rest of the week 
To that end  the market has been in a near parabolic run fueled by the geyser of global central bank liquidity and somewhat positive US economic data  Yesterday the ADP report showed the strongest growth private nonfarm payrolls since 2015  but the good news was not confirmed by ISM Non Manufacturing report which saw the employment component slip to 53 1 dropping by 1 7 points  The ADP  NASDAQ ADP  data may be skewed by warm weather  but the ISM numbers though much more modest confirm that employment remains comfortably in the expansion mode 
Still  the risk of a downside print in NFP may be the one factor that could usher in a more meaningful correction in this relentless move higher if markets begin to understand that growth will be hampered despite central bank largesse ",2020-02-06,Boris Schlossberg,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-euro-the-new-yen-200505106,200505106
182399,403915,ADP,NFP Preview  Will Blowout ADP Reading Translate To NFP ,opinion,"BackgroundEvery month  we remind traders that the Nonfarm Payrolls report is significant because of how it impacts monetary policy  In other words  the Federal Reserve is the  transmission mechanism  between U S  economic reports and market prices  so any discussion about NFP should start with a look at the state of the U S  central bank While Jerome Powell and company ostensibly maintained their neutral outlook at last week s monetary policy meeting  the Federal Reserve Chairman did hint at a mild dovish shift within the committee  By emphasizing that the Fed is determined to avoid a prolonged period of low inflation  Powell cracked the door open for a potential interest rate cut later this year  Accordingly  fed funds futures traders have started to price in that possibility  with the market now pricing in about a one in three probability of a rate cut by June  33   and a three in four  77   chance of at least one rate cut by the end of the year  according to the CME s FedWatch tool Against this backdrop  the market may be more sensitive to a soft employment report  which could pull forward the timeline on a potential interest rate reduction  than to a stronger reading  That said  this effect may be somewhat muted by the fact that we have another NFP report early next month before the Fed reconvenes to discuss the economy and monetary policy again NFP Forecast
From our perspective  there have been four historically reliable leading indicators for the NFP report 
The ISM Manufacturing PMI Employment component rose to 46 6  an improvement over last month s 45 2 reading  though still in contractionary territory  
The ISM Non Manufacturing PMI Employment component fell to 53 1  down from last month s 54 8 reading 
The ADP Employment report surged to 291k  the strongest reading in nearly a half decade and a big improvement over last month s revised 199k reading 
The 4 week moving average of initial unemployment claims fell to 214 500  down from 224 00 last month 
In other words  the leading indicators are generally positive this month  with three improving  including the truly massive ADP  print  and just one deteriorating  At this point  we d be remiss if we failed to at least mention coronavirus  with the NFP survey taking place in mid January  and most of the disruption still limited to China in any event   we don t expect any impact on tomorrow s jobs report from the virus outbreak  Weighing these factors and our internal models  the data points to a potentially stronger than expected jobs report with headline job growth in the 170k 210k range 
Regardless  the month to month fluctuations in this report are notoriously difficult to predict  so we wouldn t put too much stock into any forecasts  including ours   Most importantly  readers should note that the unemployment rate and  especially  the wages component of the report will also influence how traders interpret the strength of the reading

Risk flows ripped to the upside in early European trade after Chinese scientists stated that they may have found an effective drug against the coronavirus while UK scientists stated that they may have a vaccine in a matter of months rather than years 
The news lifted investor spirits and sent stock index futures to fresh record highs as markets continued to ignore any negative impact of China s economic lockdown  Markets are now in full melt up mode aided by massive central bank liquidity and improving economic fundamentals that have completely quashed any concerns over the lingering effects of the pandemic in China 
On the economic front  the final PMI data from both EU and UK was better than forecast with the former printing at 51 3 vs  50 9 eyed while the later came in at 53 9 vs  52 9 forecast  However  the only cable benefited from the good news as the pair rose above the 1 3050 level while euro lagged dropping to a low of 1 1022  The EUR USD decline may have been caused by carry trade flows  The pair is now one of the favorite funding instruments for the carry trade and tends to move on risk on risk off flows rather than any fundamental data 
Cable  on the other hand  received a real boost from much better than expected services sector data which saw the new orders component rise to 54 1 from 50 5 as post Brexit optimism clearly kicked in  It s still too early to tell who the UK economy will fare under the new regime  but global financial markets in a buoyant mood the UK services sector should remain supported for the time being and that in turn will keep cable supported as well 
In North America today  all eyes on the ADP and ISM Non Manufacturing report  The risk rally has been driven by massive central bank liquidity but also the narrative that US growth will continue to expand at a solid pace  The improvement in ISM Manufacturing data earlier this week helped fuel the bull thesis and if today s eco data can confirm equities could trade to fresh record highs as the day proceeds  On the other hand  and sharp surprise to the downside could quickly bring in some profit taking flows after the massive run we ve had so far ",2020-02-05,Boris Schlossberg,https://www.investing.com/analysis/risk-rips-again-on-virus-cure-hopes-200504670,200504670

Separately  the ISM Services PMI survey came in above expectations at 55 5  boosted by improvements in business activity  new orders and imports  That said  the slight deterioration in the employment component of the report took some of the shine of the strong ADP  print  tune in Thursday for our preview of what these reports mean for Friday s marquee Nonfarm Payrolls release  
Not surprisingly  the perception that the U S  economy is chugging along despite coronavirus disruptions overseas has boosted the greenback  the day s strongest major currency along with the Australian dollar  Looking at the world s most widely traded currency pair  EUR USD has fallen to test a critical support level near 1 10  This level  technically 1 0992  marks the pair s lowest closing price over the last four months and has served as support on four distinct occasions over that period

	The NASDAQ has been leading the market recently and was the only major index not to fall into negative territory for 2020 during the virus selloffs  But it lagged its counterparts on Wednesday because of Tesla  NASDAQ TSLA  
	In addition to the coronavirus and earnings season  this electric car company and cultural phenomenon was one of the biggest stories in the market as it soared over 50  in 7 days

	However  it s now less than 60 points away 
	Speaking of the coronavirus  there were some reports today that progress was being made on a vaccine or some type of treatment  However  the World Health Organization threw some cold water on those stories  So the sickness keeps spreading  but isn t frightening the market as much as in the previous two weeks

182437,403953,ADP,Wall Street s Buy Everything FOMO Trade Continues In Asia As Havens Unwind,opinion,"Wall Street stock indices all hit record highs overnight as the Wuhan virus unwind spreads faster than the virus itself  Another night of impressive U S  data led by a blowout 291 000 climb in ADP Employment saw Wuhan virus concerns recede further in the minds of global investors  News stories suggesting breakthroughs in the treatment of the Wuhan coronavirus had earlier in the day propelled markets ever higher  with equities and oil rallying and Treasury yields climbing 
Notably  though  the World Health Organization commented that there was no known treatment available for the coronavirus  nor was there on the horizon  It highlights the information gap between what we actually know about the Wuhan virus  and what we hope we know  The latter is predicated on assumptions that treatments are near and that China s lockdown of 60 million people in the epicenter  Hubei province  is bearing fruit  That is a lot of assumptions  and with asset markets now back to recycle the world s savings glut FOMO trade at a breakneck pace  any negative headlines displacing the narrative  could have an outsized and rapid negative effect 
Undeniably though  the economic data trickling in for January has yet to show any severe spillovers in economic growth from the Wuhan virus  I suspect that story is still to come through  Last night s ADP  NASDAQ ADP  Employment mega print has yet to feed through to upward revisions in Fridays  Nonfarm Payrolls though  The street is still looking for an increase of 160 000 jobs  implying that a degree of caution remains around the accuracy of the ADP data 
Some central banks are taking no chance  however  Yesterday the Bank of Thailand  BoT  cut by 25 basis points to a record low of 1 0   as did the Brazilian Central Bank  cutting 25 basis points to 4 25   The BoT cut made sense with Thailand s critical tourism sector on the frontlines of a Wuhan slowdown  and with room on the currency front after a long rally over 2019 by the baht 
The Monetary Authority of Singapore  MAS  surprised markets by commenting that there was room to weaken the NEER a currency mechanism that Singapore uses in lieu of an official cash rate for monetary policy to offset a Wuhan slowdown  With no policy decision expected from the MAS until April  the comments saw USD SGD explode higher  jumping from 1 3730 to 1 3850  The Singapore dollar is now 400 points weaker from its pre Wuhan levels in early January  Authorities in Singapore will have to tread a fine line from here  though  lest they draw the ire of U S  currency manipulator hawks in Washington DC 
Today  we have rate decisions from the Reserve Bank of India  RBI  and the Philippines Central Bank  BSP   Of the two  the RBI decision is the less clear cut  Stuck in a stagflationary situation with rising inflation and falling growth  the RBI is in somewhat of a quandary  This comes after an expansionary budget and increased deficit spending announced by the government last Saturday 
The decision will be a close call  I am erring to the side of a precautionary cut of 0 25  and damn the torpedoes on inflation  as economic growth fears outweigh price targets  Unfortunately for the RBI  no matter what its decision is  it is likely to be received negatively by both the currency market and onshore equities market  Such are the joys of stagflation 
The BSP will almost certainly shave 0 25   cutting to 3 75   following the BoT s example and trying to get ahead of the game  With the peso also enjoying an extended period of strength  the central bank has room to move  Interestingly though  regional central banks  overtly dovish monetary policy bias is in direct contrast with the super charged optimism prevalent on equity markets  Once again  investors should mind the information gap 
EquitiesWall Street climbed to record highs overnight as strong U S  earnings continued  economic data outperformed  and markets were awash with rumors of coronavirus cures around the corner  As we know  in this day and age  markets are expert at fitting the facts to the narrative they want to see  That was undoubtedly the case overnight as the buy everything FOMO trade continued its long march  The S P 500 rose 1 12   the NASDAQ rose 0 43  despite Tesla  NASDAQ TSLA  falling 17  over the session  and the Dow Jones rose an impressive 1 70  Asia has continued in much the same vein  The Nikkei 225 has risen 1 80   the KOSPI by 1 25  with the Shanghai Composite and CSI 300 both up by 1 25   The Hang Seng has risen 1 50   but the Singapore Straits Times has climbed only 0 25   It would appear that investors in Singapore are not buying into hype elsewhere and remained more concerned about the effect on earnings of local companies from a growth slowdown in China The momentum is clearly with the bulls at the moment  and we see no reason to stand against that tide  The potential for an aggressive and rapid correction lower still lurks though  if negative Wuhan virus headlines emerge CurrenciesThe USD SGD was yesterday s big mover in Asia as the MAS released very dovish comments  As a world trade bellwether  Singapore s SGD has sunk from 1 3450 to 1 3850 since the start of the Wuhan virus outbreak  The fact that the sell off continues despite the irrational exuberance displayed in other markets should be a warning sign that perhaps we are yet at the end of the tunnel 
Elsewhere  the U S  rose overnight as U S  Treasury markets continued unwinding the haven trades of last week  with yields continuing to rise  Alongside a buoyant stock market and the end of the Trump impeachment trial  there were many reasons not to own dollars  with the USD JPY climbing to 109 90 and EUR USD falling back below 1 1000 after soft eurozone Retail Sales 
Asian markets are broadly unchanged today with most of the action likely to be in petro currencies later on in the session as oil continues its tentative recovery  The Norwegian krone and Russian ruble  in particular  are likely to have bright starts against both the U S  dollar and euro 
OilHopes that a coronavirus vaccine is near and the emergency OPEC  meeting rolling into a third day today propelled oil markets higher overnight  Brent crude rose 2 70  to  55 45  and WTI leapt 2 80  to  51 05 a barrel  Not even a much higher than expected official U S  Crude Inventories number could dampen the enthusiasm Asia has fully embraced the worst is over theory with both contracts jumping again this morning  Brent crude rising 60 cents to  56 30 and WTI climbing 70 cents to  51 75 a barrel I suspect that a combination of two things drives much of the enthusiasm  The expectation that OPEC  will come to the party with more production cuts today  And an awful lot of fast money madly chasing its tail intra day on oil markets  generating short term trading momentum  With the latter being noise  the former looms as much more critical  If OPEC  fail to announce more cuts to support prices  the oil rally could vanish as quickly as it began GoldGold had an intriguing session overnight  although it ranges were unremarkable  Gold once again tested the  1550 00 regions  probing lower to  1547 00 an ounce at one stage  However  despite the myriad of reasons to not own gold yesterday  it still managed to close higher at  1556 00 an ounce 
Gold has stubbornly refused to close below the  1550 00 every day this week  and that suggests that quite a bit of caution remains around the Wuhan virus fall out despite the noise in other asset classes 
Gold is condensing into a narrow  1550 00 to  1560 00 range implying that a breakout is imminent  The indicators suggest that should be lower  but there is clearly much buying interest at the  1550 00 level  Bears may wish to wait until  1545 00 breaks before jumping aboard the train downhill  Gold s refusal to role over though is a warning sign for celebratory markets elsewhere  however ",2020-02-06,Jeffrey Halley,https://www.investing.com/analysis/wall-streets-buy-everything-fomo-trade-continues-in-asia-as-havens-unwind-200505061,200505061

182459,403975,ADP,ATTO Vs  ADP  Which Stock Should Value Investors Buy Now ,opinion,"Investors with an interest in Outsourcing stocks have likely encountered both Atento  ATTO  and Automatic Data Processing  ADP  NASDAQ ADP    But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks  Let s take a closer look 
The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits 
Atento has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while Automatic Data Processing has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold  right now  This means that ATTO s earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive  so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook  But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors 
Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional  tried and true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics  including the popular P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors 
ATTO currently has a forward P E ratio of 14 32  while ADP has a forward P E of 28 39  We also note that ATTO has a PEG ratio of 1 43  This metric is used similarly to the famous P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock s expected earnings growth rate  ADP currently has a PEG ratio of 2 18 
Another notable valuation metric for ATTO is its P B ratio of 0 87  The P B ratio is used to compare a stock s market value with its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  ADP has a P B of 14 12 
Based on these metrics and many more  ATTO holds a Value grade of A  while ADP has a Value grade of D 
ATTO is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook  which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model  And  based on the above valuation metrics  we feel that ATTO is likely the superior value option right now ",2020-01-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/atto-vs-adp-which-stock-should-value-investors-buy-now-200503649,200503649
182460,403976,ADP,If History Repeats Itself  SARS Versus Coronavirus,opinion,"If history repeats
No one can tell what s going to happen in the market  not you  not I  and indeed not Wall Street  hence it s essential to listen to the messages the market tells you daily  
The market is so finely tuned that  in a matter of 5 trading days  its self correcting mechanism takes hold without the need for central bank policy  One of the more undervalued market mechanisms is how quickly financial conditions loosen  From Friday a week past highs to peak fear last Friday  the bond markets shaved off a whopping 30 basis points on ten year US yields  which sent the dollar lower  and it provides looser financial conditions in the US market  
Also  we know the Fed is a reactionary committee  and history reminds us of the disinflationary shock from SARS that pushed the Fed into a final insurance cut in 2003  And with the Fed struggling to ignite the inflation fires  a rate cut this spring or summer is becoming the base case in quick order 
Monday Open
The markets continue to view the Wuhan virus through the lens of the SARS epidemic of 2002 03  Still  given the importance of China in the global supply chain 2020 vs  2003  the risk might be that the market is not alarmist enough  And by the looks of Friday s New York session price action  where traders unanimously voted with their feet preferring to hold long volatility positions ahead of the Monday s China post Lunar New Year market open   its support that view  The thinking is there s a chance Chinese  d  m   traders hit the panic button out of the gates before the expected PBoC policy measures or the markets mean reversion algorithms kick in  
As far as China risk  it s hard to predict if the catch up trade trap door gap lower at the open will extend Monday  typically it does during big meltdowns  Still  history reminds us that we should be reasonably confident the Financial Stability and Development Commission  part of the People s Bank of China  will offer support  Their new light touch attitude  when it comes to the market s intervention  will probably give way to the old guard heavy handed approach  as well they will possibly instruct the so called  national team  to hold the line of support on equity markets to ensure an orderly open 
At the time of writing  the PBoC has pre announced  170 billion in added liquidity for the Monday open  This is well beyond the band aid fix  and if this deluge doesn t hold risk off at bay  we are in for a colossal beat down  In addition  the PBoC will likely intervene on the currency market  so I would expect them to layer the soothing market tiger balm on thick and heavy 
The Chinese government established the so called  national team  of financial institutions to buy stocks with public funds directly  It also started a campaign to hunt down  financial crocodiles   whose trading practices were blamed for numerous mainland market crashes 
So  try to ignore initial headlines around price fall at the open in China since the markets have been closed for a week as the drop is only reflecting a catching up with the broader proxy moves from last week  It s not the earthquake at the open but rather the aftershocks that will drive risk sentiment on Monday
But and this is a big but 
It doesn t seem like there is much rational thinking going on given the mortality rate remains low  while comparisons and extrapolations to SARS seem questionable  However  this is a market that appears to be reasonably fragile when it comes to confidence  And without the usual stock market rally to help paper over the cracks  I suspect investors will take few chances when it comes to running risk on Monday  And they re probably only a step away from moving into sell first ask question later mode 
SARS vs  WARS
The biggest threat to the global economy is not just because the disease spreads quickly across countries through networks related to global travel  But also  because any economic shock to China s colossal industrial and consumption engines will spread rapidly to other countries through the increased trade and financial linkages associated with globalization 
However  two reasons the coronavirus outbreak may hit the financial market harder than SARS did in 2003 are 1  consumption is now a more substantial part of China s GDP and 2  China s overall growth trajectory  In 2002  retail sales for 34  of nominal GDP  this share is now over 40 
While comparisons between the SARS and coronavirus are beyond tricky  for those looking to play the big rebound play  keep in mind that in 2003 the entire backdrop was completely different as most risky assets were already at the lows  not highs  after the tech bubble blow up and US recession  So  looking at the stream of rebound comparison is invalid on so many levels 
Wuhan Virus Toolbox
It s injudicious for anyone in the market to offer any strong views on how this virus will play out  But instead  traders need to come up with a reactive game plan  which I ve tried to simplify below to get you thinking in the correct direction 
Remain focused on the daily flow of confirmed cases and when they peak  In the unfortunate event that the virus s spread is not contained  the impact on the global economy will likely be much more severe than it was during the time of SARS  China s share in the global economy and in global trade is colossally more significant by multiples than what it was 17 years ago 





Bloomberg
The  starting points  on global GDP and trade growth are much weaker  Although China has policy room to accommodate a short term shock  its ability to do so is limited by structural deficiencies that prevent policymakers getting the money into the hands of those that need it the most and are probably more limited now than at the time of the previous health scares  such as SARS 





Bloomberg
Market positioning could be a concern  but I don t want to be the alarmist  Still  according to most metrics  up until last week s equity futures long positioning had continued to rise to new records  call volumes have surged to the highest since October 2018  and sentiment indicators are at the top of their historical band  Over the last three months  equity funds have also seen inflows of  75bn  the strongest since early 2018  with cyclical sectors being big beneficiaries  especially Tech  Financials  and Industrials  Indeed  the market s fear factor has given way to greed  which could leave current positions precariously perched  Pullbacks of 3 5  in the S P 500 have been typical every 2 to 3 months historically  but now we ve stretched to about 3 5 months since October market knockdown  If a significant  Wu Flu  risk wobble occurs  we could see more profound positioning unwinds as a pandemic panic ensues  That situation has become a real possibility 





IMM Data
There is nowhere that China s economic influence is more on display than in Asia  The key driver of ASEAN s steady growth over the past decade has been the rapid growth in bilateral trade with China  China has been ASEAN s largest trading partner in the past ten years  with two way trade reaching  292 billion in the first half of 2019  And thus  makes the rest of Asia extremely vulnerable to a China economic slowdown At some point this week  the market may begin to focus on a few rebound trades  however  ASEAN traders will also look at risk from two different perspectives  Economies that are tourist and service providing to China and that will not recoup lost spending   i e   Thailand and Singapore  Both could continue to struggle for months ahead l  Whereas manufacturing and commodity exporters that could see pent up demand rebound later in the year will probably see much of the initial rebound flow if virus fears deescalate and the transitory trade sets in  Currency Markets 

The greenback was under pressure across G10 into month end rebalancing  USD JPY got hit the hardest and it struggled to get back above 108 50 even on the short squeeze mini bounce into the weekend  Rebalancing isn t solely to blame for this move   it s a bit of a catch up move with USTs and risk in general  Downside levels are at 107 90 107 65 
The weakest ASEAN links in the basket are the most obvious  THB and SGD   so other than covering USD shorts on Friday interbank traders were flocking to those paths of least resistance    
If history repeats itself as was the case in 2003  Singapore MAS could let the doves fly while the Bank of Thailand will most certainly bring forward a rate cut to ward off the damaging effects on the tourism sector  Both of which could significantly weaken those two currencies 
On the IMM data  and after a short five weeks being short the US Dollar  the tape indicated investors flipping aggressively back into dollar longs  as a safe haven hedge  At the same time  total open interest declined to a 2 1 2 year low  Investors increased EUR and AUD shorts while also reducing GBP  CAD  and MXN length

Oil markets
The Oil market has caught more than a case of the sniffles  China s larger oil market footprint  5 7 MMB d in 2003 vs  13 9 MMB d today  raises the potential for enormous demand devastation given Chinas current oil demand profile in comparison to the SARS epidemic era 
According to  Deutsche Bank   DE DBKGn    Early estimates of the impact on oil demand growth are around 100 kb d  raising this year s oversupply to 1 MMB d  This assumes the disruption is limited to the first quarter and suggests Brent prices may remain USD 60 bbl  below  






Although oil bulls are hoping on a wing and a prayer that an early OPEC meeting  February instead of 5 March  raises the prospect of greater supply discipline  but this is by no means certain given OPEC s current low level of output and the general consensus among OPEC ministers who believe the market impact will be smaller than the current level of market fear priced into the equation  
Regardless of the outcome of the 2019 nCoV epidemic  oil prices may have further to fall and will generally remain under downside pressure due to the toxic combination of extreme demand destruction and excess non OPEC supply 
Gold markets
Gold gains on massive demand as a hedge against coronavirus concerns  in a position build up that is now expected to challenge USD1 600 oz near term  Gold continues to benefit from the need for risk off positioning as investor sentiment tanks and the economic devastation reality check sets in as equity market traders have pivoted from buying the dip to selling the fact  






Gold propped up as US equities weakened  and yields fell  with the yield on the US 10 year Treasury easing to 1 502   But just as significant of short term traders  as was the case for the disinflationary shock from SARS  that pushed the Fed to a final  insurance  cut in 2003  with the Fed struggling to ignite the inflationary flame  a rate cut this spring is quickly becoming the market base case and extremely bullish for gold 
For now  the weaker US dollar is factoring positively into the equation as the market brings forward a Fed interest rate cut  which should weaken the US dollar and provide a positive knock on fillip for gold prices  
Gold has clearly benefited from the turmoil emanating from the coronavirus and the Iran conflict earlier in the month  However  if both tails fade gold positioning could be a bit of a problem  and with physical demand remaining weak  traders will need to be extremely alert to plateaus in virus headcount or mortality rates on a daily basis

The week ahead
 The other risk here is that all the bandwidth is being taken up by the virus  while there are plenty of other issues to consider 
A new NBC WSJ poll puts Bernie Sanders in the lead  the first time he has been at the top of a national survey  even if statistically tied   Sanders leads on 27   Joe Biden is on 26   Elizabeth Warren is on 15   and Michael Bloomberg has crept up into the fourth spot with 9   This should be a significant risk for both the USD and US equities if this trend continues and Trump s popularity wanes in the head to head polls with Sanders 
Buckle up for a US economic data deluge 
This week s economic docket includes the granddaddy of data releases  the January employment report  Friday   which will take on a heightened level of importance given the at the markets are now in the process of pricing in Fed rates cuts sooner than later  As well  we have the January manufacturing ISM  49 8 vs  47 8  along with Wednesday s non manufacturing ISM  55 5 vs  54 9  and ADP  NASDAQ ADP  employment survey  150k vs  201k  will set the tone going into Friday s employment report

S P 500 daily returns for the past seven days which is a very typical risk off progression but nothing too crazy on the downside yet 







Friday 3 30 AM SGT  Yes real traders wake up at 3 AM when things look gnarly  Hmm WHO put there stamp of approval on China containment efforts  Traders quickly move to reduce over hedged USDCNH and Gold longs and buy back a chunk of those Oil shorts as WHO opposes restrictions on travel to China or trade with it  Everyone seems to agree  although they know things are going to get worse before better  It s the herd mentality that also influences trading momentum when uncertainty is rampant 
Friday 9 20 AM SGT Social media goes frantic when close to 10 000 total confirmed cases of the virus were reported  which means its spreading at a faster pace than during SARS   however  during SARS  the data was arguably underreported  partly as it coincided with the war in Iraq   The market pared risk  but the WHO decree was too fresh in trader minds to trigger a more prominent sell off   
Friday Asia Noon SGT  Now traders think its time to square the books and add some defensives hedges against a possible Monday market meltdown  Still  no significant market moves as big Asia traders are mostly hedged via proxy or in cash now looking for the transitory reversion play this week  
Friday London opens Asia is hedged but probably not over hedged  which begets a more prominent tail risk on Monday  none the less the London market continues to de risk and gingerly buys more bonds underscoring the bid for gold  However  the big guns in London were somewhat complacent to the downside  which could contribute to a more significant Monday open tail risk 
Friday New York  Proprietary and discretionary traders get into the office early after following the proceedings in Asia the night before  And are now thinking that they need some defensive hedge as the markets are looking a bit ugly 
Friday New York Opening Bell  Splat   Cross asset traders unanimously move in to buy more US bonds and to sell the Spooz  On the currency market  FX traders cover USD shorts as rates markets are starting to price in a summer Fed rate cut and opt for the path of least resistance and buy USD vs   SGD  THB  and CNH  to hedge weekend risk and probably add a bit of over hedge for a punt against the China Monday open  
Friday New York 2 00 PM  Now traders think they are too short as the market has only sold off
Saturday  Everyone reads the Armageddon prophecies  the worst case scenarios  and just how bad Fridays beat down was  But more importantly  the fear factor sets in due to a deluge of insane amounts of negative coverage 
A New Week Dawns
Monday Open  Market gap lower as expected selling initially builds  and then it would usually cascade into Europe and then New York  This is what typically happens but not sure how much of a force the  national team   will be and how effective the PBoC massive liquidity injection remains the question mark  But its lot of cash and could keep the market on an even keel
Monday New York  Normally the lows would hit around 1  4 PM EST  and then markets start to revert 
Tuesday Asia  Yup another Turnaround Tuesday and the shorts get painfully squeezed 
Wednesday  The teeter tooter battle of the bulls and the bears 
Thursday  Unless there a slow down in the virus spread  traders get nervous again and put on the hedges they took off the day before

182462,403978,ADP,Strong Private Sector Payrolls In January,opinion,"Monthly private sector payrolls from Automatic Data Processing   NASDAQ ADP   for January posted their highest level this morning since May 2015  to a whopping 291K new private sector jobs having been created last month  This is almost double the 150K or so analysts had been expecting  The previous month s headline  itself a big upward surprise when first released at 202K  has only come down 3000 to a revised 199K 
The breakdown in type of job continues to advance Services over Goods  237K to 54K  respectively  This amounts to job gains in service industries accounting for 77 3  of all new private sector jobs in the U S  last month  This bears out when we see the top two industries on the January ADP print  Leisure Hospitality and Education Healthcare  bringing in 96K and 70K new non government jobs  respectively 
That said  Construction brought in a healthy 47K new private sector jobs for the month  Manufacturing  which has been experiencing some difficult headlines in various metrics of late  still managed 10K for January  Medium sized companies  between 50 and 499 employees  continued to lead the way last month with 128K positions filled  followed by Small firms with 94K and Large companies at 69K  These are strong figures  however you slice them 
The ADP report  of course  pre dates Friday s all inclusive non farm payroll report from the U S  Bureau of Labor Statistics  BLS   Currently  expectations are for between 155 165K new jobs created for January  still well off today s positive surprise from the ADP report  This follows a December BLS headline of 145K  Clearly  the BLS and ADP numbers are not aligned currently  though history shows they do tend to trend together over time 
One caveat ahead of Friday s number  however  is a one yearly change to benchmark BLS data scheduled to occur in the next report  Analysts have already warned there will be a downward revision to January s numbers  which would further indicate the BLS results Friday morning will be significantly lower than today s ADP surprise  Further  the Unemployment Rate is expected to stay unchanged at a half century low 3 5   while wage growth has stayed stubbornly low in the face of such a robust employment picture  only having grown 0 1  in the December report 
December s Trade Deficit numbers also hit the tape ahead of the bell this morning  with a headline slightly worse than expected to   48 9 billion  This follows a downwardly revised November read of   43 7 billion  Though these numbers are not great  they are at least off the bottoming out we saw back in December 2018  when our trade deficit sank to   60 billion  Historically  there was no concern about the U S  trade balance until about the 1980s  when borrowing to support a growing U S  economy skyrocketed  This got much worse in the first decade of the 21st century

182463,403979,ADP,Risk Appetite Stays Supported  USD Traders Await Data,opinion,"Risk sentiment remained supported yesterday  with Nasdaq hitting a new record high  It seems that investors remained optimistic that China s policy steps would relieve pressure on the economy from the coronavirus  In the FX world  the Kiwi was among the gainers  but mainly due to the risk on trading environment rather than New Zealand s employment report  As for today  USD traders are likely to pay attention to the ISM non manufacturing PMI and the ADP employment report  both for January 
RISK ASSETS CONTINUE TO GAIN DUE TO CHINA S POLICY 
The dollar traded mixed against the other G10 currencies on Tuesday and during the early Asian morning Wednesday  It gained against JPY  CHF and EUR in that order  while it underperformed versus SEK  AUD  NOK and NZD  The greenback was found virtually unchanged against GBP and CAD 







The weakening of the safe havens yen and franc and the strengthening of the commodity linked Aussie and Kiwi suggest that risk appetite remained supported for the second consecutive day  Indeed  major EU and US indices were a sea of green  with Nasdaq hitting a new record high  while the S P 500 and the DJIA notched their biggest daily gains in six and five months respectively  The upbeat mood rolled over into the Asia session today as well  with Japan s Nikkei 225 and China s Shanghai Composite rising 1 02  and 1 25  respectively 







Although the fast spreading of the coronavirus continues  with the death toll rising to 493 and the confirmed cases surging to 24531  investors kept increasing their risk exposure  perhaps due to optimism that China s policy steps would relieve pressure on the economy from the virus  On Monday  the PBoC lowered interest rates on reverse repurchase agreements  the seven day reserve repo rate and the 14 day tenor  all by 10 bps  while up until yesterday  it injected a total of 1 7 trillion yuan into the market via reserve repos  What s more  sources said that the Bank is likely to lower its loan prime rate on February 20th  and also cut the reserve requirement ratios in the weeks to come 
It seems that investors have started putting some faith on China s steps to prevent the virus from badly harming economic activity  but we are still reluctant to say that the worst is behind us  They may continue diverting flows from safe havens to riskier assets for a while more  but with the virus spreading at an exponential pace  we hesitate to call for a long lasting recovery  We prefer to wait for news and headlines that the virus has been really contained before we start assuming that the euphoria will last for long  Many believe that the virus will affect both Chinese and global economic activity in Q1  but they also believe that the blow will be short  However  with no signs that the virus could be stopped soon  further spreading may raise concerns of an even more serious impact  and if this continues for a few more weeks  the economic wounds could well drag into Q2 
Back to the currencies  the Kiwi was among the gainers  mainly getting benefited by the broader market sentiment rather than New Zealand s employment data overnight  The unemployment rate ticked down to 4 0  from a downwardly revised 4 1   However  given that the employment change revealed no new added jobs  the decline in the unemployment rate may have not been for the good reasons  Indeed  with the participation rate sliding to 70 10  from 70 40   the slide in the unemployment rate may be owed to many people being discouraged to register as unemployed and seek for a job 







At its latest meeting  the RBNZ surprised investors  who were largely pricing in a rate cut  and instead decided to stand pat  That said  officials maintained their easing bias  saying that they will add further monetary policy stimulus if needed  Back then they noted that employment remains around its maximum sustainable level and thus  combined with the acceleration in the nation s CPI rate to 1 9   just a tick below the midpoint of the Bank s target range of 1 3   a not so disappointing employment report may allow policymakers to wait for a while more before they decide to cut  Having said all that  the big risk to that view is the fast spreading coronavirus which could have a negative impact on New Zealand s economy  Let s not forget that New Zealand is one of China s main trading partners 
NZD JPY   TECHNICAL OUTLOOK
Although NZD JPY continues to trade below its short term tentative downside resistance line drawn from the high of January 17th  recently  the bulls have been very active by trying to push the rate back to that downside line  There is still a bit of room left until that line could get tested  but if the pair fails to break and stay above it  this may lead to another round of selling  That is why  overall  we will remain somewhat bearish  at least for now 
There is good likelihood that the rate could continue drifting north up until it might hit the aforementioned downside line  which if remains intact  could attract the sellers back into the game  If so  NZD JPY may slide back to the 70 88 hurdle  which is the high of January 31st  a break of which could clear the path to some lower areas  One of those areas might be the 70 42 level  marked by an inside swing high of February 3rd 
Alternatively  if the above discussed downside line breaks and the rate climbs above the 71 87 barrier  marked by the high of January 26th  this would also place the pair above its 200 EMA on the 4 hour chart and more buyers could join in  That s when we will target the 72 35 obstacle  a break of which may set the stage for a push to the 72 70 level  marked by the high of January 22nd  Slightly above it runs another short term tentative downside line  which could provide additional resistance to NZD JPY and keep it down for a bit 







ISM NON MANUFACTURING PMI AND ADP  NASDAQ ADP  REPORT ON TODAY S AGENDA
Flying back to the US and the dollar  today its traders may pay attention to the ISM non manufacturing PMI for January  as well as to the ADP employment report for the month  The ISM index is expected to have held steady to 55 0  which combined with the positive surprise in the manufacturing print on Monday and a potentially decent employment report on Friday may allow market participants to push further back the timing of when they expect another cut by the Fed  According to the Fed funds futures  investors have already pushed that action back yesterday  from July to September  perhaps due to expectations that China s steps will not allow the virus to weigh much on other economies 







Now with regards to the ADP report  it is expected to show that the economy has gained 156k jobs  less than the 202k job gain in December  This may raise speculation that the NFP print  due out on Friday  may come slightly below its forecast of 160k  However  bearing in mind that the correlation between the two time series has fallen in recent years  we believe that the ADP is far from a reliable predictor of the NFP number  Even last month  the ADP  NASDAQ ADP  accelerated to 202k from 124k  but the NFPs slowed to 145k from 256k  Taking data from back in January 2011  the correlation of those time series  no revisions are taken into account  is now standing at 0 41  The ISM non manufacturing PMI for January and the nation s trade balance are also coming out 







EUR USD   TECHNICAL OUTLOOK
After almost testing the short term tentative downside line taken from the high of December 31st  EUR USD reversed back to the downside and seems to have set sail towards January low  The RSI and the MACD seem to be supporting the idea of seeing a bit more downside  as the RSI is below 50 and the MACD is below its trigger line  and has moved fractionally below zero  Therefore  as long as the pair remains below the above mentioned downside line  we will continue aiming lower 
Another small slide could bring EUR USD to the 1 1017 hurdle  marked by the low of January 31st  which may provide temporary support for the pair  If so  the rate might rebound and make its way a bit higher  That said  if it stays below the aforementioned downside line  this could trigger another round of selling  possibly bringing EUR USD below the 1 1017 zone and targeting lower areas  That s when we will aim for the 1 0992 hurdle  which is the lowest point of January  or for the 1 0980 level  marked by the lowest point of November  2019 
In order to shift our view to the upside  we would first like to see a break of the previously mentioned downside line and a push above the 1 0995 barrier  marked by the high of last week  More bulls may see this as a good opportunity to join in  as such a move would confirm a forthcoming higher high  That s when the rate may rise to the 1 1118 obstacle  a break of which could open the door for a move to the 1 1172 level  marked by the high of January 16th 







AS FOR THE REST OF TODAY S EVENTS
During the European morning  we get the final services and composite PMIs from the Eurozone and the UK  Again  the final prints are expected to confirm their preliminary estimates  Eurozone s retail sales for December are also due to be released  The mom rate is expected to have declined to  0 5  from  1 0   but this will push the yoy rate up to 2 5  from 2 2  
In the US  apart from the ISM non manufacturing PMI and the ADP report for January  we get final Markit services and composite PMIs for the month  as well as the trade balance for December  The final Markit prints are expected to confirm their initial numbers  while the nation s trade deficit is anticipated to have widened to USD 48 20bn from USD 43 10bn  Canada s trade data for December are also due to be released  with this nation s deficit expected to have narrowed 
With regards to the energy Market  we get the EIA  Energy Information Administration  weekly report on crude oil inventories for last week  which is expected to reveal a 2 831mn barrels increase  a slowdown from 3 545mn barrels the week before  That said  bearing in mind that the API  American Petroleum Institute  reported a 4 180mn inventory build  we see the risks surrounding the EIA forecast as tilted somewhat to the upside 
As for tonight  during the Asian morning Thursday  markets in New Zealand will be closed in celebration of the National Day  From Australia  we have trade and retail sales figures  both for December  The nation s trade surplus is expected to have increased  while retail sales are anticipated to have declined 0 2  after rising 0 9  in November  However  this will push the qoq rate for Q4 up to 0 3  from  0 1

182464,403980,ADP,Gold ends two day rally  amid soft U S  private payrolls,news,"Investing com    Gold futures fell slightly on Wednesday ending a two day rally  as disappointing U S  jobs forecasts painted a bleak outlook for Friday s critical nonfarm payroll employment report 
On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange  gold futures for June delivery fell 3 80 or 0 32  to 1 189 40  Gold rose to a session high of 1 196 90 following the jobs release in U S  morning trading before falling to a daily low of 1 187 50  Since the start of April  gold futures have remained in a range of  1 170 at the low end and  1 215 at its peak 
On Wednesday  payroll processing firm Automatic Data Processing Inc   NASDAQ ADP  said in a monthly report that private payrolls increased by 169 000 nationwide for the month of April  The forecasts are just below the low end of consensus estimates at 170 000 and significantly below high estimates of a 205 000 gain  ADP also revised private payrolls for March downward by 14 000 to 175 000 
In March  nonfarm payrolls increased modestly by 126 000 on a month to month basis falling precipitously from a 264 000 gain a month earlier  The unemployment rate in March remained unchanged at 5 5   while the labor force participation rate ticked down 0 1  to 62 7   Average hourly earnings  meanwhile  increased by 0 3   up from a 0 1  gain in February 
The Federal Reserve will keep a close eye on Friday s job report  as it takes a data driven approach to the timing of its first interest rate hike in nearly a decade  Any significant improvements in the labor market could convince the hawks on the Federal Open Market Committee to push for lift off in June  By the same token  another month of modest job gains could persuade the Fed to delay a rate hike to September or possibly even December 
Metal traders appears hesitant to make any drastic moves in either direction before Friday s release 
Gold  which is unattached to dividends or interest rates  struggles to compete with high yield bearing assets in high interest rate environments 
Also on Wednesday  Fed chair Janet Yellen warned of the potential dangers from high stock valuations in an appearance with International Monetary Fund head Christine Lagarde at the Institute for New Economic Thinking in Washington  Responding to a question from Lagarde at the institute s Finance and Society Conference  Yellen indicated that while the Fed is somewhat concerned about financial stability in the equity markets  it is not worried about potential bubbles forming   I would highlight that equity market valuations at this point generally are quite high   Yellen said   There are potential dangers there

182486,404002,ADP,Animal Spirits Roar Back  Indices Recover As Dollar Builds On Gains,opinion,"Overview  
The S P 500 recovered from a 10 day low to reach a new record high  which set the tone for the Asia Pacific and European markets today  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index jumped by the most in a month with the Nikkei s 2  advance leading the way  More broadly  the markets in Taiwan  South Korea  Hong Kong  India  and Thailand all rose more than 1   Europe s Dow Jones Stoxx 600 was up a milder 0 5   but its third successive advancing session has seen new record highs  US shares are trading firmer as well  Yields in the Asia Pacific region were pushed higher by the backing up of yields seen in the US yesterday  but European yields are narrowly mixed  and the US 10 year is little changed near 1 87  
The dollar is building on yesterday s gains against the major currencies  but the risk on mood is evident in the strength of the emerging market currencies  Except for Eastern and Central Europe  emerging market currencies are mostly higher  led by the nearly 1  rally in the South Korean won  The JP Morgan Emerging Market Currency Index is pushing higher and testing the 200 day moving average  Gold and oil staged big key reversals yesterday  After reaching a peak near  1611 yesterday  gold reversed lower and finished near  1556  Today it saw  1540 before stabilizing  February WTI reached  65 65 before plummeting to almost  59  Oil prices unwound the earlier knee jerk gains and were given an extra push by the unexpected build of US crude inventories  according to the EIA  It is consolidating around  60 today 
Asia Pacific
Consumer prices steadied in China at the end of last year  December s CPI was unchanged from November s 4 5   The market had looked for a small increase  Food prices continue to be a key driver  Pork prices are up 97  from a year ago  Vegetable prices were 10 8  higher  and the price of eggs was 6 2  above year ago levels  However  there is some sign that pork prices may have peaked  They actually fell by 5 6  in December  Importantly core inflation remained at 1 4   The elevated CPI did not prevent the PBOC from cutting reserve requirements late last month as officials look through the supply driven rise in food prices  Today s report does not change things   disinflation remains an underlying issue  Producer prices fell 0 5  year over year in December  which was a bit more than expected  though a slower pace than the 1 4  decline in November  The Lunar New Year  later this month  will distort price  output  and sales figures  and a clean read might not be available until March 
Earlier today  Australia reported a larger than expected November s trade balance  even when taking into account the downward revision in the October series  It is a good reminder that last year as many countries experienced slower exports  Australia s trade surplus exploded  Consider that Australia reported an A 5 8 bln surplus in November  That is just above the average through November of A 5 75 bln  In the first 11 months of 2018  the average monthly trade surplus was near A 1 75 bln  Data from Port Hedland showed the iron ore exports surged in December 
After staging a massive upside reversal against the yen yesterday  the dollar is extending its gains today  The greenback fell to JPY107 65 amid the knee jerk reaction yesterday and then rallied to almost JPY109 25  Late in the European morning  it is approaching JPY109 50  Recall that in the second half of last month  the dollar encountered stubborn resistance near JPY109 70  The two yen rally in 24 hours leaves the short term technical indicators over extended  There is a  2 4 bln option at JPY109 25 that expires today that might attract prices  The Australian dollar is not drawing much comfort from the risk on mood or the trade figures  The Aussie is pinned near yesterday s lows    0 6850   The next downside target is found near  0 6820  The Chinese yuan has continued to strengthen and reached a five month high today   CNY6 9220   While some observers debate whether the US will lift the  fx manipulator  designation  it does not seem to have mattered much 
Europe
Germany surprised  The mood was sober after the poor factory orders data that was reported yesterday  Today  Europe s economic engine reported a larger than expected 1 1  rise in November industrial output  the most in a year and a half  October s 1 7  decline was revised to only a 1  fall  The year over year contraction moderated to  2 6  from a revised  4 6   This is the smallest year over year decline since March  While German retail sales have been robust and foreign demand remains problematic  Germany reported today that exports in November fell 2 3   much worse than expected and the second worst of last year  Imports were also weaker than expected  falling 0 5   which offset the gain in October  The overall trade surplus narrowed to 18 3 bln euros from 21 3 bln  
Sterling is the weakest of the major currencies today  shedding about 0 5  by around midday  Three considerations appear to be weighing on the pound  First  BOE Carney comments suggest the debate about cutting rates continues within the MPC and that if the economy weakens more  it would be compelled to act quickly  Short term rates in the UK fell on the comments  Second  UK retail sales over the holidays seemed to be boosted by discounts  and share prices of the UK s largest retailers are under pressure today  Third  the fear that the UK EU negotiations could fail to reach an agreement this year  which  without delay  would be very disruptive a year out  
The euro has frayed support at  1 1100  but it appears to be steadying in the European morning  There are options for 2 bln euros struck between  1 1090 and  1 1110 that expire today  A move above  1 1125  where another expiring option for 650 mln euros has been placed  is needed to help lift the technical tone  There is a third set of options placed at  1 1150 for 1 2 bln euros  Sterling was sold to about  1 3020 in Europe before finding a bid  Initial resistance is likely to be seen in the  1 3050  1 3070 area  with the upper end of the range holding a nearly GBP270 mln option that will be cut today 
America
The light US economic calendar today keeps the focus on tomorrow s employment data  The ADP  NASDAQ ADP  data was stronger than expected but may not have generated much insight into the official report  ADP 2019 averaged 162 7k and 163k in the last two months  In 2018  the average was 219k  The US nonfarm private payrolls rose an averaged 165k a month through November  The average in the first 11 months of 2018 was 214k  Month to month  the ADP shows great volatility with the Bureau of Labor Statistics  but averages show that there is a good fit  It also means that the ADP estimate  which was stronger than expected  tells investors little about Friday s employment report 
No fewer than six Fed officials speak today  In addition to Governor Clarida  two other voting members are on tap  NY s Williams  NYSE WMB   and Minn s Kashkari   Barkin  Evans  and Bullard will also be speaking  There appears to be as close to a consensus at the Fed as there has been in some time  The dissents to last year s rate cuts have rotated off the Fed  and the forecasts from last month showed 14 of the 17 officials expect policy to be on hold this year 
Canada reports December housing starts  and November permits today  However  the data  which are not typically market movers in the first place  are overshadowed by tomorrow s employment report  Recall Canada lost 71k jobs in November  and that set the tone for a string of disappointing economic reports  except for CPI  which remained firm  Another disappointing report would likely spur speculation that the Bank of Canada may have to contemplate easing policy  Mexico reports December CPI figures today  Less price pressures will keep the door open to Banxico easing this year  The official interest rate target rate is 7 25   Inflation appears to be running near 2 8  year over year  The high real and nominal yields attract interest hungry savings but also weighs on the weak economy  Brazil reports November s industrial production figures  The 0 7  decline expected would be enough to push the year over year rate back below zero for the first time since August 
We have been looking for the US dollar to recover against both the Canadian dollar and Mexican peso  The former is cooperating  The greenback has bounced from around CAD1 2950 CAD1 2960 at the start of the week to nearly CAD1 3060 in Europe today and approached the  50   retracement objective of the last leg down  Above CAD1 3065 would likely target the CAD1 3090 CAD1 3100 area  The Mexican peso has ignored our call for a correction  The risk on mood and Mexico s high yields are keeping the greenback pinned near MXN18 80  The risk off spike to MXN19 00 seemed to have attracted new dollar sales  The dollar has been trading in a clear range against the Brazilian real since mid December or BRL4 00 BRL4 10  Our bias is for a higher dollar  perhaps toward BRL4 15 BRL4 18 over the next week or so ",2020-01-09,Marc Chandler,https://www.investing.com/analysis/animal-spirits-roar-back-indices-recover-as-dollar-builds-on-gains-200497478,200497478

following Tehran s retaliatory attack  President Donald Trump s comment that America will not go for a full on war and will instead embrace peace provided some relief to investors However  Trump added that additional economic sanctions will be imposed immediately on Tehran until the nation stops supporting terrorism and abandons its nuclear program  Precisely  the de escalation in tensions between Washington and Tehran is likely to help Wall Street maintain its uptrend Middle East Tensions De escalateAfter the recent U S  airstrike killed Iran s top commander General Qasem Soleimani in Baghdad  Tehran retaliated by firing more than a dozen ballistic missiles at U S  troops in Iraq  Although Tehran s retaliation initially shook the global market  Trump s comment has calmed investors Trump said that the retaliatory attack hasn t hurt American troops and that the United States will thus not take any military action Easing Trade WarLast December  Washington and Beijing agreed to the terms of a historic phase one trade deal   likely to be signed on Jan 15  2020  As part of the accord  the United States called off the Dec 15 implementation of 15  tariffs on  160 billion worth of China goods   comprising toys  laptops  cell phones and clothing  Beijing also didn t proceed with the retaliatory tariffs of 25  on American autos that were set to go into effect on the same day Moreover  Washington has decided to halve the tariff rate levied on Sep 1 on a list of Chinese goods  worth  120 billion  to 7 5   However  to leverage negotiations for the second phase in 2020  the United States has kept its 25  duty on  250 billion worth of Chinese goods in place In the next two years  Beijing will ramp up purchase of goods and services from Washington by at least  200 billion  added U S  officials  The list of goods to be purchased comprises manufactured goods  agricultural goods and energy  With this  the U S  officials believe that the country s  419 billion trade deficit with China will be significantly lowered  which in turn will boost the nation s GDP Precisely  Beijing has vowed to step up its purchases of agriculture products from Washington by  32 billion in the next

182488,404004,ADP,December  19 Jobs 145K  Unemployment 3 5 ,opinion,"Friday  January 10  2020The long expected non farm payroll report for December from the U S  Bureau of Labor Statistics  BLS  has been released ahead of today s opening bell  and results were a little lower than expected  though far from abysmal   145K new jobs were created last month  down from the consensus 160K  The Unemployment Rate was unchanged at half century lows of 3 5  The private sector brought in 139K new jobs in December according to this survey  down considerably from Wednesday s ADP   NASDAQ ADP   report that showed 202K private sector jobs created last month  This would leave 6000 new jobs the balance from the government side  which indicates   upon the rise of a new decade   U S  census layoffs have yet to register in these numbers  As 2020 moves along  we should see government hiring post lower figures  perhaps even to the negative Revisions for the past two months also pointed downward  November s boffo 266K originally reported is now trimmed to a still great 256K  while October s 152K now reported gives up 4000 hires from the initial number  This brings the 3 month average of job gains to a more than respectable 184K  which is greater than about any analyst could have reasonably guessed this time a year ago Average Hourly Earnings grew last month  but only by 0 1    or 3 cents per hour  to an average hourly wage of  28 32  This comes to year over year wage growth of 2 9   which is 20 basis points lower than originally reported this time a month ago  It also represents the smallest annual gain since July 2018  and remains the only dent in the armor of a years long robust U S  labor market  anybody who wants a job can apparently have one  but perhaps for less money than desired Interestingly  the breakdown by industry is not what one might expect coming out of a holiday hiring season  Retail led the way with 41K new jobs  followed by Leisure Hospitality at 40K and Healthcare at 28K  Where we saw monthly job losses was  12K in Manufacturing  perhaps related to our ongoing trade war with China  and  10K for Transportation  which  based on how much online holiday shopping gets done in the modern age  might be the ex holiday payroll effect we may have expected from the Retail industry Labor Force Participation remained steady at 63 2   while the U 6 figure   often referred to as  real unemployment    fell to an all time record low of 6 7   So whatever disappointment might be felt from this morning s headline BLS number could be countered by this U 6 number Pre market futures have melted from their highs prior to the employment release  but remain in positive territory   25 on the Dow   29 on the Nasdaq and  6 on the S P 500  While the opening gains appear to be more modest  the continue to build on all time market highs  Happy Friday Mark VickerySenior Editor

182489,404005,ADP,Dollar  What To Expect From U S  Jobs Data,opinion,"The greenback saw mixed dynamics on Thursday as safe haven demand has waned somehow amid easing geopolitical tensions in the Middle East amid the US Iran conflict  As Trump has calmed down global markets  the threat of a full blown war receded  along with risk aversion 
Now  market focus gradually shifts to the upcoming U S  jobs report due later today  As a reminder  the ADP data pointed to a rise in private sector employment by over 200 000  while the November figure was revised substantially higher  Judging by this report  one can expect strong numbers today  which in turn may push the greenback higher across the board  But it should be noted also that the ADP  NASDAQ ADP  and NFP data are not often correlated  so there is a risk that the release may disappoint  By the way  apart from jobs data  wages will also matter for market participants as this component serves as an inflation indicator 
Anyway  as the USD index remains relatively elevated  further signs of easing geopolitical concerns could prompt some profit taking in the dollar against high yielding currencies  As for EUR USD  the pair briefly dipped below the 1 11 handle on Thursday and failed to stage a decent recovery  As long as the euro remains below the 200 DMA at 1 1140  bearish risks prevail ",2020-01-10,Helen Rush,https://www.investing.com/analysis/dollar-what-to-expect-from-us-jobs-data-200497954,200497954
182490,404006,ADP,Automatic Data Processing  ADP  Beats Q2 Earnings Estimates,opinion,"Automatic Data Processing  ADP  NASDAQ ADP   came out with quarterly earnings of  1 52 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 45 per share  This compares to earnings of  1 34 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 4 83   A quarter ago  it was expected that this payroll and human resources company would post earnings of  1 33 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 34  delivering a surprise of 0 75  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
ADP  which belongs to the Zacks Outsourcing industry  posted revenues of  3 67 billion for the quarter ended December 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 26   This compares to year ago revenues of  3 51 billion  The company has not been able to beat consensus revenue estimates over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
ADP shares have added about 4 6  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 1 4  
What s Next for ADP 
While ADP has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for ADP was unfavorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  1 98 on  4 08 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  6 16 on  14 99 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year 
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  Outsourcing is currently in the bottom 35  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2020-01-28,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/automatic-data-processing-adp-beats-q2-earnings-estimates-200502583,200502583

	Since we re more than halfway through the week and still not at war with Iran  the market decided this was a good day to get back to rallying 
	Last night  we were all holding our breath after reports of Iran striking military bases in Iraq that included American soldiers  The market has been waiting for some kind of retaliation after this past weekend s airstrike that killed Iran s top military commander 
	However  this morning we woke up to news that there were no casualties in the missile attacks and that Iran appeared to be  standing down   according to President Trump 
	The major indices had been idling before POTUS  comments  and then moved sharply higher 
	The Dow jumped 0 56   or about 161 points  to 28 745 09  The index had been north of 280 points at its height of the session  but the momentum waned in the final hour  Nevertheless  it s still a vast improvement over the more than 400 point loss in the futures overnight 
	The S P hit a new intraday high and seemed poised to close at a record  but it too got caught up in the late swoon  It still rose 0 49  to 3253 05 
	But the good old NASDAQ held on enough to finish at an all time closing high by advancing 0 67   or around 60 points  to 9129 24 
	Let s not get ahead of ourselves  though  The U S  relationship with Iran will remain tense  as it has for the last 40 years or so   We ll be susceptible to any kind of headline out of the region  such as rumors of explosions in Baghdad today that probably led to the late pullback 
	However  fears of an imminent war between the two countries appear to be exaggerated at the moment 
	Meanwhile  lost in the shuffle on Wednesday was a strong ADP  NASDAQ ADP  employment report  Companies added 202 000 jobs last month  which was well above expectations

Bond markets in Asia Pacific played catch up after US 10 year Treasury yields tumbled by the most in nearly four months yesterday  10 bp to 1 71    A disappointing Q3 GDP from Australia fanned expectations of an asset purchase program next year to send the 10 year bond yield down 13 bp  to  1 05    European benchmarks are slightly higher  as are Treasury yields

Australia s data was not as poor as the price action suggests  Q3 GDP came in at 0 4   which was slightly lower than expectations  but Q2 GDP was revised to 0 6  from 0 5   The year over year pace was spot on expectations at 1 7   and growth in Q2 was revised to 1 6  from 1 4   The composite PMI was revised to 49 7 from 49 5  While there is much talk about an asset purchase program  it is not imminent  With the cash rate at 75 bp  there is scope for another cut or two before QE would be considered 
India may move passed the UK and France this year to hold claim to being the fifth largest economy in the world this year  Yet the Indian economy slowing down and the Reserve Bank of India is likely to cut rates tomorrow for the sixth time this year  The repo rate began this year at 6 5   It now is at 5 15   The economic slowdown in China commands attention  Still  India  with a completely different political system and economic structure  is experiencing a sharp downturn despite the rate cuts  tax reductions and aid to troubled companies  Investors learned last week that the Indian economy grew 4 5  from a year ago in Q3  which is the first sub 5  reading in six years  In Q3 18  the economy grew by 7 0   That said  the November PMIs rose  and the composite now stands at 52 7  the highest since July  There is an underlying similarity between China and India  and that is a key problem that stems from non bank financial institutions  shadow banking   The economic slowdown is squeezing the entrepreneurs that relied on it for funding  Both the rupee and yuan have declined about 2 6  against the US dollar this year  but India s rates are twice China s  two year yields are around 5 35  and 2 65  for India ad China  respectively and the 10 year rates are near 6 45  and 3 2    While China s inhumane treatment of Muslims has been brought to the world s attention  India s actions in Kashmir have escaped much scrutiny 
The dollar  which began the week at its highest level against the yen since May   JPY109 75   extended its losses earlier today to dip briefly below JPY108 45  It has stabilized and is testing previous support  which now may serve as resistance  in the JPY108 80 JPY109  00 band  There is a roughly  375 mln option at JPY109 that expires today  The Australian dollar s two day rally that lifted it a little more than a cent met a key retracement target yesterday a little above  0 6860 and was ripe for profit taking today  Today s decline found support today after giving up nearly half of its two day advance  A break of the  0 6780 area would suggest the squeeze is over  The Chinese yuan edged higher today  but the PBOC s reference rate was set to weaken the yuan by the most since August  The dollar closed last week near CNY7 0325 and reached CNY7 0735  highest since October 23  today before pushing back belowCNY7 06  Some linked the recovery to lingering hopes that a US China deal can be struck over the next 11 days 
Europe
The eurozone composite PMI was revised to 50 6 from the flash reading of 50 3  and leaving it unchanged from October  However  several developments are concealed by the aggregate report  First  German data were revised higher  The services PMI stands at 51 7  up from the 51 3 flash report and putting it slightly above the October reading  The composite edged to 49 4 from 49 2 of the flash and 48 9 in October  This lends addition credence to our argument that the German economy is on the mend  albeit slowly from weak levels  Second  France went in the wrong direction  Both the services PMI and composite were revised lower from the flash report and showed small deterioration month over month  Third  Spain defied expectations for weakness as both the services and composite gained  At 51 9  the composite is at a three month high  Fourth  Italy disappointed  The service PMI fell to 50 4 from 52 2  and the composite below back below the 50 boom bust level  49 6  for the first time since May 
The UK PMI was not quite as weak as the flash reading suggested  but the services and composite readings remained below 50  They both stand at 49 3 from 50 0 in October  The flash report had them at 48 6 and 48 5 for the services and composite  respectively  Separately  we have noted that the Bank of England has been building its currency reserves at twice last year s pace  average monthly increase through October of   1 5 bln vs    750 mln in 2018   However  it slowed to a crawl last month  rising only by  49 mln  the weakest since a decline was posted this past March 
The euro traded between roughly  1 1065 and  1 1095 yesterday and is within that range today  A break of the  1 1040  1 1050 area now would suggest the counter trend bounce is over  It has not closed off the  1 10 handle since November 5  Sterling is trading at seven month highs against both the euro and dollar as traders appear to be increasing their exposure as they feel more confident about next wee s election outcome  Sterling reached almost  1 3065  The euro has traded down to nearly GBP0 8480  In late European morning turnover  sterling s gains are being pared  The breakout levels can be retesting    1 30 and GBP0 8500  
America
The US House of Representatives passed a bill yesterday that allows the sanctioning of Chinese officials for the repression of Muslims  The bill differs from the Senate version and must be reconciled before the president can sign the measure  China has threatened to retaliate and may sanction the bill s sponsors  but it would be seen as a badge of honor by many  US officials still seem to be hopeful that the  talking and fighting  will not stand in the way of a trade agreement before Trump makes a decision about the December 15 tariffs  
The Bank of Canada meets today  There is practically no expectation that it eases policy  The overnight target is 1 75   At its last meeting  the central bank seemed to soften its neutral stance  but it clearly signaled no great urgency to cut rates  It survived this year s three rate cuts by the Fed and a slowing of the US economy without easing policy 
There appears to be some movement with the USMCA  After talks with the House Democrats  the US trade negotiators have asked Mexico  the only one of the three parties to have passed NAFTA s replacement  to exclude biologics  This is a significant climbdown for Republicans  who  like some large pharmaceutical companies  have insisted on the inclusion  Mexico s decision is awaited  but if it agrees  there is a path to House approval  perhaps on December 20  the last session before the holiday break  e
The US sees the ADP  private sector jobs estimate   135k from 125k in October  and the final PMI and non manufacturing ISM  Recall that the manufacturing PMI rose to seven month highs while the manufacturing ISM eased to 48 1 near the cyclical trough  The most important report  though  is the jobs data at the end of the week  which should be flattered by the return of GM strikers 
The US dollar is stuck in a range between roughly CAD1 3260 and CAD1 3330 for a little more than two weeks  We continue to favor a downside break  and it has to go back below CAD1 3200 to denote anything significant  The market has sold into dollar gains above MXN19 60  Initial support is seen near MXN19 50  We note that other currencies in the region  especially Brazil s real and Chile s peso have stabilized  and this helps ease some of the pressure on the peso  Chile s central bank meets today and is expected to cut rates by 25 bp to 1 50   Lastly  a word about the S P 500  It gapped lower yesterday before reversing higher and closing on its highs  A bullish hammer candlestick may have been traced  The gap extends to about 3110 80  which will likely offer resistance  The gap created by the November 1 higher opening that we thought was significant was closed yesterday  and this is understood as a positive technical development ",2019-12-04,Marc Chandler,https://www.investing.com/analysis/new-trade-dispute-escalation-weighs-on-market-200489822,200489822
182524,404040,ADP,First Green Session Of December ,opinion,"Just one day after dropping on fears of a trade deal delay  the market rebounded Wednesday and broke its three day skid as the sentiment again turned on the long awaited Phase 1 agreement 
	As we ve said before in this commentary  if you don t like today s trade headline  just wait a while and it will change 
	The news today included President Trump saying the trade talks were going very well and Bloomberg reporting that the two countries are getting closer to a deal that might include rolling back tariffs 
	Just yesterday  the market freaked out on a stray comment from the President that he wouldn t mind waiting until after the election to strike up a deal with China 
	Remember how the market took trade headlines in stride when it was making new highs a couple weeks ago  Not anymore  Now it s reacting to each headline as we inch closer and closer to the additional tariffs scheduled for Dec  15 
	For today  the headlines were positive and the indices finally ended their losing streak and saw their first green of December 
	The S P advanced 0 63  on Wednesday to 3112 76  while the NASDAQ increased 0 54   or about 46 points  to 8566 67  The Dow rose 0 53   or nearly 147 points  to 27 649 78 
	The indices did come off the highs by the close  but they got back some of the approximately 2  that was lost in the previous three sessions and undoubtedly soothed lingering fears of another December collapse 
	Stocks rose despite soft data from ISM Services and ADP  NASDAQ ADP  Employment  which further shows how trade is the market s main focus right now 
	So what s your guess for tomorrow s headline 
	Maybe it ll be that the two sides finally worked out a deal that will be signed directly  leaving any additional tariffs   and some current ones   completely unnecessary 
	Well  let s not hold our breath on that one Today s Portfolio Highlights Value Investor  Shares of Canadian Solar  CSIQ  are up nearly 19  this year  but had been higher about 45  just a few months ago  Along with the entire solar industry  the stock got  battered  in the second half after a  blistering  start to 2019  CSIQ dropped more than 26  in just the past three months  However  analysts believe the industry s tough times are in the past and are bullish on 2020  Therefore  it looks like there s a buying opportunity for one of the world s largest solar companies  In addition to all the classic value fundamentals  it is also enjoying rising earnings estimates  Tracey thinks CSIQ has been overlooked by Wall Street for long enough  and decided to add a position on Wednesday  Read the full write up for more Home Run Investor  The portfolio made a swap on Wednesday by selling OneSpaWorld  OSW  after it slipped to a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  and replacing it with the addition of Select Medical Holdings  SEM   This healthcare company owns long term acute care and inpatient rehabilitation hospitals  as well as occupational health and physical therapy clinics  In late October  SEM reported a strong quarterly report that included a positive surprise of 50   Earnings estimates have been on the rise  which explains its status as a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  stock  Read Brian s complete commentary for a lot more on this new pick Counterstrike   Stocks ticked higher on positive China trade rhetoric Yes  the same headline I seem to write every day helped stocks higher once again  However  this is just the market we have  One day talks are bad  the next days the talks are good and the market reacts accordingly 
	 Today we went higher after Trump said China talks were going well at the NATO Summit press conference  This the day after he said we won t get a deal till after the election  Who knows what the tweet will be tomorrow  but for now stocks like the tone and we saw relief 
	 We have an important day coming that will give us a big clue how strong this market can remain  December 15th additional tariffs will go on Chinese goods  assuming Trump sticks to his promise  It will be very interesting to see how the market reacts  I would guess an exaggerated sell off that will be bought  but who really knows      Jeremy Mullin
	All the Best

182533,404049,ADP,Asia Wrap  December Is Not Going To Go Out Quietly,opinion,"December is not going to go out quietly
I think the market could be starting to feel the same 
Even with Trump s lieutenant quickly walking back this week s trade talk bombast  still  his propensity to stir the headline pot suggests it won t be a quiet end of the year for investors 
However  judging by recent equity and bond market flows  investors do appear to reduce risk and protect their gains for the year likely respecting December market tumult from years gone by  
Spec traders appear to be running things close to their chest  Bond traders are showing an inclination to run small shorts while equity traders seem just as happy to job and then revert the headline risk via small clips on short term horizon views 
Equity market positioning 
As we move deeper into December  positioning is one of the critical factors that could influence markets  More prominent macro names have been running long speculative positions through the recent period of equity strength  And given that they hold more significant exposure in the US than they do in EU equities  the risk is for a more pronounced US equity market sell off in the absence of a trade talk positive December  is real   
The US Dollar amid global equity allocations
But assuming things carry on as status quo  so what could this mean for the dollar  At first blush and given global equity market allocations  there shouldn t be much of a US positive position squeeze  And since foreign investors tend to under hedge their US asset risk  they are probably long their fill of US dollars even more so as the US data is showing early signs of curdling into 2020 
Currency Markets 
New Zealand Dollar 
RBNZ announced the new bank capital buffers earlier  with a phase in period over seven years  The longer duration than the previously expected five years was taken positively by the market  which had feared that a shorter implementation period would force the RBNZ to remain in an eternal dovish stance  RBNZ Governor Orr subsequently came out and claimed that the central bank is now  in a hold phase   Whether that means until February or beyond remains to be seen  but the market immediately scaled back on easing expectations  NZDUSD traded from 0 6525  cleared the 200dma pivot at 0 6543  but technical indicators are looking a bit scary with the market way overbought  so I would think the market needs to shed some excessive baggage before we move higher again 
Australian dollar 
Following yesterday s weaker than expected Australian GDP  retail sales also came out weaker today  The market dumped AUDUSD and AUDNZD but soon ran into demand for both  The Aussie healthy current account surplus is cushioning the economic blows 
The Malaysian Ringgit
The Ringgit got a significant boost from the 4   bounce in the Oil price overnight and continues to trade on a more welcome note on the back of trade talk calm  Also  the weaker US economic data so far released this week has kept the US dollar on its back foot heading into tomorrow s crucial NFP  After the soft ADP  NASDAQ ADP  prints  downward revision to the NFP headline are also weighing on US dollar sentiment  
Gold markets 
Given uncertain macro conditions heading into 2020  there is a strong case for investors to hold gold as critical asset allocation  but the significant risk is a comprehensive trade deal  better growth  and higher rates which remain the essential factors of downside position squeeze 
But in the current environment where uncertainties remain high  and rates are low  especially with equities at all time highs  fortunately  many investors now recognize golds necessity in the current climate 
I still expect gold to trade through 1600 supported by my views that trade war will linger  and the economic drag from tariffs will force the Fed to cut interest rates 2 3 times in 2020 and weaken the dollar  All enormous positives for gold
As mentioned  the critical risk on this view would be a comprehensive trade deal with a significant chunk of tariffs rolled back that would stimulate trade flows and economic growth  cause the Fed to raise rates and strengthen the dollar  In this case  it wouldn t make sense to own gold as the economic outlook would be much brighter  and the cost of owning haven assets like gold becomes much higher  
Ultimately when it comes to glittering gold appeal  it s all about the opportunity cost of risk free asset returns as measured by the real 10y Treasury yield  As such a higher bond yield are hugely negative for gold",2019-12-05,Stephen Innes,https://www.investing.com/analysis/asia-wrap-december-is-not-going-to-go-out-quietly-200490196,200490196

Bloomberg surveyed 43 economists  They all expected the Reserve Bank of India to cut rates earlier today  It did not  The central bank cited rising inflation expectations despite weakened growth prospects  Ir has cut rates five times this year  Officials made it clear  However  this was not the end of the easing cycle but a temporary pause  October inflation was above the 4  target while growth slowed to its weakest pace in six years  Indian bond yields  among the highest in Asia  and surged about 13 bp  The rupee edged higher 
The Reserve Bank of Australia left the cash rate at 75 bp when it met earlier in the week  While it claimed to be prepared to cut rates again  it seemed in no hurry  Today s disappointing retail sales report and smaller trade surplus strengthen the market s confidence that the RBA will have to deliver early next year  A Reuters survey showed economists expected a 0 3  increase in October retail sales  In fact  they were flat  which matches the worst since April  Separately  Australia reported an October trade surplus of A 4 5 bln  which was almost a third smaller than expected  and adding insult to injury  the September surplus was revised a little lower

Europe
German factory orders disappointed  Instead of rising by 0 3 0 4  as the newswire survey suggested  orders fell by 0 4   This confirms for many observers that the German economy  and by extension  Europe  remains mired in weakness  The world s fourth largest economy is likely to still near stagnant here in Q4 and is projected to grow less than 1  next year  Domestic orders fell 3 2   and non European orders fell 4 1   which is where China s data would be embedded  Orders from the EMU jumped by a little more than 11   which likely reflects bulk orders  Germany reports industrial output figures tomorrow  A small gain was expected before today s data after a 0 6  decline in September s figures  Separately  Germany did report a stronger than expected construction PMI  which at 52 5 is at a seven month high  However  the sector is not big enough to support the economy 
The Yellow Vest protests in France spurred the Macron government to give a 17 bln euro tax break  However  Macron faces a new challenge  His attempt to dramatically reform the pension system in a direction that appears to cut benefits and boost retirement ages is triggering a general strike   la greve    Such action has bedeviled previous French governments and could cripple the economy  Macron needs social stability to have a strong voice on the international stage and negotiate with Germany 
The euro briefly poked through  1 11 yesterday  but it failed to close above there  It is trading quietly in about a 15 tick range through the late morning in Europe  Support is seen near  1 1065  There are nearly 2 2 bln euros in options between  1 1110 and  1 1120 that expire today  These look sufficient to cap the euro  though the technical indicators still show more upside room  Short term participants may be reluctant to extend positions ahead of tomorrow s US jobs data  Sterling had been comfortably trading in a  1 28  1 30 range since mid October  Participants are feeling more confident that of next week s election outcome and a fueling a sterling breakout  It traded up to almost  1 3150 today  It finished last week near  1 2925  Many are looking for sterling to trade toward  1 35 as the expected electoral results are discounted 
America
The Bank of Canada softened its neutral stance in October and noted a  weakening growth assessment    Yesterday it seemed to almost say  never mind  and fueled the largest gain in the Canadian dollar in three months  The central bank noted the  waning recession concerns   and that the economy was operating near capacity  It continued to identify trade as the biggest risk  The key to the change of heart may lie with fiscal policy  and Prime Minister Trudeau begins his push for tax cuts  The Bank of Canada said it would incorporate the implications in next month s economic outlook  We had thought there was a chance for the Bank of Canada to cut rates earlier this year  while the Fed was cutting  and the ECB   When it did not materialize  we accepted looser ties in the monetary cycle  However  if we are right and the Federal Reserve cuts rates next year due to the same trade offs that were made this year  low inflation gives scope for efforts to extend the already record long expansion cycle   the Bank of Canada will again be challenged  Note that  like in October  Canada is once again offering a premium to the US on two year rates

By Kathy Lien  Managing Director of FX Strategy for BK Asset Management
U S  Nonfarm Payrolls is traditionally one of the most market moving pieces of data for currencies and equities but its impact depends on how the jobs report affects monetary policy  In the case of the Federal Reserve  they ve made it clear that after lowering interest rates three times this year  further easing is unnecessary  So if NFPs rise more than expected  it would validate their on hold stance and alternatively  if the numbers are weak  the central bank will still keep interest rates steady when they meet next week 
Does that mean that the U S  dollar will shrug off payroll surprises  No 
Economists are looking for very good numbers and the arguments in favor of a softer payrolls report exceeds a stronger one so there s a big disconnect from expectations and data  which can lead to volatility  According to ADP   private payrolls rose only half the amount of October  4 week average jobless claims increased  Challenger reported fewer declines in layoffs and in the manufacturing sector  jobs were shed at a faster pace  Continuing claims were unchanged and the confidence indicators offset each other with the Conference Board reporting the 4th consecutive month of weaker sentiment and the University of Michigan reporting an improvement in confidence  Yet we can t ignore the services sector  which added jobs at its fastest pace in 4 months   this number has the strongest correlation with NFPs and is the only reason why payrolls could rise  Economists are looking for the U S  to add 185K jobs in November  up from 128K in October  They are also looking for wage growth to accelerate and the unemployment rate to hold steady  While we believe that job growth improved over the last month  we are skeptical that it increased as much as 185K and anything short of 160K could trigger a sell off in the U S  dollar 
Risk appetite is also wobbly  which means that a softer report could have a bigger impact on USD JPY and other major currencies than a strong one  If job growth falls short of expectations and wage growth fails to improve like economists anticipated  USD JPY could fall toward 108 and EUR USD could extend its gains to 1 1150 
Arguments In Favor Of Weaker Nonfarm Payrolls

ADP  Employment Gains Shrink to 67K vs  121K in October


4 Week Average Claims Rise to 217K from 215K


Conference Board Confidence Declines for 4th Straight Month


Challenger Reports  16  Drop in Layoffs vs   33 5

Arguments In Favor Of Stronger Nonfarm Payrolls

The U S  is not the only country with labor market numbers scheduled for release Friday  Canada also releases its jobs report and like the U S   improvements are expected  The difference is that the bar is set low for Canada and high for the U S  Economists are looking for job growth to return in November after falling in October  According to IVEY PMI  employment conditions rose back to expansion levels after contracting for 2 months in a row  The Bank of Canada s less dovish outlook sparked a major reversal in USD CAD on Wednesday that was confirmed by Thursday morning s IVEY report  If jobs beat expectations as well  we should see USD CAD underneath 1 3150 
Euro and sterling extended higher on Thursday while the Australian and New Zealand dollar rallies fizzled  The U S  is still describing trade talks as going well but China wants the U S  to reduce tariffs before agreeing to the Phase 1 trade deal  The prospect of a Tory win and the hope for a massive spending increase in Germany supports the European currencies but at the end of the day  all of the major currencies will take their cue from Friday s U S  Nonfarm Payrolls report and fresh trade headlines  if there are any  ",2019-12-05,Kathy Lien,https://www.investing.com/analysis/usd-dont-bank-on-strong-nonfarm-payrolls-200490511,200490511
182541,404057,ADP,Stocks Rebound And Hang Onto Recent Gains,opinion,"The major indices recovered from a soft morning to post slight gains on Thursday  but it s going to take a much more energetic rally tomorrow to end this week in the green 
	The Dow and NASDAQ head into Friday with weekly losses of more than 1   while the S P is off about 0 7  
	We ve been getting conflicting reports on the Phase 1 trade deal all week long  And stocks are responding to EVERYTHING as tensions rise the closer we get to the Dec 15 deadline for additional tariffs

Daily FX Market Roundup 12 03 19
November was a great month for the dx but December is proving to be a challenging one  We are only 2 trading days into the new month  but President Trump is back to his old ways with the market reacting to all of the elusive comments coming out of the White House  On Monday  he called for lower interest rates and criticized the strong dollar  On Tuesday  an avalanche of headlines hit the wires suggesting that trade talks are going nowhere  While Trump keeps on emphasizing that China wants a deal  everyone from Commerce Secretary Ross to Vice President Pence have implied that the bar is high because Trump won t allow China to take advantage of the U S  with the wrong deal  The president himself openly mused that it may be better to wait until after the November election to make a deal  Fox news went on to say their sources indicate that the tariffs will be increased on December 15  Of course  none of this has been confirmed but today s comments from Trump and White House officials indicate that trade talks are not going well  The Fox headline could be the Trump Administration s way of preparing the markets for the possibility of new tariffs  So at the end of the day  even as nonfarm payrolls come into focus  in the near term  nothing matters more to the direction of currencies than the decision on tariffs  ADP and non manufacturing ISM are scheduled for release tomorrow   weaker numbers will have a greater impact on the greenback than strong ones as they would reinforce risk aversion 
The Bank of Canada also has a monetary policy meeting that could trigger a breakout in USD CAD  For the past 2 weeks  USD CAD has been confined in a tight range and while no changes are expected from the central bank  Governor Poloz s speech will be watched closely  When the BoC met in October  they set a bottom in USD CAD when they said the  resilience of Canada s economy will be increasingly tested   They saw the outlook weakening since July with trade conflicts likely to cause business investments and exports to shrink in the second half of the year  However last month  Governor Poloz squashed expectations for easing when he described  monetary policy conditions as just right   Data since October has been mixed  Retail sales improved slightly  inflationary pressures remained stable but labor market  housing and manufacturing activity weakened  Canada s labor market is strong but it finally peaked and the worry is that this will carry over to the rest of the economy  If Governor Poloz focuses on the risks  USD CAD could break through 1 3350 easily but if he emphasizes the appropriateness of current policy  USD CAD should sink below 1 3250 







The Australian dollar traded sharply higher after the Reserve Bank left monetary policy unchanged  Despite recent weakness in Australian data  the monetary policy statement highlighted the improvements in the property market and the central bank s view that the  easing of monetary policy this year is supporting employment and income growth in Australia and a return of inflation to the medium term target range  which confirms our view that the RBA is in no rush to ease again  The New Zealand dollar also extended its gains despite a decline in dairy prices 
Euro rallied for the fourth day in a row but with the EU becoming the subject of trade comments from Trump  investors should also keep a close eye on the currency  Trump believes that the EU   and France in particular   has treated the U S  unfairly on trade  but he said today  we will probably work it out on trade   Conflicting comments like that is the exact reason why EUR USD will be particularly sensitive to EU U S  trade headlines  Revisions to EZ service sector PMIs are scheduled for release on Wednesday and if there are upward revisions like manufacturing PMI  it could help EUR USD test 1 11 ",2019-12-03,Kathy Lien,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-bank-of-canada-trigger-breakout-in-usdcad-200489717,200489717
182558,404074,ADP,Stocks Not Happy About Talk Of Trade Deal Delay,opinion,"The market didn t do much on Tuesday to dispel fears of another December selloff  as stocks have now slipped for three straight days and shed approximately 2  in that time 
	However  the indices did come well off their lows before the closing bell  If this really were some kind of December 2018 redux  we would have seen the losses get worse as the day progressed 
	The market dropped today because it didn t like President Trump suggesting that a trade deal could be put off until after the 2020 election 
	In other words  those additional tariffs scheduled for Dec  15 would happen and we d all enjoy nearly a year more of trade uncertainty 
	But the market recovered a decent amount of the tumble  The President s statement seemed to be one of those spur of the moment type things that he s known for  rather than something official  So  we re probably no further away from a deal than we were yesterday  though it s impossible to tell how close we were to begin with     
	In the end  the Dow was only off by 1 01   or around 280 points  to 27 502 81  The index had plunged well over 400 points at its worst 
	The S P was off 0 66  to 3093 20 and the NASDAQ slipped 0 55   or around 47 points  to 8520 64 
	Therefore  the indices have lost approximately 2  in the past three sessions  Last year s December selloff could do more than that in one day 
	Most likely  we re just moving through the sell off that many of the editors expected after running so quickly to new highs  It would be a normal pullback  which is an adjective you wouldn t use for last December s catastrophe 
	In addition to its susceptibility to trade headlines  the market will also have to deal with some potentially important economic data on Wednesday  The ISM Services and ADP  NASDAQ ADP  employment reports are scheduled for tomorrow

182559,404075,ADP,Disappointing Private Sector Payrolls In November,opinion,Private sector payrolls reported this morning by Automatic Data Processing   NASDAQ ADP   disappointed  coming in at just 67K new private sector jobs created in November  This is well down from October s headline number  which had been revised down from 125K to 121K  November s total cuts those figures basically in half Goods producing posted a negative for the first time in recent memory   18k last month  while Services took up the slack but still registered just 85K new jobs last month  For the past several quarters  we d been repeating the mantra than any jobs growth over 100K per month was enough to absorb the retiring baby boomers exiting the workforce  We re now beneath this level by a considerable margin  we ll find out in time whether this is a minor blip or something bigger Medium sized companies  50 499 employees  brought in 29K new private sector jobs to lead the way  with large companies at 27K and small businesses at 11K  Digging deeper  firms with between 1 and 19 employees lost 15K private jobs in November  pointing to a real sign of weakness in our current labor force  Very small companies in goods producing industries are feeling the brunt of things like the prolonged trade war with China  and this looks to be finally showing up in the data Education Health Services once again provided the highest number of new private sector jobs with 39K  while Leisure Hospitality came in at  18K  But Trade Transport  which had helped buoy our job market for the past several quarters  if not longer  took a hit last month  posting  15K  Construction and Manufacturing were down 6K each  as well For Friday s non farm payroll numbers  provided by the U S  Bureau of Labor Statistics  BLS   analysts  expectations had been for around 189K new jobs   including public sector  government  employment   with an Unemployment Rate steady at an historically strong 3 6   But with private sector data coming in at barely a third of that overall total  we may see some analysts pull back on their Friday estimates To be clear  immediate data from ADP and BLS jobs reports are often at odds with each other  only over time and with revised numbers in future months do we see that they do represent employment trends generally in line with each other  Further  it s way too early to determine that we re seeing a major slowdown in employment based on one ADP survey  But Friday s numbers will be looked at very closely for signs the jobs market is declining in a bigger way than had been expected ,2019-12-03,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/disappointing-private-sector-payrolls-in-november-200489969,200489969
182567,404083,ADP,Fed Rate Cut Today   Capital Markets Mostly Treading Water Ahead Of Decision,opinion,"Overview   
The global capital markets are mostly treading water ahead of the Federal Reserve meeting  Asia Pacific and European equities drifted lower  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index appears to have snapped a four day advance  while the Dow Jones Stoxx 600 was trading slightly lower for the second consecutive session following a six day rally  The S P 500 gapped higher on Monday did not enter the gap yesterday  It is found between 3027 4 and 3032 1 
Benchmark 10 year yields fell in Asia but are narrowly mixed in Europe  The US 10 Year yield is around 1 83   having begun the month closer to 1 66  and settled last week a little below 1 80   Note that the US Treasury will provide details of the quarterly refunding  While the size of the refunding may not change much  some are expected a couple innovations  including a 20 year bond and maybe an instrument tied to SOFR  the intended replacement of LIBOR  The dollar is sporting a slightly softer profile against the major currencies  and the Scandis are a notable exception 
Meanwhile  the larger and accessible emerging market currencies have also edged higher against the greenback  On the other hand  the Korean won  which has rallied for four consecutive weeks  is off about 0 5  amid profit taking ahead of month end  Gold is a little firmer though below  1500  and oil has slipped a bit with December WTI though within yesterday s ranges 
Asia Pacific
Ahead of the increase in Japan s sales tax  households went shopping  September retail sales jumped 7 1   which is a little more than twice when the median forecast anticipated  The August figure was revised slightly  4 6  from 4 2    The year over year rate rose to 9 1  in September from a revised 1 8  in August  The sales tax increase brought forward purchases  but in the past  it was followed by a deep swoon 
The Bank of Japan meets tomorrow  Expectations of a  rate cut have diminished  but many expect officials to extend their forward guidance about how long rates can remain low  It could shift from a date specific back to a data focused approach  The BOJ is the only major central bank that buys equities  ETFs  as part of its quantitative and qualitative easing  Its holdings are draining liquidity from the equity market  though Nomura  the largest brokerage firm  reported its best profits in almost 20 years  Some reports are suggesting that the BOJ could begin a securities lending program for these ETFs in an attempt to restore liquidity 
Australia reported Q3 CPI figures  and they were mostly as expected  showing little change in the pace  The headline rose 0 5  the same as in Q2  which saw the year over year rate rise to 1 7  from 1 6   The trimmed mean rose 0 4   also matching the Q2 increase and expectations  keeping the year over year rate unchanged at 1 6   The weighted median rose 0 3   compared to 0 4  in Q2  The year over pace slipped to 1 2  from a revised 1 3   The takeaway is that expectations for the Reserve Bank to be on hold next week hardened  Indeed  the next rate cut appears to have been pushed into late Q1 2020 
The dollar has flatlined against the yen  It has been in about a 10 tick range below JPY108 90 through the Asian session and into the European morning  The JPY109 level remains important  There are  2 1 bln in options struck there today that will be cut and another  1 4 bln tomorrow  The Australian dollar has traded mostly in the quarter cent above  0 6850  Last week s high was a little shy of  0 6885  and the September high was a touch below  0 6900  These denote the nearby obstacles  The Aussie has not traded above  0 6900 for three months  Meanwhile  the greenback remains stuck near its recent trough against the Chinese yuan around CNY7 0560 in quiet turnover  The market seems to accept that the current tariff truce can persist as both economies are slowing 
Europe
The UK is going to hold its third election in four years on December 12  as Labour capitulated  The claim is that the election will resolve the issue  but what if it doesn t   Is that the underlying problem   Even the referendum in 2016 showed a narrowly divided country  As nearly everyone has relearned  the devil is in the details  How to leave   What to leave   There seems to be a substantial risk that the election does not resolve the issue  No party may get a majority and six seven weeks later the next deadline  and it is not clear that another extension will be granted  The triggering of Article 50 without have a consensus on a range of other issues seems backward  The EU could insist on the UK revoking it to overcome the end of the January deadline 
France is the first of the G7 economies to report Q3 GDP  It expanded as expected by 0 3  the same as in Q2 for a 1 3  year over year pace  1 4  in Q2   However  it appears households went on strike in September as consumption fell unexpectedly by 0 4   This is the biggest decline since February  German states are reported October CPI figures ahead of the national estimate later today  The early estimate suggests that the year over year pace on the national level may have slowed from September s 0 9  rate  Prices edged lower  0 1   in both August and September  Three consecutive monthly declines have not been reported since 2002  Separately Germany reported twice the rise in unemployment  6k  than the median forecast anticipation in the Bloomberg survey 
The ECB s bond buying program resumes today  It will buy roughly 20 bln euros a month in sovereign bonds  The program is open ended  and this irked some officials and former officials from several creditor members  Many private sector economists worry about the proximity of the self imposed caps on ECB holdings  Draghi tried to play the urgency down  reiterating the claim by the ECB s chief economist  that the limits will not be approached until late next year  This gives Lagarde and the ECB time to develop a more granular strategy  
The euro posted an outside up day yesterday by trading on both sides of Monday s range and then closing above Monday s high  Follow through buying today lifted it to almost  1 1125 in the European morning  There is an option for nearly 850 mln euros that is struck there and expires today  We had anticipated a bit more weakness in the euro  as the market looked past the likely Fed cut to focus on the pause that is widely expected to follow today s move  However  we had looked for the euro to recover ahead of the weekend after what we expect to be a soft jobs report  So far  today is the first day since October 23 that the euro has not traded below  1 11  Sterling is trading in the upper end of yesterday s range  but like yesterday  the air about  1 29 is thin  We note that three month volatility is steady near 9 9   which  to give some perspective  is a little above the 200 day moving average and new three month lows  The euro has formed a shelf over the past couple of weeks near GBP0 8600  An option for about 460 mln euros struck at GBP0 8650 that will be cut today is nearby  at pixel time it is around GBP0 8635

The US begins with the ADP private sector jobs estimate followed quickly by the first estimate of Q3 GDP  Attention will briefly turn to the outcome of the Bank of Canada meeting and then in the afternoon the conclusion of the FOMC meeting and Chairman Powell s press conference  The ADP  NASDAQ ADP  estimate is expected to show around 110k increase in private sector jobs  It is unlikely to reflect the full impact of the labor strife  which will more likely be picked up by the government s estimate at the end of the week  Nevertheless  the trend is clear  According to ADP  the private sector has created an average of 164k jobs a month this year  The average in the first nine months of 2018 was 222k  After expanding at a 3 1  year over year clip in Q1  the economy slowed to 2 0  in Q2  and the question at hand is how much did it slow in Q3  Most estimates are around 1 5   Still  the risk may be on the downside given that the consensus forecasts have been above what has been actually delivered in recent weeks  especially for the more significant economic reports  The economy finished Q3 with little forward momentum 
Yesterday  we explained why midcourse correction  three rate cuts  will be completed later today and that the most important part of tomorrow s meeting is likely to be the forward guidance  The impact of that forward guidance is contextual  What are the current market expectations    The CME s model suggests a little less than a one in four chance of a December hike has been discounted  and the Bloomberg model puts it just below a 30  chance  The point is that a pause is mostly expected  The next question where is the bar to another a continuation of the easing cycle  the morphing of the midcourse correction to  let s blow some air the parachute  to ensure a soft landing  We suspect that further economic slowing will get the Fed to resume its easing 
The other issue is how the Fed is addressing the pressure on the short term funding market  While some observers continue to insist that it is QE  it appears that most institutional economists and analysts do not  The Federal Reserve is defending the transmission mechanism  That is its motivation for conducting overnight and term repo operations and buying  60 bln a month in T bills until into Q2 2020  Many do not appreciate the change in the regimes at the Federal Reserve from a system based on the scarcity of reserves to a system of an abundance of reserves  Despite some numbers that look like banks should have sufficient reserves  the argument is that new post crisis liquidity regulations encumber excess reserves and provide incentives to prefer cash to securities  Treasury Secretary Mnuchin seemed sympathetic to bank calls to lighten the regulation  This will be not an important factor in the Fed s deliberations  They have to deal with present conditions  Changing the regulations cannot be in time for year end pressures  for example

182570,404086,ADP,Automatic Data Processing  ADP  Beats Q1 Earnings Estimates,opinion,"Automatic Data Processing  ADP  NASDAQ ADP   came out with quarterly earnings of  1 34 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 33 per share  This compares to earnings of  1 20 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 0 75   A quarter ago  it was expected that this payroll and human resources company would post earnings of  1 13 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 14  delivering a surprise of 0 88  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
ADP  which belongs to the Zacks Outsourcing industry  posted revenues of  3 50 billion for the quarter ended September 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 35   This compares to year ago revenues of  3 32 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
ADP shares have added about 24 2  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 21 1  
What s Next for ADP 
While ADP has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for ADP was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

Daily FX Market Roundup October 31  2019
Investors continued to dump U S  dollars today with the greenback trading lower against all of the major currencies  USD JPY was hit the hardest but significant losses were also seen for the dollar against GBP and NZD  Federal Reserve Chairman Powell s optimistic outlook for the economy and the labor market failed to translate into strength in the currency because even though further easing is unlikely  tightening isn t on the horizon either  Today s personal income and personal spending reports missed expectations but most importantly  investors worry that Friday s Nonfarm Payrolls number could be ugly 
Economists are looking for only 85K jobs in the month of October  down from 136K in September  According to some of the broader economic measures that we track pre NFP  there s a strong case for weaker job growth this month  However the forecast for NFPs is very low and both the ISM and non ISM manufacturing reports won t be released until after payrolls   leaving us without two of the most reliable leading indicators for NFPs  The Fed s rate cut this week is a sign of weakness in the economy but Powell also emphasized the labor market s strength 
Still  we expect job growth to slow but the change in Nonfarm Payrolls may not be as dismal as the forecast  However the unemployment rate  which hit a 40 year low last month  should rise and we worry that wage growth will be softer than economists predict  They are looking for wages to grow by 0 3  after stagnating in September  If NFPs print below 90K and average hourly earnings is 0 2  or lower  it will be the nail in the coffin for the U S  dollar  USD JPY will hit 107 50 while EUR USD heads toward 1 12  If NFPs are 90K or better and average hourly earnings is 0 3  or higher  we should see a nice recovery in the beleaguered greenback 
With that said  a stronger payrolls report will have a smaller impact on the dollar than a weak report given the uncertainty around U S  China trade relations  There are reports that Chinese officials doubt that a long term trade deal is possible with President Trump  According to Bloomberg  there were private conversations in Beijing where Chinese officials said they wont budge on major issues and relayed low expectations that further negotiations could result in anything meaningful  Larry Kudlow was quick to say that U S  China talks are going smoothly but given the back and forth that we ve seen over the past few years  investors are worried about another setback  At the end of the day  the U S   commitment to a trade deal will be evident in their handling of the December tariffs  It will be a very good sign if they are cancelled or delayed but if they are implemented  it confirms everyone s fears  Interestingly enough  AUD and NZD are not hurting from this news but their gains should be limited 
Arguments In Favor Of Weaker Payrolls

The rail downturn underscores the damage from the U S  China trade war  which is making shippers more cautious and crimping freight   validating earlier warnings from railroad executives  Companies that stocked up on inventory last year amid President Donald Trump s tariff threats are now working it off  Adding to the cargo drop  a brief rise in coal exports has fizzled and bad weather has delayed crop harvests and dragged down grain carloads

182609,404125,ADP,Weak Data And Tariffs Escalation Demands More ECB And Fed Easing,opinion,"Markets have just digested the news of progress in U S  China trade negotiations  as a new wave of tariff escalation sent the markets down  The S P 500 lost 1 8  on Tuesday  while the FTSE 100 and Euro 50 collapsed more than 3 2  the last day after the US Presidential Administration announced new tariffs to some European goods  This step imposes tariffs on Airbus  PA AIR   as well as other goods  including whiskey and cheese  the production of which is subsidized by the state  This step triggers fears of a new round of escalation of tariff wars  raising concerns about a possible European response 





The tariff announcement proved to be very untimely news for the markets that had previously been under pressure from weak economic data from the US and Europe  The introduction of tariffs and fears of tit for tat steps could further suppress business sentiment  which is already at the lowest levels for years 
As the FxPro Analyst Team said  the new statistics are increasing pressure on the Fed and ECB to continue its easing  as it indicates weakness in the areas to which these central banks pay the most attention  Eurozone inflation fell to 0 9  YoY  about half the ECB target levels  and weakness of business sentiment indices in Germany suggests that this decline may continue in the foreseeable future  It is also worth noting the return of oil to  57 for Brent  the 3 month lows area  which can curb producer prices in the coming months 
It is impossible to pass by the weakening of the Chinese yuan  which increases global deflationary pressures together with declining energy prices  The U S  Federal Reserve is paying much more attention to business than to inflationary signals  which are heavily distorted by tariffs  and in this area  the Fed is facing a series of worrying news this week  In addition to the decline of the ISM index in the real sector  it is also worth noting the apparent slowdown in employment growth in September  as reported by ADP  NASDAQ ADP  the previous day  A recent report closely correlating with the official statistics published yesterday noted a 135K increase in employment last month  shows the weakness persist after the drop in May 





Today s data may further shed some light on the dynamics of inflation in Europe and business activity in the U S  In the afternoon  the prices of eurozone producers will be released  which are expected to show a year to year decline for the first time since 2016  At the beginning of the U S  session  investors will be watching for weekly unemployment claims  and Non Manufacturing ISM later  The latest represents about 80  of the U S  economy  so a significant deviation from previous results and expectations could have a major impact on the markets  reinforcing or  conversely  unfolding the current negative sentiment

182610,404126,ADP,Will Nonfarm Payrolls Send Stocks  USD Crumbling Lower ,opinion,"Kathy Lien  Managing Director Of FX Strategy For BK Asset Management
Daily FX Market Roundup October 3  2019
The hope for a recovery in the last quarter of 2019 disappeared with Thursday s non manufacturing ISM report  Investors can no longer fool themselves into thinking that the US can escape the global slowdown  After learning that manufacturing activity contracted at its fastest pace in 10 years  ISM reported the weakest service sector activity index since 2016  American businesses are feeling the pain of the slowdown of the economy and the trade war  Unfortunately even with central banks easing monetary policy across the globe  the slowdown will deepen so investors are looking beyond Friday s Nonfarm Payrolls report to the FOMC meeting later this month and the potential for action 
A number as weak as Thursday s ISM should drive the US dollar  Treasury yields and stocks lower across the board  We got a glimpse of that on Tuesday and Wednesday when stocks fell more than 800 points following disappointments in ADP and manufacturing data  The US dollar also dropped but we saw more restrained selling Thursday even though non manufacturing ISM is a more significant release  All of this tells us that investors are bracing for a weak jobs number and investors are all but certain that the Fed will be forced to lower interest rates again this year 
Fed fund futures are pricing in 87  chance of a cut on October 30 and a 96  chance of a cut by December 11  This outlook is far more aggressive than most policymakers may be prepared for  When the central bank cut rates in September  2 members voted for no change and the majority did not expect additional easing this year  The question now is whether this month s reports will change so many views  While manufacturing was slowing for most of the year  services perked up enough in August for Fed Chairman Powell to say that he expects the economy to remain strong  Investors on the other hand sent the US dollar tumbling lower because they believe that these reports will force the central bank to ease for the third time this year 
Dollar bears will be looking for validation from nonfarm payrolls and while economists predict slightly higher job growth  investors are bracing for another ugly report  The arguments favor a weak release  Hiring in the service sector was at a standstill while the manufacturing sector shed jobs at the fastest pace in 5 years according to ISM  ADP  also reported weaker private payroll additions  which explains the collapse in the Conference Board s consumer sentiment index  The drop in layoffs reported by Challenger and the improvement in the UMich survey won t be enough to offset the deterioration in other reports  Wage growth is also expected to slow and we would not be surprised if the unemployment rate ticked higher 
Positioning for a weak jobs report could pay off but given the volatility this report typically induces  exposure should be limited  If payroll growth is less than 140K and average hourly earnings growth slows to 0 2   we could see a more durable decline in the dollar that takes USD JPY below 106  However if there s anything in the jobs number that could cast doubt on another round of easing  the dollar will squeeze sharply higher  Stocks on the other hand could react favorably to a positive and negative number if investors immediately think that additional easing will be necessary

182611,404127,ADP,U S  Data  From Bad To Worse,opinion,"Both key ISM surveys are pointing to a major slowdown in US growth rates  We are forecasting US GDP growth of 1 3  for 2020 versus a consensus estimate of 1 8  with the clear implication that the Federal Reserve has more work to do to support the economy
The US slowdown signals are multiplying  We were well aware of the problems in manufacturing given the trade war  slower global growth and the competitive disadvantage of a strong dollar  but it is clear that there are problems brewing in other sectors  The ISM non manufacturing index has come in at 52 6  the weakest reading for over three years  and as the chart below shows the two ISM series are now showing that GDP growth is in a clear weakening channel 
ISM indices highlight US slowdown threat




There was weakness throughout today s non manufacturing report with new orders plunging to 53 7 from 60 3 versus a breakeven level of 50  Business activity fell 6 3 points to 55 2 while employment dropped to 50 4 from 53 1  This is the worst employment reading since early 2014 and given the ISM manufacturing employment number was already pointing to a sharp fall we are not optimistic for tomorrow s all important jobs number  The consensus is still for employment growth of 147 000  but the labour surveys  including the ADP  NASDAQ ADP  report  suggest 100 120k may be more realistic 
Payrolls growth has been slowing over the past year  Initially  there was a sense that this was because firms were struggling to fill vacancies due to a lack of workers with the right skill sets  However  the downturn in business activity suggests that it is increasingly becoming a labour demand story  As such the recent pick up in wage growth may not continue for much longer  which risks undermining consumer spending 
Given these fears  we cut our US GDP growth forecast for 2020 to 1 3  a couple of months ago  The consensus is still 1 8   but we imagine that this will be moving lower  The latest developments should add a sense of urgency to talks seeking a resolution to the US China trade dispute and will keep the pressure on the Fed to ease monetary policy further  We continue to look for a December rate cut and a further move in 1Q20  but the risks are increasingly skewed towards more aggressive action

Asia Pacific
As tipped yesterday  Hong Kong cited claimed its emergency powers to ban masks for protesters  though stopped short of declaring an emergency  Chief  Executive Lam indicated officials are willing not to extend their response unless the violence escalates  Officials also denied intentions to impose capital controls  This weekend will test the resolve of both sides  Hong Kong s actions seem designed  at least in part  to appeal to the moderate and business community  which  for example  was not particularly supportive of the Umbrella Movement a few years ago  It also reinforces for us that Beijing recognizes that it is best if local authorities address the local situation 
The Reserve Bank of India delivered the widely expected 25 bp rate cut to bring the repo rate to 5 15   It is the fifth consecutive rate cut this year  and the series of moves that chopped 135 bp off the repo rate since February  The poor PMI data offered a context but not cause for the cuts  The services PMI fell to 48 7 from 52 4  and the composite reading dropped to 49 8 from 52 6  It is the first overall contraction since February 2018  The central bank cut growth and inflation forecasts and appears to anticipate around 125 bp in rate cuts over the next year 
In the past three sessions  the US dollar has fallen from about JPY108 50 to JPY106 50  the lowest level in a month  The main driver is the drop in global yields and equities this week  So far  today is the first session since September 4 that the greenback has not traded above JPY107 00  There is a nearly  500 mln option struck there that expires today and another for about  535 mln at JPY106 50 that also rolls off  A weekly close below JPY107 00 would add to the bearish technical condition  The Australian dollar is extending its recovery off the 10 year low set in the middle of the week  around  0 6670  It has risen above previous support near  0 6740  The week s high was close to  0 6775  and that is the next target  However  re establishing a foothold above  0 6800 would help solidify the base  Chinese markets re open Monday  The offshore yuan  CNH  has risen by about 0 25  since the mainland markets closed on September 30 
Europe
Outside of the US Ukraine story  Brexit is the main talking point  The general pattern seen in the past three years remains intact  The closer that the UK Parliament might get to agreeing how to proceed  the further away the UK moves from the EU  Johnson s plan seems to have won support from the Tory backbenchers  including some who do not share the hardline  the Democrat Unionist Party from Northern Ireland  and some Brexit leaning Labour MPs  It is not clear if this amounts to a majority  However  what is clear is that from top EU officials is that it is too little too late  The Chair of the foreign affairs committee of the German parliament said Johnson s proposals cannot be negotiated by the end of the month  EU President Tusk said he was  unconvinced  by the UK proposals and EC  President Juncker said it was  problematic    The European Parliament expressed  grave concerns  
Johnson s proposal seems to violate the basis of the Good Friday Agreement  and the EU cannot accept that Northern Ireland can veto the plan every four years  Although the Prime Minister called his offer his last  he does appear to have a fallback position  which apparently is a time limit on the backstop  Europe has consistently argued that a time limit on the backstop defeats the purpose and removes incentives to reach an agreement  Even though officials on both sides of the Channel have given themselves a week to work things out  the negotiations are bound to continue into the EU summit October 17 18  We continue to believe that a three month extension is still the most likely scenario while recognizing that a no deal exit is the default unless positive action is taken 
The euro is posting modest gains for the fourth consecutive session today  During this run  it has risen from a 2 5 year low near  1 0880 to  1 10  It is consolidating inside yesterday s ranges today and appears to be building a near term base around  1 0960  1 0965  The  1 10 level was tested yesterday and held fast  There is an option for about 645 mln euros that is struck there and expires today  The 20 day moving average is also found near there  The response to the US jobs report will determine how the single currency finishes the week  in which the poor US data overshadowed the disappointing EMU PMI  Sterling is trading roughly in a third of a cent range today and remains little changed  It has moved higher in the past three sessions as many see the prospects of an extension or delay as having risen  It seems to have found a base near  1 2325 
America
US job growth has slowed  Through August  the US created a net of about 158k jobs a month  In the first eight months of 2018  the US grew 234k jobs a month  In Q2  non farm payrolls rose by an average of 152k  If the US economy grew less than 167k jobs in September  the three month average would decline in Q3  After ISM PMI and ADP  NASDAQ ADP  reports  expectations for today s report softened further  and it might take less than a 125k to disappoint the market  Given some recent disappointing data  after the US data surprise models reached among the best levels of the year  the focus may be on job creation more than wage growth  A 0 3  rise in average hourly earnings would keep the year over year pace at 3 2   which is what it has averaged so far this year  The average was 2 9  in the first eight months of 2018  If the increase in average hourly earnings is supposed to be the faint heartbeat of the Phillips curve  the patient still appears comatose 
There has been an important development this week and one that has gone largely unobserved  Looking at two year interest rates  the US is not the highest yields anymore  That role has been assumed by Canada  Its two year rate pushed fractionally above its US counterpart and extended the move yesterday  The US two year yield has tumbled about 24 bp this week  while the Canadian two year yield is off about 16 bp  On the surface  it looks this has not benefited the Canadian dollar  which in the foreign exchange market  lost about 0 5  against the US dollar this week  making it poorest performing major currency  However  it highlights the fact that the major currencies are not simply a reflection of rate differentials  There are other influences on the Canadian dollar  We typically emphasize two others   the general risk appetite and oil prices  We note that oil prices fell nearly 6 5  last week  its biggest decline in a couple of months  and brought the two week drop to 10   The S P 500  a proxy for risk  fell for the third consecutive week and is lower in seven of the past ten weeks 
The US dollar broke above CAD1 33 and the 200 day moving average in the middle of the week and has not looked back  It reached almost CAD1 3350 yesterday and is consolidating its gains ahead of the US jobs report  Canada reports August trade and September IVEY survey  The data are overshadowed by the US jobs report  Note that Fed Chair Powell delivers opening remarks at a  Fed listens  event around 2PM ET  The US dollar s five day advance against the Mexican peso ended in the middle of the week  and now it is off for the third consecutive session  It finished last week near MXN19 69 and is trading close to MXN19 55 currently  near the 20 day moving average   MXN19 5450   Initial support is seen in the MXM19 50 MXN19 52 area  The Dollar Index reversed lower on Turnaround Tuesday after setting reaching its best level since Q2 17  The 20 day moving average   98 65  was frayed on an intraday basis yesterday  but that area may offer initial support  A close below 98 35 would be a particularly bearish technical development",2019-10-04,Marc Chandler,https://www.investing.com/analysis/us-jobs-data-to-close-a-sobering-week-200470582,200470582
182628,404144,ADP,Why ADP  ADP  Could Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report  you should consider Automatic Data Processing  ADP  NASDAQ ADP    This company  which is in the Zacks Outsourcing industry  shows potential for another earnings beat 
This payroll and human resources company has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 2 81  
For the last reported quarter  ADP came out with earnings of  1 14 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 13 per share  representing a surprise of 0 88   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  1 69 per share and it actually produced earnings of  1 77 per share  delivering a surprise of 4 73  
Price and EPS Surprise

For ADP  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
ADP has an Earnings ESP of  0 46  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on October 30  2019 
With the Earnings ESP metric  it s important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power  however  a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-10-02,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-adp-adp-could-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200470372,200470372

S P 500 Futures  Early Pop Leads To Larger Drop  ISM Falls To A 10 Year Low




Chart courtesy of Stewart Solaka  Chicagostock    ES F Looking a lot like the 1st trading day of August  Buyers dropped the ball  Aug 1  lost July low  left July longs trapped  Now   retesting gap   2940 where buyers came in above after Sep 1 short squeeze  September stopped out shorts from August  now Sep longs on hook 
Like on many other occasions lately  the S P 500 futures  ESZ19 CME  were acting OK during yesterday s early rally  trading up to 2994 00  It was when the ISM number was released  showing  a drop to a 10 year low  that the ES puked all the way down to 2957 75  a 36 25 handle drop in less than 45 minutes  
This seems to be the theme lately  Whether it s a Trump tweet or negative economic headline  it s all about failed rallies  
After the drop  the futures short covered up to 2965 75 at 10 30  then got hit by another wave of sell programs that helped pull the ES down to a new low at 2939 25  just after 12 30  54 75 handles off the high  
It really was a continuous sell program  There was another small bounce  and then another new low at 2938 25 printed  The  HFTAlert software that I ve been using started showing some small buy programs after that  and the ES did rally  trading up to 2950 50 at 1 48  
The next move was back down to 2945 75  then back up to the previous high at 2950 50  before heading straight down to 2943 25  From there  the futures chopped around in a 4 handle range  as the MiM went from  275 million to buy to  76 million to buy  and then sold off back down to the 2941 00 area  
On the 2 45 cash imbalance reveal  the futures traded 2944 00  as the final MiM showed  1 4 billion to sell The ES then went on to print 2941 75 on the 3 00 cash close  and settled the day on the lows at 2938 50  down  46 handles  or  1 54   
In the end  the price action was all about the failed rallies  In terms of the days overall tone  the ES acted horrible  but closed at a big discount to the S P 500 cash  In terms of the days overall trade  1 59 million mini S P futures contracts traded  which is high for what we have been seeing ",2019-10-03,Danny Riley,https://www.investing.com/analysis/ism-crusher-kicks-off-the-spooky-month-of-october-200470110,200470110

The overall report did have some bullish highlights  total crude and products inventories fell by 851 000 barrels   Crude prices never benefitted from a spike in demand and unless we see a relief rally from a positive development in the trade war  we could see bearish momentum accelerate 
The Canadian dollar mirrored the move with oil prices an fell to session lows against the greenback   The 1 3300 level is proving to be strong resistance for USD CAD   If  bullish momentum accelerates  1 3450 could be the next major upside target

182633,404149,ADP,U S  EU Trade War Escalation Hits Risk Sentiment,opinion,"It s been a rough start of a new quarter for the likes of equities  both in Europe and the US  as concerns over global growth after the decade low print in the US ISM must now co exist with heightened tensions of a trade war between the US and the EU  The Japanese Yen was  alongside the New Zealand Dollar  the main beneficiary 
Quick Take

You wouldn t have guessed it was a true  risk off  environment out there as the EU US trade war escalates by analyzing the performance of the NZD and the CHF  The former ended up as the main winner  only surpassed by the perky Yen  while the latter succumbed to a depressed inflation print out of Switzerland  which increases the risk of further negative rates by the SNB  Again  risk sentiment matters as much as fundamentally derived flows  But the NZD performance is one I still scratch my head  The utter evaporation of longs in the CAD off fresh yearly highs is also quite an X file to ruminate about  without much of a particular catalyst other than the fall in Oil prices  which in my opinion  does not justify the annihilation of CAD longs  The USD saw solid demand right off the gates in Europe  but gave it all back as capital flows entered in the US  Meanwhile  both the Euro and the Sterling were well underpinned by demand flows  the latter driven by the subtle positivism so far around UK PM s plan to solve the Irish backstop  Last but not least  the most volatile currency on Tuesday  the Australian Dollar  saw slow fluctuations as the short side interest dries out after its overextended move

Narratives In Financial Markets
  The Information is gathered after scanning top publications including the FT  WSJ  Reuters  Bloomberg  ForexLive  Institutional Bank Research reports 
Equities suffer the consequences of EU US trade war escalation  It s been a rough start of a new quarter for the likes of equities  both in Europe and the US  as concerns over global growth after the decade low print in the US ISM must now be co exist with heightened tensions of a trade war with the US at the center  this time against Europe after a WTA ruling  partly expected  allowing the US to impose tariffs on EU products 
WTO ruling in favor of the US deepens risk aversion  The WTO ruled that the US can go ahead imposing tariffs worth over  7bn in EU products  including wine  whisky  luxury goods and aircraft in retaliation for the loss of business by Boeing due to illegal EU aid to Airbus  The US is set to impose retaliatory tariffs of 10  on EU aircraft  and 25  on EU agricultural  industrial goods  The measures are set to take effect on Oct 18  Authorities in Europe have been quick to react  noting that this strategy is likely to be responded with counter tariff measures by the EU 
The US ISM PMI set the ball rolling  The US is seen as one of the ultimate safe harbor out there  still immune to the debilitating macroeconomics elsewhere  but the recessionary reality in the manufacturing sector coupled with aiming to fight a fresh trade war with Europe while fully immersed in trade dispute with China is a major red flag  
Watch today s US ISM non manuf PMI  The US ISM non manuf PMI is set to be a big market mover as a more important proxy of the state of the overall economy in the US  given that the services industry represents a larger share of the economy  If the last print in August serves as an indication  the sector continues to thrive for now 

US ADP  NASDAQ ADP  data not a good omen for the US economy  A soft print in the US ADP private sector payrolls  coming at  135K in September vs 140k expected  alongside a downward revision to 157k from 195k threw more cold water  The market now awaits the US NFP report on Friday in order to gather new evidence on the state of employment in America  one of the bedrocks of the economy so far 
JPY the unquestionable winner as stocks yields drop  The depth of the fall in bond yields and stocks is what led to the acceleration by the Japanese Yen index  which has capitalized on the positive technicals after the breakout of a long held range on the back of the US ISM miss  
Low Swiss inflation raises alarm bells for further negative rates  The Swissy  even if seen as a funding currency set to perform well amid risk aversion  has been lagging way behind  as the Swiss inflation in September missed median estimates by coming at the lowest in almost 3 years  Depressed inflation and the macro strength in the Swiss national currency increase the risk of further negative rates by the SNB 
Fed s Williams in neutral camp  Fed s member Williams crossed the wires  saying that monetary policy is in  the right place   which implies he is in neutral territory  even if the market now sees the chances of the Fed funds cut in October at 74  chance vs 60  last Friday 
GBP receives tentative positive news  The GBP has continued to trade in an erratic and non directional fashion despite the fact that UK PM Boris Johnson revealed his plans for the Irish backstop  In a nutshell  Johnson proposes that Northern Ireland remains compliant with EU rules with some checkpoints away from the border still in place as a special temporary arrangement for four years before the Northern Irish parliament determines if the arrangements are to be extended 
UK PM Brexit plan  up in the air   The plan was welcomed by the DUP and Brexiteers but Irish PM Varadkar said the backstop proposal didn t fully  meet the agreed objectives   Meanwhile  EC President Juncker sounded neutral  noting pros in his comments such as that the proposal contained  positive advances  but at the same time  noting it had  some problematic points   The EU Summit on October 17th looms near and that s when the GBP will be most volatile 
Stay glued to the Brexit newsflows to get a bias on the Pound  However  according to Verhofstadt  a Belgian politician  the reaction of most MEPs to UK proposal was  not positive  ahead head of the Brexit steering group in European parliament  even if the reporter added that they will discuss it more in the days ahead

The EUR index successful rotation off the lows was always going to make it riskier to endorse shorts with a high degree of conviction as dip buying activity could very well be expected  and eventually  that s what has transpired  We haven t had to wait long for the market to make up its mind that the path of least resistance into the US NFP  36h away  is to the upside  The acceptance of higher levels into the NY close  alongside the 2nd leg up  supports the notion that the cycle is now in that prime state where a 3rd leg up should ensue  On the way down  it will require a drop of 0 2  or 0 4  roughly to expect the highest concentration of bid clusters 





The GBP index continues to find relentless demand interest off the daily support area drawn in red  If you were to engage in long side GBP exposure every time the index nears the area  your plays would have had a high chance of being successful every single time  That s how power power lies in assessing the potential demand imbalances on an aggregate basis vs G8 FX  To the downside  any revisit of the daily support will likely continue to be bought  while engaging is GBP shorts carries a higher risk due to twofold  Firstly  because the last swing low failed to rotate back to the previous low  and secondly  because a daily support area is now in control 





The USD index attracted strong demand off the daily support line drawn 24h ago  which means those entering long USD vs the weakest projected currencies such as the CHF  would have had a field day indeed  The failure to retest the prior swing high does not invalidate trading off the daily support  but you want to be patient until at least there is a break as the market will then be given a chance to enter long with deeper liquidity available  Should the support be broken  the next one is found over 0 3  lower  hence it could also be a bearish day for the USD if initial acceptance is found below the daily support right underneath 





The CAD index has come under exceptional sell side pressure with the decline in Oil alone not really justifying the overextended depreciation in the currency  Demand in the CAD is expected to emerge within close proximity of the current price  anywhere between the current level and 0 2  lower  where a major daily support in the context of a successful rotation will be found  To the upside  we should wait patiently until the creation of a new resistance area  not yet visible  due to the impulsive and rapid depreciation of the currency index 





The NZD index should see renewed sell side pressure at a level of resistance identified in the 8h chart  which makes Wednesday s correction a potential selling opportunity into Thursday  especially considering the successful rotation achieves off the last swing high currently tested  The proximity of the baseline right overhead adds to the bearish case  Matching up short NZD against a currency expected to find demand nearby is the way to go  The downside potential also looks quite attractive  with over 0 6  until a retest of the trend lows 





The AUD index is closing in into a sell side resistance area off the hourly chart  followed by a daily resistance not far above  0 15    The dovish outlook by the RBA makes the Australian Dollar a clear candidate to experience further sell side pressure  as it is the deterioration in risk sentiment ever since the US ISM PMI  now exacerbated by the EU US trade war escalation  Allowing the AUD to keep correcting higher only to be prepared to engage in shorts against currencies with expected demand to be found is the way to go  similar to the picture in the NZD 





The JPY index has shot up past the 100  proj target  which means the probability of a rotation back down towards areas of demand is rather high  It certainly is for the brave with momentum type strategies to be deployed jumping on such an elongated movements  It s worth noting that the initiation of the aggressive buy side campaign on Wed came off an outlined support line on the 8h chart  If you are a value seeking trader  allowing the JPY to deflate from its lofty levels it trades at before giving considerations to engage in long plays is a sensible approach  The 100  proj is an excellent tool to anticipate when a swing is overcooked and has the highest chances of temporarily terminating  and that s what where the JPY trades at 





The CHF index trades in between demand and supply areas after being hammered on the back of a miss in the Swiss CPI  The successful leg down allows us now to draw key levels of resistance on the way up  which will require first for the Swissy to correct significantly higher  On the downside  there is a daily support area over 0 5  under today s close  It essentially makes the Swissy a non tradable currency in the near by vicinity amid the lack of levels definition

182634,404150,ADP,Asia Open  A Calamitous Affair,opinion,"Overnight U S  market recap
Following the U S  ADP employment report miss  U S  Treasury yields fell  the Yen soared  The S P 500 suffered its first back to back drops of more than 1  this year  Crude futures tanked to their weakest levels in a month while gold prices rallied back to the critical   1500 level 
Markets 
Investors interpreted the U S  ADP report as further proof that the U S  economy is slowing and possibly on the verge of a recession sending the S P 500 to its first back to back drops of more than 1  this year and breaching the critical 2900 level 
The market was still digesting the weaker ISM data  and the implication for global growth then got whacked with the slide on the ADP  NASDAQ ADP  data compounded by a catastrophic decline in U S  auto sales  Which now raises more questions than answers about the resilience of the U S  consumer 
The equity market price action was telling as it moved well beyond cyclical stocks and growth reactionary higher beta sectors like Oil  Miners   Industrial but was broad based suggesting that investors are not only taking chips off the table but might also be folding their cards 
Also  the U S  levied E U  goods with new tariffs greenlighted by WTO ruling adding another brick in the wall of worry for E U  investors 
Trade optimism could keep the risk on light flickering  but the dreary economic data does perhaps suggest that traders could be better sellers it this risk toxic environment 
Oil  slip sliding away 
U S  oil prices plummeted below  53 a barrel  Exacerbating the week long price slide was a  government report indicating U S  crude inventories actually increased  Which of course poorly contrasted the apparent one off API survey draw that was thought to be a result of oil stores getting depleted due to the knock on effect from the terrorist attack 
However  ignoring the inventory reports which have a propensity to swing wildly and forever miss   analysts   expectations  What s impossible to ignore is the economic realities being signalled in the latest run of doom and gloom financial market data which offers few if any reason for Oil investors to be optimistic over the outlook for global demand 
While the near term triggers may continue to relate to oil demand  next week U S  China trade talks remain the unknown variable which could lend a modicum of support 
All that glitters is gold  
The disappointing data out of the U S  and Europe  as well as weak earnings reports from automakers this week  has equity investors looking to golds umbrella to wait out this building storm 
Gold and silver are both trading constructively as 10 year US yields push below 1 60   with equities under pressure  The ten years low in U S  manufacturing ISM is being taken as a severe warning sign   With the market risk lights shifting from amber to flashing red  gold and silver may continue to be the haven beneficiary as investors diversify away from risk assets 
Currency markets
Let the games begin
Its all about the lead in U S  consumer data highlighted by the miss in private payroll and calamitous auto sales data 
On the back of the weaker U S  data prints  the USD has lost some of its shine from a growth differential prospect and with the U S  yields toppling a yield differential perspective also 
The SPX broke critical supports at its 50 day and 100 day moving averages  and risk sentiment continues to wobble  As a result  USD is struggling vs JPY and gold  but the greenback is holding up vs E M  and higher beta G10 
Even at 107 and change  given the global economic backdrop and potential for risk aversion to take hold the USDJPY could move lower but remains precariously perched tentatively bid above 107 support on possible trade optimism ",2019-10-03,Stephen Innes,https://www.investing.com/analysis/asia-open-a-calamitous-affair-200470158,200470158
182637,404153,ADP,First Signs Of Global Slowdown Hitting U S  Consumers,opinion,"Market movers today 

PMI services from around the world and US ISM non manufacturing are due out today  In particular  the US ISM non manufacturing index will be interesting given the sharp fall in the ISM manufacturing index  which caused a repricing by the Fed  ISM non manufacturing has been robust so far but the risk is the manufacturing recession spreads to the service sector  Also look out for the ISM non manufacturing employment sub index ahead of US non farm payrolls tomorrow 


We also have a range of FOMC members speaking  where hints of whether the Fed will ease again later this month or not remain key for market sentiment 


UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson presented his Brexit proposal to the public yesterday and now it is up to the EU to decide whether the proposal can make a basis for further talks or not  Notably  the EU may have concerns as to whether the proposal is simply part of a blame game by PM Johnson  Officials generally welcomed a plan from the UK but EU Commission head Juncker said yesterday that  problematic points  remain 


In the Scandies  we get housing data out of Norway and PMI services out of Sweden  see next page 

Selected market news 
Equities had a rough run on Wednesday after a somewhat weak ADP report spurred fears that the otherwise resilient looking US consumer is starting to be hit by the global industrial slowdown  ADP  NASDAQ ADP  employment on the headline came close to expectations at 135K vs consensus 140K but the previous month was revised down to 157K from 195K and thus on balance left the impression of weakening  The correlation of ADF to the all important non farm payrolls report from month to month is not high  but note that we have a below consensus call of 100K on the latter for tomorrow  Then signs of a softening labour market will be key for the Fed  as comfort has so far been taken from US private consumption holding up well amid the manufacturing slump on the back of trade woes 
Equities sold off overnight  with the S P down 1 8  and Nikkei down close to 2  on the day at the time of writing  Strong support was seen in US Treasuries and the curve bull steepened as 2Y yields dropped by 7 0bp and 10Y by 4 5bp  Regarding Fed pricing  the market is now pricing more than 70  probability of a 25bp October rate cut compared to 60  the day before  EUR USD edged higher and is back above 1 0950  while Brent crude is below the levels seen before the latest Middle East tensions 
Tensions between the EU and the US flared up as the WTO authorised tariffs on USD7 5bn of notably aircraft and food products from the EU due to the subsidies provided to Airbus  Separately  the US high level trade negotiations will likely start next week  and we now assign a 60  probability of an interim trade deal  which should help to de escalate the trade war  However  the road to a big deal is still paved with many obstacles  in our view  However  an interim deal should be positive for risk sentiment in the short term 
Scandi markets
Norway  The housing market has stabilised and price growth has proven positive  but moderate  Hence  both upside and downside risks from the housing market have diminished  Based on solid fundamentals in the labour market as well as the balanced housing market  we expect housing prices to grow 2 3   y y at least throughout next year  However  data from the largest housing provider  OBOS  points to 1 2   monthly growth in September  i e  well above Norges Bank s estimate from the latest MPR  However  this would probably be due to increasing demand as a result of fear of tighter regulations in the coming months 
Sweden  Today s services PMI will be monitored closely  not least after the plunge in the manufacturing numbers triggered a distinct move higher in EUR SEK  So how do the two compare  First  over time  there are no meaningful differences  manufacturing and services follow almost identical trends  only that manufacturing typically leads services by a few months  Second  on a monthly basis these series do not correlate well and it is not unusual for them to move in opposite directions  Considering the big drop in manufacturing  for the composite index to be steady at 53 6  this probably means that services need to rise to 56 4  from 54 1   Risks are skewed to the downside here  in our view 
Fixed income markets
On the back of soft risk sentiment  yesterday 5y5y EUR inflation notably edged lower again and we repeat our call for a move towards 1  for the 5y5y EUR inflation measure  as the global recession risks intensify  Note that German yields actually ticked higher yesterday despite the downward pressure on European stocks and that periphery and semi core underperformed 
Focus in respect of supply will be on France  which will introduce a new 10Y OAT  Nov  29   France will also issue in the long end with taps in the May 50 and Apr 55 OATs  Given the upcoming redemptions and coupons of more than EUR157bn  EUR54 2bn in France alone  in October from next week  the EUR8 9 5bn supply should be relatively easy to place  even though we are in the very long end of the OAT curve  Spain has also chosen to utilise the benign low yield environment  the positive cashflow backdrop  EUR 27 4 in Spain  and the upcoming PSPP buying  and will tap in the 10y and 30y benchmark bonds and in the 8y linker  We look for decent demand despite the upcoming 10 November general election and the uncertainty it would create 
FX markets
EUR USD held steady amid a broader sell off in equity markets but high beta currencies like the Scandies and AUD remain under pressure versus the EUR  Today  FX focus will turn to the last part of this month s PMIs where  notably  the services indices are released for Sweden and the UK  Further  in light of the gloomy US ISM manufacturing  the nonmanufacturing one should get some attention  Notably  if the US non manufacturing print comes out as gloomy as its manufacturing counterpart  we could see EUR USD going back above 1 10 today  Further  our economists are now putting a 60  probability on an interim trade deal  see US China Trade  which could fuel a temporary setback in the USD 
The PLN gained yesterday on the back of the central bank press conference  where the governor  1  ruled out the need for monetary easing and  2  played down the negative impact of today s expected EU court ruling on the Polish banks and economy  Should the EU ruling be less negative  there may be downside risk to our 1M EUR PLN forecast of 4 42   and even more so if we get an interim trade deal between the US and China next week 
Finally  note that in FX Strategy  G10 FX performance across the industrial cycle we provide a historical overview of G10 FX return distributions conditioned on the global industrial cycle  In short  history suggests that investors who expect further deceleration should be long JPY  CHF and USD and short GBP  AUD  SEK and NOK  Investors who are more upbeat should be long AUD  GBP and NZD   but stay on the side lines in Scandies until the industrial cycle expands again   and short CHF  USD and JPY

182652,404168,ADP,Onxeo  Next Generation Of DNA Damage Repair Inhibitors,opinion,"Onxeo  CSE ONXEO  is focused on the development of the next generation of DNA damage repair inhibitors from its novel oligonucleotide platON platform  The lead asset  AsiDNA  belongs to the same class of drugs as PARP inhibitors  but has a different mechanism of action  AsiDNA is in a Phase Ib trial in combination with chemotherapy in solid tumours  preliminary results are expected by end 2019  which is within the existing cash reach to Q320  To reflect the progress Onxeo has made with AsiDNA we have included the second indication for this asset in our valuation  but removed some of the legacy projects  Our updated valuation is  129m or  2 3 share 




Targeting already large and fast growing market
Onxeo s portfolio focuses on its novel platON platform  from which AsiDNA was the first product to enter clinical development  AsiDNA is the only oligonucleotide decoy agonist in development that disrupts and exhausts tumor DNA Damage Response mechanism  To date the only approved similar class drugs are four commercially successful PARP inhibitors  the first one was approved in December 2014   They all are indicated for cancers known to have a high degree of genomic instability  such as breast and ovarian cancers  which are also logical indications for AsiDNA  All four inhibitors are expected to generate total sales of US 1 6bn in 2019  DNA damage repair continues to attract significant attention and Onxeo s acquisition of AsiDNA in early 2016 was well timed as it was before it became apparent how successful PARP inhibitors would become 
AsiDNA finishing Phase I development
Onxeo s R D plans include finishing the ongoing Phase Ib study with AsiDNA in various solid tumours in combination with chemotherapy  first data end 2019  and initiating a Phase Ib II in combination with a PARP inhibitor in 2020  Then  depending on results and available funding  the company may continue with Phase II trials in these combinations  The rationale for combinations is the expected synergy with chemotherapy  but also AsiDNA s unique ability to abrogate the resistance to PARP inhibitors seen in preclinical studies  Our base case scenario now includes two cancer indications  breast and ovarian  in various settings and assumes that Onxeo will be able to partner AsiDNA after Phase II 
Valuation   129m or  2 3 share
We have revised our valuation to reflect Onxeo s decision to focus solely on AsiDNA  We have included a second indication for AsiDNA  offset by a review of the Validive out licensing deal  the removal of the residual rNPV of Beleodaq  the cash was received upfront after the royalty sale  and the removal of the small residual rNPV of Sitavig Loramyc  two legacy specialty products 
Business description
Onxeo is focused on cancer indications  specialising in novel DNA damage response inhibitors  AsiDNA  a novel DNA break repair inhibitor from Onxeo s platON platform  is in a Phase Ib trial with preliminary results expected in Q419  AsiDNA has a broad potential and can be combined with various anticancer treatments 
Investment summary
Company description  Focus on DNA damage repair
Onxeo is a French pure drug developer  which focuses on novel DNA damage repair inhibition technology  The technology came from the acquisition of DNA Therapeutics in March 2016  which brought the lead asset AsiDNA and a broad IP portfolio covering similar oligonucleotides that Onxeo organised into a platform technology called platON  Onxeo has one commercialised product  an HDAC inhibitor  belinostat  branded as Beleodaq in the US  AsiDNA is completing Phase Ib  Unlike similar class PARP inhibitors  AsiDNA is not dependent on specific gene mutations and therefore has broader application areas  In preclinical studies  Onxeo has shown that AsiDNA not only has synergistic potential in combinations with chemotherapeutic drugs that damage DNA  eg carboplatin   but also potentially has a unique feature to abrogate resistance to PARP inhibitors 
Valuation  Risk adjusted NPV of  129m or  2 3 share
The main revision to our model is the AsiDNA potential  We now include two cancer indications  breast and ovarian cancer   AsiDNA s potential is much broader in various other solid tumours and in combinations with different anticancer treatments including radiotherapy  For valuation purposes  we chose these two cancers  as they are of high priority in Onxeo s near term R D plans  We assume Phase II development between 2020 2023  Phase III studies starting in 2023 and launch in 2026  We also assume that Onxeo will be able to partner AsiDNA after Phase II  We factor in R D costs of  10m per cancer indication  the industry average for Phase II trials in oncology   This implies Onxeo will need to raise more funds  as the current cash reach is to Q320  We have used historical PARP inhibitor licensing deals as benchmark averages for our licensing model  total deal value of US 417m split into  40m upfront payment  roughly 10  of the total value  and the rest into R D and commercial milestones  50 50  plus tiered 12 15  royalties 
Financials  Cash runway to Q320
Onxeo booked revenues of  6 1m in 2018  of which  2 3m were recurring Beleodaq sales  In June 2018  the company had effectively sold the Beleodaq royalties to SWK Holdings for US 7 5m upfront  Total operating costs were  9 7m in 2018 versus  28 7m in 2017  This fall was mainly due to lower R D expenditure after the completion of the Phase III ReLive study in September 2017  For 2019 and 2020 we forecast total operating costs of  15 0m and  15 3m  respectively  Onxeo had a cash position of  6 3m at end Q219  In June 2019  the company announced that it had renewed an equity financing line with Nice   Green  which based on the current share price level  would extend the cash reach to around Q320 
Sensitivities  Biotech risks apply
Onxeo is subject to the usual drug development risks  including clinical development delays or failures  regulatory risks  competitor successes  partnering setbacks and financing risks  The main sensitivities relate to the lead asset  AsiDNA  If Onxeo continues the development beyond the ongoing Phase Ib study it will require additional investment  The company aims to accumulate an attractive data package for the potential early out licensing of AsiDNA  after Phase Ib   However  we believe that the value inflection that clinical trial readouts typically provide could be used to fund the Phase II studies  which would advance AsiDNA to late stage R D and  presuming a successful clinical trial  would warrant much better licensing deal terms  Onxeo announced in October 2017 that the court s decision in the litigation case was unfavourable and the company was ordered to pay  12m to SpeBio and other smaller charges to SpePharm SpeBio for costs incurred to market Loramyc in Europe  Onxeo paid the required amount  but it owns a 50  stake in SpeBio  which is a joint venture with SpePharm  therefore the net impact is unclear at present  but Onxeo aims to claim back the proportional payment 
Outlook  Expanding DDR inhibitor R D portfolio
Onxeo s portfolio focuses on its novel platON platform  in early 2018 AsiDNA was the first product from the platform to enter clinical development  Exhibit 1   The compounds on platON belong to the DDR inhibitor class  which is vital in DNA repair regulation  This area is currently attracting significant attention from both large pharma and biotech  To date  the only approved drugs are commercially successful PARP  poly ADP  NASDAQ ADP  ribose  polymerase  inhibitors 
Belinostat  an HDAC inhibitor  is out licensed and commercialised as Beleodaq for the second line treatment of peripheral T cell lymphoma  It is approved and marketed in the US following conditional approval and the partner bears the responsibility for any subsequent required studies  As Onxeo s business model focuses on value creation from bringing preclinical assets through to clinical mid stage  it effectively sold the royalty stream to SWK Holdings for  7 5m upfront in June 2018  raising non dilutive funds for the development of AsiDNA 




platON  Novel technology platform with AsiDNA first to Phase I
Lead asset AsiDNA   acquisition background
Onxeo gained access to the AsiDNA asset and the IP  around which the platON platform was formed  via the acquisition of DNA Therapeutics in February 2016   1 7m upfront   1m on Phase II initiation  in total up to  25m per approved indication can be paid out   The most advanced asset is AsiDNA  formerly known as DT01   a novel clinical stage compound  It had already been tested in clinical trials by DNA Therapeutics and showed positive safety tolerability results and preliminary anti tumour activity in a Phase I trial with melanoma patients when administered locally  The deal terms appeared attractive and back loaded for an asset that had Phase I data and could address major cancer indications in broad settings  This was probably due to the following  in our view 
the timing of the acquisition was very good  as the first approved PARP inhibitor  Lynparza  December 2014  had just finished its first year in the market generating sales of US 218m  therefore the R D risk was somewhat lower  but the scale of the commercial success for this class of drugs was still not fully recognised  Lynparza is expected to generate US 1 1bn in sales in 2019 and the four approved  to date  PARP inhibitors are expected to generate total sales of US 1 6bn  
at the time of the acquisition AsiDNA was being explored only as an intratumourally administered anticancer drug  which limited the number of cancer indications it could target  intratumoural injection may still be explored by Onxeo  
With the commercial success of the PARP inhibitors  there is now significant interest in the area from various players and Onxeo s acquisition timing means that AsiDNA is at the forefront of the next wave entering mid to late stage development 
Evolution of platON platform
Onxeo recognised that the potential of the technology behind AsiDNA could be increased substantially with systemic administration  Following the acquisition Onxeo completed a preclinical programme and repositioned the asset for systemic use  Onxeo s main focus was on advancing AsiDNA to clinical trials  but based on the preclinical data the company also recognised the potential in other analogue compounds  In October 2017  this was formally introduced as a proprietary platform   platON 
The second platON asset that Onxeo has chosen to progress is OX401  which is now in the proof of concept preclinical phase  results expected by Q419   OX401 is also an oligonucleotide decoy agonist targeting PARP proteins and the STING  STimulator of INterferon Genes  pathway  STING is a relatively novel research target in immunoncology  which positions OX401 as a potential combination partner with other immunoncology agents  such as checkpoint inhibitors  In addition to systemic use  Onxeo continues to explore its oligonucleotide decoy technology s potential for intratumoural administration 
AsiDNA  composition
AsiDNA is a decoy oligonucleotide and is comprised of 64 nucleotides in two complementary strands  ie 32 nucleotides in each strand   In tumour cells AsiDNA acts as an agonist and interferes with the repair of tumour DNA by  distracting  the tumour cell s DNA repair mechanism  Decoy oligonucleotides are based on three components  double strand oligonucleotides  a linker  coupling agent  and a cellular uptake facilitator  Exhibit 2   Each of these compounds can be modified  resulting in different products  and the main mechanism of action is to act as a decoy and target the mechanisms of tumour DNA function regulation 




AsiDNA is now being tested in a Phase Ib trial in combination with classic chemotherapy agents  carboplatin   paclitaxel  in various solid tumours  Results are expected in Q419  Depending on available funding  near term development could include 
Phase Ib II trial to assess synergy with chemotherapy in selected indications 
Phase Ib II trial to assess the abrogation of resistance to PARP inhibitors  likely in maintenance treatment of advanced ovarian cancer 
DNA repair pathways and first breakthrough drugs
In the past five years four PARP inhibitors have been approved by the FDA  prompting a surge in interest in DNA repair inhibition 
olaparib  Lynparza  AstraZeneca   approved in December 2014  expected 2019 sales of US 1 1bn  EvaluatePharma   indicated for relapsed ovarian cancer in maintenance setting  BRCA mutated or non mutated   and for second line treatment of metastatic breast cancer  BRCA mutated  HER2 negative  
rucaparib  Rubraca  Clovis Oncology   approved in December 2016  expected 2019 sales of US 149m  indicated for relapsed ovarian cancer in maintenance setting  BRCA mutated or non mutated  
niraparib  Zejula  GSK Tesaro   approved in March 2016  expected 2019 sales of US 310m  indicated for relapsed ovarian cancer in maintenance setting  BRCA mutated or non mutated  
talazoparib  Talzenna   Pfizer   NYSE PFE    approved in October 2018  expected 2019 sales of US 44m  indicated for treatment of BRCA mutated  HER2 negative metastatic breast cancer 
Regardless of the type of DNA lesion  endogenous like replication errors or exogenous like chemotherapy and radiation  cells initiate a highly coordinated cascade of events known as DNA damage response  which leads to the initiation of the damage repair mechanism specific to the type of the lesion  Exhibit 3   There are at least four main  partly overlapping  DNA repair pathways in mammals  base excision repair  BER   mismatch repair  MMR   nucleotide excision repair  NER  and double strand break repair via two different pathways   homologous recombination  HR  and non homologous end joining  NHEJ  
Single strand breaks are repaired by BER  Other enzymes involved in BER are PARP1 and PARP2  which act as sensors and signal transducers1  PARP inhibition therefore affects this pathway specifically 
Double strand breaks are the most serious lesions  one unrepaired double strand break could trigger cell death   Primarily  these are repaired via two pathways  HR and NHEJ  The stage of cell cycle influences which mechanism is used  Among the important proteins involved in this pathway are BRCA1 and BRCA2 
NER pathway repairs a wide class of helix distorting lesions that interfere with base pairing and obstruct transcription and normal replication 
MMR pathway repairs base mismatches that occur during cell DNA replication 
PARP inhibitors  the most advanced drugs in the DNA repair inhibition field  inhibit the BER pathway  This results in the accumulation of single strand DNA breaks  eventually leading to double strand breaks  This process could cause cell death  but in healthy cells double strand breaks are repaired via HR or NHEJ pathways  In a special case of mutated BRCA1 2 genes  the HR pathway is dysfunctional and these cells have been shown to be 100  to 1 000 fold more sensitive to PARP inhibition2  A biological defect such as mutated BRCA  dysfunctional HR   complemented by a drug leading to cell death  a PARP inhibitor in this case  blocks BER   is known as synthetic lethality 
BRCA1 2 mutations are found in around 15  of all cases of ovarian cancer and 5 10  of total breast cancer patients  The first three PARP inhibitors were approved for ovarian cancer  Initially they were explored in BRCA mutated ovarian cancers  but efficacy has also been shown in BRCA non mutated ovarian cancer as well  At a later stage  the label of the first PARP inhibitor  Lynparza  was extended to include metastatic breast cancer  BRCA mutated  HER2 negative  and the latest PARP inhibitor  talazoparib  which was approved in October 2018  is indicated for breast cancer only  BRCA mutated  HER2 negative  




The rationale for using AsiDNA standalone and in combination
PARP inhibitors have shown promising efficacy and safety in clinical trials  but the main drawbacks are the necessity of a dysfunctional HR pathway and a rapid emergence of resistance2  First in class AsiDNA is based on signal interfering DNA technology  if introduced into a cell it acts as a signal mimicking the damage of the cell s own DNA  AsiDNA molecules are short double strand DNA  32 nucleotides in each strand  that mimic double strand breaks in the cell s DNA and are recognised as  damaged DNA  by repair and signalling proteins  Namely  AsiDNA hyper activates PARP1 and DNA PK leading to a cascade of repair proteins being recruited to  repair the damage   as a result the actual damage of a cell s DNA remains unrepaired  This action renders the HR and NHEJ pathways dysfunctional  Therefore  AsiDNA is clearly differentiated from PARP inhibitors  as it acts more upstream  it is not a specific enzyme inhibitor but activates PARP  ie  distracts   when olaparib inhibits  among other repair proteins  This treatment approach has a broader action than PARP inhibitors  as it targets the entire DNA repair system by hijacking the DNA repair signalling 
Since HR and NHEJ are responsible for repairing double strand breaks  AsiDNA s ability to disrupt these pathways was initially explored by the original inventors in combination with DNA damaging therapies  such as radiotherapy and chemotherapy  Due to its independent mechanism of action there is also strong rationale to use AsiDNA in combination with PARP inhibitors to potentiate their effect in BRCA mutated tumours  In addition  AsiDNA could potentially be used to sensitise BRCA non mutated tumours to PARP inhibitors  which in turn would expand their use substantially

This was the first clinical trial Onxeo conducted after acquiring AsiDNA and is the most advanced dataset available at present  The open label  dose escalation Phase I DNA Repair Inhibitor administered IntraVenously  DRIIV  recruited patients  n 22  with various advanced solid tumours  with the first patient treated in April 2018  All patients had metastatic cancers and were failing or progressing after one or more standard treatments with no further therapeutic options  The study aimed to assess 
The safety tolerability profile  dose limiting toxicities  DLTs  and the maximum tolerated dose  MTD   and the recommended dose for subsequent efficacy trials 




Onxeo also explored various biomarkers that might help to gauge the activity of AsiDNA and stratify patients in later trials 
The final results were announced in May 2019  The findings from a total of 22 patients who received five dose levels of AsiDNA ranging from 200mg to 1300mg include 
No serious drug related events and no dose limiting toxicity at doses 200  400 and 600mg  first dose limiting toxicity appeared at 900mg level  1 6  
Maximum tolerated dose not reached  There was no need to test the highest dose level  1800mg   as the therapeutic window between the optimal dose of 600mg and the highest tested dose of 1 300mg was considered sufficient 
Biomarker analysis showed that AsiDNA 
Increased activity of gH2AX and pHSP90 as early as the second level dose  400mg    H2AX and pHSP90 are established biomarkers for the activation of DNA PK  one of the major targets for AsiDNA 
Tumour proliferation biomarker Ki67 decreased 
The activity was consistent within the therapeutic window 
At the optimal dose level of 600mg  among the three patients included in the cohort  two patients with relapsed metastatic colorectal cancer were controlled with medical imaging  which showed no further disease progression after the second treatment cycle  the treatment with AsiDNA was continued for three months  
Our view
The rationale for this study was built on previous findings from the Phase I DRIIM  conducted by the inventor company  In that trial AsiDNA was administered intratumourally in melanoma patients  While the data released from the DRIIV 1 trial are still very early and no conclusions about efficacy can be made as yet  we find it reassuring that no serious drug related side effects emerged with intravenous administration  The consistent pattern of increase in activity biomarkers also demonstrated that the drug reaches its target after intravenous administration  AsiDNA is a unique compound with no close comparators with respect to mechanism of action and therefore there was no visibility on the safety tolerability profile via a systemic administration before DRIIV 1 results  safety data via local injection in the DRIIM trial was good  
Phase Ib DRIIV 1b  extension  study ongoing




The next step in the development plan for AsiDNA is the extension of the Phase Ib  DRIIV 1b  study  which started enrolling patients in May 2019  This is the first study testing AsiDNA in combination with carboplatin plus paclitaxel  in up to 18 patients  9   9 if dose limiting toxicity is reached  Exhibit 5  with solid tumours eligible for such treatments  such as lung  breast  ovarian or head and neck cancers   The study will evaluate the efficacy of the combination treatment using RECIST criteria  response evaluation criteria in solid tumours  and the initial results are expected in Q419 
Future development options for AsiDNA and partnering strategy
As discussed above  the AsiDNA s mechanism of action allows it to be positioned in various combinations with other anticancer therapies  Therefore  near term R D plans include studies with AsiDNA in combination with classic chemotherapy drugs and novel PARP inhibitors  Exhibit 6   We note that only the Phase Ib DRIIV 1b study is ongoing  other trials are at the planning stage and the results from the DRIIV 1b trial will help to design other studies  The final decision on which indications to prioritise will be made in the near future  but ovarian and breast cancer seem to be most likely targets at present  In this regard  we find the Phase Ib II study with AsiDNA in combination with PARP inhibitors of particular interest  It will explore AsiDNA s potential to abrogate tumour resistance to PARP inhibitors  There is a strong rationale for such a combination and the proof of concept was demonstrated in the animal studies  discussed below   To date  the four approved PARP inhibitors have been approved for the treatment of ovarian or breast cancer  While commercially successful drugs  they still suffer from the rapid development of resistance  so AsiDNA s benign safety profile could be a good partner drug because of its ability to abrogate resistance to the drug 




When it comes to late stage development  Onxeo s business strategy implies it will seek to partner or out license the development of AsiDNA  Central to Onxeo s investment case is its ability to secure a timely out licensing agreement  The company would consider out licensing soon after the ongoing Phase Ib trial  which would allow the company to focus on earlier stage products in the platON platform  To be prepared for that outcome Onxeo is accumulating as broad data package as possible  However  as Onxeo employs an early  to mid stage development biotech business model  the data readouts  if positive  should create value inflection points for the share price  which would allow it to raise the necessary funds for the Phase II development  This option would lead to better deal terms and better returns to investors willing to take on the Phase II development risk 
Our base case scenario
In our model we assume that Onxeo will be able to partner AsiDNA after Phase II and the partner will cover all development and marketing costs from this point  We include two cancer indications  breast and ovarian cancer  detailed below  in our Onxeo rNPV valuation model  We assume the two Phase II studies are initiated in 2020  Phase III studies in 2023 and launch in 2026  The R D cost for each of the two Phase II trials is  10m  industry average Phase II trials in oncology   This implies Onxeo will need to raise more funds  as the current cash reach is to Q320  see Financials   Our partnering assumptions include a fairly typical deal structure  including an upfront payment  development and sales related milestones  in addition to royalties on global sales  We assume that AsiDNA will be out licensed after the Phase II studies  ie in 2022  We have used historical PARP inhibitor licensing deals as benchmarks for our valuation  Exhibit 17   In our model we include the total deal value of US 417m  average of the values of the three deals   This is split into an upfront payment of US 40m  roughly 10  of the total value  with the rest split into R D and commercial milestones  These values are equally split between the two indications  We use tiered 12 15  royalty rates  We summarise our other valuation assumptions later in the report 
Phase I DRIIM results  AsiDNA via local administration 
DNA Therapeutics  the original developer  tested AsiDNA  DT01 at that time  in a clinical trial with skin melanoma patients  In the Phase I DRIIM study the drug was injected intratumourally or peritumourally in conjunction with radiation therapy  DRIIM was an open label  non randomised  multicentre  dose escalation study  In total  23 patients received a full course of treatment and were evaluated for safety and pharmacokinetics  while 21 patients with a total of 76 skin melanoma lesions were evaluated for initial efficacy  Key headline results were presented at ASCO in May 2015 and published later 
AsiDNA was well tolerated and did not induce additional toxicity when combined with radiotherapy  The maximum tolerated dose was not reached 
AsiDNA did not cause innate immune response  which would imply that the drug is less likely to be neutralised by the immune system or cause unwanted significant local inflammation 
In the 21 patients that were evaluated for efficacy  a total of 76 tumour lesions were treated  of which 41 lesions were injected with AsiDNA 
The objective response rate of all lesions was 59   complete response was 30  and partial response was 29   For comparison  similar radiation therapy schemes were reported to have a complete response rate of 9 4 
The overall response rate of the 41 lesions injected with AsiDNA was 68  whereas in the 35 non injected lesions it was 49   P 0 103   This lack of significant difference could in part be explained by systemic exposure to AsiDNA after it was absorbed from the local injection site and an abscopal effect through immunogenicity  ie the immune system was trained to attack both the injected tumours and the non injected 
These results showed that AsiDNA was well tolerated and had an effect on lesions when injected locally and that a systemic delivery is also possible  As discussed  we believe that this potential to reposition AsiDNA for systemic delivery was the primary driver for Onxeo s acquisition of DNA Therapeutics in March 2016 
Preclinical data highlights
First proof of concept of AsiDNA systemic administration




After Onxeo acquired AsiDNA it completed the required additional preclinical development and the first preclinical proof of concept data demonstrating the potential for intravenous administration were released in July 2017  AsiDNA standalone significantly decreased tumour growth in triple negative breast cancer  TNBC  model and improved survival  while a combination with the classic chemotherapy agent carboplatin significantly reduced the growth further and outperformed all other arms  Exhibit 7

A clear risk off pall hit the currency market today with both Asian and European equity bourses in the red on concerns over global growth 
Yesterday s very weak US ISM manufacturing number shocked the market and sent US equities lower as the data showed the worst performance for the sector since the Great Recession 
Up to now  the markets have been operating on the decoupling theory assuming that US growth would pick up in H2 of this year and diverge from the slowdown in Europe and Asia  However  yesterday s data makes clear that slowdown in demand is now fully global and the US may see a further deceleration in months ahead 
Today s ADP data may provide a clue to the strength of employment demand in the US economy  but the market will really focus on tomorrow ISM Non Manufacturing report which not only provides the best forecast for monthly Non Farm payrolls figures due Friday but also will show the state of the service sector which makes up more than 70  of the US economy 
If tomorrow s ISM data also misses its mark the sell off in risk is likely to accelerate hard with USD JPY potentially falling to the 107 00 level before the end of the week  For now  however  FX majors will likely remain within ranges with USD JPY testing 107 50 support while EUR USD tests the 1 0900 level once again as markets try to determine just how severe the global slowdown has become ",2019-10-02,Boris Schlossberg,https://www.investing.com/analysis/global-growth-worries-send-risk-fx-lower-200469808,200469808
182665,404181,ADP,Markets Shaken By U S  Coupling,opinion,"The U S  decoupling story from the weakening global economy is dealt a severe blow after Tuesday s ugly U S  economic reports  Global equity indices resume their sell offs as the ISM manufacturing survey slumped to 10 year low  raising fresh questions on whether the division inside the Fed could jeopardize markets  SPX and Dow Jones 30 Futures are currently below their 100 DMA at 2918 and 26380 respectively  The U S  ADP employment report is due later today  The Premium short trade in DOW30 was closed for a 480 pt gain  while 2 other trades in indices remain deep in the green  Ashraf tells me several clients had questioned the decision to issue three different trades in indices  all shorts  at a time when the market was lifting higher  
Markets had initially been off to a solid start in October with sentiment steadily improving  The solid mood was underscored by the final Markit manufacturing PMI  It was bumped to 51 1 from 51 0 in the preliminary reading and it helped to solidify expectations for a solid reading in the ISM survey to be released shortly afterwards  The result was anything but solid  It sank to 47 8 from 50 0 expected and to the lowest level since 2009  New orders and employment were particularly soft 
The data flipped the script on theme in the markets as USD JPY dropped to 107 55 from 108 45  while US 2 year yields fell 13 bps intraday in hint that the Fed may have to ease sooner rather than later  U S  crude oil has reversed all of last week s gap  hitting  53 05 
The sudden weakness puts an extra focus on this busy week of U S  economic data starting with the ADP  NASDAQ ADP  report at 12 15 GMT  13 15 London   The survey has been a poor predictor of non farm payrolls lately  so the effect may be more muted  even on a wide miss from the  140K estimate  Other data still to come this week includes the services PMIs  factory orders and non farm payrolls ",2019-10-02,Ashraf Laidi,https://www.investing.com/analysis/markets-shaken-by-us-coupling-200469815,200469815
182666,404182,ADP,ADP Payrolls Set To Ease,opinion,"Traders will be looking to the  Automatic Data Processing  ADP payrolls report due later today  The report released by the private payrolls processing firm ADP  NASDAQ ADP  will set the tone for this Friday s nonfarm payrolls report 
But given the fact that the ADP report is confined to just about 411 000 firms in the United States  the data is limited in scope 

Still  the trends are something that investors look towards in assessing how the U S  official payrolls will result 




ADP Payrolls Change  August 2019
The general view is for hiring in the private sector to slow in September  Thus  the market estimates that ADP payrolls will rise by 140 000 
This comes after the report in August showed an increase of 195 000  The data  back then  beat the consensus estimates of 148 000 
However  we will see some revisions to the data for August 
The three month moving average trends in the ADP reports have been consistently falling  The moving average of payrolls declined from just around 250 000 in February to 100 000 in July 
The steep decline was partly due to the report for May 
In May this year  ADP showed just a 41 000 increase from the month before  This was one of the worst headline releases since the markets bottomed in May 2010  The declines came mostly from small firms with less than 50 employees 

The ADP  NASDAQ ADP  payrolls report comes as investors try to place how the U S  economy is faring  There is no doubt that the economy is in the late cycle state of expansion  This is evident from the fact that despite expansion  the pace of growth has slowed 
The private sector payrolls have been steadily rising since the drop in May  Private payrolls have increased for three consecutive months so far 
Keep an Eye on Previous Data Revisions
ADP payrolls have been rising above the three month moving average for the past two months  However  remember that the report consistently also revises the previous month s data 
The jump in payrolls in August was stronger than expected  When compared to the official payrolls report  this was a large increase  Therefore  there is a good chance that ADP s August payrolls could be revised lower 
On a year to date basis  the average pace of payroll growth has been somewhat slower  However  if the current trend continues  we could expect to see this gap narrow  This still would be a slower pace of hiring comparing to the year before 
The ADP payrolls report will  at best  give insights into the general trends in hiring  With wage growth averaging between 0 3  and 0 4  on a monthly basis  the growth has been sluggish at best 

Another thing to look into will be the effects of the trade wars  There has been much talk about the U S  and China trade wars impacting the U S  economy including the labor market 
However  the current slowdown in the labor market is certainly not entirely due to the trade wars  With overall growth slowing  demand in various sectors has been somewhat slow 
This has largely led to the weaker pace of hiring  Furthermore  despite a weaker pace of average earnings  inflation remains tame  This puts not much pressure on consumers in the short term 
In conclusion  the ADP payrolls report for September is likely to come in line with the estimates  It will be Friday s official payrolls report that will be more closely watched ",2019-10-02,ORBEX,https://www.investing.com/analysis/adp-payrolls-set-to-ease-200469846,200469846

	The market remains concerned about yesterday s manufacturing report  Apparently  its going to take longer than 24 hours to get over a second consecutive month of contraction and the lowest reading in more than a decade 
	And it didn t help that today s ADP  NASDAQ ADP  employment report was a little light with only 135 000 jobs being added in September  which was also down from the previous month   The major indices started the day in the red and kept slipping  though they did close off their lows 
	The Dow plunged 1 86   or about 494 points  to 26 078 62  The S P was off 1 79  to 2887 61 and the NASDAQ dipped 1 56    or about 123 points  to 7785 25 
	Such a performance would sting under any circumstance  but it s all the more painful coming after yesterday s selloff  For example  the Dow has started the fourth quarter by plunging more than 3   or approximately 800 points  in the first two days 
	That s a worse start than last year s fourth quarter  and we all remember how that turned out 
	The market is back to worrying about a recession  which makes tomorrow s services report and Friday s jobs report crucial for the rest of this week 
	Remember  services makes up a much bigger chunk of the economy than manufacturing and was north of 56 in August  anything over 50 shows expansion    
	However  its not how you start a quarter that matters  it s how you end it  And there s a number of potential catalysts on deck that could turn things around in short order  especially the trade meetings next week and earnings season  Today s Portfolio Highlights 
	Large Cap Trader  Now you see why John loaded up on short positions late last month  While the S P was down 1 8  today  this portfolio had three of the top five movers among all ZU names  Those strong performances came from Proshares Ultrapro Short Dow30  SDOW   5 5    Proshares Ultrapro Short S P500  SPXU   5 4   and Proshares Ultrapro Short NASDAQ  SQQQ   5 2     Surprise Trader   If yesterday was a butt kicking for stocks  then today was the extra kick in the ribs  Stocks were smashed  gapping lower and fading the entire morning  The selling did not let up until the final two hours of the session when there was a small bid 
	 I had a hunch we d gap down after breaking the 50 day but that didn t make it feel any better  An ADP payroll number shy of expectations was today s bit of bad news that set off an already ornery market 
	 If the ADP number today is any indication  the NFP number on Friday could come in a little light  With two days of heavy selling already on the books  this market is looking oversold down here  The  No Man s Land  between the 200 and 50 day moving average is not where you want to spend too much time  I think tomorrow will prove to be a great buying opportunity for equities      Dave Bartosiak

182678,404194,ADP,Nonfarm Payrolls  Another Solid Report On Tap ,opinion,"Background
Seemingly every month  we remind traders that the Nonfarm Payrolls report is significant because of how it impacts monetary policy  In other words  the Fed is the  transmission mechanism  between U S  economic reports and market prices  so any discussion about NFP should start with a look at the state of the U S  central bank 
This month  the best single word summary of the Fed s position is besieged  In a controversial  last week  former NY Fed President Bill Dudley argued that the central bank should not  enable  President Trump by cutting interest rates to offset the impact of the escalating trade tensions with China  The President has repeatedly accused the Fed of bias  and this article partially vindicated his view  While Dudley has since tried to  walk back  his argument  the article helped cement the probability of an interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve next month  lest the apolitical institution be accused of bias 
In that light  this week s NFP report may have a smaller than usual impact on markets unless it s truly shocking  At this point it seems like a 25bps interest rate cut in the middle of the month is a  done deal   and any jobs report that is reasonably aligned with market expectations is unlikely to change the immediate outlook for the Fed 
NFP Forecast
Unlike   we have access to all four of our historically reliable leading indicators for Nonfarm Payrolls 
The ADP Employment report improved to 195k from a downwardly revised reading of 142k last month The ISM Manufacturing Survey employment component fell to 47 4  down nearly 4 points from last month s 51 7 reading The ISM Non Manufacturing Survey employment component fell to 53 1  down 3 points from last month s 56 2 reading The 4 week moving average of initial unemployment claims edged higher to 216 250  up from last month s historically low 211 500 reading On balance  these leading indicators point to another solid month of job growth  with a reasonable forecast above expectations in the 180 200k range  That said  the recent deterioration in the ISM surveys could overwhelm the historically strong ADP  NASDAQ ADP  and initial claims readings and bring the headline reading back toward consensus expectations in the 160k range 
Regardless  the month to month fluctuations in this report are notoriously difficult to predict  so we wouldn t put too much stock into any forecasts  including ours   Most importantly  readers should note that the unemployment rate and  especially  the wages component of the report will also influence how traders interpret the strength of the reading

In the event the jobs and the wage data beat expectations  then we would favor looking for short term bullish setups on the dollar against the Japanese yen with USD JPY recently stabilizing around the 106 00 handle  But if the jobs data misses expectations  then we would favor looking for bearish setups on the dollar against the Swiss franc  given the medium term bearish trend and potential for safe haven demand for the Swissie ",2019-09-06,Matthew Weller,https://www.investing.com/analysis/nonfarm-payrolls-another-solid-report-on-tap-200462210,200462210

US treasuries sold off heavily and the curve was pushed more than 10bp higher  European bond markets were also under strong pressure as the market scaled back QE expectations ahead of the ECB meeting next week and as the lower geopolitical risks  Brexit  Hong Kong and trade war  continued to support European equity markets  30Y German yields turned positive for the first time since the beginning of August  We published an ECB preview this morning  see box to the right   We still expect the ECB to deliver a dovish package despite the apparent improvement in global risk appetite and the QE comments from hawkish ECB members over the past week  see our  ECB Preview   6 September 2019  
The Riksbank stole the limelight in Scandinavia yesterday  On the back of weakening growth  higher unemployment and geopolitical turbulence internationally it was widely expected that the Riksbank would delay the next hike  It did not and still said that a hike is to be expected around the turn of the year  Instead it lowered the rate path by up to 50bp  In many ways this resembles its reaction function in 2011 when Europe was heading into another crisis  In September 2011 the Riksbank acknowledged that the growth outlook had deteriorated and lowered  flattened  the rate path  Still it was signalling hikes through 2011 2012  Only three months later  in December  it delivered the first of a series of rate cuts  We do not think the Riksbank will hike this time around either and keep our forecast that the Riksbank will cut rates in Q1 next year

Only data point out of Sweden today is budget balance from SNDO  which is not a market mover 
In Norway  the recovery in the August PMI supports our view that the decline in the PMI in June and July was exaggerating the slowdown in the manufacturing sector  Actual manufacturing has been considerably stronger and this has probably continued  with an increase of 0 2  m m in July 
Fixed income markets
The fixed income market continued to sell off and the curve bear steepened as risk appetite continued to improve yesterday and as the market continued to focus on the outlook for a lower than expected ECB QE programme next week  30Y Germany jumped 14bp and yields turned positive for the first time since the beginning of August 
This morning Bloomberg published its survey ahead of the ECB meeting next week  It showed that an 80  majority of economists expect the introduction of a QE programme next week  The median is for a EUR30bn programme for 12 months  The median is also for a 10bp cut followed by another 10bp cut in December  Analysts expect  mitigating measures  as well

FX markets
A strong ISM non manufacturing print halted the rebound in EUR USD before it reached the 1 1100 level  as the USD found support from a rise in USD rates  We look for non farm to come in in line with consensus expectations today and furthermore current pricing of a 25bp cut from the Fed in September should make life easy for Fed chair Powell when he speaks tonight  Hence  EUR USD could end the week on a quiet note 
EUR SEK was down eight figures immediately after the Riksbank meeting  arguably in response to the decision not to postpone the next hike further into 2020  However  the move was partially reversed during the day and the net negative effect on the cross was muted relative to the sharp re pricing of the rate path  removing 7 of 17bp of rate cuts   One reason may be the substantial flattening of the rate path  which supports our view that the Riksbank will remain one of the softest central banks around the globe for a long time  The decision today may be viewed as relatively hawkish compared to an ECB bazooka next week and thus temporarily weigh on EUR SEK  We still think the next Riksbank move is a cut and as such we continue to see EUR SEK as a buy on dips  keeping 1M and 3M  NYSE MMM  targets at 10 70 and 10 80 
EUR GBP moved to a new low at 0 895  We expect the cross to trade in 0 88 0 90 on the back of politics moving towards an election and extension and a new discussion will be needed once it becomes formal that the election process is underway  In our view  the positive drivers for the GBP are  1  a sudden stop  which would lead to a severe UK recession  appears to become postponed and  2  an imminent shock to the exchange rate via tariffs looks less likely

182682,404198,ADP,European Open   Trade War  NFP  Brexit  Gold  Oil,opinion,"Markets flat ahead of jobs report




It s all looking a little flat as we head into the European open on Friday  as positive trade developments quickly fade and traders await the U S  jobs data 
Investors were quite clearly buoyed on Thursday by a phone call between the U S  and China that appeared to lay the foundations for an early October meeting in Washington  Whether the meeting actually takes place or resolves anything is anyone s guess but investors are clinging to any hope of bringing this trade war to an end 
Data from the U S  on Thursday further lifted sentiment  as ADP reported strong jobs growth last month and the ISM survey suggested all is rosy for the bulk of the economy  Of course  we are seeing pockets of weakness appearing but the most important part of the economy remains in good health 
Of course  if the jobs data starts to disappoint then sentiment may quickly change but there was nothing in the data we had on Thursday that suggests it will just yet  The ADP  NASDAQ ADP  report may have lifted expectations for today s NFP a little  while unemployment is expected to remain at 3 7  with earnings up a solid 3 1   Not that any of this will stop the Fed cutting this month as markets have backed them into a corner and forced their will 
Has this week really gone so badly for Boris 
This week has been everything we expected and more in Parliament  as PM Boris Johnson found himself of the losing side of countless votes but retains hope of securing the election he craves  He started the week claiming he doesn t want an election  unfortunately this was just as transparent as claims that the prorogation was just normal procedure ahead of the Queen s speech  rather than a cynical attempt to frustrate and evade Parliament 
Some suggest the PM is now out of options as the opposition refuse to give him what he wants  The reality is that an election looks inevitable and all of this week s theatrics are simply intended to feed the narrative of Parliament overriding the will of the people  and further delays will not help when that election comes  Sterling may be buoyed by this week s events but it may be less impressed if Boris  plan starts to come together 
Gold correction underway 
Gold bulls may finally be throwing in the towel following numerous failed attempts to break historic resistance and take the yellow metal back to a region it spent two years in earlier this decade  Buoyed by trade developments  investors moved away from safe haven s and scuppered gold s push just as it was taking another run at  1 560 
The yellow metal has fallen 3  from Thursday s peak and below  1 520 which had been providing some support  It continues to hold above  1 500 but in reality  the key level below is  1 480  A break of this may signal a much larger correction  one which could be argued to be overdue given the size of the rally we ve seen since the start of summer 
Brent stumbles at range highs
Oil has had a rather enjoyable second half of the week  Lifted by improved risk appetite on the back of trade talks and an unexpected inventory drawdown on Thursday  Brent has surged from its range lows   around  58   to test the range highs around  61 62  It has stumbled at the highs again though but if it can break above here  it could be a very bullish shift in oil after what has been a rough few months

Euro Retreats from a Five Day High

The common currency tested a five day high intraday  rising to 1 1083  The common currency gained largely due to the flows in the U S  dollar  Economic data was mixed with ADP  NASDAQ ADP  payrolls released stronger than expected  But the services PMI from Markit came out lower than forecasts  However  this was overshadowed by the ISM s non manufacturing PMI  Activity in the non manufacturing sectors rose to 56 4 in August 
EURUSD Retests Minor Resistance
The currency pair was seen rising to a weekly high as price action promptly gave up the gains  The retest of the previously breached support area at 1 1065 has been tested for resistance  This could mean that the euro currency could be looking to pare gains  The downside looks limited for the moment with the trend line coming in likely as dynamic support 





Pound Sterling Holds Up Amid UK Political Drama

The currency pair was seen posting gains  rising to a two week high on Thursday  The lower price level of interest is seen at 1 2295  If support is established here  there is scope for further gains  However  given the current bullish momentum  we expect GBPUSD to continue rising higher  The next resistance level is seen in the 1 2428 1 2400 region 




Gold Drops on Upbeat US Data

The precious metal was seen falling over 2  on Thursday  This came following a string of better than expected economic reports from the U S  Mostly  the ISM non manufacturing PMI alongside ADP  NASDAQ ADP  payrolls and US factory orders helped to strengthen the USD on the day  Positive news from U S  China trade talks also helped investors  risk appetite to improve 
Further XAUUSD Declines Ruled Out as Support Holds for Now
The precious metal was seen extending the declines to the initial support area  The support level of 1508 was briefly tested but prices were rejected promptly  We expect to see a firmer retest of this level in the near term  There is also scope for price to post a modest rebound in the near term  However  a lower high is likely to be formed ",2019-09-06,ORBEX,https://www.investing.com/analysis/usd-strengthens-on-surprise-economic-reports-200462231,200462231

The ADP  NASDAQ ADP  index has no direct correlation with Nonnfarm Payrolls  Nevertheless  the ADP report is considered a harbinger of the official report of the U S  Department of Labor on the general state of the labor market in the country  An increase of 158 000 in the number of workers in the U S  private sector is expected  up from  164 000 in July   as well as an unemployment rate of 3 7   same as in July

182690,404206,ADP,GBP USD To Target  1 24 Post NFP ,opinion,"With the House of Lords expected to approve the anti hard Brexit bill today  rumours of a late October election swirling and NFP report pending cable traders have plenty to be watching on Friday 
Today at 13 30 BST the U S  nonfarm payroll figures will be released  Expectations are for 160 000 jobs to have been created in August  Given the rebound in the dollar in the previous session investors could be hoping for a slightly stronger figure today 
And they could be right  There are several data points which indicate that the number of jobs created in August will surprise to the upside 
1  ADP private payrolls surprised to the upside with the largest increase in private sector jobs in 4 months
2  Jobless claims remained low with no signs of rising layoffs
However  there has also been a slew of data which indicates that the NFP could actually disappoint   
1  Whilst U S  non manufacturing print impressed  the employment component of the report was a cause for concern  dropping to the lowest level in 2 years  Given the dominance of the service sector in the U S  economy  there is a strong correlation between the ISM non manufacturing employment component and the NFP  This is arguably a stronger lead indicator than the ADP  NASDAQ ADP  private payrolls print 
2  The manufacturing sector is experiencing a slump  This is being reflected in employment numbers for the sector which have fallen to a three year low  Whilst this sector accounts for a much smaller area off the economy than services  it adds to the weaker jobs picture 
3  Finally  the University of Michigan confidence indicator experienced the biggest 1 month drop since 2012  Erosion of consumer confidence due to the ongoing U S    Sino trade dispute is now well underway  which  whilst there is no trade war solution in sight  doesn t bode well for the U S  economy or the labour market 
A print below 150k could well be in the pipeline and will disappoint  A weak figure could stoke slowdown and recession fears in the U S  economy  boosting expectations of further intervention from the Fed  Under this scenario we expect the dollar to fall 
GBPUSD levels to watch 





After three days of Brexit inspired gains GBPUSD has been moving lower in early trade on Friday  A weak US NFP report could see the pair push through resistance at  1 2355 and target  1 24  A stronger than forecast NFP could send GBPUSD lower  testing resistance at  1 2245 prior to  1 2210 ",2019-09-06,Fiona Cincotta,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gbpusd-to-target-124-post-nfp-200462251,200462251

Chinese Manufacturing PMI  USD CNH  AUD  NZD and JPY pairs  Copper  China A50  Hang Seng
China s manufacturing sector has contracted two consecutive months  adding to the chorus of calls for a global slowdown  That said  the rate of contraction slowed in July  and if PMI is to climb back above 50  we d expect a bout of risk on for the session  AUD pairs are particularly sensitive to the data as they re key trade partners  but Chinese indices and copper also make decent markets to monitor around the data s release 

RBA Cash Rate Decision and Q3 GDP  AUD pairs  ASX200
At time of writing  the  expects just an 11  chance of a 25 cut on Tuesday  This moves to 74  for a cut in October and a 115  cut  ie fully priced in  for November  This is no major surprise  given they cut by 25 bps in June and July and their August minutes provided a  steady as she goes  approach  whilst emphasising external risks such as the trade war  Moreover  GDP data is out on Wednesday and they d likely want this data on hand before easing further  Yet this still could be a high volatility event if there is a notable shift in tone with their statement 
As for GDP  RBA expect growth to average around 2 5  this year  With Q1 GDP hitting 1 8   it s not off to a great start and  with ANZ expecting it to drop to 1 1  in Q2 and the consensus at 1 4   economists seem doubtful that RBA are on track to achieve their 2019 growth target  Expect AUD to remain under pressure and bring forward easing expectation should it hit 1 3  YoY or less 

BoC Rate Decision
It s unlikely BoC will change policy next week  given inflation remains around 2  has not  dipped  as expected  Moreover  the 1 month OIS suggests less than a 20  chance of a cut at their next meeting  Still  markets suspect the next direction will be a cut  with 6 month OIS pricing in around 74  chance and a 25bps cut being bullish priced in by April next year  So we ll keep a close eye on the statement to see if there is a dovish twist  although chances are it will reiterate their need to monitor the energy sector and the impact of  trade conflicts  whilst remaining optimistic over domestic growth

Markets remain firmly focused on the ECB s September 12th meeting and September 18th FOMC decision  but we can t overlook a plethora of rate decisions that will likely signal continued additional rate cuts are coming and stimulus is just around the corner   The RBA is expected to remain on hold for just one month  while the BOC and Riksbank are expected to deliver dovish messages that will see them join the global rate cutting club   The Russian Central Bank  CBR  is expected to cut rates by 25 basis points 
Geopolitical risks remain giant thorns to the global outlook and heavy attention will remain on Hong Kong s turmoil and the ongoing saga of Brexit   In Germany  Saxony and Brandenburg will hold regional elections   AFD seems to be gaining momentum and we could see Merkel s party continue to struggle  prompting concerns she will depart sooner

Markets
New US import tariffs on Chinese goods kick in on Sunday  September 1st   If we continue to see a conciliatory tone from both China and the US  we could see risk appetite improve and safe havens may soften  If we don t see US or Chinese officials agree on a face to face meeting date in DC  we could see risk aversion quickly return and drive US stock markets and dollar yen lower  Another key risk event for USD JPY is if we see the inversion between the 10 year and 2 year Treasury yields deepen  The longer we stay in inverted territory  the greater the calls will be for the US to see a recession next year 
Bitcoin
Bitcoin seems to be losing bullish momentum as concerns grow that tighter regulation is about to come from China as they prepare to launch their own cryptocurrency   Short term bullish bets seem to be coming off quickly as the psychological  10 000 level has been unable to hold up 
Oil 
Oil remains highly sensitive to trade war movements and its impact on the global economic   and demand   outlook  Risks remain to the upside for oil as Hurricane season heats up and US stockpiles are declining at a fast pace  easing some recession worries 
Gold 
Gold s bullish trade is extremely overcrowded as the prospects of fresh global stimulus grow  more countries are adopting negative interest rates  along with geopolitical risks from Brexit and Hong Kong  If we do see a major de escalation with the US China trade war  we could see an exaggerated selloff to squeeze out some weak bullish positions  From a macroeconomic standpoint  gold should out perform the other safe haven currencies once we see the Fed capitulate and commit to an easing cycle

Turkey 
Following the August 25th flash crash lira volatility could see wild moves as Turkish liquidity returns from a national holiday on Monday  Continued weakness from Germany  Turkey s largest export destination will continue to weigh on the economy  Turkish bond equity markets will be closed on Friday for a public holiday 
Brexit
Boris Johnson will suspend parliament  commencing between 9th and 12th September  tbc  until the Queen s speech on 14th October  The move leaves MPs that want to block no deal with little time to do so and increases the chance of no deal Brexit  The next week could therefore be action packed and full of surprises  Massive swings in the pound looks almost guaranteed  with there being particular vulnerability to the downside if government fails to block no deal or bring down the government 
Italy 
Five Star Movement has agreed to go into government with the Democratic Party  with Giussepe Conte returning as Prime Minister for a second term  One stumbling block to the alliance will be an online poll of Five Star members to back the coalition  The party has previously been hostile towards PD and so support may not be as straightforward as you d typically expect  Italian equities and yields have been very sensitive to political developments and obstacles still lie ahead  The euro has so far shrugged off the political instability both because of the limited impact beyond its borders 
Hong Kong
Pro democracy demonstrations are still ongoing  now approaching three months  and constantly shift from peaceful to violent at the drop of a hat  Hong Kong s airport authority now has an indefinite court injunction against protesters which prevents them from storming and strangling airport traffic  like happened a few weeks ago  Reports suggest Carrie Lam is considering invoking the Emergency Regulations Ordinance  last used in 1967  which would give her sweeping powers to quell the protests  This has drawn criticism from members of her own cabinet and legal experts  Saturday marks the fifth anniversary of Beijing handing down a restrictive electoral framework on Hong Kong  and the Civil Human Rights Front is planning mass marches  The Hang Seng has a chance to post its first up week since mid July  but this is currently only marginal  It could quickly reverse depending on weekend developments  USD HKD is constantly testing the upper limit of the trading band at 7 85 
The risk of protests turning violent increases the risk of a heavy handed response from China  Troops moving in from across the  border  would be negative for global risk and China HK shares  potentially fueling further capital outflows from the territory  Asia might be caught up in contagion risk  The next important date is October 1  China s National Day  with big parades planned in Beijing and President Xi Jinping in attendance  There is growing speculation that the HK  situation  will be  sorted  before then  so as not to detract from the nationalistic headlines

China s response to Trumps latest tariff hike has been quite measured  with levies raised on just  75b worth of US goods  They are still promoting the  calm face  of negotiation  though it is unsure if the planned September meetings will still go ahead  The next significant data point will be the NBS manufacturing and non manufacturing PMIs scheduled for release on Saturday August 31  Whilst only a marginal deterioration in the PMI is expected  it continues to build a picture of a weakening Chinese economy  No doubt Trump will tweet on weak data prompting greater volatility the following Monday  Meanwhile we face the risk rollercoaster from Trump and his actions and Tweets 
North Korea 
Latest intel reports suggest North Korea may be building a ballistic missile submarine and may be preparing for vessel based test launches  though analysts suggest this could be more than a year away  This would be a significant advancement in the nuclear missile threat and more difficult to counter  So far  the test missile launches have proved to be nothing special or threatening  though Japan has expressed concern that any new type of weapons system may be able to breach its missile defence system 
India 
Bilateral relations on the India Pakistan border at Kashmir are deteriorating with India revoking its special status awarded to the region via the Constitution  Pakistan meanwhile is said to be considering closing its airspace to Indian carriers and blocking India s land route to Afghanistan  The risk is further escalation to a war stance 
While not a global game changer at the moment  a war between the two neighbours could hit risk appetite in the region and force superpowers from both East and West to be dragged into the skirmish and forced to choose sides  That would be a huge negative for risk appetite 
Japan
One of the few positive notes is that the US and Japan appear to be edging closer to a mini FTA  with Trump and Abe announcing a tentative deal on Aug  25  with a goal of working out final details by the end of September  Things are not so rosy with South Korea  where trade relations are souring rapidly  which started a few weeks ago when Japan removed Korea from a trusted exporter list  More likely a skirmish that will be contained locally as China is the focus for the majority of Asia s export oriented economies 
Australia 
The RBA meeting on Tuesday could be another one on pause mode  with market pricing only assigning a 10  chance of a 25 bps cut from the current record low of 1   The last set of employment data was strong  with solid jobs growth and a stable unemployment rate at 5 2   There is a slight risk of a surprise cut  but more likely we could get a more dovish tone to the statement  Q2 GDP data on Wednesday could spring a positive surprise  with latest estimates suggesting a slight improvement to  0 5  q q from  0 4   A dovish statement or a surprise cut would pile additional pressure on an already weak Aussie dollar  It s fallen vs the US dollar for the past six weeks  Other G 7 Q2 data has been flat to negative  so positive growth could be a boon for AUD 
Sweden
The central bank has indicated its intention to raise interest rates from the current level of  0 25  later this year or early next  The central bank did emphasize the need for caution given the easing tendency of the Fed and ECB and weaker global economic developments  The market is no longer pricing in the next move to be a rate hike  but now see odds slowly growing for the Riksbank to join the rest of the world in providing stimulus 
Mexico 
The biggest risk in LatAm is the presidential address by AMLO in Mexico  His first year in power has been plagued by low growth and rising violence  but this type of events are more ceremonial and not likely to influence the markets  Yet  given he is known for going off script there is a small possibility that his comments influence the MXN  Mexico avoided a technical recession by having a growth rate of 0  instead of a contraction in the second quarter  The USDMXN is at yearly highs and continues to be pressured by EU China trade war and Argentina default risks and contagion    The US holiday on Monday will mitigate any reactions  but could be a gap when the market opens on Tuesday  although that is unlikely 
South Africa
Speculation is growing that South Africa will lose their last investment grade status  Moody s is expected to move up their review from November as government takes on too much debt from Eskom  The rand will likely trade on EM flows  which will mirror the overall direction of the dollar  A downgrade to junk however should see a major selloff with the rand

182705,404221,ADP,Jobs Data To Watch For,opinion,The first week of every month  even holiday shortened weeks like this one  come with new employment data from the previous month  This morning  we see new August private sector payroll totals from Automatic Data Processing   NASDAQ ADP    which provided good news for the U S  labor market  a headline number of 195K   53 000 more jobs than we saw in July  a downwardly revised 142K  As usual  Services outperformed Goods by a large margin  184K vs  11K  That said  the recently flagging Manufacturing sector brought 8 000 of those new jobs last month  which is the strongest we ve seen this summer Medium sized businesses  50 499 employees  created 77K new jobs last month  followed by 66K from small businesses and 52K from large firms  This shows better than expected growth in small firms especially  which had been struggling to keep up in recent months Education Healthcare led the way with 58K   this is a normal occurrence  but even this figure is higher than normal  Next was Leisure Hospitality with 42K and Trade Transportation at 39K  So even when we look under the hood  we see strength in monthly jobs totals  at least in the private sector Tomorrow morning brings the all inclusive U S  non farm payroll report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics  BLS   as well as a fresh Unemployment Rate  Expectations   recorded prior to this morning s ADP release   were for between 150 170K new jobs created in August and maintaining 3 7  unemployment  which is historically pretty low  Perhaps we ll see a bump up in analyst estimates today based on the ADP numbers  but this remains to be seen Weekly Jobless Claims Stay Within RangeInitial Jobless Claims for last week posted a 217K headline  up 1000 claims from the previous week s upwardly revised 216K  Yet this number stays cozily within the long term 200 225K weekly new claims numbers we ve seen  which is a clear representation of a continuing robust labor market Whether we start to see dings in the armor as the trade war moves forward  and possibly worsens  remains to be seen  but for now these headwinds do not appear in near term employment data  Continuing Claims took a step lower from the previous week to 1 662 million  after ebbing above 1 7 million temporarily a few weeks ago  Again  very solid strength in U S  employment Pre Markets Up BigFollowing a roughly 1  gain in major indexes during regular trading yesterday  these strong figures in the jobs market   in addition to relief coming from the U S  China trade tensions this week   are sending the Dow up 260 points at this part of the pre market  the Nasdaq up 95 and the S P 500 up 27 It would appear the markets are currently having their cake and eating it  too  robust jobs numbers with a pending interest rate cut next week  plus an unresolved trade war many market participants have chosen to turn optimistic about  Perhaps this will be the tonic for gains this month  after a rough time of it in August ,2019-09-04,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/jobs-data-to-watch-for-200461945,200461945
182707,404223,ADP,World Equities Rally  GBP Extends Gains,opinion,"Equities rally worldwide as US and China said to meet early October in Washington  Hong Kong announced the withdrawal of the extradition bill and British MPs rejected a snap election by next month 

The US markets closed Wednesday s session in the green  S P 500   1 07    Dow   1 04   and NASDAQ Composite   1 29   futures followed up on the US session gains 

The US 10 year yield jumped above the 1 50  mark  With only a slim chance of a trade deal  all investors ask is at least the continuation of the trade talks  It is uncertain whether Trump would attempt to cool down the trade war moving into the presidential election year  or he would continue fanning the flames and using it as a tool to exercise an increased pressure on the Federal Reserve  Fed  for lower interest rates  So far  he has shown no urge to seal a deal  and both the equity and bond markets were set on fire with dovish Fed speculations 
Nikkei and Topix rallied past 2  as Japanese yen weakened on improved risk appetite  ASX gained 0 80   Energy stocks rallied 1 61  in Sydney  as the barrel of WTI crude traded past the  56 level and Brent crude recovered above the  60 a barrel mark 
The FTSE 100 extended gains to 7334p on Wednesday  FTSE futures   0 63   hint at a positive start in London  energy and mining stocks should remain on the front foot amid an improved global risk appetite  Meanwhile  relatively cheap sterling remains mouth watering for Britain s blue chip investors 
DAX is set for a strong positive open as well 
Cable jumped 2 50  since September 3rd dip
In the currency markets  the pound extended recovery to 1 2260 against the US dollar  as British Parliament rejected Boris Johnson s proposal for an early election by next month  Less than the half of the MPs voted in favour of a snap election  while The latter is not true for the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank   It is certainly surprising for an opposition party to reject an early election  but the soft Brexiteers chose to discard the slightest risk of a no deal rush out of the European Union if Johnson successfully united hard Brexiteers under the same roof 
Investors trimmed their short positions in sterling  as the possibility of an imminent no deal Brexit and an early election were discarded within 24 hours  The latest developments don t mean that the UK will leave the European Union with a suitable deal  it only means that the Brexit deadline will be delayed by at least another three months  Yet the tiniest hope of a Brexit deal is enough to lift the sentiment across the pound markets  provided that the net speculative short positions in sterling hit the highest levels since the first quarter of 2017  Hence  there is potential for a further short squeeze in this market  but the recovery should remain limited given that an extended Brexit deadline means a stretched period of uncertainty and the UK s economic fundamentals are deteriorating  Released earlier this week  the August PMI numbers hinted at a slower economic activity in Britain  reviving fears that the country could print a second straight quarterly fall in GDP and enter a recession  But the inflation levels are such that the Bank of England  BoE  would not be able to lower the interest rates to give support to the economy without compromising the price stability  Unlike its major peers  the BoE is expected to stay pat in the September monetary policy meeting 
The latter is not true for the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank 
US jobs data in focus
The US dollar index fell 1  since the beginning of this week  following a meagre ISM report on manufacturing activity in August  Later today  the ADP  NASDAQ ADP  employment report should reveal how much private jobs the US added in August  Analysts expect 148 000 new private jobs last month  slightly lower than 156 000 printed a month earlier 

On Friday  the August nonfarm payrolls are expected at 160 000 versus 164 000 released last month  The US unemployment rate should remain steady at 3 7   a fifty year low  but the average hourly earnings growth may have slowed to 3 00  year on year from 3 2  a month earlier 
Swiss GDP to have slowed in Q2 on global trade tensions  strong franc
Elsewhere  the Chinese slowdown may have taken its toll on the Swiss economy combined with the franc s past 5  appreciation against the greenback  and nearly 6  appreciation versus the euro since April  The Swiss GDP growth is expected to have slowed to 0 2  in the second quarter versus 0 6  printed a month earlier  The year on year growth may have nearly halved  from 1 7  to 0 9  in Q2  Swiss economy is a victim of its currency s solid safe haven status  Even with a policy rate of  0 75   Swiss policymakers are unable to stop haven flows from pouring into the franc  Deeper negative interest rates in the Euro zone may increase the pressure for lower Swiss rates  but investors will unlikely renounce to their franc holdings in the absence of a concrete intervention 
The euro advanced past the 1 10 mark against the US dollar  after the incoming ECB president Christine Lagarde said she would review the debated negative rates  while emphasizing that she would keep them in place  Actual ECB head Mario Draghi is expected to lower the European rates by at least 10 basis points in September before kissing investors goodbye  The probability of a 20 basis point cut is being priced in above 60  in the Euro zone sovereign debt markets

182710,404226,ADP,Brexit Becomes A Dog s Breakfast As Dollar s Correction Continues,opinion,"Overview  The Dollar Index fell the most in three months yesterday and is experiencing mild follow through selling today  With hopes that Hong Kong has turned a corner  news that in person US China talks will resume next month  and a no deal Brexit is well on the way to being averted  investor risk appetites are robust today  Global equities are higher as are benchmark yields  while gold is being pushed back below  1550  Most Asia Pacific equities advanced  though India and Malaysia were exceptions and Hong Kong saw a bout of profit taking after yesterday s surge  In Europe  the Dow Jones Stoxx 600 is advancing for the third consecutive session and the fifth in six sessions to trade at one month highs  The S P 500 has been crisscrossed the 2820 2950 range several times in recent weeks and is poised to gap above the top today  Interest rates are backing up  and the 10 year yields are 3 5 bp higher  The dollar is edging lower against most major and emerging market currencies  Among the majors  the yen and the Swiss franc are experiencing minor losses  while among the emerging markets  the Turkish lira is off about 0 25   The lira may snap a three day  five percent advance as Prime Minister Erdogan weighs in again on the need for aggressive rate cuts to ambitious growth hopes 
Asia Pacific
The PBOC s dollar reference rate has been extremely stable in around CNY7 0850  and it is the market that blinked first  The dollar s broad pullback yesterday saw the model projections eased below CNY7 0940  The onshore and offshore yuan has also converged near 7 1460  Chinese officials have been slower to roll out additional stimulus than many observers have expected  We had thought there was a good chance of a cut in reserve requirements over the summer  Nevertheless  the State Council appears to be hinting of action soon  and a window of opportunity is seen before the October 1 national holiday 
With the latest round of tariffs and counter tariffs in the US China spat going into effect on the start of the month  securing face to face meetings proved difficult  This had contributed to the pessimism  However  now Chinese officials will come to the US next month  according to reports  Still  the prospects of a deal are remote  Trust between the two at a low ebb after two tariff truces were ended by the announcement of new action on Twitter  and China shows reluctance to change fundamental behaviors  Separately  the US trade figures show that China was the third largest buyer of US crude oil in June and July  buying 5 7 mln barrels and 7 1 mln barrels respectively   South Korea was the largest buyer  followed by Canada  China puts a 5  levy on US crude as of September 1 
Japan auctioned new 30 year bonds and saw healthy demand  bid cover 3 45x after 3 50x last month   Although 20  and 30 year bond yields fell to fresh three year lows  the yields are still positive  Japanese investors are eager for positive returns and stepped up their purchases of foreign bonds last week   JPY1 5 trillion   the most in a couple of months  For some investors who can hedge their Japanese bonds back into dollars  the shapes of the relative yield curves and cross currency swaps mean that the return can be greater than US Treasury yields 
With one exception  the dollar has been confined to a JPY105 to JPY107 range for a full month  The greater risk appetites are helping lift the dollar toward the upper end of the range  It traded to JPY106 75 in early Asia  It pulled back to about JPY106 35 and appears poised to retest the highs today  though JPY107 may be a formidable barrier still  The Australian dollar is pushing higher for the third consecutive session  its longest winning streak in nearly two months  It reached  0 6825  which is its strongest level since August 1  Note that the five day moving average is poised to move above the 20 day moving average for the first time since July 25  The  0 6830 area corresponds to a  38 2   retracement of the leg down that began in mid July  The next retracement target is near  0 6880 
Europe
UK Prime Minister Johnson suffered two defeats yesterday  First  the House of Commons again passed the motion to compel a request for a three month extension unless an agreement with the EU is approved by the middle of October  Although the motion was amended to include a reconsideration of Withdrawal Bill negotiated by May  no agreement is likely by the mid October  as the government has reportedly failed to make a single new proposal  It was betting that the EC would capitulate at the last moment  An attempt to filibuster in the House of Lords ended relatively quickly  Following its approval  the bill will return to the House of Commons tomorrow  Johnson  some thought  maneuvered to force an election  which he said he did not want  But  another gift of Cameron s  was to make it difficult for a Prime Minister to call a snap election  Johnson again gambled and misread his opposition  They successfully blocked his effort  There is some talk that he may try again next week to force an election 
In the strange  convoluted tactical battle  Corbyn appears to have become the first opposition leader to stand in the way of an election  An election is coming but just not on Johnson s terms  It is not clear if the 21 22 rebellious MPs really lost the whip  which would mean that could not stand as Tories in the election  The referendum that Cameron wagered would unite the party has torn country and party apart  Most importantly  the extension is not a done deal  Why is the UK seeking an extension  Will it simply prolong the uncertainty  Labour accepts the need for an election after the October 31 deadline is averted  meaning an election in November  which might be the condition for a final extension 
German factory orders disappointed  After a 2 5  increase in June orders  economists had expected a modest 1 4  decline  Instead  factory orders fell 2 7  offsetting the June increase that was revised to 2 7   The year over pace decline slumped to 5 6  from a 3 5  decline in June  Domestic orders fell by 0 5   while foreign orders were off 4 2  
Sweden s Riksbank surprised the market by not giving up its hawkish tilt  The unanimous decision maintained the bias toward exiting its negative interest rate policy but at a slower rate than envisioned previously  The central bank is signaling a rate hike either late this year or early next year  With the ECB poised to ease policy next week and the elevated trade tensions  many are skeptical that the Riksbank can deviate so much  Still  the krona is the strongest of the majors today following the surprise 
The euro is firm near yesterday s highs but is bumping against important resistance  The  1 1045 level that has been tested today corresponds to a  50   retracement of the leg lower from August 26  There are also two option expirations today that may also slow the upside progress  There is a nearly 530 mln euro option at  1 1035  and 1 6 bln euros are  1 1050  A move below  1 10 would likely be seen as a signal that a high is in place  Sterling is bid and extending yesterday s gains slightly  It appears poised to challenge last month s high set near  1 2310  There is an option for about GBP516 mln at  1 23 that expires today  Look for initial support near  1 2240 
America
The US reports a slew of data today  but it is unlikely to impact deeply held ideas that the Federal Reserve will deliver its second rate cut of the year in a couple of weeks  The most market sensitive report today is the ADP  NASDAQ ADP  estimate of private sector jobs growth  It comes ahead of the government employment report tomorrow and is expected to be consistent with a modest slowing of job growth  The ADP estimated job growth in July was 156k  and the government s initial estimate was 164k  The August service non manufacturing PMI ISM are expected to show some resiliency while manufacturing was soft  July durable goods is a revision  while factory orders may be boosted by transportation orders
The Canadian dollar posted its biggest advance since January after the Bank of Canada seemed to have issued a fairly neutral statement after it decided not to change policy  It is seeing some follow through buying today  However  it acknowledged that the economy is likely to weaken in H2 and underscored trade risks and related issues  leaving many still looking for a rate cut this year  The odds of a rate cut in October eased from around 60  to closer to 50   A move ahead of year end was tweaked to about 68  from 70   interpolating from the OIS market  Prior to the Bank of Canada meeting  the July trade figures were released  Exports fell by 0 9  while imports rose 1 2   resulting in a widening of the trade deficit  C 1 125 bln   This was about the average recorded in H1 19  The decline in exports is misleading  It was largely a reflection of the 7 7  drop in Canadian crude prices which cut oil exports by 6 7   On a volume basis  exports slipped 0 1   Exports to China fell by 15 5   This is not only a result of the slowing of the Chinese economy and the US Chinese trade tensions  but Canada has also been subject to China s wrath 
The US dollar traded below CAD1 32 for the first time August 13  which corresponds to a  50   retracement of the rally since mid July  The intraday technicals are stretched and suggest not chasing it  A US dollar bounce is likely to be limited to the CAD1 3230 area  There are  1 1 bln in expiring options struck between CAD1 3240 and CAD1 3250  The Mexican peso has done well as risk appetites return  The US dollar  which pushed through MXN20 20 last week  approached MXN19 64 today  The MXN19 60 area marks the  50   retracement of the greenback s gains since the end of July  Below there  the next target is in the MXN19 40 MXN19 45 area  The Dollar Index has spent the last several weeks alternating between gains and losses  Last week was an up week  and the pattern is being maintained by the heavier tone this week  It is approaching the  50   retracement of its gains from the August 23 low and the 20 day moving average  which converge near 98 20  It probably will take a break of 98 00 to temper the bullish sentiment ",2019-09-05,Marc Chandler,https://www.investing.com/analysis/brexit-becomes-a-dogs-breakfast-as-dollars-correction-continues-200461742,200461742

A quiet night in FX ahead of the key FOMC decision later today with only Aussie seeing some movement as CPI data in Australia printed hotter than forecast 
Australian CPI came in at 0 6  vs  0 5  although the trimmed mean came in right in line with expectations at 0 4   The news was good enough to pop the pair to  6899 but it stalled ahead of the big figure as the long term implications of the release are likely to be immaterial  Inflation remains well below the RBA 2  target and will not be a factor in any policy considerations the central banks makes as officials are far likely to be concerned about growth rather than price levels  To that end the Retail Sales figure at the end of the week may be of greater interest to the market as it will show the state of consumer demand at the current time 
Generally  the direction of majors is expected to be driven by the FOMC decision with markets anticipating a 25bp cut from the Fed  The conventional view is that the Fed will acquiesce to the markets but only to a limited extent  If the Fed  however  surprises with a 50bp cut the shock would be major and would drive the dollar lower across the board and could require a counter response from other G 7 central banks in order to keep the exchange rates competitive  A 50bp cut would not only be large in absolute terms but massive in relative terms given the low baseline rate of US yields 
If the Fed does play it safe with a 25bp cut  the next order of business will be the forward guidance by Fed Chair Powell  Here too  the Chairman main opt for obfuscation rather than clarity offering no commitments to future policy  Given the rapid turn around in posture over the past six months  the Fed is likely to be far more cautious in offering guidance to any further easing 
A 25bp cut and little forward guidance is sure to frustrate the markets and it will be interesting to see if the dollar will hold its gains in such a scenario  More importantly  the equity market may rebel at the lack of commitment to further easing and any selloff there could drag both USD JPY and USD CHF lower 
In short  despite intense focus FOMC could turn out to be a bust from a trading point of view if the markets see the little fresh direction from today s announcement and after the initial burst of action FX could return to the quiet volatility ranges of the past week ",2019-07-31,Boris Schlossberg,https://www.investing.com/analysis/aussie-pops-on-cpi-but-fomc-holds-key-200447815,200447815

The resumption of US China trade talks in Shanghai ended without a statement  Little progress was expected  and it appears little delivered  US President Trump s claimed that China  just doesn t come through  and that it may be waiting for after the 2020 US election  seemed to underscore America s frustration  Trump is complaining that China has not stepped up its purchases of US agriculture while Chinese officials seemed to have seen it as a quid pro quo for granting licenses to US companies to sell to Huawei 
China reported the July PMI  The manufacturing component edged up to 49 7 from 49 4  It was the third consecutive reading below the 50 boom bust level  The non manufacturing component slipped to 537 from 54 2  The composite nudged up to 53 1 from 53 0  The Caixin version  which focuses more on small and medium sized businesses  will be released tomorrow 
Australia s Q2 CPI firmed  Consumer inflation rose 0 6  quarter over quarter for a 1 6  year over year increase  It was slightly firmer than economists forecast and follows a flat Q1  and 1 3  year over year    Separately  Australia reported a little softer than expected private credit growth in June  3 3  vs  3 5    The net impact of the reports is to reduce the odds of a follow up rate cut after the back to back moves in June and July  There was never a good chance of an August move  but the odds of a September move have fallen back below 50   The odds of a move in October have narrowed but remains above 50

Growth slowed to 0 2  in the eurozone in Q2 from 0 4  in Q1  This was in line with forecasts  The preliminary July CPI eased to 1 1  from 1 3   This  too  had been anticipated  The surprise was that the core rate slipped more than expected  0 9  from 1 1    However  the impact on the market was minimal  The ECB is widely expected to provide more stimulus in September  and today s data will not change the dynamics or calculations 
UK Prime Minister Johnson is in Northern Ireland today  Tomorrow is the byelection in the Wales district of Brecon Radnorshire  The seat was held by a Tory  but now the Lib Dems are favored to win it  This will reduce Johnson s working majority to one MP  This may not mean much in August  but come September 3 when Parliament reconvenes  Johnson will likely face a confidence vote

Following up his large rate cut last week  Turkey s central bank governor cut this year s inflation forecast to 13 9  from 14 6  while keeping next year s forecast of 8 2  unchanged  This is seen allowing additional rate cuts  The lira is near four month highs today and is rising for the sixth consecutive session  We suspect the move is getting overdone  Next week  less favorable news is likely  The CPI  which stood at 15 72  in June  likely rose in July  The median forecast in the Bloomberg survey is for an increase to 16 93   Last July prices rose only 0 55   Economists forecast a 1 6  rise in the CPI this month

It is Fed day  and the market has settled with about 79  chance of a quarter point cut discounted and the remainder sees a 50 bp move likely  according to the CME s model  More than one journalist has posited a shift in the coefficient of variables in the Fed s decision making equation and see global variables  or specifically  the interest rates spread between the US and Europe   and claim a new era is at hand  Meh   One does not need to propose a new paradigm  International uncertainties were included in the cross currents that Chairman Powell and other Fed officials have cited  In his recent congressional testimony  Powell acknowledged that the relationship between unemployment and inflation had broken down and that this meant that monetary policy setting was tighter than may be appropriate  The case for easing is based primarily on domestic economic variables  
A majority of the FOMC argues that because inflation is below target  a low cost insurance policy to extend the recovery in the face of a number of uncertainties is appropriate  Some suspect that Greenspan and Yellen s recent endorsement of a rate cut was choreographed by the Fed  and it may have been  but for some strange reason  former NY Fed President Dudley did not get the call  He wrote an op ed piece for Bloomberg yesterday in which he sounded more skeptical of the need and suggested that the Fed could be  one and done  
It may sound cheeky to say this about the first Fed cut in a decade  but it may not be the biggest driver of the price action  It is largely assumed  as we noted  What may catch some unaware is that the Fed is also likely to stop its experiment in unwinding its balance sheet  It aimed to stop at the end of next month  but it would seem contradictory to continue to do so as the Fed reduces interest rates  We suspect that there will be at least one dissent favoring stand pat policy  Two dissents would get some notice  and three  unlikely  would be a blow  However  most important is how the market interprets the forward guidance  Given what seems to be the Fed s view  and what we suspect will be the broad evolution of the economy  another rate cut toward the end of the year may remain the most likely scenario  We expect Powell to leave the door open but revert back to data dependency to see if the risks are materializing or dissipating  
Before the FOMC announcement and Powell s press conference  the economic calendar is chock full  The highlight for the US is the ADP  NASDAQ ADP  job estimate   150k  that may influence expectations for Friday s national report  Outside of FOMC days  the non farm payroll report often sees the greater market reaction of the US data  The Employment Cost Index  0 7  Q2  the same as Q1  is more important for economists that market participants  The Chicago PMI  which often tracks the national ISM  is seen rebounding back above 50  Canada reports May GDP  and Mexico reports Q2 GDP  Growth in Canada may have ratcheted down to 0 1  in May from a 0 3  expansion in April  This will reduce the year over year pace to 1 3  from 1 5   Mexico is expected to report the second consecutive quarterly decline  It may be sufficient to push the year over year rate into contraction for the first time since 2009  Given Turkey s recent aggressive rate cut  Mexico has the dubious honor of having the highest real rates after war torn Ukraine

182725,404241,ADP,Automatic Data Processing  ADP  Q4 Earnings Surpass Estimates,opinion,"Automatic Data Processing  ADP  NASDAQ ADP   came out with quarterly earnings of  1 14 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 13 per share  This compares to earnings of  0 92 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 0 88   A quarter ago  it was expected that this payroll and human resources company would post earnings of  1 69 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 77  delivering a surprise of 4 73  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
ADP  which belongs to the Zacks Outsourcing industry  posted revenues of  3 50 billion for the quarter ended June 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 15   This compares to year ago revenues of  3 32 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
ADP shares have added about 25 8  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 20 2  
What s Next for ADP 
While ADP has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for ADP was unfavorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  1 32 on  3 50 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  6 02 on  15 10 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year 
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  Outsourcing is currently in the bottom 43  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2019-07-31,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/automatic-data-processing-adp-q4-earnings-surpass-estimates-200447912,200447912
182728,404244,ADP,Central Bank Fires Insurance Bullet,opinion,"Another month and another record high in the stock market  Why are stock prices climbing to new highs  One major contributing factor is the accommodative monetary policy implemented by our government s central bank  For the first time in 12 years since the last financial crisis began  2007   the Federal Reserve recently cut interest rates by  0 25  to a new target range of 2 00  to 2 25   see chart below  
At the end of this period  with economic activity having expanded and millions of new jobs created  the Federal Reserve realized they needed to begin creating some ammunition to protect the economy for the next  eventual recession  even if the timing of the next recession remained unknown   A gun needs bullets  therefore beginning in late 2015  former Federal Reserve Chair  Janet Yellen  began manufacturing economic bullets with the first of nine interest rate hikes in December 2015 
If you fast forward to today  the economy objectively remains fairly strong and there are no clear signs of an impending recession  Current Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell made it clear that he has decided to fire one of those stimulative bullets yesterday as a precautionary insurance measure against a potential U S  recessionary slowdown  click here to read the rationale behind the Fed s rate cut   Fed officials also added to investor enthusiasm when they declared they would end the runoff of their  3 8 trillion asset portfolio  i e    halt quantitative tightening   two months earlier than previously planned 
Thanks in part to Powell s protective rate cut measure and halt to quantitative tightening  the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at a new all time monthly high of 26 864  up  1 0  for the month  Records were also set by the S P 500 index  which increased by  1 3  and the technology heavy Nasdaq market achieved a monthly advance of  2 1  
Despite global slowdown fears and evidence of flattening corporate profits  the 2019 year to date stock returns realized thus far have been quite impressive 
Dow Jones Industrial Average YTD    15 2 S P 500 YTD    18 9 Nasdaq YTD    23 2 




In addition to the recent interest rate cut  investors have appreciated other positive fundamental factors enduring in the economy  For example  the job market remains incredibly strong and resilient with the current unemployment rate of 3 7  hovering near 50 year record lows   This week s recently released data from payroll processor ADP  NASDAQ ADP  payroll also showed a healthy addition of 156 000 new private sector jobs 
Another confirming source of data highlighting the strength of our economy has been Consumer Confidence  see chart below   Consumer activity accounts for roughly 70  of our country s economy  therefore with confidence approaching 20 year highs  most investors can confidently sleep at night knowing we are likely not at the edge of a steep recession 




Rainbows and Unicorns
Although the economy appears to be on firm footing  and the Fed has been accommodative with its monetary policy  not everything is rainbows and unicorns  In fact  recently released data from a Chicago based manufacturing purchasing manager s survey showed a reading of 44 4  a level indicating a contraction in economic activity  the lowest level seen since December 2015  
The ongoing U S    China trade spat has also contributed to slowing global activity  even here in our country  U S  trade representatives  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and top trade negotiator Robert E  Lighthizer  once again recently returned empty handed from China after another round of discussions  But there have been some positive developments  In return for tariff reductions  China has shown indications it s willing to purchase large amounts of U S  agricultural products  e g   soybeans and other products  and seriously address concerns about the protection of U S  intellectual property  Discussions are expected to resume on our soil in early September 
Despite all investors  concerns and fears  the U S  stock market has continued to climb to new record territories  Economic data may continue to unfold in a  mixed  fashion in coming weeks and months  but investors may gain some comfort knowing that Fed Chair Jerome Powell has a gun with protective interest rate cut bullets that can be fired at potential recessionary threats attacking our economy ",2019-08-02,Wade Slome,https://www.investing.com/analysis/central-bank-fires-insurance-bullet-200449761,200449761
182731,404247,ADP,NFP Expected To Rise At A Slower Pace In July,opinion,"The much awaited monthly payrolls data will be coming out today  Forecasts point to payrolls rising at a slower pace this month  Economists polled expect that nonfarm payrolls will rise 160k in July 

This marks a slower pace of increase comparing to June s headline print of 224k 

The US unemployment rate is however likely to fall to 3 6   after rising to 3 7  in June 

The average earnings continue to remain stagnant  with estimates showing a 0 2  increase on the month in July 
For the past few months  average earnings have remained well anchored near the 3  yearly increase 
With inflation already tame  wages will continue to outstrip consumer prices  This will put more spending money in the hands of households 




US Nonfarm payrolls
Today s payrolls report comes on the backdrop of a number of other big ticket items  Earlier this week  the Federal Reserve lowered the fed funds rate by a quarter basis point 
The central bank remains in a wait and watch mode  Besides inflation  the unemployment rate will also be another key factor for the Fed to watch out for 
Unemployment over the past few months has been somewhat shaky  compared to the strong stretch witnessed previously  This falls in line with the general view that the US economy is indeed slowing 
ISM s Manufacturing PMI Sinks Further
Meanwhile  the ISM s manufacturing PMI data showed the manufacturing activity for July fell to 51 2  This was the weakest pace of growth in nearly three years  The index is still above the 50 level which indicates growth in the manufacturing sector 
Amid the current backdrop  the question remains on whether there will be much impact from today s payrolls report  While the estimates for July are lower  there is also the prospect of a downward revision to June s data 
The ISM s data showed that the employment index registered a reading of 51 7  which down by 2 8 points from June s 54 5  The data suggested that while employment growth was rising  the pace was much slower 
This potentially indicates that the payrolls report will be somewhat in line with the estimates if now lower comparing to the numbers from the month before 
On Wednesday  the ADP  NASDAQ ADP  payrolls data showed that hiring in the private sector rose 156k in July  This was slightly above the consensus estimates of 150k  The data for July showed that the labor market was still strong 
However  there were inherent weaknesses in the economy that was hitting the growth in the labor market sector 
Will the Payrolls Report Have any Impact on the Fed 
With the Fed staying less dovish than expected  today s payrolls report could potentially change that view  Unless there is a strong negative deviation from the estimates  the report could simply be brushed aside 
To the upside  even if there is a strong positive deviation  we do not expect to see this impacting the monetary policy  The Fed is likely to simply wait to assess more data 
But it is unlikely that the payrolls will be strong enough for the Fed to hold back from further rate cuts  Today s payrolls report will be one of the many ahead of the September Fed meeting  This is when the rate setting committee will take further action on monetary policy if required 

Given the fact that the central bank has responded to slowing growth indicators  the data would simply justify the rate cut at some point in the future 
The trend in payrolls has been somewhat weaker over the past months  This coincides with the late business cycle  Although the risks of a recession is still a possibility  the Fed s move to lower rates could help push the downside risks further down along the road 
The central bank is also quite likely to remain on the sidelines and wait for more incoming data before deciding on the next course of action ",2019-08-02,ORBEX,https://www.investing.com/analysis/nfp-expected-to-rise-at-a-slower-pace-in-july-200449795,200449795

In the face of so much economic pessimism  it is noteworthy that household spending in Japan continues to fare better than economists expected  It rose 4  year over year in May It is the strongest in four years and was more than twice the increase economists forecast  It is the sixth consecutive year over year increase  which is the longest streak in seven years  Some observers concluding that consumption is strong enough to withstand the sales tax increase in October  However  maybe the glass is half empty rather than half full  and the strength of consumption now is bringing forward activity to beat the tax 
The US trade delegation is headed to China next week  but expectations for a breakthrough are low  Although talks have resumed the positions of the two countries has not changed  The press reports that China wants to know how Huawei will be treated before making new extensive soy purchases  and it continues to demand that all US tariffs must be removed to reach a deal  something the US will be loath to concede 
The dollar finished last week near JPY107 75  It is now straddling the JPY108 area  where a nearly  1 bln option is set to expire today and where the 20 day moving average is found  There is also an option for  1 8 bln at JPY107 75 that will also be cut today and an option for about  965 mln at JPY108 50 that expires  The Australian dollar reached a new three month high yesterday just shy of  0 7050 and is little changed today  holding above  0 7015  There is an A 530 mln option at  0 7000 that rolls off today  The 20 day moving average is around  0 6950 and a close below that ahead of the weekend would likely signal a top is in place  The dollar edged slightly higher against the Chinese yuan earlier today to close about 0 15  higher on the week  ending a two week slippage 
Europe
ECB President Draghi s recent comments acknowledged that more stimulus will be required 
The markets are anticipating a 10 bp rate cut before Draghi s term ends on October 31  the same day  incidentally  that the UK is to leave the EU  and possibly a 20 bp cut before the end of the year  The nomination of Lagarde is seen as a continuation of the path that Draghi has led the ECB  well beyond former French national Trichet that was the president of the ECB before Draghi  The net impact has been to drive interest rates lower  Consider that the 10 year German Bund yields fell below the  40 bp deposit rate  The knock on effect is well beyond EMU bonds  though Italy s two year yield is straddling zero  Dovish comments by BOE Governor Carney and poor PMI data helped push the 10 year UK Gilt yield is below the UK base rate for the first time since the Great Financial Crisis  Disappointing ADP  NASDAQ ADP  jobs estimate and a disappointing service PMI saw the US 30 year yield is below the top of the fed funds target range 
Although some have been critical of the course of the ECB  the alternative is not clear  Consider today s German factory orders report  Economists surveyed by Bloomberg forecast  median  that orders fell 0 2   Instead  they slumped 2 2   and the 8 6  year over year slide was the most since October 2009  The internals seemed to confirm that PMI reports showing that the domestic economy is actually doing better  Domestic factory orders rose by 0 7   The lasting challenge is with foreign orders  They slumped 4 3   The drop in foreign orders has two components  Eurozone orders fell 1 7    while non European orders crashed 5 7   Although Spain reported that May s industrial output rose 0 3  rather than slump 0 5  as the median economist in the Bloomberg survey forecast  the conclusion by at least one central bank governor  Rehn from Finland  that the slowdown in the eurozone can no longer be thought of as temporary 
The euro has been unable to resurface above  1 13 since the middle of the week and is edging toward  1 1250 where a 625 mln euro option is struck that will be cut today  There is a set of options between  1 1295 and  1 13 for 1 5 bln euros that also expire today  A trendline off the late May and mid June lows comes in near  1 1245 today  and a break warns of a test on  1 12 if not lower  For its part  sterling has been unable to resurface above  1 26 and has been sold to a new three week low near  1 2550 and little stands in the way of a test of June s five month low a little ahead of  1 25  Below there is the flash crash low from January 3 near  1 2440 
America
US jobs growth has slowed  and the real question is the magnitude  and there is a sense that last month s 75k increase overstates the case  Nevertheless  consider that this year s average through May stands is a little less than 165k  while in the first five months of last year  non farm payrolls rose by an average of 230k a month  Nevertheless  the lower average  coupled with a dip in the participation rate  has been sufficient to keep the unemployment rate at its lowest in a generation and average earnings growth near cyclical highs  Indeed  hourly earnings are expected to have increased in June by 0 3   which would lift the year over year rate to 3 2  from 3 1  in May  That said  another weak report  say below 100k  would likely fan expectations for a 50 bp cut later this month  According to the CME s calculations  there is slightly more than a 1 in 4 chance of a 50 bp move already discounted by the fed funds futures market 
Canada also reports June employment today  Its jobs growth has accelerated this year  Consider that in the first five months of 2018  Canada lost about 1 5k jobs on average a month  This year  the average stands near 50k  And for the record  that includes about 38 5k new full time positions a month  on average  For the sake of simplicity and brevity  assume Canada is a tenth of the size of the US  That would make Canada s jobs growth this year roughly equivalent of the US creating half a million new jobs a month  That said  jobs growth is expected to have slowed to around 10k in June  Average hourly pay for permanent workers is likely to recover from the weakness seen in Q4 18 and January 2019  It peaked near 4  last May and fell to less than 1 5  in Q4 18  The median forecast is for a 2 7  pace in June  which would be the highest since last July 
Seemingly contrary to expectations of some reporters and analysts  Trump s tweets on Wednesday  accusing Europe and China of a  big manipulation game  in the currency market failed to elicit a response  Trump seemed to go a bit further this time  as past verbal jousting has also received little reaction by investors or retaliatory  He said the US could match their actions or  be dummies who sit back   Of course  Trump s assessment is contrary to his own Treasury Department s conclusions and nearly every reasonable economist  with the possible exception of those that work for him 
During the period when the Fed was buying long term assets  it defended itself and was protected against accusations of currency manipulation  The use of monetary policy to pursue domestic goals must be acceptable  The distinction between currency and interest rate manipulation is not appreciated by market purists  but it is critical  Currency manipulation is a zero sum game  which may be why Trump seems to be instinctively drawn to it  interest rate manipulation is not  The former takes others  aggregate demand  The latter spurs demand  Like firing Mueller or demoting Powell  Trump s verbal aggressiveness is not a prelude to action  That said  it is within the president s authority to order intervention  but until he does  it may be best to assume he won t  Also  the risk of escalation increases if other officials respond  Don t be provoked  and there is no provocation

The market s appetite for US dollars is important  because outside of a Bank of Canada monetary policy announcement  there s very little market moving data on the calendar this week  The focus will remain on the greenback  As far as we can tell  sentiment has shifted to the upside  All of the dollar s gains happened Friday as the New Zealand dollar and British pound were hit the hardest  NZD has been the most sensitive to market swings  while GBP was hit from all sides by softer data  The Canadian dollar was the most resilient  even though the latest jobs report fell short of expectations  Looking ahead  the USD could retain as long as the inflation numbers are decent

US dollar pops on nonfarm payrolls
All of the US dollar s gains occurred after nonfarm payrolls  A total of 224 000 jobs were created in June   significantly better than the 160 000 forecast  Frankly  we re surprised by the sustainability and magnitude of the dollar s move because the rest of the labour market report was underwhelming  Last month s weak 75 000 print was revised lower and not higher  the unemployment rate increased  and  most importantly  wage growth held steady at 0 2  instead of rising to 0 3  like economists anticipated  The broad based rally in the dollar  however  tells us that many concerns were eased by the June jobs report 
The US dollar could extend its gains this week  but we can t see how one month of stronger job growth accompanied by no improvement in wage growth can be a game changer for the Fed  Yes  it reduces the need for an immediate interest rate cut  but it doesn t eliminate it  Nearly half of the members of the FOMC feel that easing is necessary this year  and they won t be swayed by a mixed jobs report  This week s FOMC minutes should remind us of the extent of the central bank s dovishness  Their concerns centre around trade and inflation  While the US and China agreed to restart trade talks at G20  only time will tell whether the progress is real  Inflation will take a lot longer to improve  and investors will get a better sense of the extent of the problem with the release of consumer and producer prices this week  If price pressures ease  the expectations for a rate cut will intensify  What the jobs report does imply  though  is that Fed could opt for a one and done insurance cut  with no signal of additional easing  As this would be less dovish than other central banks  it d be positive for the dollar  But we won t know which way they ll lean until the FOMC meeting

How low will RBA go 
Last week was a challenging one for the commodity currencies  The Australian  New Zealand and Canadian dollars  traded higher before US nonfarm payrolls  only to give up all of their gains on one data release  This goes to show how much the market s appetite for US dollars can impact other currencies  The Reserve Bank of Australia lowered interest rates for the second time this year to a record low of 1   Normally  interest rate cuts are negative for a currency  particularly if it s accompanied by plans to ease further  But in the case of the Australian dollar  the market had already priced in last week s move along with another quarter point cut in August  So  the initial knee jerk decline was short lived 
Investors are just beginning to realise how the RBA s monetary policy bias differs from other countries  The RBA is one of the most dovish central banks  After cutting interest rates twice this year  they made it clear that they re open to easing again  According to RBA Governor Philip Lowe  the risks to the global economy are tilted to the downside and  given the circumstances   the board is prepared to adjust interest rates again  if needed  to get us closer to full employment and achieve the inflation target   Data has been mixed with manufacturing and service sector activity slowing  but the trade surplus improving  Retail sales increased but less than anticipated  With interest rates already at a record low of 1   we don t see the RBA taking rates much lower than 0 75   Even with their dovish guidance  the RBA acknowledged improvements in house prices  infrastructure spending and resources investment  The central bank also wants monetary stimulus to be accompanied by fiscal changes  Does this mean AUD USD has bottomed  Certainly not  because there could still be another rate cut this year  Until the RBA shifts to neutral  there s scope for a renewed decline in the Australian dollar 
Over the past few months  the New Zealand dollar has been the most volatile high beta currency  When risk appetite was improving and the market turned against the US dollar  it enjoyed the strongest gains  But when appetite for the greenback returned  it was hit the hardest  Despite the lack of economic data  the New Zealand dollar fell sharply last week  Manufacturing PMI numbers are scheduled for release this week  With the greenback regaining its rise  we could see a deeper correction in NZD USD 
Meanwhile  Friday s US and Canadian jobs report marked a turning point for the Canadian dollar  After falling for eight out of nine trading days  USD CAD rebounded as the market learned that in June  more than 2 000 jobs were lost in Canada compared to a forecasted growth of 10 000  Despite the currency s slide  the data wasn t exceptionally weak because full time jobs increased and wage growth accelerated  The Bank of Canada meets this week  and  as the last man standing  everyone s wondering if their central bank will finally turn dovish  When they met in May  the BoC put on a brave face and described their recent slowdown as temporary  Since then  we ve seen the first signs of weakness in Canada s economy  But it s too early to tell whether this is a slowdown or normalisation  Retail sales barely grew in April  but that was after very strong spending in March  Jobs were lost in June  but May was a record breaking month for the labour market and wages growth accelerated  As these are tentative signs of slowing  we think the Bank of Canada may want more evidence before turning dovish  So  if they maintain their positive outlook and say the recent data misses are temporary  USD CAD will resume its slide towards fresh 1 5 year lows  However  if the tone of their monetary policy statement is more cautious  we could see the beginnings of a longer term bottom in USD CAD

ECB won t cut in July  but summer easing is on the table
One of the biggest stories last week was the report that European policymakers are in no rush to lower interest rates  EUR USD shot higher immediately after the comments hit the wires  But the rally fizzled as back to back data misses harden the case for easing  German retail sales and EZ producer prices fell for the third month in a row  while weaker manufacturing activity offset stronger services  The problem for the euro is that while the European Central Bank may not be considering an immediate rate cut  more accommodation is in the euro s future  As a result  the single currency broke to the downside  opening the door for move below 1 11 
The European Union also nominated International Monetary Fund Director Christine Lagarde as Mario Draghi s replacement  As the former finance minister of France and current head of the IMF  she has experience with lending and financial crises but not in the role of a central banker  The fact that she s a politician and not an economist raised immediate concerns  but she s respected by her peers and brings much needed political savviness to the central bank at a challenging time for the region  The initially negative reaction in the euro  as minor as it may be  suggests that investors would have preferred a current member of the governing council  like Bundesbank head Jens Weidmann or Bank of France Governor Fran ois Villeroy de Galhau because they have a more intimate understanding of the current issues facing the central bank  But at the end of the day  she s a solid choice  widely respected by her peers  and has strong credibility  Looking ahead  there are no major eurozone economic reports scheduled for release  So  the euro should continue to the weaker outlook for the EZ versus the US weighs on the currency

Sterling buckles under pressure of Brexit
Last but not least  sterling continues to underperform other major currencies as the fear of a no deal Brexit or prolonged uncertainty weighs on the economy  Service  manufacturing and construction sector activity slowed significantly in June  with the manufacturing and construction sectors contracting while service sector activity stagnating  The leading Tory candidates are pushing for a no deal Brexit  which is the nightmare scenario for the central bank and a serious concern for UK businesses  Last week  Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said he s worried about the uncertainty surrounding Brexit and rising threats of protectionism  With three months to go before the UK is scheduled to leave the European Union  the possibility of a no deal Brexit is growing by the day  There won t be any real clarity until the next Tory leader is selected  But if data continues to worsen  the BoE may have to consider easing  Carney has already indicated that stimulus is likely if the EU and UK can t agree to the terms for leaving the Union  But based on sterling s recent performance  investors are betting that the central bank may have to act regardless of whether the Withdrawal Agreement is accepted  especially if the exit date is extended beyond October  Industrial production and the trade balance will be released this week  Given the softness of PMI  weaker numbers could give investors a reason to drive the currency even slower ",2019-07-09,Kathy Lien,https://www.investing.com/analysis/fx-outlook-why-the-us-dollar-keeps-rising-200438109,200438109

The relentless push lower in the U S  yields weighed on USD JPY in Asian and early European trade today sending the pair to a test of the 107 50 level  but it stabilized ahead of the New York open along with rates markets as focused turned to U S  data 
With U S  economic calendar broken up by July 4th holiday tomorrow  the market will be all eyes on the ADP and ISM Services due later today  Although Friday s NFPs will be the marquee event of the week  today s releases will give a good glimpse at the state of labor demand and services activity in the U S 
Credit markets have been very bearish in their assessment of U S  growth with the 10Y yield slipping below the psychologically important 2  level yesterday to hit a low of 1 94  today  Therefore  the conditions are ripe for a short squeeze in rates if U S  data proves to be relatively resilient  The markets are looking for a rebound to 140K in ADP from 27K previous which could temper the dramatic rate cut expectations currently priced in 
On the other hand  the second month of sub par job creation would only reinforce the shorts position that the US economy is headed for a serious slowdown and could send USD JPY back to 107 00 by day s end 
Still  market sentiment is very heavily skewed to the risk off side at the moment  so any relief on the data front could send short scurrying ahead of the holiday ",2019-07-03,Boris Schlossberg,https://www.investing.com/analysis/us-data-takes-center-stage-200436688,200436688
182768,404284,ADP,Long Weekend Plans Derailed By NFP And Wage Data,opinion,"Americans love Thursday holidays in the summer as much of the country will stretch that into a four day weekend  but that might not be the case for many hedge funds and money managers  Friday s economic data releases could be a game changer for financial models and could derail weekend plans for many 
A lot of U S  economic data is wavering  as most key indicators are falling below trend  but the recent standouts have been labor and wage data  If the pillars of the economy begin to show some signs of weakness  this will disrupt the U S  consumer and support calls for the Fed to cut in July and signal an additional one is on the way 
Today s data is highlighting the growing of downside risks to the economy  If labor weakens and wages start to fall  markets will ramp up bets the Fed will need more aggressive accommodations to deliver a soft landing 
ADP  NASDAQ ADP  recently has shown a negative June bias and most economists are still pricing in gain for the headline nonfarm payroll print between 150 000 and 205 000 jobs created in June  Jobless claims however have not yet really picked up  suggesting the economy is not completely falling off a cliff and that the other soft labor data points are showing only a slowdown 
The final U S  services PMI reading for June was revised higher  bucking the trend we have seen with manufacturing readings  but still hovering not too far from contraction territory 
If the U S  consumer remains strong  there is no reason why we should not still see economic growth around 2 5  this year 
If NFP comes in as expected around 162 000 jobs  markets should still expect the Fed to deliver a 25 basis point cut at the end of the month  A surprise beat over 225 000 jobs  might see the odds of the July cut ease a bit to 80  
Oil
The oil market was looking for a much bigger draw  but Wednesday s EIA report only showed stockpiles fell 1 09 million barrels  much less than analysts  consensus of 2 8 million barrels and the prior drop of 12 8 million barrels  The U S  oil market remains oversupplied  but today s report shows that U S  oil demand still remains strong  The U S  will eventually become a constant net exporter of oil  but today s report showed they had a net import of 2 million barrels last week 
Crude is still processing the OPEC   meeting  which delivered a nine month extension on production cuts  highlighting that the oil producing countries are concerned about the slowdown with oil demand for the remainder of the year 
Oil prices should be rangebound for the remainder of the summer as OPEC s effort will do little to ignite a bullish momentum as demand is expected to slow to the slowest pace since 2011  The EIA report was overall bearish  but following the plummet earlier in the week  West Texas Intermediate crude seems to have found some support around the  56 00 barrel level  Brent crude s support falls at the  62 00 a barrel level 

Gold
Gold prices remain firmly supported on dovish bets that the world s largest banks will continue to deliver more stimulus in the coming months  with the Fed joining the easing party at the end of the month  Bullion bulls are not being derailed by the fresh record highs U S  markets are posting 
Wednesday s gold rally was spurred on by expectations that uber dove Christine Lagarde will replace ECB Chief Draghi in November and that President Trump could see one of his dovish nominations  Christopher Waller  get approved early next year  Trump has seen his past four nominees fail to fill the remaining two seats on the board of governors  Waller  director of research at the St  Louis Fed  also Trump s informal adviser has been vocal that the central bank needs to lower rates  Judy Shelton is unlikely to get approved as she is a controversial nominee that has spent much of her time away from mainstream economics 

Bitcoin
Bitcoin s price is being supported by both retail and institutional growing interest  Volatile price swings should not be derailed by the long holiday weekend  If we see the high frequency trading systems and algos take advantage of some thin conditions  we should see  10 000 level provide key support  If Bitcoin can stabilize into early next week  we could see bullish momentum attempt to test the  14 000 resistance level

182769,404285,ADP,Dow At Record High  U S  Yields Drop More,opinion,"Asian equities traded mostly in the green  after the Dow Jones   0 67   hit a record high in New York  The S P 500   0 77   and Nasdaq s Composite   0 75   closed on a positive note before the July 4 break  Chinese stocks continued feeling the pinch of the tensions in Hong Kong 
The US dollar weakened against all its G10 counterparts and the 10 year treasury yield slipped below the 2 95  mark after the ADP  NASDAQ ADP  report showed that the US economy added 102K private jobs in June  less than 140K expected by analysts  The weak ADP figure whispers that Friday s nonfarm payrolls could also disappoint and keep the Federal Reserve  Fed  doves in charge of the market 
Meanwhile  the US trade deficit rose to  55 5 billion in May versus  54 billion penciled in  and the previous month s figure was revised up to  51 2 billion from  50 8 billion  Yet the worst in all this is that the US  deficit versus China jumped to  30 1 billion from  26 9 billion despite White House s efforts to restore a  fairer  trade relationship between the two countries  The devaluation in yuan has certainly played a role in favour of China  And the latest trade figures will probably not help releasing the US  anger as the trade talks resume 
The US and Chinese officials will be talking on the phone next week  according to the latest news  but the chances for a significant progress are low  Hence  the trade war story should continue being one of the major talking points in the second half of the year 
But today  the US markets will take a break to celebrate the Independence Day and to watch the fireworks 
Stock investors benefit from cheap pound
In the UK  the composite PMI unexpectedly slipped below 50 in June  pointing at a contraction for the first time since the Brexit referendum  Cable eased to 1 2557 as soft data strengthened the case for a more accommodative monetary policy from the Bank of England  BoE  in the coming quarters  The UK economy will certainly need BoE s help to survive a possibly messy divorce with the EU  on top of the negative repercussions of the US China tensions  As such  the BoE doves continue gaining field  Though it is too early to call for a rate cut in the foreseeable future  the probability of a 25 basis point action before the end of this year doubled to 45  since the beginning of this week 
British stocks advanced on cheaper pound  The FTSE 100 rose to 7621p  the highest since August 2018  Energy stocks   0 95   lagged  as Brent crude eased to  62 a barrel 
The FTSE is expected to open flat  Investors will likely chase dip buying opportunities in downside corrections  as the soft British pound and the prospects of a cheaper liquidity remain mouth watering in the actual context of the global equities rally 
Euro under pressure of all time low yields
The euro remains under the pressure of historically low sovereign bond yields  The 10 year Bund yield approaches the European Central Bank s  ECB  deposit rate of  0 40   as the expectation of a 10 basis point cut in September are gradually factored in the bond prices 
Still  with the rush into the US treasuries  the US   EZ yield spread fell to the narrowest since April 2018  This is because the Fed  which has been normalizing the interest rates since 2015  has a greater maneuver margin on the dovish side compared to the ECB 
Henceforward  the euro should find some support against the US dollar  Buyers could come to rescue near the 100 day moving average  1 1260  
Due today  the Euro area retail sales may have improved 0 3  m o m in May  versus  0 4  printed a month earlier  Encouraging data could give a hand to euro buyers before the US comes back in focus with Friday s payroll report 
Swiss prices may have deflated in June
Swiss consumer prices may have eased 0 1  m o m in June  as the franc rose to a two year high against the euro 
Although  the escalating tensions between the EU and Switzerland over the Swiss equities  trading ban cooled off the franc appetite  the euro swissy trades a touch above the 1 10 mark  far below the Swiss National Bank s  SNB  ideal 1 20 handle 
Pricing on the three month euro swiss franc futures  on the other hand  suggests that the market is convinced that a further SNB policy action could be needed  especially if the European Central Bank attempts to lower its rates by the end of this year

182779,404295,ADP,Traders Eye NFP And Canada Jobs Report,opinion,"The US markets are reopening after being closed on Thursday for Independence Day  Investors will be eyeing the payrolls report due later today  The US economy is forecast to add 162k jobs in June 
Besides the US payrolls report  Canada will also be releasing its monthly employment data  Canada s unemployment rate is expected to rise slightly from 5 4  previously to 5 5  in June  Elsewhere  the economic data remains sparse 
Euro Muted After Retail Sales
The euro traded flat on Thursday  Economic data from the eurozone saw the release of the monthly retail sales report  The report showed that sales in the eurozone fell 0 3  in June  This was below the forecasts of a 0 4  increase and down from June s revised print of a 0 1  decline 
EUR USD Edges Closer to 1 1250
Price action in the currency pair has been somewhat flat over the past few days after the initial decline earlier  This has kept the currency pair trading within the range of the 1 1400 and 1 1250 levels  The current declines could potentially push the EURUSD lower to test the 1 1250 level of support  However  in case of a reversal  we could expect to see the 1 1400 resistance level being tested once again 

Crude Oil Slips on Fears of Slowing Demand
WTI Crude oil prices posted declines early on Friday  The declines came on investor concerns about slowing demand  The futures markets saw crude oil falling 1 1  while Brent futures were down 0 1   extending declines from the day before  The declines come after OPEC and Russia agreed to extend the current production cuts for the next six to nine months 
WTI Crude Oil Forms a Bearish Flag
Following the recent declines off the highs near the 60 00 handle  oil prices have been consolidating sideways  This has led to a bearish flag pattern being formed just below the resistance area of 57 50  A breakdown below the previous lows of 56 25 could confirm the downside bias  This will validate the bearish flag pattern which puts the downside target to 54 42 where support level exists 

Gold Prices Hold Steady Near Highs
The precious metal was traded a bit volatile near the highs on Thursday  Price action was rather muted as gold traders await the payrolls report due later today  A weaker payrolls report could potentially cement expectations of a July rate cut  This comes following the ADP  NASDAQ ADP  private payrolls once again falling short of expectations  The pace of hiring was also somewhat slower compared to the previous months 
Will Gold Breakout Higher 
Given the current set up  gold prices are likely to see a breakout in either direction  To the upside  price will need to breach past the recent highs of 1431 in order to confirm the upside bias  There is a cup and handle type of pattern forming near the current highs that validates this view  To the downside  if the 1404 level of support gives way  then gold could extend declines to1354 ",2019-07-05,ORBEX,https://www.investing.com/analysis/traders-eye-nfp--canada-jobs-report-200437178,200437178

182792,404308,ADP,ADP  ADP  Upgraded To Buy  Here s Why,opinion,"Automatic Data Processing  ADP  NASDAQ ADP   appears an attractive pick  as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates  which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices 
The Zacks rating relies solely on a company s changing earnings picture  It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure    the Zacks Consensus Estimate 
The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors  since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time 
Therefore  the Zacks rating upgrade for ADP basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  has proven to be strongly correlated with the near term price movement of its stock  The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship  as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock 
For ADP  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company s underlying business  And investors  appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for ADP
For the fiscal year ending June      2019  this payroll and human resources company is expected to earn  5 44 per share  which is a change of 25 1  from the year ago reported number 
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for ADP  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 1 3  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term 
You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here    
The upgrade of ADP to a Zacks Rank  2 positions it in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions  implying that the stock might move higher in the near term ",2019-06-13,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/adp-adp-upgraded-to-buy-heres-why-200431621,200431621
182795,404311,ADP,What Makes Automatic Data Processing  ADP  A Strong Momentum Stock  Buy Now ,opinion,"Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock s recent trend  which can be in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   And for investors following this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks  this can be very tough to define  There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance  The Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Automatic Data Processing  ADP  NASDAQ ADP    a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B  We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions  two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Automatic Data Processing currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
Let s discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for ADP that show why this payroll and human resources company shows promise as a solid momentum pick 
Looking at a stock s short term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum  since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment  It s also helpful to compare a security to its industry  this can show investors the best companies in a particular area 
For ADP  shares are up 4 25  over the past week while the Zacks Outsourcing industry is up 2 63  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 2 48  compares favorably with the industry s 1 83  performance as well 
While any stock can see its price increase  it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market  That is why looking at longer term price metrics    such as performance over the past three months or year    can be useful as well  Over the past quarter  shares of Automatic Data Processing have risen 6 57   and are up 18 39  in the last year  In comparison  the S P 500 has only moved 3 31  and 5 81   respectively 
Investors should also pay attention to ADP s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  ADP is currently averaging 1 266 652 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things  including estimate revisions and a stock s price movement  Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank  and a nice path here can be promising  We have recently been noticing this with ADP 
Over the past two months  10 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost ADP s consensus estimate  increasing from  5 38 to  5 44 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  6 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 3 downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Given these factors  it shouldn t be surprising that ADP is a  2  Buy  stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B  If you re looking for a fresh pick that s set to soar in the near term  make sure to keep Automatic Data Processing on your short list ",2019-06-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/what-makes-automatic-data-processing-adp-a-strong-momentum-stock-buy-now-200432087,200432087

The dollar was destroyed across the board in Asian and early European trading today after the Fed signaled that it will cut rates at its next meeting in July 
US 10 year yields hit a low of 2  causing USDJPY to probe its swing lows at 107 50 while EUR USD climbed above the 1 1300 figure despite threats by ECB just a few days ago to lower rates deeper into negative territory 
The dollar drop was really a story of relative weakness as the markets reacted to the possible adjustment of lower US rates  Some bears have even argued that to have any effect the Fed needs to cut rates by 50 basis points rather than 25 at the meeting next month 
Yet despite the widespread assumption that the Fed has turned dovish  there remains a clear sense of reluctance on the part of Fed officials to lower rates dramatically at a time of economic expansion leaving policymakers with few tools should economic conditions deteriorate rapidly  That s why going forward it will be particularly important to pay attention to economic data over the next month  most specifically business sentiment and production surveys which Chairman Powell noted was the weak spot in the US economy 
If Fed s jawboning results in easing of credit conditions  improvement in business sentiment and a pick up in investment then the FOMC is much more likely to opt for one and done approach in July  Of course  a big factor in market conditions lies outside of Fed s control as trade relations with China will drive business decisions far more than any tweaks in the Fed funds rate  To that end the G 20 meeting between Trump and Xi looms large with sentiment possibly swinging the other way should the meeting prove productive resulting in some long term rapprochement between the US and China 
On the other hand  should the negotiations fail or simply produce no meaningful progress  the disappointment is likely to trigger a capitulation by dollar bulls and a move to fresh yearly lows in USD JPY ",2019-06-20,Boris Schlossberg,https://www.investing.com/analysis/dollar-beaten-across-the-board--what-happens-now-200433164,200433164

182814,404330,ADP,Gold Continues To Rally As Geopolitical Risks Remain Elevated,opinion,"Spot gold rose 0 5  to  1 336 64 per ounce  U S  gold futures settled  9 10 higher at  1 342 70 
 Ongoing concerns regarding global economic growth is supporting gold at the moment   said David Meger  director of metals trading at High Ridge Futures  adding that the United States  trade tussles with Mexico and China are taking a toll 
 Recent commentary by U S  Federal Reserve officials that they are at least willing to look at rate cuts if the data warrants it has also helped commodities across the board  
Having suspended a three year monetary tightening campaign earlier this year  the Fed is now widely expected to cut rates 
Chairman Jerome Powell said earlier this week the central bank will closely monitor the economic impact of trade conflicts  a deviation from his former  patient  stance 
U S  President Donald Trump  who has persistently advocated rate cuts  on Thursday issued fresh threats to hit China with tariffs on  at least  another  300 billion of Chinese goods  He also said he thought both China and Mexico wanted to make deals  however

Today s highlight will be the US labour market report  The wage growth figures will be in focus as many FOMC members have opened up for a change in the policy rate during the past days 
In the European space  the French and German industrial production figures will take centre stage  German prints have recently been bad and are particularly important in order to see whether the verge between hard and soft data starts to close or it remains wide  Furthermore  markets will digest yesterday s ECB meeting  where focus will also be on the inflation market pricing which suffered late yesterday 
Today and during the weekend the US Mexico tariff war will gain focus as Trump has threatened to put a 5  tariff on Mexican goods starting Monday  Mexico wants a delay  as negotiations advance  
We also get the Norwegian GDP figure for April and manufacturing production  see next page  
Selected market news 
The ECB yesterday joined the camp of central banks looking at easing monetary policy to fend off moderation in economic growth and declining inflation expectations  At the meeting the ECB extended its forward guidance to  at present levels at least through H1 2020  and Draghi also acknowledged on the subsequent press conference that a possible rate cut or restart of QE as a contingency tool had been discussed at the meeting  Yet  it was not as dovish as expected by markets given the market pricing of an almost 50 50 chance of a 10bp cut already in September  As a result  the EUR USD and the front end of the euro curve moved higher  The announced TLTRO3 modalities were broadly as expected  The new staff projections were broadly unchanged  leading to an unchanged baseline narrative  although the external environment posed a more prominent risk than previously  Markets are still pricing a 10bp rate cut by summer next year  for more details see   ECB not delivering to market expectations  
Yesterday  US president Trump said that he will decide whether to enact tariffs on another USD 325 billion of Chinese imports after the Group of 20 summit at the end of the month in Japan  where President Trump is expected to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping  In a taped interview with Fox News the US president also said that China wanted a deal and predicted the two sides would definitely reach agreement  Meanwhile  the governor of The Peoples Bank of China stressed yesterday that China has a lot of options to stimulate its economy  including cutting interest rates and the required reserve ratio rate  as well as stimulating the economy through fiscal measures  For our latest take on the difficult US China trade discussion  please see yesterday s  China Weekly Letter   Are we heading for an all out trade war   
Scandi markets
In Norway  the GDP figures for April will finally be adjusted for supply side effects from power and fisheries  and we expect an increase of 0 3  m m  which will indicate continued above trend growth  Manufacturing production has surprised to the downside lately  and based on the PMI we are looking for a rebound in April  expecting manufacturing production to grow 0 5   m m 
Fixed income markets
The ECB statement and press conference was a disappointment for the front end of the curve that jumped some 4bp  However  importantly Draghi did mention the possibility of rate cuts or restarting QE as a contingency tool  There is now priced 8bp of cut on a 12M horizon  See our ECB review here 
In respect of the long end we doubt that Draghi will trigger a Bund sell off despite the move higher in short rates  First of all  the risk is still skewed towards a future rate cut given the prominent risks lurking on the horizon  Secondly  Draghi did very little to lift inflation expectations that trade close to an all time low with 5y5y EUR inflation as low as 1 24  after the meeting  Hence  yesterday s flattening of the German curve 2s10s and 5s10s could very well continue over the next couple of weeks dependent on risk appetite  The higher EUR USD also adds further downside for eurozone inflation 
The conclusion from yesterday is that a significant part of the EGB market will continue to trade with negative yields for an extended period  Hence  the hunt for positive yields in periphery markets are set to continue  Note that 10Y France is also fast approaching negative territory after some very strong auctions yesterday  The latter could increasingly push Japanese investors towards higher yielding Spain 
Today  the attention turns to non farm payrolls where the market is probably prepared for a weaker number after the weak ADP  NASDAQ ADP  report this Wednesday 
FX markets
ECB turned its back on the dovishly priced market and the market reacted by appreciating the EUR and lowering inflation expectations  As for EUR USD  it is now faced with a Fed ready to cut rates and an ECB who has only started discussing easing  That should keep positive EUR USD momentum going  We forecast EUR USD at 1 15 in 6M  A sound US jobs report could temporarily weigh on EUR USD though  but it should not derail the outlook for a summer Fed rate cut 
In the Scandies  external developments have been key in driving NOK for some time  That said we now face a key couple of sessions in terms of domestic data releases  first today s GDP and manufacturing production and then Tuesday s blockbuster set with inflation and the Regional Network Survey due  We expect this data package to support the case for a June rate hike which is only priced at slightly more than 50 50  Relative rates have admittedly had less of an impact on the NOK in recent months  However  as long as the NOK remains weak and domestic data strong that will just underpin the case for additional rate hikes and likely at some point reach a pivotal carry level as NOK surpasses the carryattractiveness of AUD  NZD and CAD  For more on pivotal carry and our view on NOK please see NOK see FX Strategy   Why is the NOK so weak   28 May 2019 ",2019-06-07,Danske Markets,https://www.investing.com/analysis/ecb-disappoints-the-market-200429415,200429415
182820,404336,ADP,When The Worse Is Better  Markets Grew On Stimulus Hopes From Central Banks,opinion,"Market focus
The attention of financial markets is still focused on US trade disputes with other countries  Thursday was the second day of negotiations on trade and migration between the representatives of the U S  and Mexico  During the day  there were reports that the US administration may postpone the date for the introduction of tariffs  which is now scheduled on Monday  Reports of a softening position supported the risk on mood on the markets  reinforcing the purchase of stocks  However  on Friday morning  markets are taking a more cautious position in anticipation of the U S  employment report 
Stocks
US stocks rose 1  on Thursday  SPX rose 3 9  this week after touching 2 5 month lows  Today is NFP  day  and trading activity can be reduced until the release of the U S  statistics  The further rebound from the current 2850 may lead SPX to an important MA  50  level at that is at 2870 now  At the same time  it is worth noting that the markets have been growing in recent days in anticipation of stimulus from central banks  so the worse the data is  the higher the hopes for a softening of policies that support stocks 

EUR USD
The European Central Bank on Thursday moved the date before which it promises not to raise interest rates  but at the same time  it did not make hints about softening the policy in the near future  According to money market futures  the likelihood of interest rates cut by 10 bp this year fell from 75  before Draghi s speech to 45  at the moment  The change in expectations provoked a surge in EUR USD to 1 1300  Like earlier this week  the growth of the single currency was stopped as it approached this mark  The single currency has been falling since yesterday evening to 1 1260  Nevertheless  EUR USD remains above the former of the resistance line of the downward channel  reflecting the possible likely reversal of the euro trend from a decline to growth 

Gold
Gold unsuccessfully tried to hit  1340 on Wednesday and Thursday  which eventually turned into increased selling pressure  The end of week factor plays its role  as after strong dynamics market participants are trying to take profits  This is especially relevant now  before the release of important data on the US labour market 
Chart of the day  NFP
U S  Non Farm Payrolls  scheduled to 12 30 GMT  often have the strongest influence on the markets  deviating markedly from expectations  Market analysts at the beginning of the week  on average  predicted an increase in employment by 180K in May  However  the sharply negative ADP  NASDAQ ADP  report on employment in the private sector  an increase of 27K against the expected 185K  caused the alertness of market participants  Other labour market indicators are causing much less concern  Weekly unemployment claims changed slightly over the month  Manufacturing ISM Employment Index added 1 3 points to 53 7  Non manufacturing ISM Employment Index added 4 4 points to 58 1  Such a sharp increase can be a reflection of both a strong number of employed people and the growth in wages

182835,404351,ADP,Payrolls  The Fed And Gold,opinion,"On Friday  it was announced that the U S  added merely 75 000 jobs in May  Needless to say  a severe disappointment on the downside  The talk of an oncoming recession  and interest rate cut speculations   were boosted  Is it justified  How close are we actually to the end of the business cycle  Should we buy gold now 
Payrolls Below Expectations  But We Are Not Surprised
The U S  created just 75 000 jobs in May  following a strong rise of 224 000 in April  after a downward revision   The number surprised negatively  as the economists forecasted 180 000 created jobs  However  the weak payrolls confirmed what we saw in the ADP  data earlier in week  As we wrote on Thursday edition of the Gold News Monitor   ADP private sector job growth tumbled to a 9 year low  which suggests that the Friday s official employment report from the Labor Department will be also disappointing   And this is indeed what happened 
Moreover  the weak headline number was accompanied by substantial downward revisions in April and March  Employment gains in those two months combined were 75 000 lower than previously reported  Consequently  job gains have averaged 151 000 per month over the last three months  which is lower than several months ago  Indeed  monthly job gains have averaged 164 000 in 2019  compared with an average gain of 223 000 per month in 2018 
So  the pace of hiring has slowed  as the chart below shows  It is another worrisome signal of a slowing economy  especially that employment was weak everywhere except for three areas  professional and business services  education and health services  and leisure and hospitality  For example  construction companies hired just 4 000 new workers  while government and retailers cut jobs 
Chart 1  U S  nonfarm payrolls  red bars  left axis  change in thousands of persons  and the annual growth in average earnings in the private sector  green line  right axis     from May 2014 to May 2019 

Unemployment Rate Stays Flat
However  the employment situation report was not all bad  The unemployment rate stayed at a 49 year low of 3 6 percent  This is very important  as the unemployment rate is a powerful recession indicator  so if it had increased  we would have been very worried 
Actually  the unemployment rate decreased  We mean here U6  a broader measure of joblessness that includes part time workers  As one can see in the chart below  that rate dropped from 7 3 to 7 1 percent  the lowest level since December 2000 
Payrolls  Tariffs And The Business Cycle  The Takeaway
While the U S  isn t as international trade dependent as other major economies  the tariffs are a drag and coupled with the fading fiscal stimulus  point to a slower growth in second half of 2019  This is clearly evident in the weakening export growth figures  which explains why manufacturing data are coming this weak  The jobs market remains relatively strong and projects a picture in line with what can be expected during a maturing business cycle expansion stage 
Chart 2  The unemployment rate U3  red line  and the unemployment rate U6  green line  from May 2009 to May 2019 

Implications For Gold
What does it all mean for the gold market  Well  the pace of hiring has slowed since the end of 2018  so it may put more pressure on the Fed to remain dovish and prolong its pause in the tightening cycle  which should support gold prices  Or  the U S  central bank could even please the financial markets  and cut the federal funds rate  if we see another month of weak payrolls  This should be good news for the gold market  but investors should be aware that the interest rate outlook has been already priced in to a large extent 
On the other hand  the labor market remains healthier than a few years ago  with the unemployment rate staying at a multi year low  May s disappointing jobs number could be just an outlier  Or it might result from a growing shortage of skilled labor in the very tight job market  As the latest Beige Book report shows  many companies complain that they cannot find workers  The low jobs numbers would then mean not a recession but the late stage of the boom phase of the business cycle 
Indeed  as the chart below shows  the actual unemployment rate is currently below the so called natural unemployment rate  which is the equilibrium rate for a given economy 
Chart 3  U S  unemployment rate  red line  U3  and the natural unemployment rate  green line  from Q1 2009 to Q1 2019 

So is the rate a result of structural forces only  Hence  the current situation when the actual is below the natural rate  which may result from very favorable cyclical factors  We are still in the boom phase of the business cycle  Sorry  gold bulls 
Given the healthy labor market  the Fed should not cut interest rates  But the natural rate of unemployment is unobservable  so nobody knows what its true level actually is  The stock market increased after the disappointing payrolls  anticipating the dovish Fed s reaction  Gold prices have also increased  however  the gains were temporary  And the precious metals investors should not forget that when almost all market participants have bullish expectations  there is a risk of an opposite market outcome ",2019-06-11,Arkadiusz Sieron,https://www.investing.com/analysis/payrolls-the-fed-and-gold-200430631,200430631
182846,404362,ADP,EUR USD   Euro Rally Continues As Fed s Powell Hints At Rate Cut,opinion,"EUR USD has posted winning sessions for three successive days  and the upward trend has continued on Wednesday  Currently  the pair is trading at 1 1284  up 0 26  on the day  On the release front  German and eurozone services PMIs beat expectations  with scores of 55 4 and 52 9  respectively  Eurozone retail sales dropped 0 4   its first decline in four months 
In the U S   ADP nonfarm payrolls is expected to drop to 185 thousand in May  after a sparkling gain of 275 thousand in April  ISM Non Manufacturing PMI is projected to show strong expansion  with an estimate of 55 6 
On Thursday  the ECB is expected to maintain its key interest rate at a flat 0 00   In the U S   the key event is unemployment claims 
There were no surprises from the PMIs readings in May  The services sector continue to shows expansion in both Germany and the eurozone  The German release slowed to 55 4  down from the reading of 55 7 in April  It was a different story for manufacturing  as manufacturing PMIs pointed to contraction in Germany and the eurozone 
Both indicators have been mired in contraction territory for most of 2019  This is a result of ongoing trade tensions  which have reduced global demand for German and eurozone exports  and dampened the manufacturing sectors 
The Federal Reserve  has tried to present an aura of neutrality regarding rate moves  but has taken a sharp U turn this week in favor of an easing bias  On Tuesday  Fed chair Jerome Powell said that the Fed would  act as appropriate to sustain the expansion   and analysts noted that he did not mention his  patient  approach to monetary policy  which has been a buzzword in Powell s recent comments 
This comes on the heels of comments from James Bullard  president of the St  Louis Fed  Bullard stated that the Fed might have to lower rates shortly due to low inflation and the ongoing trade war with China  Bullard warned that the Fed may have to deal with  an economy that is expected to grow more slowly going forward  with some risk that the slowdown could be sharper than expected due to ongoing global trade regime uncertainty  
Bullard added that the current benchmark rate  which is at a range of 2 25  to 2 50   is too high for current economic conditions  and recommended lowering rates in order to stabilize the economy

	Also  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will meet with People s Bank of China Governor Yi Gang this weekend in Japan  which will be the first get together of the two countries since trade talks broke down a month ago 
	The market is praying that the G 20 meeting later this month might include a breakthrough on trade between the globe s two largest economies  but we don t even know yet if President Trump and China President Xi will talk to each other at the summit  Maybe this weekend can lay some groundwork

182854,404370,ADP,U S  Employment Growth Plunges To Lowest Growth Level In 9 Years,opinion,"If the U S  economy was heading into a recession  we would expect to see a slowdown in the employment numbers  and that is precisely what is happening 
According to payroll processing firm ADP Nonfarm Employment Change  the U S  economy only added 27 000 new jobs in May  and that is way below the number that is needed just to keep up with population growth  Of course some in the mainstream media are attempting to put a positive spin on this  but there really is no denying that this is a truly awful number  In fact  we have not seen a number this bad in more than 9 years 

Job creation skidded to a near halt in May in another sign that the U S  economic momentum is slowing 
Companies added just 27 000 new positions during the month  according to a report Wednesday from payroll processing firm ADP  NASDAQ ADP  and Moody s Analytics that was well below Dow Jones estimates of 173 000 
The reading was the worst since around the time the economic expansion began and the jobs market bottomed in March 2010 with a loss of 113 000 

9 years is a very long time  but this terrible employment number is perfectly consistent with all of the other horrible economic numbers that have been rolling in lately 
Time after time in recent weeks I have been using phrases such as  since the last recession  to describe what we are witnessing  The U S  economy has not been in such rough shape in nearly a decade  and things just keep getting worse 
So how did Wall Street respond to the latest employment news 
Actually  stock prices surged  because investors are super excited about the prospect that the Federal Reserve could soon lower interest rates 
If the U S  economy was heading into a recession  we would expect to see a slowdown in the employment numbers  and that is precisely what is happening  According to payroll processing firm ADP  the U S  economy only added 27 000 new jobs in May  and that is way below the number that is needed just to keep up with population growth  Of course  some in the mainstream media are attempting to put a positive spin on this  but there really is no denying that this is a truly awful number  In fact  we have not seen a number this bad in more than 9 years

So how did Wall Street respond to the latest employment news 
Actually  stock prices surged  because investors are super excited about the prospect that the Federal Reserve could soon lower interest rates 

Stocks added to strong week to date performance on Wednesday as investors grew even more confident that the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates this year to reignite an economy wounded by trade battles 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 207 39 points to 25 539 57  while the S P 500 advanced 0 8  to 2 826 15  The Nasdaq Composite closed 0 6  higher at 7 575 48 

Pushing interest rates all the way to the floor certainly helped the stock market recover after the last recession  but this time around there is a major twist 
The U S  is currently engaged in a major trade war with China  and the normal tools that the Fed utilizes may not be powerful enough to overcome the negative effects of such a conflict 
And to make things worse  now the U S  is also starting a trade war with Mexico  On Wednesday  President Trump made it clear that  not nearly enough  progress had been achieved during negotiations with Mexican officials 

President Donald Trump said  not nearly enough  progress was made in talks with Mexico to mitigate the flow of undocumented migrants and illegal drugs  raising the likelihood that the U S  will follow through with tariffs next week 

So tariffs will be slapped on Mexican goods starting on Monday  and President Trump seems quite excited about this 

 If no agreement is reached  Tariffs at the 5  level will begin on Monday  with monthly increases as per schedule   Trump tweeted Wednesday   The higher the Tariffs go  the higher the number of companies that will move back to the USA  

Of course the Mexicans will almost certainly retaliate  and both countries will start seeing higher prices and significant job losses 
In fact  one study has concluded that the U S  economy could lose more than 400 000 jobs as a result of these tariffs on Mexico  The following comes from CNN 

If the 5  US tariff on all goods from Mexico takes effect and is maintained  more than 400 000 jobs in the United States could be lost  an analysis released this week found 
The tariffs on Mexico  set to go in effect on Monday  would cost Texas alone more than 117 000 jobs  according to the analysis by The Perryman Group  an economic consulting firm  Texas is Mexico s largest export market  making the two economies closely intertwined 

And the truth is that those numbers could actually be on the low side 
According to Marc Thiessen  a trade war with Mexico would literally put millions of U S  jobs at risk 

Indeed  Mexican tariffs could be even more devastating for Americans than those imposed on China  Deutsche Bank  DE DBKGn  estimates the tariffs could raise the average price of automobiles sold in the United States by  1 300  Indeed  U S  and Mexican auto supply chains are so deeply integrated that many parts cross the border multiple times before they end up in a finished vehicle   which means they would be hit by tariffs multiple times  compounding costs  Ten million U S  workers  jobs depend on this supply chain  tariffs would put those jobs at risk  including those of the  forgotten Americans  in the industrial Midwest whose jobs Trump vowed to protect 

We shall see what happens  but the outlook for the U S  economy for the rest of this year is not good at all  and beyond that things look exceedingly grim 
Hopefully  I am wrong  but it certainly appears that a major economic downturn is developing just in time for the 2020 presidential election 
There is one more thing that I would like to mention before I wrap up this article  This week  a Russian news source reported that Russia and China  will sign an agreement  regarding the use of their own national currencies in bilateral trade with one another 

Russia and China will sign an agreement on possible payments in national currencies  A decree of the Russian government on signing of a relevant agreement with the Chinese side was released on the official portal of legal information on Wednesday 
According to the draft decree approved through that government document   settlements and payments for goods  service and direct investments between economic entities of the Russian Federation and the People s Republic of China are made in accordance with the international practice and the legislation of the sides  states with the use of foreign currency  the Russian currency  rubles  and the Chinese currency  yuan   

In other words  they are dumping the dollar in favor of their own national currencies when trading with each other  This is a direct threat to the international dominance of the U S  dollar  and other countries have been discussing similar moves 
For decades  the U S  dollar has essentially been a global currency  More dollars are actually used outside of the United States than within this country  and most Americans don t realize that 
This has given us some enormous advantages in the global marketplace  and it could be just a matter of time before those advantages begin to disappear 
Things that used to take months or years to happen are now happening in a matter of days  The pace of change is really picking up  and right now the momentum of events is heading in a direction that is definitely not favorable to the United States ",2019-06-06,Michael T.

182856,404372,ADP,ECB Meeting Unlikely To Be A Game Changer ,opinion,"Market movers today 
Focus in markets remains on US trade talks   with short term emphasis on Mexico  see latest  here   and speculation of central bank easing for most notably the Fed 
Today s highlight is the ECB meeting  with a policy statement to be released at 13 45 CEST and a press conference at 14 30 CEST  We expect the ECB to maintain its easing bias  with no new additional stimulus measures announced  The update of the staff projections is unlikely to change much for inflation  but we see a downside risk to the 2020 21 growth forecast from its already low level  We will also get more information on the TLTRO3 terms  which we expect to be favourable in light of the ongoing struggles of the economy  See our full preview  here and our  cheat sheet   here  
We will also get euro area GDP details for Q1   We will closely monitor the domestic demand drivers and see how they fared  private consumption and fixed investments were probably strong judging from the German figures already released 
In the US   we get the jobless claims   which will attract attention ahead of tomorrow s NFP number amid contradicting labour market signals yesterday  see below   We expect initial jobless claims to come in at the low end 
Selected market news 
Yesterday s US ADP  NASDAQ ADP  report for May fell well short of market expectations with a monthly private job growth of only 24K   the weakest report since March 2010  Over the past years the ADP report has been a less than stellar predictor of the nonfarm release even if the moving average version has proven a better fit  see  chart   Upon the ADP release  rates markets raised their bets on Fed rate cuts  Meanwhile  the subsequent ISM non manufacturing was strong  with a rise to 56 9 beating both market expectations of a modest drop and the gloomy signals from the Markit Service PMI  Also  the employment index of the ISM non manufacturing   which has historically correlated well with nonfarm payrolls  see  chart   showed a strong rise to 58 1  spreading doubt as to the reliability of the weak ADP signal  Rates markets subsequently reversed most of the US fixed income rally 
Brent crude temporarily dropped below USD60 bbl yesterday as the EIA s weekly inventory report showed a historically large increase in total US petroleum stocks  This raises concerns about waning US demand at a time when trade concerns have resurfaced  On the other hand  the latest price drop increases the likelihood of OPEC  extending its output curbs 
The general election in Denmark gave a majority to the parties that support a new government under Social Democratic leadership  There still need to be negotiations and the shape of a new government is not a done deal  We do not expect any market impact  A new government does not mean a fundamental shift in economic policy  Denmark s EU membership is not in question  and any thoughts of joining the euro are far away 
Real Estate Norway house prices showed a monthly rise in national house prices in May of 0 5  s a  This was a little stronger than expected and shows that rising disposable income growth is more than countering the housing headwinds from rising supplies  higher nominal rates  tight regulation  lower migration and lower population growth  We expect continued moderate house price growth in the coming months 
Fixed income markets
Today s big question is whether Draghi  like Powell  will make a dovish turn and open up for more QE or rate cuts at today s ECB meeting  In that respect  remember the ECB is already on an  easing bias   But still it might be difficult to live up to dovish market expectations  We expect that the best the market can hope for is some favourable TLTRO modalities  potentially with an incentive structure to the level seen for the current deposit rate of  40bp  For more see our ECB cheat sheet and our ECB preview  We see short end rates markets suffering initially  although we expect the low for longer hunt for carry narrative to continue also after today  However  equity markets might suffer initially  which should add support to Bunds and push 10Y yields even lower 
The periphery including Italy  continued to perform yesterday and today Spain is set to sell a modest EUR2 3bn in the 3Y and 5Y benchmark bonds  Hence  there is modest SPGB risk coming to the market  which should support the auction  The drop in 10Y French yields to just 15bp has also fuelled speculation that Japanese investors will increasingly move to Spain  France will today tap the 8Y  10Y  17Y and 30Y bonds  Hence  there is a lot of French duration coming to the market  We continue to recommend 10Y Spain vs France 
FX markets
More dovish hints from the Fed and a weak ADP employment report temporarily sent EUR USD up to 1 13 yesterday before the cross more than erased gains on the nonmanufacturing ISM  The market will likely need a significant dovish shift from the ECB today to be inclined to sell EUR USD  i e  rate cuts and or QE on the table  We think the ECB will have a hard time living up to market expectations as it becomes clear that the Fed is one step ahead of ECB in the dovish shift  Hence  we do not look for the ECB to derail recent positive EUR USD momentum 
Over a volatile day  USD JPY ended slightly higher and thus joined in on the rally also seen in equities  We remain on the sidelines in buying this rally and expect declining oil prices to set the dominant theme for continued JPY strength  Our short term forecast is 108 and we continue to see downside on this 
The NOK has come under renewed pressure from the drop in oil prices and hence yesterday our NOK SEK trading recommendation hit our stop profit level of 1 0825  PnL  3 1  incl  carry   In the short term  the bearish oil sentiment in oil markets is testing our views of both a lower AUD NOK and lower USD NOK   but strategically we still like the trades on both the Norwegian macro case and in an environment where the Fed fully opens for rate cuts 
More specifically on Oceania FX  the AUD and NZD either weakened or gave back some gains in the end as commodities remain on a weak footing  not least the broad dollar strengthening late in the US session  Domestic data has been a bit better in these countries but against still weak risk sentiment we do not expect to see a major rally in these crosses ",2019-06-06,Danske Markets,https://www.investing.com/analysis/ecb-meeting-unlikely-to-be-a-game-changer-200428931,200428931
182858,404374,ADP,Oil Tumbled On Unexpected U S  Inventory Addition And Renewed Concern Of A Supply ,opinion,"Crude oil  WTI July 19  closed around 51 61 in the U S  session Wednesday  tumbled almost  3 50  on an unexpected U S  inventory addition and renewed concern of a supply glut amid synchronized global contraction as a result of Trump trade cold war  Overall  oil plunged almost  4  for June  till date  after over 16  slump in May on Trump trade war tensions and the concern of global economic slowdown coupled with surging U S  inventory and OPEC  production cut agreement extension suspense  while got some support on Trump s bellicose Iran and Venezuelan policies 
On Wednesday  the EIA data shows that the U S  crude oil inventories jumped to  6 771 mb from prior drawdown of  0 282 mb  higher than the expectations of  0 849 mb drawdown  API   3 545 mb   The U S  crude oil imports surged to  1 084 mb from prior  0 476 mb  The U S  crude oil inventories at Cushing soared to  1 791 mb from prior drawdown of  0 016 mb  The EIA weekly distillates stocks also jumped to 4 572 mb from prior drawdown of  1 615 mb  higher than the expectations of  0 499 mb  The U S  gasoline inventories jumped to  3 205 mb from prior addition of  2 204 mb  higher than the expectations of  0 630 mb 
In brief  at a glance all the main components  Crude Gasoline and Cushing inventories  of EIA oil inventory report are bearish and subsequently  oil tumbled to a low 50 62  at 5 months low and well off the April high of 66 60  down almost  24  and technically in the bear market territory amid renewed fear of a supply glut  The U S  crude production jumped to record 12 4 mbpd and the U S  crude inventories jumped by 6 8 mb to 483 26 mb  the highest level since July 17  while U S  Cushing crude inventories jumped to highest since Dec 17 
Outside OPEC  countries  it s not only the U S   but Kazakhstan s oil output also surged after scheduled maintenance to 400 kbpd from prior 340 kbpd  On the other side  global oil demand growth is now the weakest since 2012  resulting in a fear of supply glut despite OPEC  cut effort and supply disruptions from Iran  Venezuela  and Libya  But Trump s bellicose policies are also helping U S  export to a great extent as  despite China s lower offtake  other Asian countries such as India  South Korea  and Japan are now buying more U S  sweet crude oil  which is also selling at a significant discount to the current market rate of Crude oil 
The concern of an economic slowdown exaggerated further after the ADP  NASDAQ ADP  nonfarm employment change for May crumbled to 27K  from prior 271K  lower than the expectations of 180K coupled with other soft U S  economic data  Looking ahead  OPEC  is likely to extend production cuts as the current slump of oil prices makes its decision an easy one when they meet in Vienna  Oil was also undercut by a report that Russian oil companies are ready to respond quickly and boost output if OPEC  deal members decide 
Meanwhile  on Wednesday  IMF warned Trump tariffs could reduce the global GDP growth as high as 0 5  in 2020  negative for oil energy demand  The global GDP loss from U S  China tariffs war alone could reach  455B  larger than South Africa s annual GDP output 
IMF also lowered China growth forecast on trade tensions but said no additional policy stimulus needed yet  The IMF marginally slashed growth forecast for China in 2019 to 6 2  vs 6 3   The IMF noted that the Chinese economy stabilized in early 2019 reflecting a wide range of policy support  However  renewed trade tension is a significant course of uncertainty that weighs on sentiment 
But IMF noted that policy stimulus announced so far is sufficient to stabilize growth in 2019 20 despite the recent U S  tariff hike  And no additional policy easing is needed for the time being  provided there are no further increases in tariffs or a significant slowdown in growth  However  if trade tensions escalate further  some additional policy easing would be warranted 
Full IMF statement on China 
 Growth is expected to moderate to 6 2 percent and 6 0 percent in 2019 and 2020  respectively  as the planned policy stimulus partially offsets the negative impact from the recent US tariff hike on US  200 billion of Chinese exports  Growth is expected to gradually slow to 5 5 percent by 2024 as the economy moves towards a more sustainable growth path  Headline inflation is projected to rise to 2 3 percent in 2019  reflecting higher food prices  The near term outlook remains particularly uncertain given the potential for further escalation of trade tensions  
 The policy stimulus announced so far is sufficient to stabilize growth in 2019 20 despite the recent US tariff hike  No additional policy easing is needed  provided there are no further increases in tariffs or a significant slowdown in growth  Exchange rate flexibility should increase to facilitate adjustment to the new external environment  However  if trade tensions escalate further  putting at risk economic and financial stability  some additional policy easing would be warranted  For example  a fiscal expansion  which is centrally financed  pro rebalancing  and targeted to low income households  could be used to stabilize the economy  
 The global economy would benefit from a more open  stable  and transparent  rules based international trade system  China and it s trading partners should work constructively to address shortcomings in the trading system and enable a system that can more readily adapt to economic changes in the international environment  China can also play an important role and benefit from further opening up and other structural reforms that enhance competition  Trade tensions between the U S  and China should be quickly resolved through a comprehensive agreement that supports the international system and avoids managed trade  
 Credit growth and corporate debt have been reduced thanks to concerted efforts to strengthen financial regulation  reduce regulatory arbitrage  and improve the framework for financial supervision  Going forward  the priority should be to fully implement the announced regulatory reforms and continue with structural regulatory reforms to reduce still elevated vulnerabilities  
 Bank capital  especially for small and medium size banks  should be strengthened and macro prudential regulations should not be relaxed  even temporarily  for cyclical reasons or to offset tighter domestic financial conditions  To improve credit allocation and efficiency  policies to increase lending to the private sector should be complemented with a comprehensive plan to remove the implicit guarantee for state owned enterprises  SOEs   
 China has made welcome progress in reducing external imbalances over several years  and the external position in 2018 was broadly in line with medium term fundamentals and desirable policies  Enhancing the social safety net with a more progressive tax system would help prevent external imbalances from re emerging by discouraging excessive household savings and boosting consumption  Greater exchange rate flexibility and better functioning foreign exchange markets would help the financial system prepare for more volatile capital flows  
 Progress on structural reforms has led to a further opening up of the economy and a greater role for market forces  Such structural reforms should continue to boost productivity and longer term growth  Liberalizing product and labor markets and further opening up the service sector would increase competition and flexibility and allow China to benefit further from globalization  SOE reform should continue and help achieve competitive neutrality by hardening SOE budget constraints and removing their implicit guarantees  Managing China s increasingly systemic and complex economy requires modernizing policy frameworks towards more market based and transparent frameworks

182859,404375,ADP,The Energy Report  Massive Increases In Oil Inventory,opinion,"The Great Flood
Did you hear about the great flood  No not the one that has plagued the Midwest and the Plains  but the flood of crude oil that supposedly hit our shores along with the major builds in gasoline and distillate  The Energy Information Administration  EIA  stunned the market by reporting a massive 6 771 million barrel increase in crude supply  a big 3 205 million barrel increase in gasoline supply and a whopping 4 572 million barrel increase in distillate  The massive flood of inventories had total commercial oil stocks increasing by a whopping 22 4 million barrels  the highest levels since September of 2017 
Apparently based on these numbers the global economy ground to an abrupt halt last week and countries like Canada and Columbia decided to flood the U S  shores with incredible amounts of crude oil  Crude imports shot up 1M bpd to 7 9M bpd  This comes as we have had a run of rising inventories  which by seasonal standards  should be falling
Yet perhaps the other great flood in the Midwest and the Plains  along with other acts by mother Nature  may be part of the reason we saw these massive increases in oil inventory 
In fact  I would argue that these historic storms and floods may have had more impact on overall economic activity than many people thought  Not only did we see a dip in manufacturing earlier  we saw the ADP  NASDAQ ADP  Jobs number miss in a big way  The ADP said we created only 27 000 new jobs in April  a far cry from the 180 000 plus that the market was looking for  Small businesses were laying off and not hiring in part due to the impacts of the great floods 
We know that U S  farmers are way behind on planting and that millions of acres of grain will go unplanted with diesel burning tractors remaining parked  We also know that gasoline demand  that was up last week  would have been even stronger if it were not for all the rainy weather  We also know that the flooding shut down a major pipeline out of the Cushing Oklahoma delivery hub  That backed up supply  leading to a 1 791 million barrel increase in Cushing Oklahoma 
Yet that does not fully explain the massive surge in oil imports to the U S   But there is an explanation for that  Part of that comes in the form of adjustments and some of that comes down to another shutdown in the Houston Shipping channel last week and at the end of March  That caused  because of tracking issues  the EIA overestimating U S  oil exports in previous months and the EIA has been making upward revisions on supplies to correct previous errors  The EIA adjustment number added 876 000 barrels a day which is ridiculously high  Part of the issue is the weather plagued Houston Shipping Channel  Shut down by fog and chemical fires  it made it almost impossible for the EIA to track real numbers and whether oil tankers were coming or going  and whether they were full or empty  Also  the EIA is having trouble tracking oil because the jammed up Houston shipping channel has issues with very large crude oil carriers 
The EIA explained the problem like this   U S  crude oil exports averaged 1 1 million barrels per day  b d  in 2017 and 1 6 million b d so far in 2018  up from less than 0 5 million b d in 2016  This growth in U S  crude oil exports happened despite the fact that U S  Gulf Coast onshore ports cannot fully load Very Large Crude Carriers  VLCC   the largest and most economic vessels used for crude oil transportation  Instead  export growth was achieved using smaller and less cost effective ships  
The EIA continued  Each VLCC is designed to carry approximately 2 million barrels of crude oil  Because of their large size  VLCCs require ports with waterways of enough width and depth for safe navigation  All onshore U S  ports in the Gulf Coast that actively trade petroleum are in inland harbors and are connected to the open ocean through shipping channels or navigable rivers  Although these channels and rivers are regularly dredged to maintain depth and enable safe navigation for most ships  they are not deep enough for deep draft vessels such as fully loaded VLCCs  To circumvent depth restrictions  VLCCs transporting crude oil to or from the U S  Gulf Coast have typically used partial loadings and ship to ship transfers  The ship to ship transfer process known as lightering refers to a larger vessel partially unloading onto a smaller vessel  Reverse lightering occurs when smaller vessels load onto a larger vessel  These transfers take place in designated lightering zones and points that exist outside many of the largest U S  petroleum ports  
The EIA said that  Currently  most U S  Gulf Coast petroleum ports are capable of accepting vessels with capacities of approximately 500 000 barrels of crude oil  AFRAMAX   The number of ports that can accept vessels with capacities of approximately 900 000 1 000 000 barrels  SUEZMAX  is relatively limited  Four AFRAMAX sized vessels or two SUEZMAX sized vessels are required to carry the same amount of crude oil as a single VLCC  
Still  we must acknowledge weak demand  The EIA said total demand on the U S  system fell 2 2 million barrels a day last week  How much of that was rain and how much were signs of economic pain

182860,404376,ADP,Jobs Data Depicts Weakness  75K In May,opinion,"Friday  June 7  2019Despite estimates for non farm payrolls in May remaining in the 150K 200K range among at least a plurality of analysts  just 75K new jobs were created last month  according to the U S  Bureau of Labor Statistics  BLS   The Unemployment Rate stayed unchanged at a 50 year low 3 6   with both Wage Growth and Labor Force Participation slipping Revisions to the past two months also displayed softer headlines   April s initially reported headline of 263K fell to 224K  while March s 189K  originally released as 196K  slipped to 153K  This amounts to 75K fewer jobs created in the past two months  combined with the 100K fewer than expected last month  As we saw in ADP s   NASDAQ ADP   private sector report Wednesday  we finally see some weak data in our multi year robust labor market Average Hourly Earnings rose 6 cents  or  0 2  month over month  to  27 83  This creates a 3 1  gain year over year  which remains historically weak  considering we remain at 3 6  on Unemployment  Labor Force Participation came in at 62 8   ultimately flat but lower than the 63   we had been used to seeing in these monthly data reports  In a spot of good news  the U 6  aka  real unemployment   fell to a very low 7 1  from 7 3  last read  For a bit of context  getting under 10 on the U 6 a few years ago was considered a major accomplishment Overall  jobs gains for the past 3 months average out to 151K   lower than we d grown accustomed to  but still higher than the jobs market needs to make up for baby boomer retirees  This also comes in line with the ADP s 3 month average of 152K  Thus  we can take this disappointing headline and still recognize a healthy labor situation in the U S   even if it is below what we d come to expect Yet wage growth at  0 2  indicates all this positive jobs data isn t generating the wealth for the workforce analysts would have expected  So in addition to a lower monthly jobs report   and without mentioning the two fronted trade war begun by the Trump administration   this slowing rate of wage payment does point to a slowing economy overall  And this may back up analysts looking for the Fed to cut interest rates sometime this year  quite possibly this summer Mark VickerySenior Editor

182866,404382,ADP,Disappointing Job Data For May,opinion,Despite estimates for non farm payrolls in May remaining in the 150K 200K range among at least a plurality of analysts  just 75K new jobs were created last month  according to the U S  Bureau of Labor Statistics  BLS   The Unemployment Rate stayed unchanged at a 50 year low 3 6   with both Wage Growth and Labor Force Participation slipping Revisions to the past two months also displayed softer headlines   April s initially reported headline of 263K fell to 224K  while March s 189K  originally released as 196K  slipped to 153K  This amounts to 75K fewer jobs created in the past two months  combined with the 100K fewer than expected last month  As we saw in ADP s   NASDAQ ADP   private sector report Wednesday  we finally see some weak data in our multi year robust labor market Average Hourly Earnings rose 6 cents  or  0 2  month over month  to  27 83  This creates a 3 1  gain year over year  which remains historically weak  considering we remain at 3 6  on Unemployment  Labor Force Participation came in at 62 8   ultimately flat but lower than the 63   we had been used to seeing in these monthly data reports  In a spot of good news  the U 6  aka  real unemployment   fell to a very low 7 1  from 7 3  last read  For a bit of context  getting under 10 on the U 6 a few years ago was considered a major accomplishment Overall  jobs gains for the past 3 months average out to 151K   lower than we d grown accustomed to  but still higher than the jobs market needs to make up for baby boomer retirees  This also comes in line with the ADP s 3 month average of 152K  Thus  we can take this disappointing headline and still recognize a healthy labor situation in the U S   even if it is below what we d come to expect Yet wage growth at  0 2  indicates all this positive jobs data isn t generating the wealth for the workforce analysts would have expected  So in addition to a lower monthly jobs report   and without mentioning the two fronted trade war begun by the Trump administration   this slowing rate of wage payment does point to a slowing economy overall  And this may back up analysts looking for the Fed to cut interest rates sometime this year  quite possibly this summer ,2019-06-06,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/disappointing-job-data-for-may-200429692,200429692

How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then 
In the past month  investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates 
VGM Scores
Currently  ADP has a nice Growth Score of B  though it is lagging a bit on the Momentum Score front with a C  Charting a somewhat similar path  the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side  putting it in the bottom 40  for this investment strategy 
Overall  the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C  If you aren t focused on one strategy  this score is the one you should be interested in 
Outlook
Estimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock  and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift  Notably  ADP has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   We expect an in line return from the stock in the next few months ",2019-05-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/adp-adp-up-16-since-last-earnings-report-can-it-continue-200427067,200427067
182879,404395,ADP,Safe Havens Reign Supreme As Tariffs Batter Markets,opinion,"Risk aversion ran wild as stock markets and other risk assets plummeted on global tariff escalation  The US dollar s early gains during the end of May market rout is starting to reverse course on expectations the Fed may cut rates twice this year  Stocks are licking their wounds following a double dose of negative trade news  The first bullet came from China s retaliatory measures that will deliver a crippling blow to multi nationals and likely further downgrade earnings forecasts as the Sino US relationship appears to going towards a path of irreparable damage  The second bullet came from the escalation in trade tensions between Mexico and US  which pretty much came out of nowhere  The trade spat with China has been brewing  but markets were taken back with the US actions towards Mexico  The US  Mexico and Canada were in the process of getting the USMCA approved with their respective governments  but that may have hit a road block now  President Trump s attack to their southern neighbor saw a Mexican response that US exports of grains  pork  and apples may be hit with tariffs  Tariff escalation is detrimental to global growth and the bond market saw Bunds fall to a record low and the 10 year Treasury yield dropped to a fresh 20 month low and fell further below the Fed s fund target range 
Markets will continue to care about every incremental trade update  but they should also closely pay attention to a couple important rate decisions and a wrath of Fed speak  which includes Chair Powell s discussion on policy strategy  On Monday  President Trump will also make a state visit to the UK  where he will meet with Queen Elizabeth and PM May  Tuesday  the RBA is expected to cut rates and we hear from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell at a Fed Research Conference  Wednesday  the EIA releases their crude oil weekly report and the Fed releases the Beige book and members Clarida and Bostic speak  On Thursday  the ECB will keep policy steady and update their economic forecasts  Friday will see PM May step down as the leader of the conservative party and have the release of the US employment report  which expects to see hiring deliver 185 000 new jobs in May 
RBA to cut rates and signal more are coming
ECB to downgrade forecasts and give details on next round of TLTROs
Fed s Speakers to address recent trade war escalation and possible capitulation on cuts
RBA
On Tuesday  the Reserve Bank of Australia  RBA  is widely expected to cut the cash rate by 25 basis points to 1 25   with investors focusing on how many more cuts will be queued up  Only 5  of economists  two specifically  see the RBA keep rates steady  At the last meeting  the RBA surprised many when they kept policy following disappointingly weak first quarter inflation 
The RBA may decide on holding off on confirming any additional rate cuts  preferring to see how the global growth slowdown hits their domestic economy  The recent global bond rally took the Australian 10 year yield below the RBA s cash rate of 1 5   for the first time since 2015  Analysts are piling on the rate cut bets  JP Morgan sees rates falling to 0 50  by mid 2020 while Westpac and Capital Economics see cuts targeting 0 75   With tame inflation  the RBA s easing decision should be an easy one 
The Australian dollar remains near the lows of the year  as the recent escalation in trade wars dims global growth outlooks  and while data points in the Asia Pacific continue to deteriorate  With China s May manufacturing PMI falling back into contraction  expectations remain high the PBOC will come to the rescue  While the market begins pricing in further RBA rate cuts  we could limited Australian dollar downside as the greater driver could be the Fed s capitulation with delivering their own rate cuts 

Fed
A wrath of Federal Reserve members will speak next week  with investors waiting to see further confirming signals that the Fed will provide further accommodation shortly  On Tuesday  Fed Chair Jerome Powell will discuss monetary policy strategy  tools  and communication practices at the Fed s framework review conference in Chicago  Markets have not heard from Powell since the trade war went on steroids and he could use this as his stage to begin capitulate and signal accommodation is needed  The Fed s preferred core price measure in April stayed steady at 1 6   but still comfortably below the Fed s 2  target  The US trade war escalations with China and Mexico will likely dominate the Fed s concerns here and while the data dependent script may suggest they need to see further data confirm weakness  they might agree that is not necessary 
ECB
The ECB rate decision is expected to see no change with rates and possibly minor downgrades with their economic forecasts  The central bank will also deliver more details on the expected launch of its third round of targeted long term refinancing operations in September  Economists are expecting them to use TLTROs as a backstop  which could provide insurance in times of heightened uncertainty  With most of the other G7 central banks on the verge of providing stimulus  expectations are rising for the ECB to also provide fresh support to the ailing economy  Global trade wars are raising the risk for a euro zone recession  but that is still not the base case  The current implied interest rate probabilities see a 53  chance that the ECB cuts rates at the January 23rd 2020 meeting 
The upcoming meeting should see the ECB provide a slight adjustment to forward guidance becoming more accommodative  Economists however still are not abandoning a rate hike in the near future and that should provide some support for the euro  A Reuters poll showed 47  of the 60 contributors expect a rate hike at some point between now and the end of 2020  while 3  saw a cut and the rest expect no change in rates 
The euro remains stuck in very tight range and we should see 1 11 remain formidable support  while 1 1250 provides initial resistance 

Oil
The month of May was a disaster for crude prices  the worst May performance in seven years  as unabrupt escalation with global trade war saw the global growth outlook crumble  Oil prices have now given up the lion share of the effects of the OPEC   production cuts  Geopolitical risks remain in place but right now demand growth is in freefall and oil remains vulnerable  The US   China trade war remains most critical to the global growth outlook  but the addition of trade tensions between the US and Mexico raised the slower demand picture for the Americas 
West Texas Intermediate crude s selloff is now around 20  lower from the April 23rd high of  66 60  With rising expectations that OPEC will be less effective in signaling continued production cuts going forward  crude will need to rely on some positive outcomes on the trade front for prices to begin stabilizing 

Gold 
It took a while  but gold prices finally broke out higher after the trade war escalation led to a code red for global growth  A devastating month for equities  the worst one since December  and other risk assets saw a global bond rally lead the way for safe haven assets  The yellow metal is once again becoming an attractive safe haven as markets will remain skeptical on any trade progress after seeing how fast we could see Trump deliver a new tariff threat

182881,404397,ADP,EUR USD   Euro Rally Hits 6 Week High ,opinion,"EUR USD continues to gain ground  after starting the week with strong gains  Currently  the pair is trading at 1 1249  up 0 06  on the day  Earlier in the day  the pair touched a high of 1 1277  its highest level since mid April  On the release front  eurozone consumer inflation indicators disappointed  The estimate for annual inflation in May slowed to 1 2   down from 1 7  in April  The core indicator also fell  dropping to 0 8   after a reading of 1 2  in April  Both indicators missed their forecasts  There are no major events out of the U S  On Wednesday  the eurozone releases retail sales  while the U S  posts ADP nonfarm payrolls and  ISM Non Manufacturing PMI 
The week has started out with disappointing data in the eurozone  The estimate for consumer inflation slowed in May  a reflection of weaker economic activity in Germany as well as the rest of the eurozone  The downward slide continues for German and eurozone manufacturing PMIs  which have been mired in contraction territory for most of 2019  This is a result of ongoing trade tensions  which have reduced global demand for German and eurozone exports  and dampened the manufacturing sectors 
Despite soft eurozone data this week  the euro has gained ground  courtesy of FOMC member James Bullard  The president of the St  Louis Fed was blunt and pessimistic  saying that the Fed might have to lower rates shortly due to low inflation and the ongoing trade war with China  Bullard warned that the Fed may have to deal with  an economy that is expected to grow more slowly going forward  with some risk that the slowdown could be sharper than expected due to ongoing global trade regime uncertainty   Bullard added that the current benchmark rate  which is at a range of 2 25  to 2 50   is too high for current economic conditions  and recommended lowering rates in order to stabilize the economy  The dovish comments about lower rates helped boost the euro on Monday

182887,404403,ADP,Fed s Powell Opens Door For Further Rate Cuts,opinion,"Market movers today

The ongoing  Fed Listens  conference remains the centre of attention  with any interviews speeches scrutinised for policy hints following the recent days  remarks  see below 
Otherwise  the market is primarily awaiting the ECB meeting tomorrow and the US labour market report on Friday  Today s ADP  NASDAQ ADP  report could give an indication of what to expect on the latter even if the predictive power has been mediocre recently  We also get US ISM non manufacturing  which will receive more attention than usual given the disappointing US flash Markit Service PMI two weeks ago  we get the final Markit print 15 minutes prior to the ISM today  A series of Markit Service PMIs will also be released across Europe 
The weekly US crude inventory report could prove interesting in the current weak macro environment and in light of the recent oil sell off  The story since mid April has been a rise in US crude stocks  which has raised concerns about weakening US demand 
In the Scandies  focus turns to the general election in Denmark and Real Estate Norway house prices in Norway  Neither of these should trigger any significant market reaction 

Selected market news 
This morning  most Asian equity indices are trading in green following yesterday s equity rally driven by Fed Chair Powell  see below  and encouraging remarks on both Mexican and Chinese trade negotiations  US market inflation expectations have rebounded from their lowest levels since January while US 10Y treasury yields have moved above 2 10  again  USD FX moved modestly lower overnight while both oil and gold are little changed 
At the  Fed Listens  conference  Fed Chair Powell showed a willingness to cut interest rates  He initiated his opening speech with an odd one out paragraph on the current policy situation  on which he stated the Fed  will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion  amid  trade negotiations and other matters   In our view  this supports our call for a rate cut signal at the June FOMC meeting and a subsequent rate cut at the July or September meeting  see here 
The big question now is whether the ECB will also make a new dovish turn tomorrow  In that respect  remember the ECB is already on an  easing bias  but inflation markets are clearly doubting the ECB s ability to react  This was illustrated yesterday following Euro area inflation that came in on the low side with 5y5y Euro area inflation expectations dropping close to a historical low  see chart  For more  see our ECB cheat sheet here and our ECB preview here 
FX reserves data in Denmark published yesterday showed that Danmarks Nationalbank  DN  opted to see through the rise in EUR DKK to the highest level this year  In our view  it signals patience from DN with respect to the weak DKK 
Scandi markets

In Denmark  polls indicate there will be a change of government after the general election today  but regardless of the result  we do not expect any market reaction  There is broad agreement on the overall framework for economic policy  and neither Denmark s EU membership nor staying out of the euro are at stake  Exit polls will be out shortly after 20 00 CEST  and a reliable result is expected around 23 00 CEST  Note also that the Danish market is closed today  Constitution Day  
In Norway  May Real Estate Norway house prices are set to be published  After rising since November  housing prices levelled off in April  The market seems well balanced and as interest rates have risen  prices are unlikely to move much more strongly than wages  We expect roughly stable prices in May  although the OBOS figures published last week imply some upside risk 

Fixed income markets
Today  for the first time we have Finland tapping the RFGB 06 29 10Y benchmark bond for EUR1bn  Given the current  hunt for yield  in the EGB market  we expect a strong auction  Finland will have fulfilled EUR5bn of its EUR9bn issuance target after the auction The new Finnish government yesterday announced a EUR4bn stimulus plan  Despite the government saying the plan would be funded by tax hikes and the sale of state assets  the new plan has likely postponed Finland s potential return to the triple A camp of the rating agencies 
ESFS will also be in the market tapping up to EUR1 0bn in the 01 23 bond 
Norges Bank will also be in the market tapping the NGB  21 bond  NGB spreads vs Germany have tightened and NGB asw spreads have widened this week  We still hold the view that Norges Bank will hike rates on 20 June despite the drop in global yields  We also hold a positive view on the NOK  For more see Fixed Income Research   Norges Bank to sell NOK2bn in NGB NST474  3 75    21  4 June 
FX markets
Two days of hints from Fed officials that policy easing might be warranted has started to weigh on the broad USD  In our view  the Fed has started to blink and the market will discuss using the signal to reverse long USD positions  as the Fed could choose to cut rates in H2  including repricing EUR USD higher  
Near term  a bit more might be warranted from the Fed for risk sentiment to turn more sustainably  We still have some lingering doubts as to the credibility of rates actually being cut enough to move the global macro in a positive direction  In markets  this is seen in inflation expectations and a still more muted reaction from credit and commodities  particularly versus equities   We expect USD JPY to continue lower until a more pronounced movement in inflation expectations and its corresponding drivers is seen 
For the Scandies  both the SEK and NOK continue to trade on the external environment  with little reaction on domestic data releases  In light of the recent Fed policy signals  we have decided to take profit on both our long USD SEK and USD NOK positions  see here ",2019-06-05,Danske Markets,https://www.investing.com/analysis/feds-powell-opens-door-for-further-rate-cuts-200428513,200428513
182900,404416,ADP,Payrolls Expected To Rise At Slower Pace,opinion,"Investors turn their attention to the U S  jobs market today  The official payrolls report  will be released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics  BLS  
Heading into the event  the median estimates point to the fact that the U S  economy added jobs at a slower pace 
The economy is forecast to add 181 000 jobs in April while the unemployment rate is forecast to hold steady at 3 8   The U S  unemployment rate which is at a multi decade low has held steady at 3 8  for the last two months 
Wages  which were weak in the previous month are forecast to rise by 0 3  in April  This marks a strong increase after wages rose just 0 1  on the month in March Despite the somewhat downbeat forecasts  the labor market in the US is still chugging along at a strong pace  The economy has been adding jobs for 101 months so far  marking the longest stretch of job gains in U S  history  As a result  investors are starting to grow cautious amid signs that the labor market might have reached its potential 
U  S Payrolls LandscapeIn February  the number of job openings fell by 538 000  The weakness was a surprise and was seen by many to be an outlier to the strong labor market  In March  the payrolls rose 196 000 while the unemployment rate held steady at 3 8  US Nonfarm payrolls  March 2019  196k 
Wage growth was seen rising at a pace of 3 2  on a year over year basis  This was a weak pace of wage growth since October 2018  The data was potentially underlining the fact that growth in wages might have fallen  This comes in contrast to the fact that employers are seeking higher skilled workers and there s an apparent shortage of them U S  Average Hourly Earnings m m
The rebound in the payrolls report for March proved that the sharp decline in February was a temporary hiccup 
The labor market landscape is one that has been improving at a steady pace  It remains one of the cornerstones of the US economic growth story In recent times  data shows that employment is decelerating although jobless claims continue to hit historical lows  This suggests that the labor market still has room to absorb further slack in the economy 
The participation rate fell to 63 0  from 63 2  previously in February  There were also declines in jobs in the manufacturing sector  something which investors will be keenly looking at in today s report  This comes as April s ISM PMI fell to 52 8 in April  down from 55 0 in March  The decline in manufacturing activity was broad based  New orders fell while production also declines 
The markets remain cautious on subtle signals that the economy could lose the momentum 
ADP Private Payrolls Rise in April
The latest ADP payrolls report for April showed that private employers added 275k jobs in April  This beat estimates of 181k  The numbers for March were also revised higher from 129k to 151k 
While the private payroll figures show a higher estimate  it did come with a word of caution  Moody s analytics chief economist cautioned that the gains came mostly from the service sector 
According to the latest payroll report  ADP  NASDAQ ADP  said that significant job losses were seen in the natural resources and mining sectors  Moody s chief economist  however  said that official payrolls report could be closer to the 175 000   200 000 mark  in line with the median estimates 
ADP s figures came ahead of the Fed meeting later in the day  The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged at 2 50   The meeting was underway as President Trump tweeted that the central bank should cut interest rates by as much as 1   The central bank maintained a neutral tone in its forward guidance while acknowledging that inflation was weak 
In today s payrolls report  we expect the payroll figures to come closely in line with the median estimates  Focus will shift to the average hourly earnings performance in April ",2019-05-03,ORBEX,https://www.investing.com/analysis/payrolls-expected-to-rise-at-slower-pace-200416491,200416491

182905,404421,ADP,ADP  ADP  Upgraded To Buy  Here s What You Should Know,opinion,"Investors might want to bet on Automatic Data Processing  ADP  NASDAQ ADP    as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   This rating change essentially reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates    one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices 
A company s changing earnings picture is at the core of the Zacks rating  The system tracks the Zacks Consensus Estimate    the consensus measure of EPS estimates from the sell side analysts covering the stock    for the current and following years 
The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors  since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time 
As such  the Zacks rating upgrade for ADP is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  has proven to be strongly correlated with the near term price movement of its stock  That s partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock 
For ADP  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company s underlying business  And investors  appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
As empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for ADP
For the fiscal year ending June      2019  this payroll and human resources company is expected to earn  5 42 per share  which is a change of 24 6  from the year ago reported number 
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for ADP  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 1  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term 
You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here    
The upgrade of ADP to a Zacks Rank  2 positions it in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions  implying that the stock might move higher in the near term ",2019-05-13,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/adp-adp-upgraded-to-buy-heres-what-you-should-know-200421279,200421279

The Chinese responded to the latest salvo from Trump by stating that   China will take all necessary measures to protect its firms   The line initially sent equities lower by 0 4  in Asia but buyers returned to the fold through early European trade with indices paring losses down to 0 1

182924,404440,ADP,U S  NFP Special  Historical Patterns,opinion,"The US is set to release the change in the number of people employed during the month of April  in what should be seen as yet another critical piece of information about the US economy 
The US is set to release the change in the number of people employed during April  in what should be seen as yet another critical piece of information about the US economy  What s interesting about today s set of numbers is that after the volatile range observed from Jan  to March  primarily due to the US government shutdown  the data should start to normalize again  so whatever number comes out today  should give us a more accurate picture of the state of affairs in the US labor market 
It s worth noting that the US jobs market has unquestionably reached levels considered to be at full capacity  with little to no slack to account for  It s not that workers are not in demand by employers  but the real issue  whenever an economy reaches full capacity utilization of its labor force  is to find the qualified employees due to constrained supply  which paradoxically  tends to pose an increase in downside risk in the headline number  today expected at 175 180k 
What this means is  rather than taking at face value the breakdown of the US jobs number and the unemployment rate  the debate has been gradually shifting towards whether or not employers are forced to increase the average hourly wages paid in order to attract the shortage of qualified labor force  Therefore  the reaction in the USD comes as a function of not simply fixated on the breakdown of the change in the labor force  but it must come accompanied with an encouraging pick up in earnings too 
Let s now deconstruct the event  category by category  before coming up with some conclusions that could help prepare for the volatile event 
Historical Data  Any Patterns Worth Taking Notice 
As the chart below indicates  the average of 175 180k expected is very much in line with the projections from the last 12 months  where the 200k threshold appears to be the clear psychological ceiling  Looking at the recent historical patterns  a few insights are revealed  The first noticeable development is that the US employment change has broken above the 200k mark 6 times out of the last 12 months  in other words  in 50  of the events  the US NFP not only beat estimates but it also printed a strong number 

Source  forexfactory com
In 3 occasions in the last 12 months  the headline number made it into the 300k  in Dec 2018 and Jan 2019 the most recent occurrences  However  not all is rosy on the change of employment front  as in the other 6 months  the data underwhelmed  with last February s paltry print of just 30k  due to the US government shutdown disruption  weighting  What s interesting  with the exception of February s outlier  is that whenever a beat occurs  it far exceeds the misses  which should be an important data point to reflect on 
Even if by the law of averages  if only based on the last 12 months  it suggests that today s number is going to be the toss of a coin  the magnitude of the beat in the change of employment tends to be far greater  which makes perfect sense as it s no secret that the US economy has been growing at a very steady pace for years now  far outpacing the RoW  rest of the world   which implies the downside risk in the USD is more contained vs the upside potential on a beat  if only based on this category alone 
Looking at seasonals  April tends to be a month that offers no clear insights on the possible outcome  judging by the data sets compiled from the last 5 years  with the number coming above estimates 2 times  below estimates another 2 times while another time came in line with expectations 
What about the average earnings  Can we obtain some insights by analyzing the latest set of numbers  If in the case of the change in employment the number to use as a reference is clearly the 200k handle  when extrapolated to the average earnings growth on a monthly basis  0 3  is clearly the ceiling to use as a reference  What s encouraging about the trajectory of the US economy is the fact that in 2 out of the last 4 releases  or 4 out of the last 8  that level was either matched  1 time  or surpassed  in 3 occasions  

Source  forexfactory comWhat s a bit more disheartening  is that in the last 3 releases  in 2 of them the average earnings missed estimates by a deviation of 0 2   Even if we were to remove these 2 months of bad misses out of the equation  the picture remains pretty even with no clear patterns arising when accounting for the numbers from 2018 and these first 3 months  Also  when it comes to the month of April  it s a rather weak month in terms of seasonals  with 3 misses and 2 in line prints in the last 5 years 
An important input to consider for today s wage growth data is the positive rhetoric out of the last Beige Book report  where it was highlighted that  many districts reported that firms have offered perks such as bonuses and expanded benefits packages in order to attract and retain employees   In my view  this can tilt the risk to the upside for a potential in line or above consensus read  while it acts as a reassurance that a bad miss like last month should be avoided 
The chart where I will spend the least time is on the unemployment rate  which is expected to remain at historically low levels  50y low to be more precise  with expectations calling for 3 8   Some economists are expecting a return back to the 3 7  print seen last Sept and Nov of 2018  which if the case  would be the icing on the cake to prop up the USD if the rest of data points agree 
However  with the labor market so tight  one could expect a potential marginal increase in the participation rate  which would make the reduction in the employment rate more challenging  On the contrary  the increase in people coming out of the labor force due to retirement is a trend on the increase  which means a lower participation rate is a risk this year based on demographics  if that outweighs new job seekers actively looking for a job  the jobless rate may keep decreasing

Average USD Movement Based On Historical Data
Each US NFP data release tends to be reflected in the EUR USD chart by a price volatility of about 30 pips on average in the first 15 minutes before a range extension worth over 80 pips on average if the data points show a clear bear or miss  as illustrated in the historical data below  courtesy of FXStreet  One can dive deeper into each individual event and the market response by visiting fasteconomicnewscom 

What s interesting is that in the last 12 months  a pattern emerges which reinforces the rationale to play this even  From my observations in the EUR USD chart via fasteconomicnews com   which could well be extrapolated into other USD pairs  since the EUR USD is a reflection of the DXY  USD index   judging by each price movement immediately after the data release  algos tend to pick up on the headline number first as long as the earnings change doesn t miss badly by more than 0 1bp deviation  If it s a beat on expectations in the change of employment without less than a 0 1bp miss in salary growth  the average reaction is for the USD to spike on average 20 30 pip 
However  a follow through continuation is conditioned to the average hourly wages also coming at or above expectations  If the salary inflation underwhelms  the strategy seems to be a reversion back to the origin of the USD demand area  This can also be observed the other way around  if US NFP misses yet the salary inflation doesn t surprise strongly to the upside by more than 0 1bp deviation from the 0 3  threshold on a m m  the initial fall in the USD is subject to also a miss in the earnings figure 
See last month s price activity as an example  A spike in the EUR USD worth about 20 pips after the US NFP number beat estimates by a narrow margin of 15k but the salary growth stood at just 0 1   hence  the market took notice of the latter to initiate the first move before fading it

Trend for the last 12 months in the US NFP  No particular insights obtained 
Outcomes in the last 12 months in the US NFP  Mixed bag with 6 positive and 6 negatives 
Deviations last 12 months in the US NFP  Risk skewed towards a larger positive deviation 
Seasonals in the last 5 years in the US NFP  No particular insights obtained 
Trend for the last 12 months in the US salary growth  No particular insights obtained 
Outcomes in the last 12 months in the US salary growth  Unclear withan even number of beats and misses 
Deviations last 12 months in the US salary growth  Risk evenly balanced due to the poor deviations in 2019  which has distorted an otherwise encouraging average 
Seasonals in the last 5 years in the US salary growth Slightly weak month but far from conclusive  3 vs 2  
Based on the most recent historical data gathered  the saying that the US NFP number is a  lottery  should hold true based on the analysis of data trends in recent times  However  by diving deeper  the risk appears to be skewed towards a potential larger USD move if the US NFP beats expectations vs if it s a miss  This thesis is conditioned to not having a bad miss beyond 0 1bp negative deviation in the US wage growth m m  One should consider this week s blowout in the ADP  NASDAQ ADP  employment report as an event that may create further upside risks in the headline number via the services sector  The jobless rate is the data point that is set to influence the immediate algo led reaction the least given the clear downtrend established ever since the GFC  However  a reduction towards the 3 7  mark should be  subject to the heavy weights agreeing  the icing on the cake to reinforce a USD bullish move  The opposite is true if US NFP and or wage growth misses badly and the US jobless rate surprisingly increases even if marginally 
FX Majors  Key Levels To Watch Post US NFP

The momentum on the EUR USD heading into the event is clearly negative as the micro slope of the 25HMA reflects  which is further underpinned by a bearish structure of lower lows and lower highs  which so far has achieved two drives lower  hence  we are theoretically still missing one  Even the extension of this 2nd drive down doesn t seem to be complete yet  with a 100  proj target of 1 1155 eyed  as long as sellers can muster further momentum through the horizontal support  Should a clear miss in the US employment numbers materialize  a major area of confluence to expect a strong cluster of offers can be found at 1 1220  ADR limit  resistance line   On the contrary  any major beat in today s number may see sellers looking to exploit the momentum for an ultimate target of 1 1120 or thereabouts where a major confluence is found 

When it comes to the Sterling  the next 100  proj target aligns perfectly with the 1 30 round number  which is always going to be an area rich in liquidity  Any major beat in the US NFP data series and we could even expect the ADR limit at 1 2975 80 to be tested  On the upside  there are up to three levels that will act as resistances around 1 3080  1 31 and 1 3115 20  Technically  despite an environment of a rather constructive USD across the board  the GBP should still draw significant buying interest on any overstretched move lower as the bullish structure remains firmly in place and far from being negated following the mega move from the lows on Tuesday 

It s been a very choppy affair trading the USD JPY this week  which  fortunately  may soon be over if there is enough of a stimulant for price activity to beak in either direction  For now  the lines of battles have been clearly defined post US NFP  with 111 65 70 the first resistance to watch  H4 resistance level   ahead of 111 80  ADR limit  and 111 90  hourly resistance   To the downside  an area rich in liquidity is going to be between 111 00 and 111 10  where the ADR limit  hourly support  and the round number meet 

Last but not least  the AUD USD is heading into the US NFP with a strong negative bias  having reached an intraday 100  proj target sub 0 70c a few minutes ago  A beat in the US NFP will have serious technical ramifications in the Aussie from a macro perspective  as the currency is now staring into an abyss below the massive 0 70 round number  This means that technically speaking  there would be a void area to exploit until faced with 0 6960 65  which would be the 200  intraday proj target and ADR limit  On the way up  a miss in the US NFP exposes a retest of resistance at 0 7030 35  ADR limit   with 0 70 easily taken out one thinks given the proximity at present time ",2019-05-02,Ivan Delgado,https://www.investing.com/analysis/us-nfp-special-analysis-of-historical-patterns-200416303,200416303
182938,404454,ADP,Automatic Data Processing  ADP  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Automatic Data Processing  ADP  NASDAQ ADP   reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on May 1  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This payroll and human resources company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 69 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  11 2  
Revenues are expected to be  3 90 billion  up 5 7  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for ADP 
For ADP  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 42  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination indicates that ADP will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that ADP would post earnings of  1 18 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 34  delivering a surprise of  13 56  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
ADP appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/automatic-data-processing-adp-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200410139,200410139

182942,404458,ADP,Private Sector Adds A Staggering Number Of Jobs,opinion,Taking a break from the deluge of continued Q1 earnings reports  this morning we see a new monthly private sector payroll release from Automatic Data Processing   NASDAQ ADP    which once again blew the doors off expectations  275K non government jobs were created in the month of April  This is way up from the 177K expected  and the upwardly revised March read of 151K Apparently  to paraphrase Mark Twain   reports of the death of the U S  labor market are greatly exaggerated   Though economists had been expecting that job growth would dwindle in the face of such a tight labor market and a wearing off of the corporate tax cut stimulus from last year  275K new private sector jobs last month would point to a different outcome The breakdown was much the same as it has been over the past few years  Services brought 223K of the total amount of new jobs  and Goods had 52K  a good number at this stage of the domestic economy   Medium sized companies   between 50 499 employees   gained the most in April  145K  Small businesses hired 77K new employees  while large corporations brought 53K fresh hires By industry  the results were also more or less typical  Education Healthcare led the way with 54K new jobs  and Construction continued its multi year resurgence with 49K spots filled  Leisure Hospitality staged a big rebound last month with 53K hires  following lower than expected results in monthly jobs over the past quarter or so  Trade Transportation also saw a robust 37K new hires  and Manufacturing reached 5K Currently  the non farm payroll estimate for Friday morning s Employment Situation from the Bureau of Labor Statistics  BLS  is for 190K new jobs from last month  This is right around what we see most months   an estimate somewhere between 170 200K   though the actual numbers have been wildly unpredictable for much of 2019 so far  January saw gains of 312K news jobs  followed by just 33K in February  March was closer to  trend  at 196K What s more  the direction for these numbers has sometimes been predicted by the ADP private jobs figure earlier in the week  but sometimes not  Thus  while it may be tempting for analysts to bump up their expectations for Friday s BLS numbers  it s tough to tell by today s report what those numbers might be  The Unemployment Rate  by contrast  has stayed consistent over the past two months  at 3 8  ,2019-04-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/private-sector-adds-a-staggering-number-of-jobs-200413730,200413730

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 4 73   A quarter ago  it was expected that this payroll and human resources company would post earnings of  1 18 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 34  delivering a surprise of 13 56  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
ADP  which belongs to the Zacks Outsourcing industry  posted revenues of  3 85 billion for the quarter ended March 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1 42   This compares to year ago revenues of  3 69 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters

Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for ADP was favorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

182957,404473,ADP,ADP Or BR  Which Outsourcing Player Is A Better Stock To Buy ,opinion,Outsourcing is the practice of transferring control of certain operations  services or processes  previously done by a company s internal staff or resources  to a third party While increasing demand for technology expertise  efficiency and cost reduction has kept outsourcing industry s revenues in good shape  rising talent costs due to competition coupled with Trump s stringent policies on immigration could curb the industry s growth  Notably  the industry is labor intensive and heavily dependent on foreign talent The Zacks  industry is a group within the broader Zacks  sector  The group s   which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks  indicates solid growth prospects in the near term  It carries a Zacks Industry Rank  84  which places it in the top 33  of more than 250 Zacks industries Given this backdrop  it is not a bad idea to undertake a comparative analysis of two outsourcing service providers   Automatic Data Processing  Inc    NASDAQ ADP   and Broadridge Financial Solutions Inc    NYSE BR    While Automatic Data Processing has a market capitalization of  69 56 billion  Broadridge s market cap is  12 64 billion Zacks Rank   Style ScoreCurrently  both the stocks carry a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  However  with a  of B  Broadridge has an edge over ADP in terms of investment attractiveness  ADP has a VGM Score of C  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2 offer the best investment opportunities for investors Price PerformanceADP clearly scores over Broadridge in terms of price performance  So far this year  shares of ADP have gained 22 4   outperforming the 14 7  rise of Zacks S P 500 Composite  Broadridge has returned 13 8  in the same time frame  Earnings ExpectationsEarnings growth along with stock price gains is often an indication of a company s strong prospects ADP s current year earnings are projected to grow 23 5  compared with 10 3  for Broadridge   For 2020  ADP s earnings are expected to register 11 7  growth compared with 10  for Broadridge Thus  ADP has an edge over Broadridge in terms of yearly projected earnings growth Earnings Surprise HistoryThe earnings surprise history of a stock helps investors have an idea of the stock s performance in the previous quarters ADP has an impressive earning surprise history  with earnings surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the previous four quarters  Broadridge has a decent earnings surprise history  having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the previous four quarters Overall  ADP delivered a higher average positive earnings surprise of 7 6  compared with 4 3  for Broadridge Net MarginNet profit margin helps investors evaluate a company s business model in terms of pricing policy  cost structure and operating efficiency  and shows how good it is at converting revenues into profits  Hence  a strong net profit margin is preferred by all classes of investors ADP s TTM net margin of 11 6  is on par with the Zacks S P 500 Composite  It has a lead over Broadridge s 10 2  TTM net margin

Zacks S P 500 Composite is 17 1 Although both the companies compare unfavorably with the benchmark index  Broadridge has a lower P E   F12M value than ADP Bottom LineOur comparative analysis shows that ADP scores over Broadridge in terms of price performance  yearly projected earnings growth  earnings surprise history and net margin  Broadridge has an edge over ADP in terms of style score Although faster share price rally year to date has led to a rich valuation for both stocks compared with the benchmark index  Broadridge is cheaper than ADP Other Stocks to ConsiderA few other top

182981,404497,ADP,Russia Expands Gold Position In February,opinion,"After Russia expanded its gold position by a record amount of more than 274 tons in 2018  the country appears to continue that trend in 2019 with 31 tonnes of gold purchases in February 
Dollars For Gold The trend and the ways in which Russia  among others  continues to expand its gold reserves is remarkable  One of these ways is that Russia uses dollar bonds to purchase gold  This could be interpreted as Russia s central bank anticipating on a possible dollar crisis and acting accordingly 
Farfetched ScenarioAnd it isn t a strange thing to think about converting our dollar into gold  The economic sentiment in the United States is showing cracks  There are a number of indicators that we at GoldRepublic could show to prove this scenario isn t all that crazy 
1  Fed President Powell says the US economy will slow down 2  The number of jobless claims in the US rose to its highest level in 10 months  3  ADP  NASDAQ ADP  showed the lowest number of new jobs in the US in the last 18 months  4  Carsales are slowing down significantly and had their worst quarter since Q4  2014  5  Retailers are again having a particularly rough time and the number of job layoffs in the US is increasing 
Interest Rates QT And QEWith a low interest rate and the promise of the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates only once in 2020 and to stop Quantitative Tightening  QT   some analysts are even speculating that we might be seeing a new round of Quantitative Easing  QE

The US and China may announce as early as today when the two presidents will meet to ostensibly sign a trade deal  while House of Commons effort to block a no deal exit goes to the House of Lords today  India cut interest rates by 25 bp  the second consecutive cut  German factory orders slumped 4 2  in February  the most in two years  Equities were mixed in Asia  and the Dow Jones Stoxx 600 is snapping a four day advance  US shares are trading softer  and the S P 500 has a five day rally in tow  reaching new six month highs yesterday  Bond yields are mostly softer  though Australia and New Zealand were outliers in the Asia Pacific  and Italy is an exception in Europe  Yesterday the 10 year Bund yield rose above zero for the first time in a week  but after the factory orders disappointed is back in negative territory  The dollar is little changed  though generally firmer  Late in the European morning  most of the major currencies are     0 15  from yesterday s US close 
Asia Pacific
China and the US may announce a meeting for Xi and Trump to meet and sign a new agreement  In fact  if an announcement is not made today  the disappointment may way on the capital markets   According to reports  China will have until 2025 to meet the commitment to commodity purchases and allow US businesses to own wholly owned subsidiaries in China  The US is pushing to front load commodity purchases with benchmark objectives for 90 and 180 days  There are said to be some other non binding promises to be delivered by 2029  but there is no threat of retaliation if the goals are not met  until the 2025 deadline  for which the US retains the right for proportionate tariff action  China has been reluctant to agree not to retaliate but seems to be taking it under advisement  Reports  The pending agreement seems to do two things  First  get it done before the US sells fighter jets to Taiwan  Second  shape the timeframe to be most useful to the next president  apparently on ideas that Trump will be re elected 
There are three issues that we cite now that we will write about in more detail later  First  the commodity purchases sound good for US farmers and the energy producers  However  this is low value added sectors and seems to do little for US manufacturers  China gets secures soy and energy inputs  Second  the US is setting a dangerous precedent by seeking a sphere of influence in China  It is not seeking a lifting of barriers to trade for everyone  allowing the US to compete on a level playing field  which had previously been its thrust  Just as the Belt Road Initiative is in some ways reminiscent of earlier expansions by the European powers and the US  the shift back to spheres of influence is a retreat from the Open Door  a mainstay of US foreign economic policy since the start of the 20th century  and globalized in the post WWII institutions  like GATT  WTO   World Bank and IMF  Third  the US devalued the dollar  by getting Europe  Germany  and Japan to revalue their currencies  the 1960s through 1980s   but America s fear of a devaluation of the yuan is so great that it does not seem to realize that yuan stability is a double edged sword  It will make it more difficult for the US to seek a weaker dollar against the yuan  Promising a stable yuan allows China to erode any advantage of a weaker dollar 
India cut its repo and reserve repo rates 25 bp to 6 0  and 5 75  respectively  It kept the cash reserve rate at 4 0   It is the first back to back cut since the monetary policy committee was launched in 2016  While headline inflation is below the RBI s Q1 forecast of 2 8  and below the 4  target  the core rate is at 5   Indian banks have not fully passed along the first rate cut  but many see the rate cut as political motivated ahead of the month long election that begins next week  Still  many look for another cut toward the end of Q2 
For the third session  the dollar is trapped in extremely narrow ranges against the yen  On Tuesday  the range was 21 ticks  yesterday 37  and so far today  18  The dollar is hovering near the JPY111 50 level  where options for almost  970 mln are struck that will be cut today  For the fourth session  the Australian dollar has met a wall of sellers near  0 7130  Australian stocks and bonds are underperformed today  but the Aussie remains resilient and is holding on to most of the gains since testing the  0 7050 area over the past two sessions  There is an option for A 1 6 bln struck at  0 7100 that expires tomorrow  
Europe
By a single vote  the House of Commons blocked a no deal exit  The bill now goes before the House of Lords  which is a touch ironic  given the UK criticism of the being at the mercy of the non elected European Commission  If a no deal exit is effectively blocked by required May to seek another extension  then the Withdrawal Bill may find more support  if it can be brought up again  The stark choice would be to accept it or accept the possibility of no exit  Meanwhile  the idea of seeking the public s approval on any resolutions via a referendum  confirmation referendum  appears to be gaining ground  While May and Corbyn have held talks  which are said to be constructive  the failure to do so earlier  and even to create a cross party government after the 2017 election that the Tories lost its majority  maybe strategic mistakes of a poorly played hand 
German s February factory orders were dreadful  The 4 2  fall on the month is in stark contrast to the median forecast in the Bloomberg survey for a 0 3  gain  The year over year drop of 8 4  is the most sine 2009  Export orders dropped 6  and were the source of the disappointment  Tomorrow  German publishes February industrial production  After falling by 0 8  in January  industrial output is expected to have risen by 0 5   but after today s report  the risk is clearly on the downside  Adding to the poor news stream was slash to this year s growth forecast by the leading five economic institutes in Germany to 0 8   half of its previous forecast 
US Vice President Pence seemed to give Turkey an ultimatum  though it is still not clear if it is really a policy announcement  Pence said Turkey had a choice of remaining in NATO or risking its security by going with the Russian defense system that is designed to shoot down NATO planes  The Turkish lira is lower for the third consecutive session and has fallen in six of the past seven sessions 
The euro is trading in less than a quarter cent range thus far today below  1 1250  where a 1 3 bln euro option is struck that expires today  There is also a roughly 515 mln euro options at  1 12 that will also be cut  Sterling is also trading near several expiring options between  1 3175 and  1 3195 today for GBP580 mln  The intraday technicals suggest both currencies may find a bid in the North American morning

The global capital markets are subdued despite several macro developments  Yesterday s ADP private sector jobs estimate disappointed with its 129k increase in March  However  the February series was revised slightly higher to 197k from 183k  Recall that the official estimate was 25k  It seems as if there may be a seasonal adjustment issue and the ADP  NASDAQ ADP  report did not seem to alter expectations much for tomorrow national report  Weekly initial jobless claims will be reported today for the end of March  They continue to hover a little above 200k

Positive Data Bullish For NIKKEI
Japanese retail sales and housing starts increased in February  Will the NIKKEI continue rising 
Recent Japanese economic data were positive on balance  while the Tankan index for big manufacturers sentiment softened in the first quarter 2019 from the previous three month period  retail sales inched up 0 2  over month in February after 2 3  decline in January  and housing starts rose 4 1  from 1 1  over year in February  And while services sector expansion slowed a bit in March as Nikkei Services PMI ticked to 52 from 52 3 in February  the manufacturing sector contraction slowed  Most of the decline was due to weaker foreign sales to China and Taiwan  But international trade prospects have been improving lately with China s Vice Premier Liu He arriving in Washington on Tuesday for a continuation of high level talks held last week in Beijing after U S  Chamber of Commerce executive s comment  ninety percent of the deal is done  but the last 10  is the hardest part  about talks  progress so far  Positive data are bullish for NIKKEI 

On the daily time frame the Nikkei  D1 is rising after hitting 19 month low in the end of December  The price has risen above the resistance line  this is bullish 


The Parabolic indicator gives a buy signal 


The Donchian channel indicates uptrend  it is widening up 


The MACD indicator gives a bullish signal  it is above the signal line and the gap is widening 


The Stochastic oscillator is in the overbought zone but is set to decline 


We believe the bullish momentum will continue after the price closes above the upper boundary of Donchian channel at 21834 2  This level can be used as an entry point for placing a pending order to buy  The stop loss can be placed below the fractal low at 20870 8  After placing the order  the stop loss is to be moved every day to the next fractal low  following Parabolic signals  Thus  we are changing the expected profit loss ratio to the breakeven point  If the price meets the stop loss level  20870 8  without reaching the order  21834 2   we recommend cancelling the order  the market has undergone internal changes which were not taken into account

182999,404515,ADP,Why The Earnings Surprise Streak Could Continue For ADP  ADP ,opinion,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well positioned to maintain its earnings beat streak in its upcoming report  It is worth considering Automatic Data Processing  ADP  NASDAQ ADP    which belongs to the Zacks Outsourcing industry 
This payroll and human resources company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 11 33  
For the last reported quarter  ADP came out with earnings of  1 34 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 18 per share  representing a surprise of 13 56   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  1 10 per share and it actually produced earnings of  1 20 per share  delivering a surprise of 9 09  
Price and EPS Surprise

For ADP  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
ADP has an Earnings ESP of  1 42  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  2  Buy   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on May 1  2019 
With the Earnings ESP metric  it s important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power  however  a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss

183004,404520,ADP,Watch Out For The US Nonfarm Payrolls,opinion,"We will focus on the U S  employment report for March today  The US Nonfarm Payrolls will be released at 12 30 p m   GMT  
Why Is This Important 
The Nonfarm Payrolls track the change in the number of people employed by the US in manufacturing  construction and goods companies  It does not include the farming industry employment  The US Jobs Report is an important determinant of a Fed rate hike in the upcoming decisions 
Last Wednesday  the ADP  NASDAQ ADP  report showed the US private sector added 129K jobs during March  missing expectations and down from February s 197K jobs 
The forecast is that the economy added 175K jobs in March after rising 20K the previous month  Average hourly earnings are expected to rise 0 2  for the month  bringing the year over year gain in earnings to 3 4   Policymakers are watching the annualized reading closely to gauge upward pressure on inflation  Released at the same time  traders will pay close attention to the unemployment rate which is expected to stay at 3 8  
Strong employment report will point to an improving US Economy and support the US dollar 
Technical Analysis EUR USD  Ahead of the US Jobs Report  the 1 1219 daily support level is critical for the EUR USD pair  As long as the pair stays above 1 1219 on a daily basis  we will watch 1 1285 as a resistance level  On the other hand  If the pair moves down below 1 1219  the next daily support level will be placed at 1 1103 

Support  1 1219   1 1103   1 0980
Resistance  1 1285   1 1355   1 1450

GBP USD  Sterling moved up versus the US Dollar in the Asian Session after the report showed that the European Council President Tusk is proposing to offer a 12 month Brexit extension to the UK  In the event that the GBP USD rise continues  we will see resistance levels at 1 3152 and 1 3217  In contrast  if the pair drops below the 1 3055 level  we will follow 1 2994 as a daily support level 

Support  1 3055   1 2994   1 2931
Resistance  1 3152   1 3217   1 3291

USD JPY  The USD JPY reached a three week high level in the Asian Session with expectations that a protracted trade dispute between the US and China would be resolved soon  We will focus on the key resistance level of 111 85  In order for the rise to gain more momentum  it needs to break out and stay above 111 85 on a four hourly basis  In this case  the daily resistance level will be placed in 112 36  Otherwise  the daily support level will be found in 111 18 again 

Support  111 18   110 35   109 57
Resistance  111 85   112 36   112 98

GOLD  The GOLD Price is under selling pressure  Ahead of the US Nonfarm Payrolls  the daily resistance level of 1291 is significant  As long as the yellow metal price stays below 1291  on a daily basis  the bearish action may continue and we will see 1278 as a support level  On the other hand  if the price rises above 1291  the next resistance level will be found at 1305 

Support  1278   1266   1251
Resistance  1291   1305   1316",2019-04-05,Emre Karaoglu,https://www.investing.com/analysis/watch-out-for-the-us-nonfarm-payrolls-200404141,200404141
183009,404525,ADP,Automatic Data Processing  ADP  Is Up 3 86  In One Week  What You Should Know,opinion,"Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock s recent trend in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will be essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   With this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving that way  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks  this can be very tough to define  There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance  The Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Automatic Data Processing  ADP  NASDAQ ADP    a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B  We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions  two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Automatic Data Processing currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
Let s discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for ADP that show why this payroll and human resources company shows promise as a solid momentum pick 
A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short term price activity  as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand  It s also helpful to compare a security to its industry  this can show investors the best companies in a particular area 
For ADP  shares are up 3 86  over the past week while the Zacks Outsourcing industry is up 3 14  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 6 59  compares favorably with the industry s 4 43  performance as well 
Considering longer term price metrics  like performance over the last three months or year  can be advantageous as well  Shares of Automatic Data Processing have increased 21 05  over the past quarter  and have gained 36 45  in the last year  On the other hand  the S P 500 has only moved 14 77  and 10 75   respectively 
Investors should also pay attention to ADP s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  ADP is currently averaging 1 882 238 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things  including estimate revisions and a stock s price movement  Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank  and a nice path here can be promising  We have recently been noticing this with ADP 
Over the past two months  1 earnings estimate moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost ADP s consensus estimate  increasing from  5 36 to  5 37 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  2 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Taking into account all of these elements  it should come as no surprise that ADP is a  2  Buy  stock with a Momentum Score of B  If you ve been searching for a fresh pick that s set to rise in the near term  make sure to keep Automatic Data Processing on your short list ",2019-04-07,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/automatic-data-processing-adp-is-up-386-in-one-week-what-you-should-know-200404820,200404820

183021,404537,ADP,A Cross Party Brexit Deal And A Trade Deal Drawing Closer ,opinion,"Market movers today 
In the UK  focus remains on Brexit after PM May s intervention yesterday evening  It would be positive for sentiment if May and Corbyn could find common ground but we still cannot rule out a no deal Brexit at this point  although we remain optimistic that the politicians want to go a long way to avoid that 
In Europe  retail sales in February are due out at 11 00 CEST  Given the weakness in Europe lately  it feels like every data release is important  Our base case is still that we should soon see improvement in Europe  In Norway  we get house price data 
In the US  we are looking forward to the release of the ISM non manufacturing index for March  which is a better indicator of GDP growth than ISM manufacturing  Based on the ISM indices  US growth was decent in Q1  ADP  NASDAQ ADP  employment is due out at 14 15 CEST  We also have plenty of Fed speakers today 
Selected market news 
Global growth optimism continued in the European equity markets  However  noteworthy the European bond market remained supported throughout the day as Brexit fears dominated before PM Theresa May s Brexit intervention in the evening  Overnight risk appetite got a new boost with media  FT  reports that the US and China are about to finalise a trade deal and as Brexit news removed fears of an imminent hard Brexit  Asian equities are higher and 10Y Treasury yields are back 2 5  
Yesterday  PM Theresa May said she wants to find common ground on Brexit with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn  which is quite unusual in the UK given the old two party system  A way forward could involve accepting a permanent customs union  something which Labour has advocated for a long time while May has objected  and the proposal was only three votes from reaching a majority in Monday s indicative vote   but it is definitely not without risk for May  as it may split her party in two  When analysing Brexit  it is important to remember that it is also about history   May probably would not want to be the prime minister getting the UK out of the EU without a deal  as it may have a long lasting damaging impact on the UK  economically and politically  May  if her words can be trusted  finally decided country was above party  The hard Brexiteers are clearly upset and may even vote against the government in a no confidence vote if May finalises Brexit with Corbyn  so any agreement would involve Corbyn accepting no snap election until after the withdrawal  Any plan must also be built on the Withdrawal Agreement  which will upset the supporting party  the DUP  The Brexiteers and the DUP also have some thinking to do  as Brexiteers have to support May s deal to avoid a softer Brexit and the DUP risks losing power after May reached out to Corbyn 
For now  we stick to our view that we are heading for a long extension to at least year end but we have to monitor the development over the next week  ahead of the EU summit on 10 April  May also said yesterday that she hoped the negotiations could be sorted out quickly  there is talk the government aims within the next three days  so the UK only needs the short extension to 22 May still  Overall  yesterday s development was positive  as it indicates the risk of a no deal Brexit remains low  but not negligible 
Scandi markets
In Norway  the housing market is still well balanced  which means we basically expect house prices to be essentially flat in March after a surprisingly strong start to the year  However  data from OBOS showed housing prices  n s a   rose 2  in March  implying a considerable upside risk to our estimate 
Fixed income markets
Today  all eyes will again be on the ongoing Brexit saga  The decision by PM Theresa May last night to hold cross party talks and ask the EU for an extension sets the agenda  Even though this will upset many Conservatives  it removes some of the imminent fears of a hard Brexit on 12 April  and together with the FT story that a US China deal is drawing closer might put Bunds under some pressure this morning  But as we said yesterday  we are unlikely to see a sustained Bund sell off as long as the Euro zone data remains weak  core inflation remains very low and the ECB remains very concerned dovish  The periphery should be able to perform given the improved risk appetite 
In Denmark  it is again time for taps in the 5Y and 10Y benchmark bonds  Danish fixed income remains supported by the drop in duration in the callable mortgage market and an expected jump in excess liquidity in the coming two weeks  Despite the recent performance  we see room for even tighter spreads vs Germany  For more see FI Strategy Denmark  1 April 2019 
FX markets
In our view  the remaining three quarter turns in EUR USD FX forwards are trading at fairto  cheap levels at the moment  For example  if year end basis widens to the past year s extreme levels  it would amount to an 8 14bp increase in the 1Y EUR USD FX forward   see FX Strategy EUR USD FX forwards  one down  three quarter turns to go  2 April 2019  In addition  we note that the market has found some comfort in recent US data  which has slowly started to push short term US rates higher and EUR USD lower  In that respect  the line up of Fed speakers today will be key to follow 
In the Scandies  EUR SEK tested 10 40 after solid PMI data for the manufacturing sector  but failed to break and is back in the 10 40 10 50 range  We expect to stay here ahead of next week s  11 April  inflation figures and expect no significant reaction on the PMI services data today 
For quite some time  house prices from Real Estate Norway have not been a market mover for the NOK  Meanwhile  with Monday s surprisingly strong OBOS data  we might be in for a change should the housing market continue to surprise to the topside  We are still pencilling in further upside in NOK SEK and downside in EUR NOK over the coming months 
EUR GBP moved to the lower end of the 0 85 0 87 range after PM Theresa May s statement yesterday evening  For now  we expect EUR GBP to stay above 0 85  but if the negotiations are successful and May and Corbyn can find common ground  we could soon see a move below 0 85  However  this is easier said than done  When a deal is agreed upon  we expect EUR GBP to move down to 0 83  In case of no deal Brexit  we expect a move towards parity  A long extension would also be slightly GBP positive and we could see EUR GBP trade in the 0 84 0 86 range ",2019-04-03,Danske Markets,https://www.investing.com/analysis/a-crossparty-brexit-deal-and-a-trade-deal-drawing-closer-200403403,200403403
183022,404538,ADP,EUR USD   Euro Improves On German Services PMI  Eurozone Retail Sales,opinion,"After a luckluster start to the week  EUR USD has posted gains on Tuesday  Currently  the pair is trading at 1 1246  up 0 37  on the day  On the release front  the focus is on the service sector  German and eurozone services PMIs indicated expansion and beat their estimates  Eurozone retail sales slowed to 0 4   but managed to beat the forecast of 0 2   In the U S   this week s employment data kicks off with ADP nonfarm payrolls  which is projected to tick up to 184 thousand  As well  the ISM Non Manufacturing PMI is expected to drop to 58 1 points 
After disappointing manufacturing PMIs in March  there was better news from services PMI reports  German and eurozone indicators came in at 55 4  and 53 3  respectively  This points to expansion  in contrast to the manufacturing PMIs  which are showing contraction  Investors are also concerned that the manufacturing PMIs have been falling for months  This is largely due to the global trade war  which continues to dampen manufacturing activity in Germany and the rest of the eurozone 
The U S  economy remains strong  but this week s key numbers have been anything but impressive  The weak durable goods orders data comes on the heels of soft retail sales numbers for March  Retail sales declined by 0 2   shy of the estimate of  0 3   Core retail sales declined by 0 4   a sharp drop from the 0 9  gain a month earlier  Both indicators posted a second decline in three months  which is bound to raise concerns about the strength of the economy  There are concerns that the economy could be slowing down   growth for the first quarter could be as low as 0 8  annualized  compared to 2 2  in the fourth quarter

S P 500 Futures   ES Short Sellers Are Toast

If you re bearish  you re not a happy camper  I know I was off by a week or two on my call of the Nikkei   S P comparison charts  but you know what  that s how the cookie crumbles 
I told the PitBull last week that the ES is  fed supercharged   and to forget the short call stuff  I also told him that 2880 2890 was on tap  I am not saying that some out of the blue headline won t come flying out that knocks the S P down  but after the algos digest it  it will just be more fuel for the upside  Let s face it traders  QE is back and that means new all time highs 
During Monday nights Globex session  the S P 500 futures  ESM19 CME  printed a high of 2873 75  a low of 2864 50  and opened Tuesday s regular trading hours at 2871 75 
The first move after the 8 30 CT bell was a quick dip down to 2869 25  followed by a bump up to 2871 00  After that  a sell program activated that helped pull the futures back down to 2865 75  but by 9 30 it had recovered back up to 2871 75 
After testing the RTH high  the ES set its sights on a new low  and at 10 15 traded down to 2862 25  From there  the futures again recovered  and within the hour had rallied back to 2871 00  For the rest of the morning  and into the afternoon  the ES traded sideways between 2871 00 and 2866 00 
Just after 2 00 CT the futures finally broke out of the range and slowly started to inch higher  It wasn t the kind of rally you buy into though  volume had not even broken 700k contracts at that point  and the MiM showed some early signs of a negative imbalance 
The ES hovered near the highs going into the close and printed 2873 00 on the 2 45 cash imbalance reveal  then 2871 50 on the 3 00 cash close  and ended the day on a weak note  trading down to 2867 25 on the 3 15 futures close  down  3 25  handles  or  0 11  
In the end  the overall tone of the ES was firm  In terms of the days overall trade  total volume was low  with only 857k futures contracts traded

Normally  after three strikes you are out  but PM May seems determined to ram through a deal so the UK can avoid taking part in EU parliamentary elections in May  May suffered a third defeat on her stripped down withdrawal agreement  The margin of defeat has steadily improved from a historic 230 votes to 149  and on Friday she lost by 58 votes  The third defeat raises bets that we will see a general election  complicating the UK s attempts to finalizing a divorce agreement with the EU  Monday s indicative votes may see a customs union be agreed upon in Parliament 
The base case is for UK to get a long extension and on Monday we will see lawmakers try to figure out options for a Plan B  The risks of a no deal exit or an election are growing and those options would likely be the most bearish for the British pound 

Australia
The Australia dollar volatility should pick up ahead of a busy week that will see a rate decision  the annual budget release and the announcement of elections  Expectations are high for the RBA to deliver a rate cut this year  especially after they witness their own yield curve inversion  Unlike the US  Australian 3 month 10 year yield curve inversions are more frequent and recent history shows six out of seven inversions saw rate cuts 
The release of the Australian budget is expected to snap a long streak of deficits  Economists expect a budget surplus of A 4 6 billion in the year through June 2020  the first since 1970  The last time Australia saw a surplus was right before the financial crisis in 2008 
Later in the week  expectations are high for elections to be called  something we have been seeing frequently in Australia  They have seen six prime ministers over the last 9 years  and current polls have Labor opposition s Bill Shorten in the lead 

Oil
West Texas Intermediate crude had a great quarter that saw price recapture the  60 00 a barrel level  the first time since early November  The recent rise stemmed from growing optimism on global growth and continued declines with US rigs  April optimism is high for US and China data to recover and that could be a key spark for the demand side argument for higher prices 
Regarding production cuts  OPEC   has been very effective in stabilizing prices and if we continue to hear supportive comments from Russia  prices could remain well supported  OPEC has punted the April Extraordinary meeting till after the US makes their decision on sanctions with Iran and Venezuela  If OPEC fails to deliver a year end extension  that could be straw that breaks this bullish rally s back 

S P 500 Best Quarter Since 2009
Stocks managed to still crush it this quarter  despite a yield inversion with the Fed s favorite spread and heightened economic growth concerns  The rally is mainly attributed to accommodative monetary policy stances globally  expectations for growth concerns to stabilize and optimism China and the US will make a trade deal 
This was a very long earnings season and the next season is about to kick off on April 11  Expectations are for a soft quarter  but we could be in for a bullish surprise if we see trade war concerns ease  Earnings growth for the S P 500 index fell 3 3  when compared to the same period from a year ago  Weakness is heavily priced in and we could see strong reactions if we do get some more optimistic outlooks 
Turkish Lira
Once the Turkish controls are relaxed  we still could see the lira collapse  Regardless of the local Turkish election outcomes  investors may be quick to hit the sell button if Turkey abandoning faith in Turkish investments  The restriction of allowing foreign investors to sell the lira could prove to be damning in the future 
The Turkish economy is very weak  falling into its first recession in a decade and with inflation three times above the bank s target range  If the elections see the public vote in line with the recent data  President Erdogan may lose control of some large cities and that could lead to calls for an early election  The next major election in Turkey is not for four years

The Canadian dollar ended last week with strong gains  as Canada s GDP posted a gain of 0 3  in January  This beat the estimate and came after two successive declines  which has raised concerns about the health of the Canadian economy  The slowdown in the fourth quarter has forced the BoC to turn more dovish and shelve any plans of hiking interest rates  There have even been calls for a rate cut from the bank  but the GDP gain in January will lessen the pressure on the BoC to stimulate the economy 
Positive data out of China this week has also boosted the fortunes of the Canadian dollar  Investor risk appetite has risen following a key manufacturing report that was better than expected  Chinese Caixin Manufacturing PMI improved to 50 8  easily beating the estimate of 50 1 points  Investors cheered as the indicator climbed to an 8 month high  after three successive readings in contraction territory  The Chinese economy has been hit hard by the trade war with the U S   and a piece of good news sparked strong gains on the equity markets and boosted the Canadian dollar

All eyes are will be on the Federal Reserve  which holds a policy meeting on Wednesday  The Fed is widely expected to maintain the benchmark rate at a range between 2 25   2 50 percent  Investors will be expecting the Fed to play a dovish tune in the March rate statement  The Fed s balance sheet will also be under scrutiny  with the policymakers expected to announce when they will stop reducing the  4 billion balance sheet  The Fed has been reducing assets by  50 billion a month  but there has been criticism that this tightening is choking economic growth  The Fed will also publish its new dot plot  which is used to convey its interest rate outlook 
The Bank of Canada held the benchmark rate at 1 75  at its last meeting  but the bank s stance has become more dovish in response to the economic downturn  which is deeper than policymakers estimated  The most recent rate statement noted that the economy could continue to require stimulus and said there was  increased uncertainty  regarding the timing of future rate hikes  If economic conditions remain soft  the BoC may have to consider a rate cut to stimulate growth  Weak oil prices and the global trade war have hurt the Canadian economy and dampened the critical export sector  and the Canadian dollar  which is down 1 2  in March  could face further headwinds

The Federal Reserve has been in dovish mode since January  but the pessimistic stance at the Wednesday policy meeting was a surprise  The Fed s rate outlook  dot plot   which is released each quarter  showed that a majority of FOMC members expect no rate hikes in 2019  This was in sharp contrast to the previous quarter s forecast  in which the FOMC projected two hikes this year 
The rate statement was markedly dovish  stating that economic activity  has slowed   Policy makers singled out slower growth in household spending and business investment and noted that inflation has decreased due to lower energy prices  The Fed also announced that it would stop reducing its balance sheet by  50 billion a month  This move is a loosening of policy and is intended to stimulate the economy  The new Fed forecast projects GDP growth of 2 1   down from 2 3  in December 
The Bank of Canada held the benchmark rate at 1 75  at its last meeting  but the bank s stance has become more dovish in response to the economic downturn  which is deeper than policymakers estimated  The most recent rate statement noted that the economy could continue to require stimulus and said there was  increased uncertainty  regarding the timing of future rate hikes  If economic conditions remain soft  the BoC may have to consider a rate cut to stimulate growth  Weak oil prices and the global trade war have hurt the Canadian economy and dampened the critical export sector  and the Canadian dollar  which is down 1 2  in March  could face further headwinds

183081,404597,ADP,Euro Tumbles As ECB Joins The Global Growth Concern Club,opinion,"Stocks are poised to have their worst trading week of the year as global growth concerns outweigh the recent wrath of dovishness from central banks  This morning the ECB s dovish message took the euro to the lowest levels against the dollar since June 2017 and was the main contributor to the broad risk off trading day 
NFP   Job growth may come back down to trend
ECB   Dovish policy measures shows things might be worse than feared
CAD   Expected to see minimal job gains
Oil   Tightness in market continues to outweigh U S  production concerns 
Gold  Unable to deliver strong rally on today s risk off trading 
NFP
Tomorrow s employment and wage report for the U S  could either support the view that both the labor market and wages remain strong or that we are finally seeing softness hit these metrics  The Fed has clearly signaled they are on hold for the foreseeable future and the financial markets are undecided on what will be the next move  a rate hike or cut 
Following last month s blockbuster report of 304 000 jobs created in January  expectations are for the February reading to show 180 000 jobs created  with a low estimate of 85 000 and a high forecast of 250 000  Investors however should not be surprised if we see a disappointing headline number and significant downward revision 
The Fed s Beige Book noted that employment growth is now  modest to moderate  and while economic activity for most regions expanding at a slight to moderate pace  expectations will likely grow for employers to ease up on hiring  This week s ADP  NASDAQ ADP  report showed private payrolls added 163 000 jobs  while the Challenger  Gray   Christmas report showed 76 835 job cuts in February  which was the highest total since July 2015  If we see softer wage data and a sub 100 000 nonfarm payroll headline  expectations will grow for the Fed s next move to be a rate cut  A strong beat could see the euro collapse towards 1 1050 
ECB
ECB s Draghi went into the toolbox and unleashed a handful of measures to help an ailing euro zone  Many expected a dovish policy meeting  but the extraordinary steps taken were more than what was priced in 
The ECB downgraded both their inflation and growth forecasts a little more than what most were expecting and the announcement of cheap loans to help trouble banks came perhaps one meeting before than what most expected  The financial markets already priced in no rate hikes for 2019 and the ECB finally pushed their guidance back for the December rate hike 
The Bank also noted they will keep reinvesting principal payments from maturing securities to assure favorable liquidity conditions  The ECB also will help allow counter parties control the amount of liquidity by operating with a fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment  To sum up  this was more dovish than what most economists expected and suggests the ECB thinks things are much worst than feared 

CAD
The political and economical headlines have been very concerning for Canada and many are curious to see if we will see that weakness trickle down to the labor market  January s employment report posted a robust 66 800 reading with an unemployment rate of 5 8   slightly above the 44 year low of 5 6   Current expectations for the February reading are for 1 200 jobs created and for the unemployment rate to remain steady  A soft employment number will support the Bank of Canada s dovish pivot and will further cement expectations for the next move to be a rate cut 

Oil
Crude prices are higher today on expectations tightness will be the story for the first half of the year  What is impressive about today s price action is that oil s rally is shrugging off the slower growth concerns that are hitting the other asset classes  Rising U S  production should eventually cap any major rally from here  but until we see U S  production consistently post bigger builds in stockpiles  prices might see less resistance to the upside

Surprisingly gold  has been unable to muster up a decent rally following today s risk off trading  The stimulus packaged revealed by the ECB did little to alleviate the risk off tone as markets remain focused on slower growth concerns  If we see softer wage and employment from the U S   that may be the catalyst to help the precious metal

183083,404599,ADP,Dollar and NFP jobs data,opinion,The dollar demand was getting muted towards the end of the trading week but reemerged on Thursday as the ECB dumped the euro and risk off sentiment intensified  The majors are making some recovery attempts ahead of the US NFP jobs report due later today  Considering a rather high correlation between the ADP  NASDAQ ADP  and NFP numbers  we could see solid results for February  The ADP employment report showed the economy added 183K jobs last month  marginally below the 189K expected  By the way  the January reading was revised strongly upwards to 300K from 213K originally reported   However  considering that the Fed policy makers have repeatedly indicated that the country s labor market is tight already  the focus will likely shift towards the wages data  So should the earnings numbers disappoint  the greenback could lose ground across the board after a strong start of the week  As for the EURUSD pair  dismal jobs and wages data may help the prices settle above the 1 12 level after yesterday s plunge to the low of 1 1175  But any potential rally will likely be short lived and limited due to the general euro weakness ,2019-03-08,Helen Rush,https://www.investing.com/analysis/dollar-and-nfp-jobs-data-200395993,200395993
183084,404600,ADP,ATTO Or ADP  Which Is The Better Value Stock Right Now ,opinion,"Investors interested in stocks from the Outsourcing sector have probably already heard of Atento  ATTO  and Automatic Data Processing  ADP  NASDAQ ADP    But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now  We ll need to take a closer look 
We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits 
Both Atento and Automatic Data Processing have a Zacks Rank of   2  Buy  right now  Investors should feel comfortable knowing that both of these stocks have an improving earnings outlook since the Zacks Rank favors companies that have witnessed positive analyst estimate revisions  But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in 
Value investors analyze a variety of traditional  tried and true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics  These include the long favored P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company s fair value 
ATTO currently has a forward P E ratio of 5  while ADP has a forward P E of 27 79  We also note that ATTO has a PEG ratio of 0 65  This popular figure is similar to the widely used P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also considers a company s expected EPS growth rate  ADP currently has a PEG ratio of 2 18 
Another notable valuation metric for ATTO is its P B ratio of 0 85  The P B is a method of comparing a stock s market value to its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  ADP has a P B of 13 65 
These metrics  and several others  help ATTO earn a Value grade of A  while ADP has been given a Value grade of C 
Both ATTO and ADP are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks  but based on these valuation figures  we feel that ATTO is the superior value option right now ",2019-03-10,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/atto-or-adp-which-is-the-better-value-stock-right-now-200396407,200396407
183090,404606,ADP,GBP Is Testing the  1 31 Mark  Us Labour Market Report Is in the Spotlight,opinion,The USD index is showing a positive trend  Since the beginning of the month  the USD strengthened against the basket of world currencies by more than 0 75   The indicator is currently testing the annual maximums  The demand for USD remains due to the progress in the Washington Beijing negotiations and the growth of the US Treasury bonds  yield  The British pound began to descend after a long rally since the middle of February  The investors started to fix positions due to ambiguousness around Brexit  This week the representatives of the Labour party claimed that they will not support Theresa May s agreement with the EU and that the negotiations with Brussel have had  no sign of a breakthrough   The GBP USD quotes are close to the weekly minimums  due to the talks hitting a dead end  According to Reuters  the experts forecast that GBP can lose up to 9  of its current value against the USD and reach the  1 20 mark should the Brexit conclude without said agreement   The financial market participants are waiting for the US Labour Market report  which is set to be published on March 8 at 15 30  GMT 2 00   This report should affect the dynamic and balance of power on the major currency pairs  The latest reports from the US have been rather positive  i e   in February the Customer Trust Index reached 131 4 against the 124 7 expectations  The non industrial PMI increased from 56 7 to 59 7  According to the ADP  NASDAQ ADP   the number of employees in the non agricultural industry was 183000 against the forecasted 189000  The experts expect that in February the number of non agricultural employees in the US will lower from 304K to 180K  The unemployment level should also lower from 4  to 3 9   The growth of the average wage should reach 0 3   You should keep an eye on the difference between the forecasted and real data   Current Technical Picture of GBP USD  Support levels  1 31000  1 30000  1 29350  Resistance levels  1 31850  1 32650  1 33500 GBP USD is moving in a flat  The key support and resistance levels are 1 31000 and 1 31850  The indicators do not provide precise signals     50    has crossed 200        The MACD histogram is in the negative zone   You should open positions from the key levels   If the US labour market report is positive  expect the quotes to fall toward the round 1 30000   Alternatively  the quotes can fix above 1 31850  and you should consider buying GBP USD  The price will move toward 1 32500 1 33000   The confirmations and market entry points will be located on smaller timeframes  Use trailing stop when creating positions ,2019-03-07,JustForex,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gbp-is-testing-the-131-mark-us-labour-market-report-is-in-the-spotlight-200395432,200395432
183092,404608,ADP,Here s Why Automatic Data Processing  ADP  Is A Great Momentum Stock To Buy,opinion,"Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock s recent trend  which can be in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   And for investors following this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks  this can be very tough to define  There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance  The Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Automatic Data Processing  ADP  NASDAQ ADP    which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B  We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score  like price change and earnings estimate revisions 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Automatic Data Processing currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
In order to see if ADP is a promising momentum pick  let s examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this payroll and human resources company holds up 
Looking at a stock s short term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum  since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment  It is also useful to compare a security to its industry  as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area 
For ADP  shares are up 0 47  over the past week while the Zacks Outsourcing industry is up 0 64  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 3 25  compares favorably with the industry s 3 25  performance as well 
While any stock can see a spike in price  it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market  Shares of Automatic Data Processing have increased 8 84  over the past quarter  and have gained 28 61  in the last year  On the other hand  the S P 500 has only moved 4 99  and 2 83   respectively 
Investors should also take note of ADP s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  Right now  ADP is averaging 1 964 454 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things  including estimate revisions and a stock s price movement  Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank  and a nice path here can be promising  We have recently been noticing this with ADP 
Over the past two months  10 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost ADP s consensus estimate  increasing from  5 27 to  5 37 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  8 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Given these factors  it shouldn t be surprising that ADP is a  2  Buy  stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B  If you re looking for a fresh pick that s set to soar in the near term  make sure to keep Automatic Data Processing on your short list ",2019-03-07,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/heres-why-automatic-data-processing-adp-is-a-great-momentum-stock-to-buy-200395924,200395924

ECB
The ECB today left rates unchanged and now expects those rates to stay at the current level through year end  Additionally  they will launch a new round of quarterly refinancing operations  Today s news is bullish for equities and multiple expansion  while bearish for the euro  In fact  equity markets are stronger since the announcement
The euro is once again on the cusp of a significant breakdown versus the dollar  Again  this move by Draghi puts Powell in a box and essentially puts the Fed on hold for the balance of the year 
The risk of allowing the dollar to strengthen materially would kill off any inflationary force in the economy  The Fed can t afford for that to happen 

International Trading
South Korea
Stocks were mixed overnight  The market we have been most concerned about has been South Korea and that market continues to sink  Still  the index is at crucial support  and as long as it holds  there is hope the markets won t slip further  But this continues to be one region of particular interest at this point 

Hong Kong
Hong Kong also continues to pause at resistance 

US Markets
Russell
The move yesterday in the Russell was the most concerning and when you look at the chart from this standpoint you can get a sense of just how much damage was done  I can t emphasize enough just how important support at this 1 534 level is  A drop below here sends the index back to 1 492  While it is not the end of the world  it will make those bearish calls louder  But as long as support holds there is a reason to be optimistic  and might have Mario to thank 

S P 500  SPY  NYSE SPY  
While the S P 500 continues to hold support around 2 770  and that is reason enough to stay optimistic  I still think that the outlook for the balance of the year looks strong and that valuations support a move towards 3 200 by year end  With the ECB in its position and the Fed in a box  the case for low rates and multiple expansion strengthen 

I also continue to believe that the recent services ISM continues to suggest the economy is doing better than most fear  The GDPNow estimate for the first quarter growth is 0 5  which up from 0 3   The next reading comes on the 8th  and I expect that number to continue to rise 
Job growth based on ADP  NASDAQ ADP  seems sturdy and the most recent trends suggest the BLS remain firm on Friday 

NXP  NXPI 
NXP is one stock on the rise after reports surfaced that Samsung  KS 005930  is looking to make a bid for the company  Clearly  this would be interesting given Qualcomm s failed attempt for NXP  Yes  an acquisition by Samsung would make sense from a few standpoints  Samsung would have the resources to pull a deal off  and it likely would not go through same issues for approval from China  since neither company is US based  For now we have to wait and see as Samsung has denied the rumor 
Support for NXP continues to be around  91  while a break above  97 could push shares back around  106 

Nvidia  NVDA 
Nvidia continues to drift lower and a drop below  150 could result in a drop back to  140 

Facebook  NASDAQ FB 
It was reported that advertisers are leaving Facebook  The stock finds itself in a critical spot  Resistance is right  173  and for now  the stock is failing  A pullback could drag the stock all the way back to  148  which is the level I have looked for a few weeks 

Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM 
Qualcomm continues to trend higher and it suggests shares may continue to head towards  58

183108,404624,ADP,Gold Slide Continues On Trade Talk Optimism,opinion,"Gold continues to lose ground  as the metal has recorded four straight losing days  In Tuesday s North American session  the spot price for one ounce of gold is  1283 72  down 0 23  on the day  It has been a miserable March for gold  which has declined 2 2   and the metal has dropped to its lowest level since late January  On the fundamental front  ISM Non Manufacturing PMI improved sharply to 59 7 points  up from 56 7 in the previous release  This marked a 3 month high  New Home Sales slipped to 621 thousand but managed to beat the forecast of 597 thousand  On Wednesday  the U S  releases ADP nonfarm payrolls 
The trade war between the U S  and China may not be over  but there are clear signs that tensions between the two super economies have eased considerably  Growing risk appetite has been bad news for gold  as the safe haven asset thrives at periods of uncertainty and handwringing  If the positive momentum continues  President Trump and Chinese President Xi could sign a trade agreement in late March  Still  it s unclear what the agreement will look like  as the sides have been very tight lipped  Investors will be most concerned as to whether U S  tariffs on Chinese products would be eliminated immediately or phased out over time  If speculation rises that a breakthrough is imminent  gold will continue to look less unattractive to investors open to risk 
The focus will be on U S  employment numbers for the remainder of the week  starting with ADP nonfarm payrolls on Wednesday  Analysts are expecting mixed numbers on Friday  Wage growth is expected to improve to 0 3   but nonfarm payrolls are projected to slide to 185 thousand  after a strong gain of 304 thousand in the previous release  The unemployment rate has been at record lows and is expected to dip to a sizzling 3 9  in the February report

183112,404628,ADP,Lowe Helps AUD Lower,opinion,"Australian dollar sitting a little above 0 7050  A push below 0 70 wouldn t take too much and the RBA Governor seems happy to help 
Just a little bit further   
It s hard to find outright calls to make on markets these days  with the US Treasury market priced about right  the dollar too  so aside from the INR  there are few conviction calls to make  One of these is the AUD  which we see weaker this year 
It isn t that there is anything particularly wrong with the Australian economy  but there are few other currencies around which are so wholeheartedly wished weaker by their central bank than the AUD 
In this morning s comments  following the no change decision of the RBA on rates yesterday  RBA Governor  Phillip Lowe said   It s hard to think of a scenario where interest rates would need to go up this year  Inflation pressures are very benign  wage growth remains low  and the current rate of wage growth is unlikely to generate an inflation rate of 2 5   and there are a number of other factors that are weighing on inflation at the moment 
A growing number of market economists are rushing to add rate cuts to their forecasts  I don t see it  The economy is going forward  not backward  It just has some issues  The following additional remark by Lowe seems to sum up our expectation of nothing for ages      I think it s quite unlikely that inflation s going to be a problem anytime soon  and if it s not  then we can keep the current setting of monetary policy for some time   our emphasis 

BIS warns of risk from Investment Grade bonds
Normally  an investment grade is an indicator of a degree of safety in an investment  But in a very thin day for news  one story has caught my eye  which is the risk posed by the pile of low rated  but still investment grade credit that high yield investors would struggle to absorb in the event of a mass downgrade 
We wrote late last week about Paul Krugman s view that the world is headed for recession  Moreover  the un named analyst s comments are also a bit chicken and egg 
It s an interesting story  but it would be a bit more interesting if high yield credit spreads were at a multiperiod low  We ll leave this one for the credit guys to disentangle  It s a bit too hard for a mere economist 
Day ahead   not much
Aside from Australian GDP  which is released about when this note gets published  expected 0 3 QoQ  2 6 YoY  there isn t a lot going on in Asia today 
The G 7 is only a bit more lively  with ADP  NASDAQ ADP  figures providing a prelude to Friday s labour report  Another strong number must surely cause some re think of the rate cuts priced into the market for the US  though maybe we need to see the March 20 FOMC dot diagram before markets will revise their thinking

183120,404636,ADP,EUR USD   Euro Under Pressure Ahead Of ECB Decision,opinion,"EUR USD is showing little movement in the Wednesday session  but the pair s trend this week has been downwards  Currently  the pair is trading at 1 1302  down 0 05  on the day  There are no eurozone or German events on the calendar  In the U S   the major event is ADP nonfarm payrolls  which is expected to dip to 190 thousand  On Thursday  the ECB is expected to maintain interest rates at 0 00   The U S  releases unemployment  claims 
All eyes will be on the ECB  which releases a rate statement on Thursday  The bank has pegged interest rates at a flat 0 00  since March of 2016  Economic activity in the eurozone has not been strong enough to warrant rate hikes over the past two years  At the same time  with the ECB winding up its massive stimulus program in December  any improvement in economic data  or rise in inflation  will raise speculation about a rate hike 
The eurozone economy showed some strength in the first half of 2018  which led to talk of a rate hike in the second half of 2019  However  with Germany and the eurozone in the midst of a slowdown triggered by global trade tensions  it s unlikely that the ECB will make a rate move before 2020 
In the U S   the focus for the remainder of the week will be on employment numbers  The key events are nonfarm payrolls and wage growth  which will be released on Friday  Analysts are expecting mixed numbers on Friday  Wage growth is expected to improve to 0 3   but nonfarm payrolls are projected to slide to 185 thousand  after a strong gain of 304 thousand in the previous release  The unemployment rate has been at record lows  and is expected to dip to a sizzling 3 9  in the February report

183122,404638,ADP,Danske Daily   Preparations For No Deal Brexit Continue ,opinion,"Market movers today 
Markets are still awaiting the two key events this week  the ECB meeting tomorrow and the US employment report on Friday 
Today  we get the US ADP  NASDAQ ADP  employment report  which offers some input on the job situation in the US  However  note that the correlation with non farm payrolls on a month to month basis is not very high 
Further  US trade data is due  while normally it does not receive a lot of market attention  the chance that it might show that the US trade deficit has grown by more than USD100bn due Trump s presidency could mean it gets some focus amid the final rounds of trade negotiations between the US and China 
The Bank of Canada is widely expected to leave policy rates unchanged at today s interim policy meeting  At the last meeting  9 January   Poloz and co signalled that the next policy move is still expected to be a hike  Meanwhile  as in the US  markets have fully priced out any hike probability over the next 12M  Given our constructive view on the global economy and our call on Fed and oil  we think this is too dovish  However  we doubt we will see any significant re pricing post today s announcement 
Tonight  the Fed s Beige Book is released and we will have speeches by the two Fed members Williams  NYSE WMB   voter  neutral  and Mester  voter  hawk  
Selected market news 
Mixed sentiment overnight with Asian equities struggling after small losses in the US session  Notably  weaker than expected Australian GDP data showing growth decelerated to 2 3   previous 2 8   consensus 2 6   helped dent risk appetite in Asia  This came after a relatively strong US non manufacturing ISM report on Tuesday afternoon  which saw the overall index rebound to 59 7 in February  previous 56 7   driven by a decent increase in both business activity and new orders  albeit the employment component actually fell somewhat  At least this underlines that a US recession is not imminent and we should be on track for a healthy level of Q1 growth with 3  q q  ar  in sight  However  the Fed s Rosengren helped dampen any attempts to reprice the Fed on this  as he was out stating it may take  several meetings  before the Fed is ready to move on rates again  US Treasuries ended the day mixed but the 10Y yield declined a tad to 2 72   USD crosses continued to edge higher as the ISM report helped add to the sense of a possible bottom in the US cycle 
Separately  the GBP was supported yesterday by noteworthy comments from Bank of England  BoE  governor Carney that the current market path for the Bank rate  may not be high enough   Meanwhile  May s talks with the EU were reportedly unsuccessful yesterday  but are set to continue today  and preparations for a no deal outcome continue  The BoE announced that it has set up a EUR swap line with the ECB to ensure UK banks can have access to euro funding  And according to  Sky News   the UK may cut tariffs down to zero for 80 90  of all goods  excluding cars and some food products  in case of a no deal Brexit 
Scandi markets
No significant calendar events scheduled in Scandinavia today 
Fixed income markets
The new 10Y Greek bond launched yesterday saw orders in excess of EUR11 8bn and the debt office sold EUR2 5bn  up from an initial EUR2 0bn target with a yield of 3 90   Hence  the hunt for yield and carry is intact in the EGB market  BTPs also got a boost yesterday as the Italian service PMI rebounded into expansionary territory 
Today  Denmark will tap the markets today with a tap in the 5y and 10Y benchmark bonds of an estimated DKK2 5bn  The lack of duration in the Danish mortgage bond market bodes well for demand and we expect that DGBs will continue to tighten vs Germany in March 
Furthermore  we forecast a new rise in banks  net position  excess liquidity  in the Danish market  It will further add support to the short end of the DGB curve  For more  see   The EGB issuance calendar is empty today ahead of supply from Spain and France tomorrow 
FX markets
Among the majors  EUR USD continued its slide yesterday and dipped below 1 13 on muted moves in US yields but helped by the strong US PMI report  We are still awaiting a likely repricing of the Fed in a more hawkish direction  which could deliver pockets of USD strength ahead but we do not envisage a trend move as such  Watch out for the Fed speakers today in this respect  Ahead of the ECB meeting tomorrow  focus for majors will be on the Bank of Canada today  while widely expected to be on hold  the statement will be scrutinised for hints of whether central banks are about to turn  1  more dovish amid global growth challenges  or  2  more hawkish as the skies may clear with the prospects growing for a trade deal and a decent Brexit 
In the Scandies  after a brief visit above 10 60  EUR SEK turned lower on comments by Riksbank vice governor Cecilia Skingsley  She said SEK weakness was unjustified based on macro  that she is comfortable with the bank s repo rate path and stressed that it has become more forward looking and thus less inclined to respond to spot inflation  The latter can be seen as a response to the substantial January inflation miss  We think the Riksbank s tolerance to such misses will be tested again next week when the February numbers are due out  Separately  Norwegian house prices fell a little short of expectations yesterday  but as the release followed two strong months and given how activity remains high in the housing market  the print is no game changer for the NOK  Indeed the tone for the NOK yesterday was set by the recovering SEK  and in recent days EUR NOK has generally lagged EUR SEK price action somewhat but as EUR SEK recovered yesterday  NOK SEK fell towards the 1 0750 level  We note that there is a big option expiry in NOK SEK this week close to current spot levels  which could tie EUR SEK and EUR NOK price action together more than usual  That said  we still see a case for a lower EUR NOK over the coming months ",2019-03-06,Danske Markets,https://www.investing.com/analysis/danske-daily--preparations-for-nodeal-brexit-continue-200395335,200395335
183124,404640,ADP,Dollar Index Extends Gains Into Sixth Consecutive Session,opinion,"Overview
The capital markets are on edge  The week s big events lie ahead  The Bank of Canada meets today and the ECB tomorrow  followed by U S  and Canada employment data on Friday  The equity markets are mixed  While Japan and Korean equities eased  China s markets continue their tear  The Shanghai Composite rose 1 5   the fourth consecutive advance  and closing in on its ninth weekly rise  Yes  it has risen every week this year  European stocks are narrowly mixed  and the Dow Jones Stoxx 600 s four day rally is at risk  It has moved higher in all but one week this year  The S P 500 is consolidating around 2800 but has failed to close higher in five of the past six sessions  Benchmark 10 year bond yields are lower across the board  Australia s 10 year yield tumbled 6 bp after the disappointing GDP  leading today s move  European benchmarks are mostly around two basis points lower  The U S  dollar enjoys a firmer tone against the major currencies  except the yen  where it is stalling around JPY112  The euro continues to straddle  1 13  The Australian dollar is the weakest of the majors  off around 0 8  to about  0 7025  the lowest level since January 4  while the lack of progress in Brussels is pushing sterling lower for the fifth session 
Asia Pacific
Australia s economy expanded a disappointing 0 2  in Q4 18  The median forecast was for a 0 3  increase  The year over year pace slowed to 2 3  from 2 7   revised from 2 8   and below expectations  Reserve Bank Governor Lowe is stuck to his neutral stance  though the market continues to move toward discounting a rate cut  The RBA s optimism  like we will hear from the ECB tomorrow  rests on the traditional relationship between employment and wages  which many suspect has broken down  Lowe argues the strong employment may lift wages boost consumption and offset the decline in property prices 
The Bank of Japan meets in the middle of the month  but there is talk that it may downgrade its output and export outlook  Exports fell 8 4  year over year in January  and exports to China fell twice as much  Last month  Governor Kuroda threatened to consider additional measures if the yen s strength weakened the economy  The economy has softened  but Kuroda is likely to repel any attempt by the dovish members to easy policy now  It is difficult for Prime Minister Abe to back away from the October sales tax increase  Although the government is trying to offset it with some other consumer incentives  past hikes have disrupted the economy  and as the implementation draws close  there will be more concerns expressed about its likely impact 
First  there was a clause in the new NAFTA agreement about minimizing and making transparent intervention in the foreign exchange market  We argued at the time  it was really unnecessary for Canada and Mexico  but it established a precedent that would be repeated  The U S  reportedly seeking a pledge from China to keep the yuan stable  We argue that this sounds good to Americans now  but it could very well hamper future efforts to devalue the dollar against the yuan  After the U S  China trade talks are resolved  we suspect the eventual outcome will keep some of the current tariffs in place   the trade focus will shift to Japan and Europe  Reports suggest the U S  is asking Japan to minimize and make transparent foreign exchange intervention  A U S  U K  post Brexit trade agreement  if that is not getting too far ahead of the game  will reportedly have a similar clause 
The Australian dollar has approached the 50  retracement mark of the rally since the flash crash low on January 3    0 6740   which is found near  0 7020  There is an option for nearly A 800 mln at  0 7050 that expires today and an A 1 2 bln strike that rolls off after the U S  jobs data on March 8  Although the next retracement target is near  0 6950  we suspect that the flash crash low will be revisited in Q2  The dollar is confined to a narrow range against the yen  So far today is the first session in four that it has not traded above JPY112 00  There is a roughly  540 mln option at JPY111 80 and another for around  500 mln at JPY112 00 that expire today  The JPY112 strike is popular  and more expire ahead of the weekend  Our next upside target is near JPY112 60  On the downside  initial support is seen in the JPY111 65 JPY111 80 area 
Europe
The U K  Brussels meeting looking for some way to make the Withdrawal Agreement more acceptable to the House of Commons failed  which should hardly come as a surprise  The U K  insisted on formally limiting the backstop  which the EC has repeatedly refused and would seem to contradict the very nature and purpose of the backstop  Still  lower level talks continue  We continue to think that a postponement of the March 29 Brexit date is the most likely scenario  Sterling s rally so far seems to be largely about reduced risk of a no deal exit  However  a postponement solves only the immediate problem without resolving the larger issues  Uncertainty will continue to overhang business and investment decisions  It will paralyze the government and distract from other challenges 
The euro has thus far been confined to 10 ticks on either side of  1 13 as it consolidates ahead of tomorrow s ECB meeting  The market expects a dovish bias after the risk assessment was cut in January  There is an option for 680 mln euros at  1 1275 and a little more than 960 mln euros at  1 1300  both of which expire today  On each of the next two sessions  there is a large  1 7 1 8 bln euro  option at  1 1250 that expires  On the tops side  tomorrow sees a 1 2 bln euro strike at  1 1360 roll off and on Friday the higher strike is at  1 1425 for 1 7 bln euros  Resistance today is seen in the  1 1320  1 1360 area 
Sterling is lower for the fifth consecutive session  The mood toward sterling has soured a bit  and some participants are eager to take profits  Sterling had rallied more than five cents since the middle of February  The softer and later Brexit scenario had been discounted  Something that increases the prospects of a second referendum or the possibility that the U K  remains in the customs union could renew sterling s climb  Initial support is seen in the  1 3050  1 3060  which houses the 20 day moving average  congestion in late February  and the 50  retracement of the last leg up 
America
The Bank of Canada meets  There is little doubt that the overnight rate will be left alone at 1 75   The issue today is the extent to which the central bank acknowledges the economic slowdown  0 4  annualized Q4 GDP   Many economists expect it to stick with its tightening bias  that it still intends to remove accommodation or normalize rates  Market participants appear to be leaning the other way  The Canadian dollar is just above the year s low and the implied yield on the BA futures have fallen around 25 bp since mid January 
The ADP  NASDAQ ADP  ADP estimate of U S  private sector jobs growth is closely watched  A rise of around 190k  January 213k  would seem to remove the risks of a downside surprise in the official data on Friday  Many market participants already seem to have discounted this  and it is one of the reasons the Dollar Index is up for the sixth consecutive session  The twin deficit challenge is back in the news and may take some of the employment s thunder  With the budget balance for January reported yesterday  we know now that the deficit for the first four months of the fiscal year is about  310 bln  The main cause of the widening appears to be the decline in revenue associated with the corporate tax cut  Today  December and therefore the 2018 trade deficit will be announced  Despite the incredible improvement in the energy trade balance  the overall trade deficit has swelled around 20  over the past two  years to about  600 bln in 2018  The exchange rate is an easy target  but growth differentials  extenuated by U S  fiscal stimulus when the economy was already growing in excess of what the central bank thinks is its long run non inflationary rate  may offer a more robust explanation  Remember the U S  exports around 15  of GDP 
The Beige Book will be released in the afternoon of the U S  session  Although it typically does not move the market  its anecdotes will help shape sentiment  Our base case is that the crosscurrents that Fed Chief Powell cites will be cleared up over the next couple of months  The warmer weather will help  Another government shutdown can be avoided  Investors and policymakers will have a better sense of whether what we see as preliminary green shoots in China and Germany catch hold  The Brexit mess may be a little clearer  The US and China may strike an agreement  or at least not escalate the trade tensions further  Under this scenario  the resilience of the US economy will be manifest again  and this could still set the stage for a Fed rate hike mid year Q3 
The U S  dollar is pushing through the late January highs against the Canadian dollar   CAD1 3375   This area corresponds to a 50  retracement of this year s pullback  The next technical target is near CAD1 3440  The highs are being recorded just before the start of the North American session  and the intraday technical readings are stretched  warning of the risk of  buy the rumor  sell the fact  behavior  Its sixth consecutive advance has brought the Dollar Index to 97 00  The next important level is the high for the year  recorded on February 15 near 97 35  from which it recorded a key reversal lower  traded on both sides of the previous day s range  making a new high for the move  and then finishing below the previous day s low  ",2019-03-06,Marc Chandler,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-dollar-index-extends-gains-into-the-sixth-consecutive-session-200394988,200394988

The U S China trade war has weighed on the global economy and caused significant volatility in the equity markets  Now that trade tensions have eased between the two super economies  investor risk appetite has improved  If progress continues and the sides ink an agreement  traders can expect the markets to climb sharply 
An agreement between the U S  and China cannot come fast enough for Germany  the locomotive of the eurozone  The OECD has lowered its 2019 GDP forecast to 0 7   down from 1 6  in November

183139,404655,ADP,Euro Breaks 1 13  USD CAD Eyes 1 34  What To Expect From Bank Of Canada,opinion,"Daily FX Market Roundup March 6  2019
Kathy Lien  Managing Director of FX Strategy for BK Asset Management 
With stocks stabilizing after yesterday s slide  the US dollar traded higher against all of the major currencies  Part of the strength can be attributed to a larger than expected rise in non manufacturing activity  Service sector activity expanded at its fastest pace since November according to ISM and the business activity index rose to its highest level in 13 years  But there was weakness underneath the surface with the employment index falling to an 8 month low and the prices index slipping to its lowest since 2017  In other words  job growth and inflation are slowing  These reports show the vulnerability of the US economy and the likelihood of a weaker NFP on Friday  New home sales rebounded in December but the improvement was offset by a revision to the January report that erased nearly half the gain  ADP will be released Wednesday along with the Federal Reserve s Beige Book and while some of the Fed districts could report some improvements related to confidence  the only thing that matters this week are jobs  If ADP  NASDAQ ADP  comes in decent  which means anything greater than 175K  the dollar could hold onto its gains with USD JPY prime for a stronger break of 112  However if ADP reports job growth less than 150K or NFPs rise less than 150K on Friday  the gains we ve seen in USD JPY could evaporate quickly 
EUR USD  which had been holding above 1 13  finally broke through this support level to fall to its weakest level in 2 weeks  This was despite an upward revision to EZ PMIs and the rebound in consumer spending  The problem for the euro is that despite these data improvements  the European Central Bank is still thinking about more stimulus and increasing the supply of cheap money  A new targeted long term refinancing operation is expected sometime in the next 2 to 3 months and the sooner they commit to it  the more pressure there must be to boost growth 
The focus shifts to the Canadian dollar with the Bank of Canada making a monetary policy announcement Wednesday  The Bank of Canada also has a lot to consider this month because while the labor market is strong the rest of the economy is weak  When the central bank last met  it lowered its GDP and inflation forecasts  These changes were validated by the latest reports  which showed quarterly GDP growth slowing to 0 4  from 2   Annualized CPI growth also dropped to its weakest level in more than a year  At the same time  oil prices are recovering and the Federal Reserve appears to be slowing its pace of tightening  We don t expect the Bank of Canada to change its policy stance but having raised interest rates 3 times last year  it is in no position to do so at this time again  USD CAD is trading at its highest level in more than a month ahead of the rate decision and a dovish outlook could send it to 1 34  The IVEY PMI report will be released alongside the Bank of Canada s rate decision and this report takes on increased importance ahead of Friday s employment report 

The Reserve Bank of Australia s monetary policy announcement had a limited and short lived impact on the Australian dollar  In a matter of seconds  AUD USD spiked higher and retreated lower after the central bank said the pickup in inflation will be gradual and an unchanged policy is what it needs to keep growth and CPI on track  Later this afternoon  RBA Governor Lowe will shed more light on their outlook  Economic data continues to improve with the services index rebounding and the current account balance shrinking  Fourth quarter GDP numbers are also due for release and the improvement in trade leads us to believe that the pace of growth accelerated towards the end of the year  The New Zealand dollar on the other hand extended its losses despite reports of higher dairy prices  commodity prices and house prices 
Last but not least  sterling ended the day unchanged despite a significantly better manufacturing PMI report  Services activity accelerated toward the end of the year  taking the composite index back up to 51 5 from 50 3  However data continues to be overshadowed by Brexit and panic about the possibility of no deal is growing  The UK is asking for backstop guarantees but the EU doesn t want to budge  Time is running out  there s still a lot of work to do and the government is also making contingencies in the event of a no deal Brexit by asking the EU to secure citizen rights  something they had asked for last week as part of a  mini deal  that was swiftly rejected ",2019-03-05,Kathy Lien,https://www.investing.com/analysis/euro-breaks-113-usdcad-eyes-134-what-to-expect-from-bank-of-canada-200394872,200394872
183144,404660,ADP,ADP In Line At 183K  Trade Deficit   59 8B  Lowest Since 2008,opinion,"Wednesday  March 6  2019Fresh economic data has hit the tape this morning  with results of the private sector employment survey from Automatic Data Processing   NASDAQ ADP   coming in line with expectations  183K new jobs were created in the month of February among non government businesses  January s figure was revised up 87K to an even 300K for that month  which was mostly do to a technical re working of the ADP benchmark  Goods producing businesses brought in 44K new jobs  as opposed to the 139K from Services  which is roughly in line with the U S  economy breakdown  The estimate for Friday morning s non farm payroll headline is right around the same level  180K  which would be a big pullback from January s 304K initially reported Medium sized companies  between 50 and 499 employees  tallied the highest number of new jobs at 139K  followed by Large companies at 77K and Small firms picking up the 12K slack  We see here the continuing narrative of smaller companies having difficulties landing employees in such a tight labor market  they do not tend to have the healthcare  stock options and other resources larger companies have By sector  as usual the Education Healthcare group led the way with 37K new jobs in February  Construction and Manufacturing performed well  especially in a storm ridden winter month  with 25K and 17K  respectively  Leisure Hospitality turned in a weak February  however  only 4K new jobs came in for this industry last month A delayed read on International Trade for December was also reported this morning  its initial report date had been set back due to the 5 week government shutdown   and was a worse than expected   59 8 billion   lower than the   57 billion expected  This is also the worst read in over a decade  and the worst since the mid 2000s  when only the government led recovery from the financial crisis built back up trade levels to a more normal range Mark VickerySenior Editor

183151,404667,ADP,ATTO Vs  ADP  Which Stock Is The Better Value Option ,opinion,"Investors interested in stocks from the Outsourcing sector have probably already heard of Atento  ATTO  and Automatic Data Processing  ADP  NASDAQ ADP    But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now  Let s take a closer look 
The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends  while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits 
Currently  both Atento and Automatic Data Processing are holding a Zacks Rank of   2  Buy   Investors should feel comfortable knowing that both of these stocks have an improving earnings outlook since the Zacks Rank favors companies that have witnessed positive analyst estimate revisions  But this is only part of the picture for value investors 
Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics  including the tried and true P E ratio  the P S ratio  earnings yield  and cash flow per share  as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use 
ATTO currently has a forward P E ratio of 5 39  while ADP has a forward P E of 28 07  We also note that ATTO has a PEG ratio of 0 70  This figure is similar to the commonly used P E ratio  with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company s expected earnings growth rate  ADP currently has a PEG ratio of 2 20 
Another notable valuation metric for ATTO is its P B ratio of 0 91  Investors use the P B ratio to look at a stock s market value versus its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  ADP has a P B of 13 77 
Based on these metrics and many more  ATTO holds a Value grade of A  while ADP has a Value grade of C 
Both ATTO and ADP are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks  but based on these valuation figures  we feel that ATTO is the superior value option right now ",2019-02-20,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/atto-vs-adp-which-stock-is-the-better-value-option-200390767,200390767

Kathy Lien  Managing Director of FX Strategy for BK Asset Management 
The US dollar is coasting on a post GDP high and USD JPY is enjoying one of the strongest rallies but better than expected growth was not the only reason for the pair s gains  Here s a quick look at the reasons why USD JPY hit 112 
1  Better than expected US Q4 GDP 2  US 10 year Treasury yields hit 1 month highs 3  Trump extends China trade deadline 4  Tensions between India   Pakistan ease 5  Fed Chair Powell expresses optimism on US economy 6  BoJ talks easing
Last week kicked off with President Trump s decision to delay the next round of Chinese tariffs  Then came Fed Chair Powell  who could have focused on the red flags in the economy or the possibility of no rate hike this year but he didn t say anything damaging during his testimony on Capitol Hill  Instead he highlighted the positive outlook for the economy and overall strength of the labor market  During the week  the Bank of Japan talked about being open to additional stimulus  which hurt the Japanese yen and US Q4 GDP beat expectations driving the greenback higher  Tensions between India and Pakistan  which could have escalated quickly  eased with the return of an Indian pilot 
It was a busy week for US data and while other economic reports were not as positive as the Q4 GDP report  it was good enough for the Fed fund futures to price in a greater chance of a rate hike than a rate cut this year  something that we haven t seen for a few weeks now  Ten year Treasury yields also rose to their highest level in a month  The fundamentals are not in favor of the dollar  at least in the near term  GDP growth did not slow as much as economists anticipated in the last 3 months of the year  but it still slowed and growth in the first quarter should be worse as it includes the impact of the government shutdown  We also can t ignore the fact that many of the other economic reports released this past week reflected weakness in the US economy  This includes housing data  personal income  spending  the trade balance and the ISM manufacturing index and the revisions  The Conference Board Consumer confidence index was higher and manufacturing activity in the Chicago region improved but next week s employment report won t be so kind to the dollar  Job growth was unexpectedly strong in the month of January and as a result could pare back in February and the January numbers could also be revised lower  If the ISM and ADP  NASDAQ ADP  reports flash warning signs for the labor market  USD JPY could fall back quickly  However if the job market continues to power on  USD JPY will make its way up to 114  Technically  111 has been an important resistance level for USD JPY for more than 2 weeks and finally on the back of slower but better than expected growth in the fourth quarter  the pair hit a high of 112  a level not seen since December of last year  This move is important because it also takes the pair above all major moving averages  opening the door for a move to 113   114 zone ",2019-03-01,Kathy Lien,https://www.investing.com/analysis/usdjpy-after-post-gdp-high-how-much-further-can-it-rise-200394092,200394092

183172,404688,ADP,Here s Why Momentum Investors Will Love Automatic Data Processing  ADP ,opinion,"Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock s recent trend  which can be in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   And for investors following this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic  it can be tough to define  Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy  but the Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Automatic Data Processing  ADP  NASDAQ ADP    a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B  We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions  two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Automatic Data Processing currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
In order to see if ADP is a promising momentum pick  let s examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this payroll and human resources company holds up 
Looking at a stock s short term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum  since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment  It s also helpful to compare a security to its industry  this can show investors the best companies in a particular area 
For ADP  shares are up 3 66  over the past week while the Zacks Outsourcing industry is up 0 92  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 11 44  compares favorably with the industry s 8 84  performance as well 
While any stock can see a spike in price  it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market  Over the past quarter  shares of Automatic Data Processing have risen 5 01   and are up 28 26  in the last year  In comparison  the S P 500 has only moved 2 05  and 3 66   respectively 
Investors should also take note of ADP s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  Right now  ADP is averaging 2 393 031 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions  in addition to price changes  Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well  A nice path here can help show promise  and we have recently been seeing that with ADP 
Over the past two months  11 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost ADP s consensus estimate  increasing from  5 26 to  5 36 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  8 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Taking into account all of these elements  it should come as no surprise that ADP is a  2  Buy  stock with a Momentum Score of B  If you ve been searching for a fresh pick that s set to rise in the near term  make sure to keep Automatic Data Processing on your short list ",2019-02-14,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/heres-why-momentum-investors-will-love-automatic-data-processing-adp-200388756,200388756
183183,404699,ADP,ADP  Private U S  Payrolls Post Significant Growth In January,opinion,"U S  companies added 213 000 workers to payrolls this month  according to the ADP National Employment Report  Although the monthly increase is below December s strong 263 000 gain  the latest number still reflect a healthy expansion for the labor market  The release goes a long way in dismissing the concern that a new recession is imminent  Today s report  and Monday s encouraging data from the Chicago Fed National Activity Index for December  follows the cautious but upbeat analysis of the U S  business cycle published earlier this month 
 The labor market has continued its pattern of strong growth with little sign of a slowdown in sight   says Ahu Yildirmaz  vice president and co head of the ADP  NASDAQ ADP  Research Institute   We saw significant growth in nearly all industries  with manufacturing adding the most jobs in more than four years  
The year over year increase in ADP s employment estimate ticked lower this month  slipping fractionally to a 1 94  rise   the slowest since September  Nonetheless  a labor market that s expanding at close to 2  reflects a healthy trend and it implies that the U S  economy still enjoys a solid tailwind 

 The job market weathered the government shutdown well   notes Mark Zandi  chief economist of Moody s Analytics  which co produces the data with ADP   Despite the severe disruptions  businesses continued to add aggressively to their payrolls  As long as businesses hire strongly the economic expansion will continue on  
Today s results offer a degree of confidence for expecting that Friday s official jobs report for January from the Labor Department will align with today s ADP release  Yet Econoday com s consensus forecast sees the government s estimate of private payrolls rising 160 000  sharply below December s stellar 301 000 gain  But if today s update is a clue  the case for an upside surprise on Friday is a reasonable guess 
In any case  Friday s release deserves close attention for an update on the crucial one year trend in private payrolls  For now  the healthy 2  annual pace is expected to hold steady in January for the government s data  according to The Capital Spectator s projection via the average forecast using nine models  The growth trend for payrolls is expected to ease in the months ahead  but unless the Labor Department s numbers reveal otherwise on Friday the near term outlook still looks encouraging ",2019-01-31,James Picerno,https://www.investing.com/analysis/adp-private-us-payrolls-post-significant-growth-in-january-200381648,200381648
183186,404702,ADP,Is Housing The Spoiler For The U S  Economy In 2019 ,opinion,"Yesterday s scheduled release of U S  gross domestic product  GDP  for the fourth quarter is still a mystery  courtesy of lingering effects of the partial government shutdown that ended last week  The good news is that whenever the Bureau of Economic Analysis publishes the data  the date remains  to be determined   the results are likely to show that the expected slowdown in Q4 growth was moderate  The question is whether the trend will continue to decelerate this year  The jury s still out  due to limited 2019 data published so far 
Let s start with the current profile for GDP in Q4  The median estimate for a set of nowcasts compiled by The Capital Spectator is still holding at a 2 9  increase  seasonally adjusted annual rate  for the final three months of 2018  That s unchanged from last week s estimate and translates to a moderately softer gain vs  the 3 4  increase in 2018 s Q3 and Q2 s strong 4 2  rise  but for now it appears that a moderate growth trend prevailed at the end of last year 

For this year  a new survey from The Wall Street Journal indicates that the deceleration in output will continue in Q1  Economists are currently projecting that growth will dip to a relatively weak 1 8  in the first three months of 2019  the Journal reports via a poll this week 
The Federal Reserve appears to be downsizing its economic expectations  too  by putting rate hikes on hold and advising that it will be  patient  with future policy tightening  if any   We are now facing a somewhat contradictory picture of generally strong U S  macroeconomic performance alongside growing evidence of cross currents   Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said in yesterday s press conference   Common sense risk management suggests patiently waiting greater clarity  
Meantime  yesterday s January report on private sector payrolls via ADP  NASDAQ ADP  paints a brighter profile  U S  companies hired 213 000 workers this month  a solid gain that translates to a strong 1 9  year over year increase  The upbeat data implies that tomorrow s official jobs report from the Labor Department for January will deliver encouraging results too 
Econoday com s consensus forecast sees the government reporting private payrolls increased 160 000  Although that s well down from December s stellar 301 000 surge  the projection for January translates to a solid 2 0  annual rise  marking the second straight month at that pace 
The labor market s positive trend appears to be intact at the start of the new year  but the outlook for housing has turned cloudy lately  Recent updates that suggest that headwinds are strengthening in this key corner of the economy include 
Pending home sales continued to trend lower  falling 9 8  year over year in December   the 12th straight month of annual contraction 
Existing home sales in December fell to their softest level since 2015 
The annual trend for new residential construction has been negative as well  housing starts declined modestly in year over year terms for two straight months in October and November  The government shutdown delayed the December update  but economists are expecting a rebound in the one year trend to a modest increase of almost 4   based on the implied estimate via Econoday com s consensus estimate for the monthly change  which is expected to remain flat compared with November  A weaker than expected number  however  would raise concern that the housing market is set for a rough year in 2019 
Adding to worries for the economic trend in 2019  the sharp drop in consumer confidence in January  which slumped to an 18 month low  according to the Conference Board  The weakness may be temporary  however  due to the government shutdown that ended last week 
The case for optimism for this year s first quarter  in other words  rests largely at the moment on upbeat data for the labor market via ADP s January profile  The first question  Will tomorrow s Labor Department data offer corroboration  The crowd s expecting no less 
 It looks like the labor market remains in solid shape despite significant weakening in business and consumer sentiment in recent months   says Daniel Silver  a JP Morgan economist   We don t see much evidence that the government shutdown spilled over into the private labor market in an especially meaningful way  
The burning question  of course  Will the incoming data will confirm Silver s analysis ",2019-01-31,James Picerno,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-housing-the-spoiler-for-the-us-economy-in-2019-200381718,200381718

183190,404706,ADP,ADP  ADP  Moves To Buy  Rationale Behind The Upgrade,opinion,"Investors might want to bet on Automatic Data Processing  ADP  NASDAQ ADP    as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   This rating change essentially reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates    one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices 
The Zacks rating relies solely on a company s changing earnings picture  It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure    the Zacks Consensus Estimate 
Since a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near term stock price movements  the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors  They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time 
Therefore  the Zacks rating upgrade for ADP basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  and the near term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated  The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship  as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock 
For ADP  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company s underlying business  And investors  appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for ADP
This payroll and human resources company is expected to earn  5 36 per share for the fiscal year ending June 2019  which represents a year over year change of 23 2  
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for ADP  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 1 9  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

183193,404709,ADP,Weak Chinese Data Dulls Trade Talk Optimism,opinion,"Wall Street extended gains on Thursday  thanks to Facebook  NASDAQ FB  and the Fed s dovish turn  In Asia  disappointing Chinese factory growth data dulled optimism over progress in US  Sino trade talks  keeping Asian markets mixed  Europe has had a mixed start
Data showing that Chinese manufacturing contracted at the fastest pace in 3 years dented risk appetite overnight  The figures are further evidence of headwinds hitting the worlds second largest economy  despite Beijing taking steps to shore it up  The Caixin manufacturing PMI slipped to 48 3 in January  from 49 7 just one month earlier  Traders will be watching closely for further moves by China to support growth  The expectation is that Beijing will act quickly  which is keeping the equity markets buoyant 
The Aussie dollar  which is broadly considered a liquid barometer for Chinese investment sentiment  slid 0 4  overnight amid growing concerns for the health of the Chinese economy 
Trade talk progress optimism
Whilst Chinese manufacturing data weighed on sentiment  US   China trade talk progress provided a lift  Trump saying that he will meet with President Xi soon is boosting optimism that the talks must be nearing a deal  The market widely assumes that the two sides are still some distance from an agreement  traders are deeply skeptical that a deal can be hashed out in time  However  another meeting between the two leaders would suggest that that the possibility of sealing a trade deal before the March deadline still exists 
The reality is this meeting appears like many before  Lots of positive comments coming away from the talks but little solid evidence of a deal coming through  As the March trade deadline approaches  investors will be more demanding of evidence to support markets at current levels 
Non farm payrolls Up Next
The dollar is holding steady ahead of the NFP  174K jobs are expected to have been created  This comes after a very strong December  which saw 312k jobs created 
The ADP private payroll data smashed expectations earlier in the week  Given the strong correlation between the ADP  NASDAQ ADP  data and NFP figures  we would usually expect a beat for today s payrolls as well  However  given the extremely strong December figure  it would be standard to see some payback this month which could bring the headline figure lower  Even in the case of a surprise to the upside  it is doubtful how much support a strong number would offer to the ailing dollar following the Fed s decision to put rate hikes on hold

183194,404710,ADP,USDJPY Jumped On Goldilocks US NFP Job Report  Upbeat ISM Mfg PMI Data And Hawkish,opinion,"USDJPY closed around 109 50 in the US session Friday  jumped by almost  0 56  on Goldilocks US NFP report  upbeat ISM Manufacturing  Mfg  PMI data coupled with hawkish talks from Fed s Kaplan  indicating the next Fed move  hike  in June 19  Q2  and progress in US China trade talks  USDJPY made a session low high of 108 72 109 59 on Friday and recovered from Thursday s post Fed low of 108 49 amid Fed s patience and flexibility 
On Friday  the much awaited January NFP data shows that the US economy added a mammoth 304K jobs from prior December figure of 222K  revised downwards from 312K  and much higher than the median expectations of 165K  The private NFP data also shows that the US economy added 296K jobs in January against December s 206K  revised downwards from 301K   higher than the market expectations of 170K 
The January NFP 1st estimate is the strongest since Feb 2018  In January  leisure and hospitality  health care  construction  transportation  and warehousing all saw strong gains  while manufacturing lost jobs to some extent  The January NFP jobs numbers follow a report released on Wednesday from payroll processing firm ADP  NASDAQ ADP   which revealed the private sector added 213K jobs in December  beating analysts  expectations of 180K jobs  but was lower than the December final figure of 263K  revised downwards from 271K  
The US unemployment rate ticked up to 4 0  in January  from prior 3 9   higher than the estimate of no change at 3 9   But higher unemployment rate also came with higher labor participation rate at 63 2  in January   at highest since 2014   against prior 63 1  
The U6 unemployment  part time underemployment  rate soared to 8 1  from prior 7 6  amid the US government shutdown  which also affected the US government contractors and their workers  The US government payrolls added 8 0K jobs from prior 16 0K  revised upwards from 11 0K  
But the most important aspect of US wage growth  i e  the average hourly earnings  AHE  grew at the muted pace at  3 2   just right on the expectations  bur ticked down from prior  3 3   revised upwards from 3 2   on yearly basis  On a sequential basis  the January AHE grew at  0 1   much lower than the December growth of  0 4  and the estimate of  0 3   The average weekly hours were unchanged at 34 5 in January  The January wage growth coincides with 19 states adding implementing new minimum wage laws 
The strong NFP report comes despite a five week shutdown that lasted most of the month and it also marks 100th consecutive months of job growth  which began in the middle of President Obama s first term following the GFC  The January NFP report also dramatically revised downward the stellar December jobs report  which was revised down to 222K from the original 312K estimate  
The Labor Department  BLS  had said earlier it would consider the 800K federal workers who were furloughed or working without pay during the shutdown fully employed  But in Friday s jobs report  it said that the shutdown had contributed to the uptick in unemployment  Temporary layoffs increased 175K as a result of the shutdown  the department said Friday and a figure that included some furloughed workers  Furloughed employees were counted as employed in the survey because are slated to receive pay for the period that included the 12th of the month 
All in all  the number of unemployed workers rose to 6 5 million in the survey  The US partial government shutdown also may have increased the number of people who took on part time work for economic reasons  which increased by about half a million to 5 1 million in January 
But the establishment side of the data seemed to shrug off the shutdown altogether  The BLS said   There were no discernible impacts of the partial federal government shutdown on the estimates of employment  hours  and earnings from the establishment survey  
In any way  the last 6 months   excluding January flash  average NFP is around 210 5K  well above the Fed s long term sustainable target of around 150K  For the full year of 2018  the average monthly payroll gain was 223K 
For the last 4 months  the average AHE growth is now around  3 2   whereas the headline US CPI  inflation  is around  2 2   in December  it was at  1 9    Thus for the last 4 months  the average US real wage growth is now around  1   3 2 2 2   positive for the US consumer spending  discretionary  and for the economy as well as the USD  The consistent real wage inflation  growth  will eventually translate into real  core  inflation  Goldilocks in nature  but also supports Fed s projections of two more hikes in 2019  As per an estimate  the aggregate wage growth is now around  5 7   y y   the fastest rate of expansion this cycle  since 2006  
Overall  the January NFP report may be called as mixed Goldilocks  which is indicating the underlying strength of the US economy contrary to the earlier perception of  gloom   doom  and at the same time could also keep the Fed  patient  and  flexible  for the time being as it poised to hike in Q1 2019  June   almost 5 months from now and may also end the B S tapering  QT  by H2 2020  an year earlier than earlier scheduled H2 2021  Subsequently  both the USD and the US stock market jumped on early Friday 
After the Friday NFP  the White House CEA Kudlow said   I think we re in great shape right now  The USA is still the hottest economy in the world  
Trump tweeted about the  great  NFP job number   We added 304 000 jobs  which was a shocker to a lot of people  It wasn t a shocker to me  JOBS  JOBS  JOBS  Best January for the DOW in over 30 years  We have  by far  the strongest economy in the world  
Trump also said   other nations  difficulties make the US job numbers look even better   On China  Trump said   China is having a very tough time  
The US House Speaker Pelosi said of the NFP report while applauding the overall jobs figure   Federal workers  many of them veterans  saw their financial security shaken  their credit ratings harmed  and their lives upended by the longest shut down in history   And now  with families still hurting  President Trump refuses to take a second senseless shutdown off the table  
The shutdown got close to inflicting serious damage on the US economy  but ultimately  businesses behaved as if it would end quickly and they kept hiring  while the US politicians got pretty close to going over that cliff  but they didn t  Again  Trump is threatening another shutdown or use of  national emergency  to build the controversial border wall at  5 7B  for which  3B economic output was already lost in the 1st shutdown 
The US consumer confidence index  however  dropped to an 18 month low in January  from 126 6 to 120 2  according to the Conference Board  Economists who monitor that indicator did not expect such a plummet  which suggested that the chaos in Washington was dampening moods nationwide  The Conference Board said in a statement that the slip appeared to be more of a  temporary shock  than a  precursor to a significant slowdown  
In another data on Friday  the ISM manufacturing PMI for January surged to 56 6 from prior 54 3  revised upwards from 54 1   much higher than the estimates of 54 2  USD got more boost after the strong ISM manufacturing PMI report  although the ISM manufacturing prices  paid  drooped to 49 6 from prior 54 9  more than expected 54 5  showing modest inflationary pressure 
The UM consumer sentiment surged to 91 2 from prior 90 7  higher than the expectations of 90 8  The Markit manufacturing PMI for January was unchanged at 54 9  right on the expectations 
On Friday  after the NFP job report  Fed s Kaplan confirmed that the base case is Fed taking no action  hike  through June and thus  pausing  is the right thing to do for now  Fed s Kaplan expects the US Economy to slow in 2019 as fiscal stimulus wanes and he sees 2  GDP growth in 2019  Kaplan is concerned by slower global growth and sees signs of weakness in the US housing  Kaplan also thinks that  the Fed shouldn t take action on rates  for now  should  get out of the way  and pausing is the right thing to do  The base case is Fed taking no action through June and the Fed decisions on the economy are made without regard to any political  Trump  pressure  
The Dallas Fed President Kaplan  a known hawk neutral  said   I had concerns on risks since October  The Fed is doing the right thing by keeping interest rates on hold and should do so for months  not weeks  as it assesses downside risks  this has been my view since late last year  My position did not abruptly change  I have seen risks in financial markets and in global weakness in October  I expect inflation to stay muted  giving the Fed the luxury to be patient on policy decisions  
Kaplan added   It s very important for the Fed to get out of the way and let uncertainties around the economy resolve themselves before weighing any more changes in monetary policy in terms of the Fed funds rate for the time being  My base case is for the Fed to remain on hold until at least June  
On Friday just after the NFP  Fed s Bullard  a known dove and an FOMC voter this year said he s pleased with rates at these levels and it s time to  wait and see  how the economy develops the NFP job data for January was strong but still time to  wait and see  
The St  Louis Fed President Bullard said   Interest rates are at a good level to set us up for a good couple of years  I am pleased with the Fed s  patient  stance  The level of rates is very good where it is today  I would like to think we re out of the business of penciling in further increases that have to be made  I don t think we re in that game anymore  Now it s time to wait and see how the economy develops before taking any more rate action and if the economy were to show unexpected strength or weakness  the Fed would consider acting in either direction  
Bullard recognized the strength of the US job market  after Friday NFP   But he said   at this point in the cycle  looking at low unemployment and jobs growth is maybe a backward looking signal  Obviously  we will react to data as it comes in  If the economy performs better than expect or worse than expected going forward  we re willing to move in either direction  But there wouldn t be any presumption now anymore that we re going to move in one direction or the other  
Overall  Bullard is supporting the Fed s temporary pause at least until Q2 2019  June  and depending on data  the Fed could move on either side at that time as the Fed is now poised to be  neutral   Bullard s comments are almost similar to Kaplan 
After Kaplan  the USD got more strength as it s now almost clear that Fed will gradually prepare the market for a possible rate hike in Q2 2019  June   if there is no big negative surprise on the US core PCE inflation  employment wage and GDP growth  And the Fed could hike again in Q4 2019  Dec  to end the current hiking cycle for a nominal US rate  median neutral  at  3 00  
Technical view  USDJPY

183197,404713,ADP,FX Week Ahead  What To Expect From RBA And BoE ,opinion,"Between the strong US nonfarm payrolls report and a less hawkish Federal Reserve monetary policy statement  the equity markets are on fire  This improvement in risk appetite lifted many currency pairs with the exception of sterling  which continues to be haunted by Brexit 
The Fed joined the chorus of central bankers worried about growth and global market uncertainty  which should remain the case until Brexit  the US funding crisis and US China trade risks are lifted  The greenback sold off against all of the major currencies except for sterling  The best performer was the New Zealand dollar  which soared on stronger data and better risk appetite  Looking ahead  there s very little US data on the calendar  although some delayed data could be released   so the downtrend that we saw last week could continue  There are also two important monetary policy announcements from Australia and the UK along with employment reports from New Zealand and Canada

Fed Says No To Rate Hikes  For Now 
The US dollar sold off aggressively last week after the Federal Reserve made it clear that they have no immediate plans to raise interest rates  Since last year  they ve been talking about the need for patience but made it official at their most recent central bank meeting by removing the reference to further gradual rate increases from their monetary policy statement  USD JPY broke below 109 in response but found support after a better than expected nonfarm payrolls report  More than 300k jobs were created in January  which was significantly better than the 165K forecast and matched last month s  300k rise  Not only does this report tell us that the government shutdown had a limited impact on the labor market  but after revisions  job gains averaged 241K over the past three months 
Even though the labor market is on fire  wage growth is slowing  and there s a very good chance of downward revisions next month  More importantly  the change in the Federal Reserve s monetary policy statement was significant enough to keep the US dollar under pressure  Having just raised interest rates in December and released a dot plot that showed two more rate hikes in 2019  they said they  will be patient   which is a big shift from last month when their statement said   some further gradual increases  were coming  With that in mind  the central bank still feels that the economy is growing at a  solid rate  with inflation hovering near their target  To clarify  Fed Chair Powell said in his press conference that the economy is in a good place  but the case for raising interest rates has receded  So in some ways  the Fed s baseline economic outlook has not changed  and they re only saying no to rate hikes for now  A lot of their concerns stem from events like Brexit  funding for the US government and US China trade issues that could be resolved over the next few months  The economy is still slowing  but if Congress passes a permanent spending increase  the UK reaches a withdrawal agreement with the EU and the US forgoes further tariffs on China  two rate hikes this year could still be justified  With that in mind  any one of these discussions could go south  sending the markets into turmoil  Press conferences after every meeting this year gives the Fed the flexibility to change policy as needed and so far  domestic and global uncertainty justifies the need for patience  There s not much in the way of US data  so for the time being  the path of least resistance for USD JPY should be lower

Euro Rally Cut Short By Data
Unlike many of the major other major currencies  weaker economic data has made it difficult for the euro to rally  It broke through 1 15 briefly last week on the back of US dollar weakness but failed to extend beyond this level as disappointing economic reports and dovish central bank comments reminded investors that the risks are skewed to the downside for the single currency  Inflation is falling according to the latest German CPI report  retail sales in Germany fell by the largest amount in 11 years and confidence is down across the region  ECB President Draghi feels that the risks have moved to the downside and last week ECB member Weidmann said growth in 2019 could be well below 1 5  and inflation could be noticeably lower  He expects bad news from the economy to continue for a while as uncertainty remains high  There are potential downside surprises to all of this week s economic reports from Eurozone PPI to retail sales and GDP  US dollar weakness is the only reason why EUR USD rallied over the past week and the lack of US data in the week ahead makes 1 15 a difficult resistance level to break

Will The EU Play Hardball With UK Or Cooperate 
Theresa May survived her no confidence vote  the UK Parliament rejected the Brexit withdrawal agreement and gave her the mandate to renegotiate the backstop  She refuses to extend Article 50 or officially rule out a no deal Brexit  None of this hurt the British pound  but the UK is no closer to a mitigating Brexit uncertainty today than three or even six months ago  With less than 60 days before the UK exits the European Union  the fate of sterling  the economy and millions of EU and UK citizens rests on whether the European Union agrees to open the withdrawal agreement for renegotiation  The EU  Ireland and several other countries said on countless occasions this past week that the agreement  which was 18 months in the making is not open renegotiation  Having promised Parliament the opportunity to take control of Brexit on February 13th if she fails to make meaningful progress on a revised agreement  May has two weeks to come up with a better alternative for the Irish backstop  But having seen her backed into a corner by her peers  the EU is playing hardball and forcing the UK to choose between a no deal Brexit  the current agreement or a second referendum  If the EU refuses to budge  May s only option is to get Parliament to support a gently revised version of the current Withdrawal agreement  Until there s meaningful progress and a clear path forward  the risk is to the downside for sterling 
Brexit uncertainty will also be a problem for the Bank of England who meets this week  The risk of a disorderly no deal Brexit increases with each passing day and Governor Mark Carney will reassure investors that they are ready to increase stimulus if it causes a major disruption in the markets  When the central bank last met in December  they said Brexit risks intensified significantly  Earlier this month  Carney said future rate hikes would be limited and gradual  The BoE won t even consider changing interest rates until the terms to leaving the EU becomes clear  If Article 50 is extended by a few months or to the end of the year  they will stand pat until the government settles on a solution and for this reason  the outcome of the meeting should be sterling negative  The performance of the economy allows for patience as weaker service and manufacturing activity is offset by a strong labor market and wage gains  In addition to the monetary policy announcement  the BoE will also release its Quarterly Inflation report  which includes updated economic forecasts and is followed by a press conference with Governor Carney

AUD Could Rally Even If RBA Is Neutral
All three of the commodity currencies benefitted from a weaker US dollar this past week  but stronger local data also supported their moves  In Australia  consumer prices rose more than expected  and manufacturing activity accelerated  but these improvements will not alter the Reserve Bank s monetary policy position  When they meet this week  the RBA will say that while the next move in rates will be up  a change is some ways off so for their time being a steady and neutral stance is warranted  Taking a look at the table below  there s been more weakness than strength in Australia s economy since December  Labor market activity weakened  business and consumer confidence is down  building approvals plummeted  and consumer inflation expectations declined  There was also widespread deterioration in Chinese imports  GDP  industrial production and retail sales  So even if manufacturing and service sector activity improved  the RBA won t alter their cautious outlook especially after NAB raised interest rates  With that in mind  neutral policy may not be negative for AUD because the Fed just shifted to a less hawkish stance  Technically the pair is bid and could hit a two month high above 74 cents 
The Canadian dollar also ended the week unchanged after hitting 2 week lows and then recovered strongly on Friday despite a steep fall retail sales  Consumer spending dropped  0 9  in November  the most in 7 months as gas prices fell and automobile purchases declined  November GDP numbers are due for release this week and given the latest retail sales and trade balance reports a contraction is expected  USDCAD is poised to extend its slide below 1 32 

The New Zealand dollar rose to its strongest level in 7 weeks on the back of a stronger trade balance  NZD has been one of the best performers as the combination of risk appetite  stronger data and a weaker US dollar lent support to the currency  We expect that outperformance to continue in the week ahead as Q4 labor market numbers will most likely surprise to the upside  According to the Manpower index  hiring intentions improved in Q4 and Q1 and this positive sentiment was further validated by consistent increases in the employment component of the business PMI index  The Canadian dollar rallied on the back of higher oil prices and a slightly better than expected GDP report  Oil prices hit a 2 month high after the US imposed sanctions on Venezuela s oil industry  Crude oil inventories also rose less than expected and gas stockpiles declined  We ve seen a near term bottom in oil but if US China trade talks break down  we could see renewed declines in the price of crude ",2019-02-04,Kathy Lien,https://www.investing.com/analysis/fx-week-ahead-what-to-expect-from-rba-and-boe-200383189,200383189
183208,404724,ADP,EUR USD   Lack Of Fundamental Releases Leaves Euro Subdued,opinion,"EUR USD continues to gain ground this week  Currently  the pair is trading at 1 1432  up 0 03  on the day  On the release front  there are on eurozone or German releases  In the U S  the key event is CB Consumer Confidence  which is expected to drop to 125 0 points 
As the largest economy in the eurozone  Germany is a bellwether for the rest of the bloc  Recent German numbers have been weak  raising concerns about the strength of the eurozone economy  On Friday  German Ifo Business Climate dipped to 99 1  below the 100 level for the first time since 2010  Earlier in the week  a ZEW survey found that institutional investors remain deeply pessimistic about the German and eurozone economies  There was also grim news from the manufacturing front  as German manufacturing PMI slipped to 49 9  falling into contraction territory for the first time since 2013 
On Monday  ECB President Mario Draghi painted a mixed picture in his testimony before an EU parliamentary committee  Draghi highlighted serious concerns affecting the eurozone  Draghi pointed to uncertainties over geopolitical factors and protectionism threats continued to weigh on the eurozone economy  On the bright side  Draghi noted that an improving labor market and stronger inflation were fueling expansion in the eurozone  At last week s policy meeting  the ECB said that risks to growth have  moved to the downside   These pessimistic comments were the result of weaker eurozone releases in recent weeks  The economy has slowed  as weaker growth in China and trade tensions  such as Brexit  have dampened business and consumer confidence 
How many times will the Fed raise rates in 2019  The answer varies  depending on who you ask  The markets are not expecting any increases  while the Federal Reserve continues to stick with a forecast of two hikes  The Congressional Budget Office  CBO  has also weighed in  saying that they expect further rate increases this year  The CBO made the forecast in its 10 year outlook update but did not specify how many hikes  The CBO report projected growth of 2 3  for the U S economy in 2019  matching the forecast of the Federal Reserve

183214,404730,ADP,Perception That Brexit Delay Is Inevitable Could Help Sterling Stabilize,opinion,"Overview
The U K  Prime Minister has two weeks to strike a new deal with the EC over the Irish backstop or return to Parliament in mid February to consider alternatives  six weeks before Brexit  Sterling has recovered about half of yesterday s drop  The Australian dollar jump back to  0 7200 was aided by the nearly 10  jump in iron ore price after Vale announced a sharp reduction in output  The Mexican peso is the weakest of emerging market currencies after Fitch cut Pemex s credit rating two notches to BBB  and maintained a negative outlook  Equities are narrowly mixed  Although Chinese and Japanese stocks fell  most of the other regional markets rose  The Dow Jones Stoxx 600 in Europe is eking out a small gain through the morning  led by consumer discretionary and materials sector  Bond markets are also mixed  Italian bonds may be building a concession ahead of today s supply  The ADP private sector jobs estimate  the FOMC meeting  and Mexico s Q4 GDP are the highlights from the North America session 
Asia Pacific
Australia reported slightly softer Q4 CPI of 1 8   down from 1 9  in Q3  It rose 0 5  on the quarter  Evidence softer inflation reading will not sway the investors or policymakers is evident by the more than three basis point increase in Australia s two year yield  The more important news for investors was the 9 5  rise in iron ore prices to 15 month highs  as Vale announced that decommissioning of trailing dams will cut its output by 40 mln tons  Australia s equities rose 0 2   but the material sector was up over 2  
Japan reported retail sales rose 0 9  in December  which was more than twice the gain expected after a 1 1  decline in November  initially 1 0  decline   The year over year rate ticked down to 1 3  from 1 4   Economists expected a 1 0  pace  While stronger retail sales are helpful  the economic rebound from the contraction in Q3 still seems lackluster  Tomorrow Japan is expected to report a 0 5  decline in December industrial output  It follows a 1 0  slide in November after October s 2 4  surge as the reconstruction from the natural disasters kicked in 
At least 20 Chinese companies warned of weaker earnings today  blaming the economic slowdown and accounting changes  Nevertheless  Bloomberg data suggests foreign investors may have bought a record amount of Chinese shares this month through the Shanghai and Shenzhen connect facility  It appears foreign investors bought CNY52 bln    7 8 bln  of A shares 
The Chinese yuan rose about 0 25  against the U S  dollar  The greenback was sold for the sixth consecutive session and has not fallen below the 200 day moving average   CNY6 7250  for the first time since last June  Officials had seemed to imply they did not want it to go beyond CNY6 70  but the market seems intent on testing officials  The trade talks get underway today and tomorrow in Washington  The most that can be reasonably expected is for both sides to accept that progress is being made and that there is time for another round of talks before the early March deadline  Next week s Lunar New Year holiday is draining liquidity  and this is evident in the money market  and forwards in Hong Kong   The Australian dollar is testing the  0 7200 area  The high for the month was set near  0 7235  We are more inclined to sell into these gains than look for an upside break  The dollar is in less than a quarter yen range against the Japanese currency  There is a nearly  400 mln option at JPY109 30 that expires today  There are much larger options struck at JPY110 that expire tomorrow and Friday   1 3 bln and  1 8 bln respectively  
Europe
When everything was said and done  the U K  House of Commons authorized the Prime Minister to seek alternatives to the current backstop provisions in the Withdrawal Agreement  The EC and several countries individually  and notably Ireland has summarily rejected this  If a customs border cannot be between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland  nor a border between Northern Ireland and the rest of Britain there is one obvious solution  Remain in the same customs union  Parliament rejected this course yesterday  Sterling s six week rally reflects perceptions of diminished downside risks  but the House of Commons vote that rejected a no deal exit barely scraped by  318 310   and it is not binding  like the referendum itself    Positive action still must be taken to avoid a hard Brexit  May was given a two week mandate  Without changing the U K  s red lines  it seems highly doubtful that the EC will change its red lines  U K  officials must recognize this and appear to be playing for time  Sterling was sold yesterday when it seemed that the risk of a no deal exit had increased  Ideas that a delay in Brexit is all but inevitable may be helping sterling stabilize today  
France reported its Q4 GDP rose 0 3   which is the same as in Q3 but better than expected  Ironically  exports seemed the key  and they contributed 0 2 percentage points to growth  Household demand was weak  Consumer spending slumped 1 5  in the month of December  and it was the third decline in four months  Growth last year slowed to 1 5  from 2 3  in 2017  Several countries  including Germany  Italy  and Spain report Q4 GDP tomorrow  and the preliminary aggregate figure for EMU will also be reported  
Political risks may be rising in Italy  Prime Minister Conte warned the government is  wobbling   League leader Salvini s strong anti immigration stance is leaving him vulnerable to some legal challenges  according to the local press  Meanwhile  the League support is seen near 32   roughly double last year s electoral performance  Tensions between the unlikely coalition partners have reportedly increased  and the ambitious Salvini may be tempted to push for an election ahead of the May EU Parliament elections on ideas that he could head a center right government with Berlusconi s Forza Italia and the Brothers of Italy 
The euro is confined to a quarter of a cent below  1 1450  The market appears to be waiting for the FOMC to provide more incentives  There are no expiring options to note today  but tomorrow there are options struck at  1 1400  1 1405 for 2 2 bln euros  We anticipate the North American session to probe the upside today  Sterling recouped about half of yesterday s decline and appeared to have lost some momentum in the European morning as it approached  1 3120  The euro is consolidating yesterday s gains against sterling  It reached GBP0 8755 yesterday and has eased back to GBP0 8715 today  Chart support is seen near GBP0 8700 
North America
There are three main events on the U S  diary today  the resumption of trade talks  the ADP private sector jobs estimate and the FOMC meeting  The first day of trade talks should not generate many headlines  The ADP  NASDAQ ADP  jobs estimate is expected to fall from 271k to 181k  largely matching the decline expected to be reported by the national report at the end of the week  There the consensus is for payback after a 312k job increase in December 
There is no doubt the FOMC is on hold through the first part of the year  While the market anticipates that the Fed is likely on hold all year  many economists still look for a hike or two  The FOMC statement should be succinct  While it maintains the roughly balanced risk outlook  the forward guidance will likely be replaced with the emphasis on patience  flexibility and data dependence  Although the impact of the balance sheet reduction is controversial  we look for some rhetoric that will ease the anxiety in some quarters  Powell is likely to emphasize what the Fed has already indicated  that the balance sheet will remain much larger than before the Great Financial Crisis  He is unlikely to announce a target in time or size  Note that although the Fed says it can reduce the balance sheet by  50 bln a month since last October  it is letting only about  40 bln a month roll off 
Mexico reports Q4 GDP today  It is expected to slow from 2 4  to 2 0   The downgrade of Pemex has hit the peso  It warns about the quality of it as a standalone credit and notes that it has under invested in upstream businesses  The company has a total negative equity balance since 2009  and there have been 14 consecutive years of declining output  Pemex dollar bonds  due 2027  had the biggest sell off yesterday in three weeks 
The U S  dollar is trapped in a CAD1 3200 CAD1 3285 trading range  It tested the top side yesterday and is set to push to the downside  The dollar rose to almost MXN19 15 in Asia after dipping below MXN18 97 yesterday  It has not closed above the 20 day moving average   MXN19 1370  since December 5  Elsewhere  note that Chile is expected to hike rates 25 bp tomorrow  to 3   and the currency has gained for the past four weeks  leaving the greenback at the lower end of its five month trading range ",2019-01-30,Marc Chandler,https://www.investing.com/analysis/she-cant-accept-no-200381021,200381021

183237,404753,ADP,Moderately Slower Growth Rate Expected For U S  GDP In Q4,opinion,"The US expansion remains on track for a moderate deceleration in fourth quarter GDP growth  based on the median estimate for a set of nowcasts compiled by The Capital Spectator  The good news is that the estimate has been steady in recent weeks 
The median Q4 nowcast remains at 2 7   seasonally adjusted annual rate   unchanged from the Dec  18 update and down from Q3 s robust 3 4  rise  Nowcasts are prone to all the usual caveats that accompany efforts to anticipate future economic conditions  but the fact that the median estimate has remained stable is an encouraging sign for assuming that the US economy will close out the final quarter of 2018 with a diminished but still healthy increase in output 

The outlook for this year s first quarter and beyond  by contrast  is subject to greater uncertainty  courtesy of several factors  starting with the partial government shutdown   a shutdown that doesn t appear set to end any time soon  Kevin Hassett  chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers  yesterday advised that the shutdown will be a  big negative  on the January employment report   Our estimate is that GDP in the first quarter could go down by about a tenth if this were to resolve in the next few weeks   he said on Thursday 
The fallout from the shutdown will likely be temporary  but other economic headwinds are blowing  ranging from the Federal Reserve s recent hikes in interest rates and the ongoing fallout from the US China trade war 
Despite the risks  it s not yet obvious that a softer macro trend for the US is destined to deteriorate into a new recession in the near term  As discussed late last month  the probability that a new NBER defined contraction has started remains low  Today s revised profile of Q4 GDP activity reaffirms the analysis 
Reviewing the GDP outlook from the perspective of one year changes also suggests that moderate growth will prevail for the foreseeable future  The chart below shows estimates for annual GDP comparisons  based on the average forecast via nine models  The modeling indicates that the 3 0  annual increase in real GDP in the third quarter will edge down to 2 8  in Q4 and more or less hold at that pace in 2019 s first quarter 

At this point it s premature to assume that a new recession is imminent  On the other hand  the evidence is building that US growth has peaked  a theme that s been outlined on these pages for months  see here and here  for example  
Assuming the worst  however  remains an emotional reaction rather than a view based on the data in hand  The year ahead looks challenging  at least by 2018 s standards  but the latest numbers have yet to reflect a clear warning for the US macro trend  Indeed  yesterday s December update of the ADP Employment Report still reflects a strong trend for labor market growth   nonfarm payroll employment surged 271 000 last month  holding at a solid 2 0  year over year pace 
Until the incoming data on multiple fronts dispense a clear warning  it s reasonable to assume that softer but still healthy economic growth will endure 
 Businesses continue to add aggressively to their payrolls despite the stock market slump and the trade war   notes Mark Zandi  chief economist of Moody s Analytics  which co produces the ADP  NASDAQ ADP  numbers on payrolls   Favorable December weather also helped lift the job market  At the current pace of job growth  low unemployment will get even lower  ",2019-01-04,James Picerno,https://www.investing.com/analysis/moderately-slower-growth-rate-expected-for-us-gdp-in-q4-200372818,200372818
183239,404755,ADP,312k Jobs Added While Wage Growth Surged In U S ,opinion,"The U S  nonfarm payrolls report came out on Friday last week and it covered December 
Data showed that U S  employers added jobs in December at the fastest pace since February 2018 along with an increase in wage growth  The data suggested that the real economy in the United States maintained a strong momentum close to the end of the year 
On a seasonally adjusted basis  the nonfarm payrolls rose 312 000 during the month  This was the biggest jump since February while the average hourly earnings rose 0 4  on the month to a seasonally adjusted annual basis of 3 2   This was the best pace of wage growth since 2008 
Estimates showed that economists forecast employment to rise 177 000 for December  This follows an increase of the original reading at 155 000 in December  Economists also expected the U S  unemployment rate to hold steady at 3 7  during the month 
The December data showed that employers in the U S  added an average of 220 000 jobs per month in 2018  This was the highest in comparison to the previous year s average growth of 182 000 and the best since 2015 
December s payrolls data showed that the economy added jobs for 99 consecutive months marking the longest stretch of hiring on record 
Private sector except information services contributed to the pace of hiring  Government payrolls rose 11 000 in December 
The unemployment rate  however  ticked higher to show 3 9   This was higher than the median estimates which forecast that the unemployment rate would remain unchanged at 3 7   The increase in the unemployment rate was seen amid the higher participation rate which ticked up to 63 1   This was the highest participation rate since 2014 and was up from November s reading of 62 9  
Private sector payrolls rise in December
Ahead of the official payrolls report  data showed that the ADP Moody s private payroll figures surged in December  The data was seen reflecting the favorable weather with the statistics coming out stronger than the estimates during the reporting month 
ADP Moody s private payroll figures showed that employment rose 271 000 in December  This came after November s private payrolls showed 157 000 jobs for the month  In November  ADP Moody s initially reported a headline print of 179 000 
The data for December beat estimates which forecast 178 000 jobs created during the month  ADP said private sector employment surged up by 271 000 jobs in December after climbing by a downwardly revised 157 000 jobs in November 
The stronger than expected job growth for December showed the biggest jump in private sector hiring since February 2017  Ahu Yildirmaz  the vice president of ADP  NASDAQ ADP  research institute  said that the U S  economy wrapped up 2018 with a strong month of growth in the labor market 
 Although there were increases in most sectors  the busy holiday season greatly impacted both trade and leisure and hospitality  Small businesses also experienced their strongest month of job growth all year   Ahu Yildirmaz said 
Mark Zandi echoed similar views  chief economist for Moody s Analytics  Zandi said   Businesses continue to add aggressively to their payrolls despite the stock market slump and the trade war  At the current pace of job growth  low unemployment will get even lower  The private payrolls report showed that the services sector jumped by 224 000 jobs during the month  Other areas contributing to the net gains included sectors such as leisure  hospitality  and trade  transportation and utility industries which added a combined 72 000 jobs during the month 
The goods producing sector contributed to the payrolls by adding 47 000 jobs during the month  This reflected an increase of 37 000 jobs in the construction sector 
On a business size basis  ADP said that medium sized companies added 129 000 jobs while small businesses added 89 000 jobs in December ",2019-01-08,ORBEX,https://www.investing.com/analysis/us-economy-adds-312k-jobs-in-december-with-wage-growth-surging-200373504,200373504

183241,404757,ADP,USD CAD  Loonie Dips Ahead Of Canadian ADP Nonfarm Payrolls,opinion,"USD CAD has posted gains in the Thursday session  Currently  the pair is trading at 1 3302  up 0 35  on the day  On the release front  Canada publishes ADP nonfarm payrolls  while the U S  posts unemployment claims and the Philly Fed Manufacturing Index 
Last week  the Bank of Canada lowered its growth forecast for 2019 to 1 7   down from 2 1   The bank also noted concerns over lower oil prices and the global trade war  both of which have hurt the economy  Still  the BoC expects economic activity to strengthen in the second half of the year  so it appears unlikely that the BoC will raise rates in the first quarter  An important factor in rate policy is the level of inflation  and investors are braced for a soft reading from CPI for December  CPI is expected to post a second successive decline of 0 4   If inflation remains weak  the BoC will have an easier time holding off from rate cuts 
The U S  government shutdown has meant that the flow of economic data has been reduced  This has magnified the importance of the Beige Book  which was released on Wednesday  The report found that businesses across the country had become less optimistic  due to higher interest rates  swings in the financial markets and global trade tensions  At the same time  most of the regional Feds said that growth in their region was  modest to moderate   The report reiterates the recent dovish stance we are seeing from the Federal Reserve  which has sent strong signals to the markets that rate hikes could be on hold for the near future

183242,404758,ADP,Automatic Data Processing  ADP  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Automatic Data Processing  ADP  NASDAQ ADP   reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 30  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This payroll and human resources company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 18 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  19 2  
Revenues are expected to be  3 44 billion  up 6 2  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for ADP 
For ADP  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that ADP will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that ADP would post earnings of  1 10 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 20  delivering a surprise of  9 09  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
ADP doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/automatic-data-processing-adp-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200378481,200378481

183253,404769,ADP,ISM Manufacturing Activity Expected To Ease To 58 2,opinion,"The U S  Dollar posted strong gains on Wednesday as price action in the greenback sent most of its peers to close lower on the day  Gold prices tried to inch higher but failed to keep the intraday gains  WTI crude oil prices  on the other hand  managed to close bullish 
Higher yen and gold prices reflected the risk off sentiment in the market while the Kiwi Dollar  the AUD  GBP  and the Euro posted strong declines on the day 
On the economic front  manufacturing PMI from the Eurozone showed that activity in the sector was unchanged at 51 5 compared to the month before  This was however in line with the median estimates 
In the UK  manufacturing activity rose to 54 2  marking a slight advance from the estimates of 52 5 and up from a revised reading of 53 6 in November  Markit s manufacturing PMI for the U S  showed a modest decline to 53 8 which was below estimates of 53 9 
Looking ahead  the economic data from the Eurozone is relatively quiet  In the UK  the construction PMI data is due to be released today  Forecasts point to a slowdown in the UK s construction activity with the index expected to ease to 52 9  This is weaker compared to 53 4 that was registered the month before 
The NY trading session will see the release of the U S  ADP private payrolls report for December  Economists forecast that private payrolls rose slightly by 180k in December  up from 179k in November  The weekly unemployment claims follow the ADP  NASDAQ ADP  report 
The main event for the day will be the Institute of Supply Management s manufacturing PMI report  Manufacturing activity is expected to ease to 58 2 in December  down from 59 3 previously  The ISM prices paid is also likely to ease from 60 7 to 57 9 
EUR USD intraday analysis
EUR USD  1 1368   The EUR USD currency pair posted strong losses on Wednesday as price action failed to breakout above the 1 1461 level of resistance  The minor trend line was breached invalidating the bullish ascending triangle pattern  The break down from the rising trend line saw the Euro currency testing lows of 1 1305 before recovering  The current rally off the lows near 1 1305 could see the EUR USD retesting the breakout level from the trend line  As long as the gains are capped here  we expect further declines down to 1 1275 level 
AUD USD intraday analysis
AUD USD  0 6939   The Australian dollar fell sharply on the day  losing 0 94  overall  Price action fell to a decade low of 0 6759 after closing a bit higher from the lows  The declines came following the break down of the support level near 0 7022  The current recovery could  however  keep the AUD USD to consolidate just below the resistance level of 0 7022  As long as this level is not breached  the AUD USD could be attempting to post a bottom  However  we cannot rule out further declines in the near term 
XAU USD intraday analysis

XAU USD  1288 56   Gold prices continued to maintain the bullish momentum although price action was seen briefly retreating off the highs before recovering in today s early Asian trading session  Establishing support at the 1280 handle has pushed gold prices slightly higher from Wednesday s highs  However  with the Stochastics oscillator pointing to a bearish divergence  we anticipate that the support level at 1280 could give way to some downside in price action  A break down below 1280 will potentially push gold prices down to the 1250 handle where support is most likely to be established ",2019-01-03,ORBEX,https://www.investing.com/analysis/ism-manufacturing-activity-expected-to-ease-to-582-200372397,200372397
183257,404773,ADP,EUR USD   Steady After Yen Surge Sends Euro Tumbling,opinion,"EUR USD has edged lower in the Wednesday session  Currently  the pair is trading at 1 1347  up 0 03   On the release front  there are no major U S  events on the schedule  In the U S   the focus will be on employment numbers for the remainder of the week  ADP nonfarm payrolls are expected to remain unchanged at 179 thousand  while unemployment claims are forecast to continue climbing  with an estimate of 220 thousand  On Friday  the eurozone releases CPI reports  while the U S  will post nonfarm payrolls and wage growth  As well  ISM Manufacturing PMI is forecast to dip to 57 7 points 
The euro took a plunge on Wednesday  declining 1 0 percent  The catalyst for the sharp drop was a surge by the Japanese yen  as investors remain nervous about the global economy and flocked to the yen  which posted strong gains against the dollar  with other currencies such as the euro feeling the effect  The markets are thin on liquidity this week  and with Japanese banks closed for most of the week  the yen s movement was even more pronounced  The dollar has traditionally been a safe haven asset  but this role is being re evaluated  with some analysts calling the yen the  safer safe haven   If investor jitters continue  the euro could resume its downward slide 
After four rate hikes in 2018  the Federal Reserve will be drastically easing up on raising rates in 2019  Just a few months ago  there was heady talk of three or four rate hikes in 2019  but the Fed made an abrupt U turn  saying the  neutral rate range  had been reached  Analysts expect one rate hike in 2019  as this year s hikes and the global trade war have lessened the pace of expansion in the U S  economy  According to the CME Group  the likelihood that the Fed will stay on the sidelines in January and March stands at 98  and 93   respectively  This dovish stance from the Fed could weigh on the dollar in the coming months

183258,404774,ADP,Stupendous Jobs Report Keeps Hopes Alive,opinion,For those of us who may have concluded yesterday s private sector payroll report from Automatic Data Processing   NASDAQ ADP   represented an outlier number at 271K  well above the 180K or so expected   we see an even bigger December jobs number from the non farm payroll figures this morning from the Bureau of Labor Statistics  BLS   A whopping 312K new jobs were reportedly generated in December  way   way    above the 182K consensus estimate  and more than double the originally reported November headline number of 155K Not only that  but look beneath the headline and see every other major metric in this BLS report putting up a significant positive surprise  as well  Average Hourly Earnings rose 11 cents per hour  or  0 4  month over month  above the  0 3  expected and the  0 2  originally reported for November  revisions to the past two months   November from 155K to 176K  and October from 237K to 274K   pushing jobs gains to an average of 254K over the past three months  and  importantly  the Labor Force Participation Rate rose to 63 1  from 62 9  last time around  Impressive strength for the labor market and the economy as a whole  everywhere you look The only  bad  headline number would be the Unemployment Rate  which rose 20 basis points to 3 9  last month  But considering the participation rate is up   indicating more people getting off the couch  finding and landing new jobs   it would stand to reason more people being counted in the potential workforce overall might lead to higher rates of unemployment overall  Unemployed adult men grew month over month  and the amount of people overall leaving their jobs  in hopes of finding a better one   was higher than expected By sector  Healthcare brought in 50K new jobs in December   the most recorded on a monthly basis in the BLS  history  This was followed by Restaurants   Bars having brought 41K new jobs last month  with Construction bringing an impressive 38K  Overall 301K private sector jobs came to the labor market in the past month  with government jobs picking up the remainder Normally  analysts tend to look askew at workforce numbers generated during the holiday shopping season  rife as it tends to be with temporary retail  transportation and warehouse jobs  But as these numbers demonstrate  growth in the labor market is coming from elsewhere  This is not to suggest we can expect 300K new jobs every month   the run rate may not even be as high overall as the 250K  three month average we ve seen   but for those who had begun to think the labor market was poised to shrink somewhat one year removed from the giant corporate tax cut  they d do well to reassess their findings today That the pre market has taken these boffo figures in stride is also noteworthy  often times of late  hotter than expected economic growth numbers have led investors to worry about a reaction from the Fed in terms of interest rate hikes  For now  we see the Dow 280 points in the green  the Nasdaq up 90 and the S P 500 33 points higher  If market participants are concerned the Fed is going to re re consider its one or two rate hike scenario this year  previously  many had speculated three or four hikes for 2019   they re not showing it currently Helpfully  we have an already scheduled panel an hour from now or so consisting of Fed Chair Jerome Powell  flanked by former Fed Chairs Janet Yellen and Ben Bernanke  This will be an excellent opportunity to help put into perspective what the Federal Reserve is currently thinking about its dual mandate   full employment  check   and controlled inflation  check  so far    through the prism of the Fed funds rate  currently in a range of 2 25  2 50   Especially considering how much the Fed has been the subject of harsh vilification by President Trump and others  today s forum offers a terrific chance to clear the air ,2019-01-03,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/stupendous-jobs-report-keeps-hopes-alive-200372957,200372957
183263,404779,ADP,Yen Jumps As Asian Markets In Deep Selloff ,opinion,"The yen surges broadly while the Australian dollar is pressured as the Asian markets start the new year with a deep selloff  The Hong Kong HSI is quickly down over  2 3  in initial trading  China Shanghai SSE  LON SSE  is down  1 0  and Singapore Strait Times is down  0 48   Japan is still on holiday  Canadian dollar and U S  dollar are the relatively firmer ones  but look vulnerable  European majors are steadily in range  More volatility will likely be seen as a load of economic data will be featured in the holiday shortened week 
Technically  USD JPY s decline extended to as low as 109 51 so far  The break of 109 76 support carries bearish implications and opens up further fall back to 104 62 low  EUR JPY also breaks 125 52 support to resume recent decline towards 124 08 key support level  GBP JPY is also heading back to 139 29 key support  Talking about the pound  it would be noted that despite Monday s rally attempt  GBP USD was held by 1 2811 near term resistance EUR GBP was also kept by 0 8931 support  There is no committed buying in Sterling yet 
Two more things to note  Firstly  U S  yield curve inversion worsened quite seriously by the end of 2018  It s clearly inverted from 1 year  2 619  to 2 year  2 504  and then 3 year  2 462   The 5 year yield at 2 511 is way below 1 year yield  The 6 month yield at 2 486 isn t too far away  Secondly  fed funds futures are now pricing just around 2 5  chance of a Fed hike in March to 2 50 2 75   And there s just around 11  chance of a rate hike in 1H  It looks like investors are expecting something rather ugly ahead in 2019 
Democrats to offer a deal to end government shutdown without border wall
The partial U S  government shutdown is now in its second week  Democrats  who will take control over House with a 36 seat majority  plan to vote on a two part package on Thursday  intending to break the deadlock  One part of the package includes a bundle of six measures worth USD 265B for funding non homeland security agencies through September 30  The second part includes funding for the Department of Homeland Security through February 8  and provide  1 3 billion for border fencing and  300 million for other border security items including technology and cameras  There won t be funding for the border wall that Trump demanded and shut down the government for 
Democrat leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer said in a joint statement that  While President Trump drags the nation into Week Two of the Trump Shutdown and sits in the White House and tweets  without offering any plan that can pass both chambers of Congress  Democrats are taking action to lead our country out of this mess  
The fate of the Democrats  package is rather uncertain in the Republican controlled Senate  A spokesman for Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell already said   It s simple  The Senate is not going to send something to the president that he won t sign  
But Trump himself hinted that he might want to make a deal  He tweeted that  Border Security and the Wall  thing  and Shutdown is not where Nancy Pelosi wanted to start her tenure as Speaker  Let s make a deal  
China Xi to Trump  History has proven cooperation is best for both sides
In his New Year address  Chinese President Xi Jinping reminded US President Donald Trump that  history has proved that cooperation is the best choice for both sides   Xi added that  I attach great importance to the development of China U S  relations and am willing to work with President Trump to summarize the experience of the development of China U S  relations and implement the consensus we have reached in a joint effort to advance China U S  relations featuring coordination  cooperation and stability so as to better benefit the two peoples as well as the people of the rest of the world  
The official Xinhua new agency also echoed in the commentary that  At a time when the world is undergoing unprecedentedly profound changes and is fraught with risks and uncertainties  the global community expects an even closer collaboration between the two largest economies  
Trump tweeted on December 29 that  Just had a long and very good call with President Xi of China  Deal is moving along very well  If made  it will be very comprehensive  covering all subjects  areas and points of dispute  Big progress being made    China s state media also said Xi believed both sides wanted  stable progress   and China US ties had reached a  vital stage  on its 40th anniversary 
It s believed that Deputy U S  Trade Representative Jeffrey Gerrish will lead a delegation including Treasury Under Secretary for International Affairs David Malpass  to travel to China in the week of January 7 for a face to face meeting on trade negotiations 
UK PM May urged support to her Brexit deal to turn a corner
UK Prime Minister Theresa May continued to sell her Brexit agreement in her New Year message  He said that  the Brexit deal I have negotiated delivers on the vote of the British people and in the next few weeks MPs will have an important decision to make   She emphasized that  if parliament backs a deal  Britain can turn a corner  
May added that  the referendum in 2016 was divisive but we all want the best for our country and 2019 can be the year we put our differences aside and move forward together  into a strong new relationship with our European neighbors and out into the world as a globally trading nation   And   we have all we need to thrive and if we come together in 2019 I know we can make a success of what lies ahead  
MPs are expected to re start the debate on the Brexit agreement in the week of January 7 and a Commons vote is scheduled for the week of January 14  In the coming days  a focus will be on what further political and even legally assurances the EU will give regarding the non permanent nature of the Irish backstop

Zhengsheng Zhong  Director of Macroeconomic Analysis at CEBM Group  noted in the release that  external demand remained subdued due to the trade frictions between China and the U S   while domestic demand weakened more notably   And   it is looking increasingly likely that the Chinese economy may come under greater downward pressure

183276,404792,ADP,USD CAD  Canadian Dollar Higher  Investors Eye U S Jobless Claims,opinion,"USD CAD is down slightly in the Thursday session  Currently  the pair is trading at 1 3470  down 0 07  on the day  On the release front  Canadian Wholesale Sales are expected to post a gain of 0 4  after two straight declines  Canada will also release ADP  NASDAQ ADP  nonfarm payrolls  which declined by 23 0 thousand last week  In the U S   the Philly Fed Manufacturing Index is expected to rise to 15 1  while jobless claims are forecast to increase to 216 thousand  On Friday  there are key events on both sides of the border  Canada releases GDP and retail sales  while the U S  will publish Final GDP  durable goods orders and consumer confidence 
The Federal Reserve delivered the goods as far as a rate hike  marking the fourth rate hike of the year  The benchmark rate is currently in a range between 2 25 and 250 percent  However  the U S dollar is broadly lower on Thursday  as the markets had expected a more dovish message in the rate statement  There was speculation that the Fed would  compensate  investors with a very dovish statement  given that the markets have been in turmoil for weeks and the U S  economy appears to be cooling down  However  the Fed seems bent on continuing to raise rates in 2019   most significantly  policymakers did not remove the critical phrase  further gradual increases  from their statement  At the same time  the dot plot forecast was lowered for 2019  from three rate rises to two  This marks a U turn for the Fed  as back in October  Fed Chair Jerome Powell talked about continuing to raise rates until the  neutral rate  range was met  This range has been somewhat unclear  allowing Powell to say on Thursday that the  lower end  of the range has been achieved 
Just a few months ago  the markets were predicting a  rate hike every quarter  for 2019  but such heady talk has disappeared  as Fed policymakers have responded to economic data which is pointing to slower growth  The policy of gradual rate hikes bears much of the responsibility for the volatility in the equity markets  and the message from the Fed that more hikes are coming will likely mean that the volatility will continue in December and into the New Year  This will likely translate into volatility for the Canadian currency  which is sensitive to the level of risk appetite on the part of investors

183287,404803,ADP,U S  November Payrolls  Has Job Growth Peaked ,opinion,"Hiring growth slowed in November among US companies  according to this morning s update of the ADP Employment Report  Payrolls increased 179 000 last month  down from 225 000 in October  As expected  the annual pace of growth also ticked lower   just barely   although rounding the year over year change to one digit leaves the year over year trend at a healthy 2 0  for a second month   the fastest rise in over two years 
 Job growth is strong  but has likely peaked   says Mark Zandi  chief economist of Moody s Analytics  which co produces the numbers with ADP  NASDAQ ADP  

 This month s report is free of significant weather effects and suggests slowing underlying job creation  With very tight labor markets  and record unfilled positions  businesses will have an increasingly tough time adding to payrolls  

A fractionally softer year over year trend in private payrolls is expected in today s estimate from the Labor Department  echoing the outlook for US GDP growth   The Capital Spectator s point forecast for the one year change in the government s payrolls report for November  scheduled for release on Friday  Dec  7  is 1 9   down slightly from October s 2 0  rise   a gain that matches September s annual increase  The back to back advances in the last two updates mark the strongest year over year gains in two years  but that trend appears set to wilt  albeit fractionally in November 
Although the projected downshift in the annual trend for payrolls is expected to be measured  Zandi s observation that employment growth has peaked appears set for confirmation in the published figures in the December update and beyond 

The projections are based on averaging forecasts from eight models  each using a different methodology and offer a different set of pros and cons  Numerous studies over the years advise that combining forecasts from different models generally improves the accuracy of the estimates relative to the projections from any one model   For an example of the literature on the topic  see this summary   Here s a summary of the eight models used to generate the forecasts above  Seven of the models use univariate methods   analyzing the indicator under scrutiny in isolation   while the eighth model draws on multiple indicators  All the analytics are generated in R 
Exponential smoothing state space model  the average forecast is used from 100 simulations based on bootstrap aggregating via the forecasting package  The data set is the historical record for the target indicator 
Autoregressive integrated moving average model  the average forecast is used from 100 simulations based on bootstrap aggregating via the forecasting package  The data set is the historical record for the target indicator 
Neural network model  the average forecast is used from 100 simulations via the forecasting package  The data set is the historical record for the target indicator 
Na ve model  this forecast simply extracts the last data point and assumes that it will prevail for the next 12 months

183290,404806,ADP,A 200K Nonfarm Payroll Is Non Event,opinion,"Market volatility remains elevated  in part because of confusion over comments by Washington officials re Sino U S trade war this week  The supposed de escalation of trade tension coming out of the G20 seem to be somewhat misleading and has led to aggressive selling of risk assets and the buying of sovereign bonds 
The VIX has jumped back above 25  and the U S dollar has come under modest pressure  The U S 10 year yield has slumped to  2 8   level not seen since this summer  The 2 year yield has fallen even faster  resulting in benchmark steepening despite a continued inversion at the belly of the curve  2 10s  13 bps  
Trade tensions between the world s two largest economies   U S and China   just got trickier with the arrest of the CFO and daughter of the founder of Huawei  in Canada  at the request of the U S  The U S has been probing Huawei over possible violation of sanctions against Iran

Russia remains the key  Moscow could contribute a maximum of  150K bpd cut  but the Middle East dominated OPEC insists Russia cut by  250K 300K bpd 
Yesterday s  179K increase in the ADP s  measure of private employment in November supports the theory that the official non farm payrolls figures due this morning will show a similar 190K  gain  That would represent a slowdown from October s reading  but should still be enough to convince the Fed to raise interest rates again later this month

183294,404810,ADP,Why Automatic Data Processing  ADP  Is A Great Dividend Stock Right Now,opinion,"All investors love getting big returns from their portfolio  whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  However  when you re an income investor  your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments 
While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments  income investors hone in on dividends  A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  and investors often view it by its dividend yield  a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long term returns  with dividend contributions exceeding one third of total returns in many cases 
Automatic Data Processing in Focus
Automatic Data Processing  ADP  NASDAQ ADP   is headquartered in Roseland  and is in the Business Services sector  The stock has seen a price change of 17 93  since the start of the year  Currently paying a dividend of  0 69 per share  the company has a dividend yield of 2 29   In comparison  the Outsourcing industry s yield is 0 48   while the S P 500 s yield is 2 02  
In terms of dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  3 16 is up 25 4  from last year  Automatic Data Processing has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 7 98   Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company s payout ratio  a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  ADP s current payout ratio is 60   This means it paid out 60  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
ADP is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 is  5 27 per share  which represents a year over year growth rate of 21 15  
Bottom Line
From greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages  investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  But  not every company offers a quarterly payout 
Big  established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  but it s fairly uncommon to see high growth businesses or tech start ups offer their stockholders a dividend  Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  With that in mind  ADP presents a compelling investment opportunity  it s not only an attractive dividend play  but the stock also boasts a strong Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  ",2018-12-13,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-automatic-data-processing-adp-is-a-great-dividend-stock-right-now-200368222,200368222
183306,404822,ADP,Dollar Regains Ground As Investors Rush From Stocks To Bonds  Aussie Additionally ,opinion,"The US stock markets closed sharply lower overnight while treasury yields also dived  Such patterns continue in Asia  seeing major indices pressured while JGB year yields also drop  There are clear flows out of stocks into bonds  Fed has already turned less hawkish with Chair Jerome Powell s turn last week  US and China also announced trade truce  The current development argues there are problems lying deeper in the global economy 
In the stock markets  DOW dropped  799 36 pts or  3 10  overnight to close at 25027 07  S P 500 lost  3 24  while NASDAQ declined  3 80   Technically  it s actually not a a surprise as DOW is seen as in medium term correction from 26951 81 high  Thus  it s common to have a down leg in such corrections  But DOW s failure to break even 26000 with the rebound is a disappointment and a sign of lack of confidence  In Asia  Nikkei dropped sharply to as low as 21708 82 but pares back some losses  It s now down  0 67  at 21887  Singapore Strait Times is down  1 0   Hong Kong HSI is down  1 84  while China Shanghai SSE  LON SSE  is down  0 68  
In the treasury markets  US 10 year yield closed below 3  level for the first time since September  More importantly  10 year yield dropped sharply by  0 68 to 2 924  30 year yield dropped even deeper by  0 100 to 3 178  US yield curve is inverted between 3  and 5 year and that s another development that worried investors  It should also be noted that German 10 year bund yield closed at 0 264 yesterday  lowest since May  and less than half of October high at 0 577  Japan 10 year JGB yield dropped to as low as 0 053 earlier today  and hit the lowest since July  And  10 year JGB yield hit as high as 0 166 just back in early October  So  the movements in the bond markets are rather drastic 
In the currency markets  Australian Dollar is overwhelmingly the weakest one for today  The Aussie suffers double blow of risk aversion and large GDP miss  Sterling follows as the second weakest as Prime Minister Theresa May s debate of her Brexit deal in the parliament didn t go too well  Swiss Franc is the third weakest  For today  Dollar is now the strongest one  followed by Canadian and then Euro 
China MOFCOM on US China trade talk  Will implement specifics as soon as possible
China s Ministry of Commerce issued an extremely brief Q A statement today regarding the results of Xi Trump summit  In short  the MOFCOM said the meeting was successful  And  the economic and trade teams from both sides will actively promote the work of negotiations within 90 days in accordance with a clear timetable and road map  Most importantly  China pledged to implement the specifics   sooner the better  
Yesterday  Trump sounded positive with his tweet and said  President Xi and I want this deal to happen  and it probably will   But he also noted that is a real deal doesn t happen   I am a Tariff Man   And even now  he added   We are right now taking in  billions in Tariffs  
BoJ Wakatabe  Inflation only halfway to target  may revert to deflation
BoJ Deputy Governor  Masazumi Wakatabe said today that the first characteristic of the current economy is it s being  widespread   And it s  bring about benefits to a wide range of economic entities   And  the second characteristic is that  inflation rate turning positive    which is different from the case in the mid 2000s  
On outlook  he reiterated the bank s rhetorics that the economy is expected to continue on an  expanding trend   But he also noted various risks including US China trade friction  On prices  he said CPI is likely to  increase gradually  as the economic expansion continues 
Though  Wakatabe also warned that for now  inflation remained at around 1    only halfway  to 2  target  And   in a case where downward pressure is exerted on the economy again  it may revert to deflation  Thus  it s appropriate to continue with the  large scale monetary easing  
Australia GDP grew merely 0 3  in Q3  Aussie pressured broadly
Australia GDP grew merely 0 3  qoq in Q3  just half of expectation of 0 6  qoq  That s also a sharp slow down from Q2 s 0 90   On annual basis  GDP growth slowed to 2 8  yoy  well below expectation of 3 4  yoy  In November Monetary Policy Statement  RBA projected GDP growth to be at 3 5  in 2018  And it s now highly likely to miss such projection  Based on the steep slowdown in momentum  it s getting doubtful if 2019 forecast of 3 25  growth would be met  And  RBA might need to revise down its projections in the next MPS in February  But after all  the slowdown will firm up the case for RBA to continue to stand pat throughout 2019  and probably deeper into 2020 
Also from Australia  AiG perfomance of services index rose to 55 1  up from 51 1  From China  Caixin PMI services rose to 53 8  up from 50 8 and beat expectation of 50 8 
BoC to keep policy rate unchanged at 1 75 
Bank of Canada is expected to keep its policy rate unchanged at 1 75  today  after a rate hike of 25 bps in October  Despite bets of another move this month  we believe policymakers would take a wait  and  see mode to assess the impact of the sharp fall of oil prices on Canada s economy  Another focus is BOC s forward guidance  whether Governor Stephen Poloz would stick to his hawkish stance that the policy rate would need to rise to the neutral rate would be closely watched

183308,404824,ADP,EUR USD  EUR Drifting As German And EUR Services PMI Within Expectations,opinion,"EUR USD is almost unchanged in the Wednesday session  Currently  the pair is trading at 1 1338  down 0 05  on the day  On the release front  German and eurozone services PMIs both softened in November  German Final Services PMI dropped to 53 3  matching the estimate  Eurozone Final Services PMI dipped to 53 4  above the estimate of 53 1  Eurozone retail sales posted a gain of 0 3   marking a 4 month high  This beat the estimate of 0 2   On Thursday  OPEC members are meeting in Vienna  The US will release ADP  nonfarm payrolls  unemployment claims and the ISM Non Manufacturing PMI 
In France  the  yellow vest  protests are continuing  despite the about face by the government  which agreed to suspend a controversial fuel tax  The riots have paralyzed Paris  and hotels and restaurants have been particularly affected  The demonstrations began in protest of the fuel tax  but have grown into a massive protest against the Macron government  If the protests continue  French GDP for the fourth quarter could be negatively affected 
German Services PMI dropped to its lowest level since April  as the eurozone s largest economy continues to post weak numbers in the fourth quarter  On Monday  Manufacturing PMI dropped to 51 8 in November  down from 52 2 points in October  This marked a fourth straight downturn and was the lowest reading since April 2016  The global trade war has taken a bite out of German exports and a slowdown in the eurozone economy has dampened manufacturing growth in Germany  Consumer indicators are also pointing downwards   last week  GfK Consumer Climate dipped to an 18 month low  while retail sales fell by 0 3   its first decline since July  Consumers are holding tighter to the purse strings  which is hurting economic growth  This does not bode well for the eurozone economy  as the German economy is often a bellwether for the rest of the eurozone

The sharp risk off flows that greeted traders on the start of Asia open dissipated a bit when London came on line helped by positive comments from China Commerce ministry on the state of US China trade negotiations 
USD JPY dropped to a low of 112 58 at the start of Tokyo trade when a sloppy open in US equity futures and reports of an arrest of Huawei executive sent risk reeling on concerns of renewed global tensions  The Huawei was arrested in Vancouver to be extradited to US on violation of US sanctions against Iran  While the incident threatens to become a major diplomatic confrontation  for now both sides appeared to be restrained about the matter  but the situation could certainly become much worse should US decide to prosecute

Oil slips below  52 a barrel  completes hourly top reversal
BOJ s Kuroda  Fed s Beige Book highlight fading growth prospects
Key Events
Global stocks sold off this morning and futures on the S P 500  Dow and NASDAQ 100 slumped at the Asian open  pressuring CME which operates the US futures and options exchange to intermittently halt trading  US Treasurys jumped  boosting the dollar  as investors shifted to risk off on multiple macro headwinds  including a high profile arrest linked with US sanctions against Iran 

The STOXX Europe 600 gapped down 0 74  on open and extended its slide to 2 26  by late European morning  with all sectors in red territory  The pan European benchmark s 4 4  plunge since Monday s peak marks the biggest three day loss from its highest levels since early November to its lowest levels since December 2016  Technically  the index completed  subject to a close confirmation  an H S continuation pattern since mid October  bearish in a downtrend  Even more worryingly  it is signaling the end of a return move to a massive H S top reversal since May 2017 
In the earlier Asian session  Hong Kong s Hang Seng tumbled 2 47  after Huawei s CFO Meng Wanzhou was arrested by Canadian authorities on Saturday  The daughter of the Chinese smartphone and IT giant s founder faces extradition to the US  on allegations she violated US sanctions against Iran  The move threatens to end the current US Sino trade ceasefire  re initing fears over the strained negotiations between the two countries  and can therefore explain the US equity futures selloff 
Global Financial Affairs
Adding to triggers for the US futures plunge was the downbeat economic outlook posted by Bank of Japan s Governor Haruhiko Kuroda  who warned economic risks from abroad could be severe  Kuroda s remarks compounded the Federal Reserve s Beige Book report  which showed fading optimism over growth prospects at US firms  even as most districts continued to report a modest expansion 

The general risk off tone increased demand for US Treasurys  pushing the yield on 10 year notes below 2 9   Ten year yields reached the lowest level in almost three months upon paring most of today s decline  which brings them yet nearer to 2 year rates  underpinning worries that a yield curve inversion may soon herald an economic downturn 
Technically  today s trading may be forming a bullish hammer  upon reaching the uptrend line since March when the trade war started 

The dollar rebounded from earlier losses  despite the USD negative equity selloff and a potential move by the EU to increase the use of the euro in the energy field  to become less dependent on the dollar

183315,404831,ADP,New Spanner In US China Relations Weighs On Risk Appetites,opinion,"Overview  The global capital markets were fragile amid trade uncertainty and economic slowdown fears  News that Canada arrested the CFO of Huawei on behalf of the US  ostensibly for violating the embargo against Iran triggered an almost immediate risk off wave that has extended the equity markets losses  sending core bond yields lower  with the US 10 year slipping below 2 9   and underpinning the dollar against most currencies  with the notable exception of the Japanese yen and Swiss franc  Oil prices are unwinding the gains scored earlier in the week amid some skepticism that OPEC  will agree on the magnitude of cuts that will impress the market 
Asia Pacific
The US and China were not in sync about what was agreed at the G20 meeting  There were contradictions and miscues among the Americans themselves  The US President penchant for overselling and then retreating is being played out again with China  but also North Korea  which reports suggest is developing a new weapon and perhaps a new secret test location may have been discovered  With reports that China was already making good on its promise to buy more US agriculture goods and energy  the arrest of the CFO from Huawei in Canada has earned the ire of Chinese officials and kept global investors on the defensive  Although it is not related to US China trade dispute  it does play into ideas that 1  trade is only one of several issues US and Chinese interests clash and 2  there is much distrust between the two largest economies and military powers 
Despite better macro news today  the Australian dollar has not been able to shrug off yesterday s disappointment over the Q3 growth  which was half of what was anticipated  0 3  vs  0 6    Australia s 10 year bond yield is falling through 2 5  to its lowest level since the middle of last year  Today s data includes a smaller than expected October trade deficit and slightly better retail sales  The trade shortfall narrowed to A 2 2 bln from a revised A 2 94 bln  while retail sales rose 0 3  after a 0 2  gain in September was revised to 0 1   The Australian dollar is the weakest of the majors today  losing about 0 75   It had started the week knocking on  0 7400 and today is testing  0 7200  This area corresponds to a 50  retracement of the Aussie s gains since the low for the year was recorded in late October    0 7020   The next retracement level is found near  0 7165  which is also the mid November low  The New Zealand dollar is holding up better  but it is still paring its recent gains  With today s slippage  the Kiwi filled the gap created by Monday s sharply higher opening  The next support is seen near  0 6850  where an option for about NZ  200 mln will expire today  
The decline in yields and equities is helping lift the Japanese yen to marginal new highs for the week  Yesterday s dollar gains above JPY113 were rejected and the greenback slipped slightly below JPY112 60  A trend line connecting the year s low from March   JPY104 55  and October low   JPY111 40  has been tested in recent days  It is found near JPY112 55 today  There are some large options expirations today     1 57 bln at JPY112 75 80 and   2 0 bln at JPY113 00 10  That said  the intraday technicals suggest the greenback is overextended to the downside in the European morning and a recovery  at least in early North American is likely  
Europe
Brexit continues to hog much of the oxygen  The two expert opinions this week  the first suggesting that the UK can unilaterally rescind the invocation of Article 50 and the second  the UK legal opinion  published yesterday  warns that the backstop for the Irish border could indeed be indefinite has shaken up the debate  Until now  it looked like it was going to be the negotiated plan or an exit with no agreement  However  while there had been some murmurings along the way  the possibility that the UK does not leave the EU is beginning to be taken more seriously  One large US bank increased their subjective odds of the UK not leaving to 40   
In addition to Brexit  another important concern for investors is the economic strength ahead of next week s ECB meeting  Earlier today  Germany reported its third consecutive increase in factory orders and this reinforces the sense that the eurozone s largest economy is emerging from the soft patch that saw the economy contract in Q3  However  the economic momentum is weak  Factory orders rose 0 3  in October  but September gain was cut to 0 1  from 0 3   and on a year over year basis the contraction actually deepened to  2 7  from a revised  2 6   initially  2 2   
Italian and Greek bonds are treated like risk assets and are under pressure today like other risk assets  However  there are other challenges in Europe  Although the French government reversed itself  at least temporarily on the petrol tax  the  yellow vest  protest appears to have grown well beyond its origin and widespread demonstrations are expected this weekend  Without much fanfare  the French premium over German Bunds is at its widest for the year today  The results of last week s election in Andalusia  a traditional Socialist stronghold  raises questions over the minority government s ability to pass the 2019 budget next month  It needs to make a deal with nationalist forces in Catalonia and Basque  An election early next year cannot be ruled out  Tomorrow  Germany s CDU meets and will pick a Merkel s replacement 
The euro is in less than a third of a cent range  It appears trapped between two expiring options strikes today  There are 1 2 bln euros at  1 13 and roughly 2 bln euros at  1 1350 60  Just in case this is not sufficient  there are 1 4 bln euros at  1 1380 as well  Sterling is in about a half a cent range above  1 2700  It is inside yesterday s range  which is inside Tuesday s range  The intraday technicals appear to favor the downside 
North America
The Bank of Canada concluded its policy meeting yesterday with dovish hold  It still says that it will remove all the accommodation  return to neutral   but its economic assessment was significantly less confident than previously  The downward revisions to back data  pointing to weaker growth and recent negative developments make the central bank question whether the economy is really bumping against capacity constraints  The implied yield of the March 2019 BA futures contract had fallen from 2 57  in early November to 2 39  before the Bank of Canada meeting  It shed another seven basis points to reach its lowest level in four months  2 32    Bloomberg calculates from the OIS that the odds of a January hike have fallen from 80  at the start of last month to 55  before the meeting and a little below 25  now  The US dollar had weakened to about CAD1 3165 to start the week after the G20 meeting and the favorable spin put on the US China talks and Russia and Saudi Arabia s pledge to renew their cooperation  The US dollar reached CAD1 3400 yesterday  a marginal new high for the year  in response to the Bank of Canada s dovish statement and has extended its gains to almost CAD1 3450 today  Governor Poloz speaks  text will be available around 8 30 ET and the presentation to Toronto s CFA will be followed by Q A  The market will be sensitive to his comments ahead of the November employment report and the October merchandise trade balance tomorrow 
There is a full slate of US economic reports today and the EIA oil inventory data will be reported as well  a day later than usual due to yesterday s government closure   Perhaps the ADP  NASDAQ ADP  private sector jobs estimate  which steals some of the thunder from tomorrow s official report  is the most important  It is to show around 195k increase after 227k in October  Although the weekly jobless claims report is not going to shed light on tomorrow s report  a drop in claims today will lend credence to ideas that the recent rise may be a bit of a quirk and related to holidays and disasters  cf  California fires and lingering effects of the hurricanes  US trade figures and factory orders  with revised durable goods orders  may be helpful for economists to forecast Q4 GDP  but may be overshadowed by the other data and ahead of tomorrow s national jobs figures 
The S P 500 is poised to gap lower at the open after finishing Tuesday on its lows near 2700  There is some chart based support that in the 2647 2650 area  Last month s low was set next 2630 and the October low was closer to 2600  With the US 10 year yield slipping below 2 90   the next important area is 2 80

Friday also promises to be busy  Germany releases Industrial Production  and the eurozone will publish jobless claims and GDP  The U S will release three key employment indicators   nonfarm payrolls  wage growth and the unemployment rate  The week wraps up with UoM consumer sentiment 
After a string of disappointing releases out of Germany  there was some good news on the manufacturing front  Factory orders posted a gain of 0 3  for a second straight month  This follows a lukewarm Manufacturing PMI release earlier in the week  Although the reading of 51 8 was within expectations  it marked a fourth monthly downturn and was the lowest reading since April 2016  The global trade war has taken a bite out of German exports and a slowdown in the eurozone economy has dampened manufacturing growth in Germany  On Friday  Germany releases industrial production  which is expected to edge up to 0 3  
Now that there is a respite in the tariff war  can the U S  and China narrow their differences in just a few weeks  There are a host of issues that need to be addressed  including repeated charges by the U S  that China is engaged in theft of U S  intellectual property  The markets have been very sensitive to the trade dispute  and the upcoming negotiations between the U S  and China  with the likely ups and downs  promise to have a significant effect on the currency markets 
The  tariff truce  between the U S and China is welcome news after months of an escalating trade war  but the two super economies remain far apart on a number of issues  including U S  accusations that China has been stealing U S  intellectual property  All indications are that reaching a deal will be difficult  The markets have been sensitive to development in the tariff tussle between the countries  and the likely ups and downs in the upcoming negotiations will likely affect the movement of gold prices in the coming weeks

183321,404837,ADP,USD Hit By Convergence Of Negative News,opinion,"Daily FX Market Roundup 12 06 2018 
By Kathy Lien  Managing Director of FX Strategy for BK Asset Management 
A convergence of bad news sent equities and currencies tumbling lower  U S  assets were hit the hardest Thursday with USD JPY falling to a fresh one month low and the Dow Industrial Average dropping more than 750 points intraday  Although stocks rebounded off the lows into the close  risk aversion remained  Thursday s sell off started with the decline in yields  Having breached 3  on Monday  10 year Treasury rates dropped below 2 9  on concerns about inflation and growth  But what really kicked off the decline in stocks and Asian currencies was the arrest of Huawei s CFO and Deputy chairwoman Wanzhou Meng  Huawei is one of China s largest tech companies and she is the founder s daughter  Her arrest has been met by anger and surprise and the Chinese government has asked for an immediate release  On paper  the Trump Administration wants to look like it is willing to work with China on trade but the seriousness of its intentions are questioned by this arrest  Instead of focusing on reconciliation and negotiation  the U S  has made it clear that it is not going soft on China  Unfortunately this is a very delicate time for negotiations and Thursday s move is a major setback to U S  Chinese relations  As a result  equities and currencies sold off aggressively on the fear that no agreements will be made in the next 90 days  triggering the next round of tariffs 
US data also failed to impress  Jobless claims increased  ADP  reported a much smaller than expected rise in employment and according to Challenger  Gray   Christmas  job cuts rose 51 5  y y in November  The trade balance also widened while factory orders and durable goods fell  The only good news was service sector activity  Instead of falling  the ISM non manufacturing index rose to 60 7 from 60 3 but the employment component of the report declined  None of this is good news for Friday s jobs report  As you can see by the list below  there are more reasons to believe that job growth slowed than improved in November  Not only did ADP report significantly lower employment change but the 4 week moving average of jobless claims increased  consumer confidence is down and most importantly  the employment component of the service sector activity report fell  The US labor market is one of the strongest parts of the economy but with stocks falling sharply over the past 2 months  businesses may have grown more conservative about hiring  Economists are looking for weaker job growth and if their outlook is confirmed  the dollar could extend its slide  Wage growth will also be important because that s where the forecast diverges with market sentiment  Economists are looking for an uptick in wages and if they are wrong  the sell off in the greenback could be even more significant with USD JPY eyeing a test of 112 
Arguments In Favor Of Stronger Payrolls
1  Employment Component of Manufacturing ISM rises to 58 4 from 56 8 2  Continuing Claims Drop to 1 63M from 1 67m
Arguments In Favor Of Weaker Payrolls 
1  ADP drops to 179k from 225k 2  Employment Component of Non Manufacturing ISM drops to 58 4 from 59 7 3  Challenger Reports 51  Increase in Layoffs 4  4 Week Average Jobless Claims Rises to 228K from 213k 5  University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index drops to 97 5 from 98 6 6  Consumer Confidence Index Drops to 135 7 from 137 9
Considering that the source of market anxiety is US Chinese trade relations  it s no surprise to see that the Australian dollar was the day s worst performing currency  Recent economic reports have been disappointing with the trade surplus shrinking instead of expanding  Although retail sales increased  the improvement was lost amid all of the negative news and risk aversion  Technically  AUD USD has fallen below the 20 day SMA for the first time since early November and this move signals a deeper correction toward 71 cents  NZD fell in sympathy with AUD but Canadian dollar traders have their own reasons to be worried  The first day of the OPEC meeting ended with no deal  Russia is resisting pressure to cut production and with its pushback  oil prices are down 2   Bank of Canada Governor Poloz also sounded less hawkish in his economic assessment   he said data since October has been disappointing and therefore the current level of rates is appropriate for the time being  They are worried about oil and the US China trade war and need to do more work to understand how much of a shock the oil decline will have on their economy  All of this implies that they are in no rush to raise interest rates again  USD CAD will be in focus on Friday with a number of factors affecting the currency including OPEC  US and Canadian employment reports 
Euro and sterling  on the other hand  traded higher against the greenback  No news is good news for EUR USD  which continues to trade in a tight range  Meanwhile  sterling traders are staying on the sidelines as they wait to see if the UK Parliament supports Prime Minister May s Brexit deal  A lot is at stake and despite talk of delaying the vote  May is pressing forward with the December 11 date  saying that it s her deal  no deal or no Brexit  The day before  the European Court of Justice is set to decide if Britain can halt Brexit  Next week is judgment week for Brexit  the pound and Prime Minister May so we expect further consolidation ahead of these big decisions ",2018-12-06,Kathy Lien,https://www.investing.com/analysis/usd-hit-by-convergence-of-negative-news-200365826,200365826
183326,404842,ADP,Dollar Looking For Economic Guidance Ahead Of Busy Week,opinion,"The US dollar is higher against most major pairs on Friday ahead of the G20 meeting  The greenback fell across the board on Wednesday after the market took the comments from Fed Chair Powell on interest rates to mean less rate hikes from the central bank  The minutes form the November Federal Open Market Committee  FOMC  showed all members are onboard with more rates hikes coming  very soon  but the dovish narrative was in full force and the dollar only partially recovered to end up slightly higher against major pairs on a weekly basis

The US economic calendar will kick off on Monday  December 3 with the release of the ISM Manufacturing PMI forecasted to slowdown slightly to 57 5  Non Manufacturing PMI will follow on Wednesday along the release of the ADP  NASDAQ ADP  private payrolls report  Friday  December 7 the U S  non farm payrolls  NFP  will be posted with another big jobs gain expected  and a 0 3 percent average hourly earnings gain 
Loonie Falls Despite USMCA Signing
The Canadian dollar is lower on Friday against the US dollar  The USD CAD gained 0 08 percent on Friday to put the loonie down 0 47 percent versus the greenback on the last week of November  Lower oil prices and a perceived slowdown of the economy could mean the Bank of Canada  BoC  remains data dependant and pushes back plans to raise interest rates until spring although there is still a 70 percent probability priced in for a January rate hike 

Canadian Prime Minister was joined by US President Donald Trump and outgoing Mexican President Pena Nieto to sign the USMCA with the G20 as the background  Trade is a big topic for discussion at the meeting  with a likely outcome of no deal reached between China and the United States  Canada is not immune to trade uncertainty despite renewing its partnership with the US and Mexico 
Oil prices fell on Friday and the market will focus on the outcome of the meeting between the OPEC and other major producers to once again agree on a crude production cut to stem the drop in energy prices 
November Blues for Oil as Oversupply is Balanced Against Production Cut Plans
Oil prices have plummeted more than 20 percent during November  Weather and geopolitical factors have disrupted supply  but as supply has recovered and in the case of Iran  waivers were issued  oversupply concerns took over pushing prices lower 

Russia has not committed to a new agreement to limit production  The deal with OPEC and other major producers stabilized prices  but as the US President pressures Saudi Arabia to keep prices low it must look to its own best interests 
Trade disputes have also impacted energy prices as global growth estimates have been slashed as more protectionist measures are introduced  Higher supply with shrinking demand have resulted in lower crude prices  with the OPEC trying to tackle the first part of the equation  The second production cut agreement is not a done deal at this point and comments from Russia do not hint at a strong commitment at this stage 
Gold Lower as Dollar Riding Risk Aversion Wave
The yellow metal ended November flat as risk events kept the commodity bid  while trade concerns and monetary policy boosted the US dollar  Gold has rejoined investor s portafolio as a safe haven  but still struggles to overcome its weakness against the US dollar as US triggered trade aversion has made the greenback the de facto refuge 

The U S  Federal Reserve is likely to hike in December with economic indicators validating the decision as US jobs and inflation continue to advance  Next year is a bigger question mark as the Fed will not be able to hike four times as in 2018 and the economy is expected to cool down  Gold is forecasted to trade higher next year as risk will remain  but the dollar will lose the support from the central bank

183334,404850,ADP,10 Reasons Why December Will Be Rocky For FX ,opinion,"November was a volatile month for US equities but this volatility did not translate into big moves for currencies  Unlike the Dow  which had a 3 200 point swing  trading ranges for pairs like the EUR USD and USD JPY were confined to 300 pips and the moves were not one way 
Trading ranges narrowed even further over the past week as investors shrugged off unexpected comments from President Trump on trade and Fed Chair Powell s views on interest rates  In many ways market participants have become desensitized to the musings of government officials  Actions speak louder than words and rather than believe what the administration is offering   threatening or speculating that the Fed could pause after hiking in December   traders prefer to wait and see how these meetings play out before taking any big positions  With that in mind  the US dollar extended its gains last week against all of the major currencies except for the Australian and New Zealand dollars  AUD and NZD benefitted from the hope that the next round of sanctions on China will be delayed 
December is packed with market moving events ranging from the G20 to the UK Parliament s Brexit vote  FOMC and OPEC  There s a lot at stake in each of these meetings which could make for a rocky time for currencies  Of all the events on this month s calendar  here are the 10 most important  This list does not even include this week s Reserve Bank of Australia and Bank of Canada monetary policy meetings  nonfarm payrolls and Canada s employment reports 
December s 10 Most Important Events

What If Trump Delays Chinese Tariffs 
This week in particular  the biggest determinants of how the dollar will move will be the meeting between US President Trump and Chinese President Xi  Fed Chair Powell s testimony to Congress and the non farm payrolls report  By the time you read this note  we will know whether President Trump has agreed to delay the next round of tariffs until further talks are held or proceed with them  It s doubtful that US and China could come to some far reaching agreement in Buenos Aires and ahead of the summit officials already tried to temper expectations that a deal would be coming noting instead that two parties are likely to extend their discussions into spring with US delaying any further tariffs for now  On the face of it that would seem like good news for the dollar  but in actuality  it is simply the absence of an additional negative and it remains to be seen how much help the buck would get from any such statement out of G 20  USD JPY and AUD USD are the most sensitive to the talks  but a more collaborative tone would be positive for all risk currencies  Further antagonism on the other hand would send USD JPY and other major currencies lower 
Fed Powell s Congressional Testimony Will Overshadow Nonfarm Payrolls
Meanwhile the biggest surprise last week came from Fed Chair Powell  The greenback fell quickly and aggressively after the US central bank head said interest rates are  just below  neutral levels because just a month ago  he said they are a  long way from neutral at this point   Considering that there s been no interest rate hikes since September  these comments tell us one of two things  which is either the Fed has finally figured out where the neutral rate is or they believe that a pause in tightening is necessary  Chances are it s the latter because economic data has been weakening  stocks have been falling and lower oil and gas prices restrict rather than encourage inflation  As a result  consistent rate hikes may no longer be needed  While a surprise  Powell s comments are not a game changer for the US dollar because investors are already pricing in less aggressive tightening  Fed fund futures show only one full rate hike for 2019 compared to the Fed s forecast for 3 hikes next year  Still  if Powell s semi annual testimony on the economy and monetary policy is less hawkish  it will be very difficult for the dollar to rally as it would confirm that the Fed is preparing to pause early next year  The non farm payrolls report comes after Powell s speech and will have a greater impact on the dollar if it confirms a slowdown in the economy  Good data like the ones that we saw last week including personal income  spending and the blockbuster Chicago PMI report won t have a lasting impact on the greenback

All The Reasons Why EUR Could Fall Further
In contrast  euro has been under pressure because data is weak and tariffs on autos could be levied at any time  Even ECB President Draghi is worried  In his speech last week  he described recent economic data as softer than expected and said that while some of the slowdown may be temporary  prevailing uncertainties call for patience  Draghi also felt that world growth momentum has slowed considerably and while inflation has been going up  it is expected to decline in the coming months  The central bank is still expected to end bond purchases in December but the usage of the words  at current time  to describe their plans to halt bond buying raised some concerns that they could reconsider if the global economy weakens materially over the next few weeks  Since we don t expect a shock in the financial markets before 13th of December monetary policy meeting  the ECB should go ahead with ending bond buys but the move could be diminished by dovish guidance and lower economic projections  There are no major Eurozone economic reports scheduled for release next week

Is The Brexit Vote Reversible  The European Court Of Justice Decides
Sterling also ended the week near its lows as the market waits for Brexit updates  Prime Minister May said that Brexit is irreversible but the European Court of Justice will decide on the 4th of December whether Britain could reverse this decision  If they say yes  it would spark a flurry of speculation about a second referendum that could plunge the UK into deeper uncertainty  If they rule no  it will kill any hope of returning to prior relations   so either way it s a lose lose for the pound  The most important date is the 11th of December   when Parliament votes on the current Brexit deal and between now and then we don t expect any meaningful recovery  This is true even though health of the UK economy will return to focus a speech by Bank of England Governor Carney and UK PMIs scheduled for release

RBA Has No Reason To Alter Neutral Bias
Commodity currencies will also be on the move with Reserve Bank of Australia and Bank of Canada monetary policy announcements this week  The Australian dollar is strong because despite all of China s trade troubles  Australia s economy is holding up well  Taking a look at the table below  the labor market is improving  consumer confidence is up and home loans have increased  But neither we nor the RBA knows how long this will last particularly with business confidence  service and construction activity slowing  As a result  the RBA will most likely maintain its cautiously neutral outlook  which should not have much impact on the Australian dollar  Instead  AUD USD could have a bigger reaction to the latest PMI reports  third quarter GDP and October retail sales  The risk is to the upside in our opinion because data has been good 

Will Oil Slide Curtail BoC Hawkishness 
The Bank of Canada on the other hand has more to consider  They raised interest rates at their last meeting and dropped the word  gradual  from their comment on future hikes and upgraded its assessment of exports and investments  These hawkish adjustments sent the Canadian dollar sharply higher and the market thinking about a strong tightening cycle next year  However oil prices have fallen sharply with the cost of crude dropping more than 25  since their last meeting  The price of Western Canada Select the primary blend sold by Alberta s oil sands fell another 12   However economic data hasn t been terrible  Retail sales are up  the unemployment rate is down  inflation is well above 2  and the manufacturing sector is growing strongly  So these economic reports justify the BoC hawkishness  If they disregard the decline in oil and continue to talk about the need to normalize monetary policy  1 33 could end up being the peak for USD CAD  While important  Canada s Friday employment report should be less market moving than the monetary policy announcement because by then we ll know where the BoC stands 

Meanwhile there was very little rhyme or reason to the outperformance of the New Zealand dollar last week because retail sales and the trade balance were significantly weaker than expected  The only explanation is that the oversold conditions of the currency allowed it to benefit the most from short covering when the US dollar started to fall ",2018-12-03,Kathy Lien,https://www.investing.com/analysis/10-reasons-why-december-will-be-a-rocky-month-for-fx-200364451,200364451
183337,404853,ADP,Investors Skeptical About U S    China Trade Negotiation,opinion,So it would seem market participants are walking back their enthusiasm a tad this morning  putting index futures in the red 24 hours after bidding up equities across the board in response to a U S  China trade deal  Not that there isn t much to like about a proposed 90 day cease fire on new tariffs  especially considering we were headed for an additional 25  tax on goods after the first of the year  But new questions have begun to emerge  such as  How sticky are these proposals Assuming for a moment everything stays peachy with the agreement  we still must contend with potential changes in attitude from Fed Chair Jerome Powell and his associates in the FOMC   less than a week after he reassured investors that the current interest rate was  just below  neutral  setting up traders to believe the Fed would stand pat once the quarter point hike expected December 19th is passed  The absence of trade tensions across the Pacific yesterday had the immediate affect of a run up in stocks  this continuing would put the onus back on the Fed to take a harder look at rate hikes in the new year And that s before considering November jobs totals  which we ll see beginning Thursday morning with the ADP   NASDAQ ADP   private sector employment report  followed by non farm payrolls from the U S  government s BLS results Friday before the bell  Jobs growth has only been going higher of late  with nearly 250K new jobs created in the month of October and another 200K expected last month  These numbers are more than double the amount our economy  needs  to offset retiring baby boomers from the workforce  The Unemployment Rate was 3 7  last month  and may be headed further down Obviously  more jobs is a good thing  and also satisfies one half of the Fed s mandate  full employment   But with sustained employment growth   which in this case goes well back into the timeline of the Obama administration   eventually comes increased wages  which can trigger inflation  which is the other half of the Fed s mandate  and feels 2  is ideal   For October BLS numbers  we saw a 3 1  growth in wages  if we see that again this Friday  while it s a very good thing for members of the workforce  it again may behoove the Fed to get busy with interest rate hikes beyond December Why  Because interest rates are largely designed to absorb inflation  and are generally expected to align atop wherever inflation numbers are  In fact  inflation percentages surpassing interest rates is called an  inversion of the yield curve   and that s important to economists because it has often signaled economic recession  We haven t talked about recession in the U S  for quite some time  but just the suggestion being re entered into the conversation can have a way of unnerving market activity We ll stay  data dependent  for now  and that means exhibiting patience  Expect the Fed to do the same  Powell gives another address tomorrow afternoon  ahead of new employment numbers  but his verbiage may point to their significance upon release later this week  Time will tell ,2018-12-03,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/investors-skeptical-about-us--china-trade-negotiation-200364880,200364880

The breakout through the descending trendline in the S P 500 was materialized in the first hour of cash trading  That was the missing piece to confirm our thesis of a constructive risk environment  encapsulated within a USD strength context  as per the active up cycles in the DXY and US yields  It was the last day of the month  so the market had to contend with FX rebalancing flows  which would always make this day more unpredictable in nature 
We should now be reverting back to a clean slate in terms of risk sentiment dynamics  hence judging by the cycles I am seeing  I expect JPY crosses to remain on the backfoot  while the USD should continue to find grateful buyers on dips  The present context would still justify European currencies  EUR  GBP  CHF  to trade heavy against the likes of commodity FX as the recovery in equities extends  but the positive Brexit headlines in the last 24h are likely to distort this   USD buy side flows confirm fresh hourly down cycleCycles   Levels  Subject to the US NFP outcome  the odds are on the rise of seeing a back to back bearish week with a close below the 50  fib retrac of last year s meteoric rise  If the weekly candle can make it sub the Aug 13 swing low  that would strengthen the case for an ultimate weekly downside target of 1 0845  On the daily  if sellers garner enough momentum through the 1 13 round number  the new sell side campaign could exploit a 65 70 pips leeway until the proj target of 1 1242 is reached  Don t rule out a potential rebound as we are at a crossroads here  Aug 15 validated swing low  On the hourly  the re grouping of sellers at the mid point of Wednesday s range honored with precision those avid enough to read price action  The rejection of a range s mid point is a great predictor showing us the potential directional resolution of range bound conditions 
Correlations   Volumes  The risk of an exhaustive move is fading as the latest 24h of tick volume activity show an increase in commitment  which reinforces follow through downside risks  The absence of profit taking at 5pm NY is another negative input  as it is the fact that sellers keep buyers trapped on the wrong side of the market judging by Wednesday s POC  1 1344   In terms of correlations  the German vs US 5 year yield spread keeps trending lower  just a stone s throw from claiming new multi year lows  Meanwhile  the other key driver  Italian premium vs German  is consolidating  which reduces the risk of acting as a key driver 
Drivers   Risk events  The Euro continues pressured via lower growth expectations in the EZ  poor showing in the latest EZ or Italian GDP   which raises the risks of a more cautious ECB  Besides  the Italian and Brexit conundrum is also weighing  In the last 24h  positive USD flows on month end rebalancing and upbeat ADP employment data anchored the currency further  as does the USD strength environment highlighted above  It s a public bank holiday in both France and Italy on Thursday  In the US we get the US manufacturing PMI 
GBP USD  First validated swing high in over 2 weeksCycles   Levels  Last Friday s weekly close told us a story  That the risk of the Aug 13 low being re tested was within sight  That s what we ve seen before a rather vigorous rebound off this support If the recovery can make it up towards 1 30  it would confirm a range in the weekly  while on the daily the down cycle remains firmly in place  Despite the pick up in GBP  there is still pending business to the downside to achieving the 100  fib proj target  The current ongoing buy side campaign could perfectly target a re test of the broken support turned resistance at 1 2930  The hourly is starting to provide the first tentative signs of a new up cycle in the making  I d be waiting for acceptance above the previous swing high to give the current recovery more credentials of its health 
Correlations   Volumes  The sequence of volumes fails to provide sufficient intentional clues in the last 24h  On the contrary  the depressed UK vs US 5 year yield spread valuation makes a test of 1 2930 a compelling opportunity to consider a re engagement in short side action all else being equal  Considering the USD strength environment we are in  it should assist this thesis 
Drivers   Risk events  Renewed Brexit optimism is behind the recovery in the Pound after UK  Brexit Minister Raab put a date  Nov 21  to a potential deal with the EU  In the coming 24h  UK manuf PMI and the BoE monetary policy are scheduled  while in the US we get the US manufacturing PMI 
USD JPY  Risk profile and daily structure suggest dip buyingCycles   Levels  The weekly structure remains unambiguously bullish as per higher highs and higher lows  Similarly  the daily has validated a new up cycle structure  which increases the chances of a follow through continuation inline with the main trend up  The acceptance above the previous swing high above 113 00 gives us a target of 114 37 to the upside  hence making the prospects of buy on dips an attractive proposition from a risk reward perspective  On the hourly  any setback down towards a backside retest of the broken trendline would start becoming tempting to add longs 
Correlations   Volumes  Wednesday s low volume bearish candle is far from being a concern for the interest of buyers  Besides  the risk environment should still see the market emboldened with an appetite to gain short yen exposure  especially amid up cycles in the DXY and US yields  leaving aside higher equities  It s a perfect scenario to see yen crosses retaining the buy side bias 
Drivers   Risk events  On Wednesday  the Bank of Japan kept its status quo and therefore acted as a non event  The Yen seems to have benefited from month end flows but nothing else to chew here  The upward bias is further supported by Wednesday s positive ADP  NASDAQ ADP  number out of the US  Today s US ISM manuf PMI is the next risk event to monitor  I d personally be looking to buy the dip 
AUD USD  Stubborn Aussie stuck mid point of the daily rangeCycles   Levels  On the weekly  we are still short of the ultimate target of 0 6892  but as a caveat  note that 0 70 could be acting as that point where a substantial reversal is seen  Nonetheless  the weekly remains in a firm downtrend  On the daily  last Friday s bullish absorption off 0 7050 head fake continues to play out as the market morphs into a newly established range between 0 7050 and 0 7150  with the current price stuck right in the middle  On the hourly  we are at risk of finding ourselves in yet another range after the violation of the ascending trendline  Acceptance above 0 7125 or below 0 7050 is needed to stimulate this market into new cycles 
Correlations   Volumes  As I reiterated several times  as correlations stand  one shouldn t expect the Aussie to be an outperformer by any means under this environment  Yes we have equities heading higher again  but gold is selling off  AUD     DXY is up  AUD     the Yuan keeps weakening towards the USD CNY 7 00 mark  AUD   and AU vs US yield spread remains depressed  AUD    No much to read from volumes in the last 24h 
Drivers   Risk events  The reduction in EM volatility alongside potential macro bids ahead of 0 70 are elements allowing the Aussie to stay better bid  The failure to go lower even as equities got wreaked havoc in recent weeks has been a strong statement of the market s determination to hold the ground above 0 70  Australian trade balance came better than expected for Sept  giving a boost to the Aussie once again early Thursday  Later in the US  the ISM manuf is the next key risk to monitor 
Important Footnotes

183364,404880,ADP,Pound Rises On Brexit Hope Awaits BoE,opinion,"The US dollar is higher against most major pairs on Wednesday  The Japanese yen and the British pound were outliers as they both rose in the session  The Bank of Japan  BOJ  kept monetary policy unchanged as expected earlier today  and the Bank of England  BoE  is anticipated to do the same  Positive Brexit comments today boosted sterling ahead of the central bank s Super Thursday 
US private payrolls beat expectations with a 227 000 gain
BoE rate to remain intact  but focus on press conference
Post Brexit trade deal deadline set for November 21
Pound Sensitive to Brexit Chatter
The GBP USD rose 0 60 percent on Wednesday  The currency pair is trading at 1 2778 ahead of Super Thursday  The Bank of England  BoE  will release its Inflation report  monetary policy summary  official bank rate and the votes from MPC members at 8 00 am EDT  BoE Governor Mark Carney will host a press conference at 8 30 am EDT 

Sterling is still 0 40 percent lower than the USD on a weekly basis as Brexit concerns continue putting downward pressure on the pair  The rebound on Wednesday came after a moment from UK Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said that the exit deal with the EU would be finalized by November 21  With less than a month to go it falls in line with what members of both negotiation teams have said  The deal is mostly agreed to  95 percent by some measure but the final stretch has proven difficult 
The backstop issue could be close to solved  but details are scarce and with this new line on the sand politicians are put under even further pressure to compromise if a deal is to be reached in time 
The Bank of England  BoE  will keep monitoring the situation as a failure to reach a deal would put the UK economy on the brink of a recession  Standard and Poor s published a report where the most immediate outcome could be a credit rating downgrade 
Despite the assurances from some politicians that a deal is very close  the probability of a no deal exit has actually gone up the market remains unconvinced given there have been few details on the actual agreement and a lot of time spent on the backstop 
Governor Carney has been clear on the risks of a no deal Brexit  and his comments on Thursday might cancel out the optimism based move in the pound 
Dollar Rides Strong Fundamentals to Overcome Euro
The EUR USD lost 0 22 percent on Wednesday  The single pair is trading at 1 1318 after strong US fundamentals have given a leg up to the US dollar  The ADP  NASDAQ ADP  private payrolls report exceeded expectations ahead of Friday s release of the U S  non farm payrolls  NFP   The US economy is forecasted to have added 200 000 jobs  The September NFP numbers underperformed  but weather disruptions due to Hurricane Florence were a factor 

A recovering stock market and more risk tolerance from investors took the US dollar higher against major pairs  Stronger US spending on Monday  consumer confidence on Tuesday and private payrolls and the employment cost index on Wednesday have given the greenback a strong argument to appreciate  Manufacturing is up next on Thursday and of course the biggest indicator in the market the U S  non farm payrolls  NFP  will be published on Friday 
The US dollar is on track to a 16 month high with solid fundamentals but also a fine balance of investor appetite for the safety of the big dollar  The data might not be impressive but it is consistent  that is something no other major economy can claim 
Gold Lower but Geopolitics Keep it in Play
Gold prices fell on Thursday  The yellow metal is trading at  1 214 after the US dollar recovered its mojo with strong fundamentals  US indicators this week have been solid  pointing to more monetary policy tightening by the U S  Federal Reserve  The central bank is heavily anticipated to hike in December with more to come in 2019 

Gold had lost some of its luster as a safe haven as rate differentials pushed investors to seek safety in currencies  The stock market sell off earlier this month triggered by US rate hike anxiety put the yellow metal back on investor s radars
Oil Tumbles on Oversupply Concerns Despite Strong Demand
Oil prices dropped on Thursday despite a the expected buildup in US crude inventories matching the forecast  and a larger drawdown in gasoline and distillates  The market is starting to price in a smaller than anticipated drop in crude exports from Iran as its biggest customers remain defiant on following US sanctions 

US oil stocks have risen for sixth consecutive weeks  but with product stocks decline the biggest factor behind the decline in energy prices was on what will happen in November when the US sanctions against Iran kicked in  Originally oil prices pointed to  100 or higher  until Russia and Saudi Arabia pledged to close the gap left  Now with production already rising  the question on how big will the gap be to begin with is making investors reconsider  If Iran and its customers find enough loopholes to avoid US sanctions there could be more supply than originally intended  putting the black stuff on the back foot

After chopping during the overnight session  the S P 500 futures opened Tuesday s RTH at 2641 25  and printed a 2635 75 low on the 8 30 CT bell  Strong buy programs immediately helped push the S P s up to the early high of 2675 25 just before 9 00  From there  the rest of the morning would be filled with broad  choppy ranges  as the ES went down to a mid morning low of 2645 50  and then up to a late morning high of 2673 75  before trading lower into the midday 
The afternoon saw a 2640 50 low at 12 30  and then the ES began to rally  chopping up to 2660 00  Afternoon buy programs eventually came in  pushing the S P up to a new high of day in the final hour at 2686 50  and then printed 2683 25 on the 3 00 close  before settling the day at 2684 50  up  41 00 handles  or  1 55

183369,404885,ADP,October  A Month To Forget,opinion,"Global equity markets ended a scary October on a slightly brighter note following a rebound on Wall Street during the final two trading days of the month  The Dow Jones industrial average rallied 933 points from Monday s lows  the S P 500 bounced more than 4   and similarly the heavy Tech weighted Nasdaq composite bounced 5 5  after a 14 4  decline 
Robust corporate earnings and bargain hunting for undervalued stocks led the pullback  but the fundamental story hasn t changed a lot yet  U S  interest rates remain on the rise  trade tensions are not over  and global economic growth still looks weak  This will create a tricky environment for investors on whether to focus on the macro outlook or valuations which are becoming much more reasonable than a year ago  What investors may be certain about is for volatility to remain elevated especially with the U S  midterm elections is just around the corner 
Despite the rally in equities  the Dollar rose to its strongest level in 16 months  reaching a high of 97 20 on Wednesday  The Greenback was supported by a larger than expected ADP  NASDAQ ADP  ADP employment report showing the U S  private sector payrolls increased by 227 000 in October  the highest in eight months  However  the Greenback couldn t hold its gains today as many major currencies reached significant support levels  particularly the Euro  For the Dollar to keep rallying it requires Friday s nonfarm payrolls report to beat economists  expectations  especially on wages  If wage growth accelerates further the Federal Reserve may have no excuse to turn less hawkish  thus providing further push to U S  Treasury yields 
The Pound rallied sharply today on reports that Theresa May had struck a deal with Brussels for British financial services companies to continue operating in European markets after Brexit  However  with the U K  remaining far from striking an agreement to resolve the Irish border issue  the currency gains may quickly evaporate  Traders  attention will turn to the Bank of England monetary policy decision today which is expected to keep interest rates on hold  While Marc Caney s speech and the Quarterly Inflation Report may move the Pound slightly  it s still all about the Brexit deal that will decide the fate of the currency

US and Asian stocks are boosted up on hope of resolution in US China trade tensions  Trump tweeted yesterday that the had  long and very good  conversation with Chinese President Xi Jinping  with  heavy emphasis on trade   He added the  discussions are moving along nicely  and meeting is being scheduled at the G20 summit in Argentina 
Separately  Xi said on CCTW state television that  the two countries  trade teams should strengthen contact and conduct consultations on issues of concern to both sides  and promote a plan that both can accept to reach a consensus on the China U S  trade issue   Chinese Premier Li Keqiang also said yesterday that  we do hope that China and the United States will meet each other halfway and work together in the spirit of mutual respect and equality

Focus turns to Non Farm Payrolls
Dollar had a roller coaster ride this week and is not trading in deep red against Aussie and Kiwi  mixed in general  The greenback will at least need some very solid set of job data to bring back some lives to it  Markets are expecting NFP to show 200k growth in October  Unemployment rate is expected to be unchanged at 3 7   Average hourly earnings are expected to grow 0 2  mom 
Other job related data released so far were generally solid  ADP  NASDAQ ADP  employe blew the market with 227k growth in private sector jobs  Initial jobless claims averaged October at 211k  which remained ultra low in historical standard  The employment component of ISM manufacturing did dropped 2 pts to 56 8  But that s still well above 50  US consumer confidence surged to 137 9 in October  highest in 18 years  There is little worry in the headline number and the unemployment rate  The questions remains on whether wage growth is strong enough to warrant Fed s rate path

EU floats compromised Irish backstop solution for Brexit
The Financial Times reported that EU is floating around a compromised Irish border backstop proposal to solve the ongoing Brexit negotiation impasse  The proposal was briefed to EU ambassadors earlier on Wednesday 
Under the proposal  EU would lay out the full terms of a  bare bones  whole UK customs union in the withdrawal agreement  It would apply a common external tariff on imports from outside the EU and rules of original  Meanwhile  under the backstop  Northern Ireland would remain in a deep customs union with the EU  applying all  customs code  and following EU s regulations for goods and agri food products  The stop gap measures would remain in place until concluding the permanent UK EU trade deal 
UK Prime Minister Theresa May is expected to tell the EU whether UK is open to the compromise next week  And that would be a key factor to determine if a November Brexit summit is to be held 
BoE stood pat and delivered hawkish signals
Yesterday  BOE voted unanimously to keep all monetary policies unchanged in November  The Bank rate stays unchanged at 0 75   Meanwhile  purchases of gilts and corporate bonds remain at 435B pound and 10B pound  respectively  The central bank sent a more hawkish than expected message to the market  While reiterating  gradual and limited  monetary stance  BOE noted more rate hikes might be needed as there could be overheating in the economy in 2H19  Meanwhile  its desire to hike interest rates could materialise amidst smooth Brexit

Japan PM Abe  Won t proceed with sales tax hike if there s global crisis
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe appeared to be backing down on his stance regarding the planned sales tax hike next year  For now  he s still on track to raise sales tax from 8  to 10  in October 2019  He also pledged to mitigate any impact on the economy by providing counter measures 
However  he told parliament that  Our basic stance is that we will proceed with the sales tax hike  But it s wrong to be too rigid about this and raise the tax rate no matter what   And   we will proceed with the tax hike unless the economy is hit by a shock of the scale of the collapse of Lehman Brothers   which  would be something like a global economic crisis or a huge earthquake

183385,404901,ADP,Are You Looking For A High Growth Dividend Stock  Automatic Data Processing  ADP  Could Be A Great Choice,opinion,"Whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  all investors love seeing their portfolios score big returns  But when you re an income investor  your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments 
Cash flow can come from bond interest  interest from other types of investments  and of course  dividends  A dividend is the distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  it s often viewed by its dividend yield  a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long term returns  and in many cases  dividend contributions surpass one third of total returns 
Automatic Data Processing in Focus
Automatic Data Processing  ADP  NASDAQ ADP   is headquartered in Roseland  and is in the Business Services sector  The stock has seen a price change of 17 13  since the start of the year  Currently paying a dividend of  0 69 per share  the company has a dividend yield of 2 01   In comparison  the Outsourcing industry s yield is 1   while the S P 500 s yield is 1 96  
In terms of dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  2 76 is up 9 5  from last year  In the past five year period  Automatic Data Processing has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 7 98   Looking ahead  future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  ADP s current payout ratio is 64   meaning it paid out 64  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
ADP is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 is  5 18 per share  representing a year over year earnings growth rate of 19 08  
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits  It s important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout 
High growth firms or tech start ups  for example  rarely provide their shareholders a dividend  while larger  more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  During periods of rising interest rates  income investors must be mindful that high yielding stocks tend to struggle  With that in mind  ADP presents a compelling investment opportunity  it s not only an attractive dividend play  but the stock also boasts a strong Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  ",2018-10-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/are-you-looking-for-a-highgrowth-dividend-stock-automatic-data-processing-adp-could-be-a-great-choice-200352294,200352294

183395,404911,ADP,Dollar Regains Control As Stocks And Yield Rebound  Facing Key Levels Against Euro,opinion,"Dollar index jumped overnight and breached 96 98 key resistance  with the help from rebound in stocks and treasury yields  But strength of the greenback mainly centered against Sterling  Swiss Franc and Yen  It s holding in range against Euro  Canadian and Australian for the moment  As for today  Sterling is recovering broadly  mainly because it s digesting this week s sharp losses  Australian Dollar and Yen are the weakest for now instead 
DOW staged a strong 431 72 pts  or 1 77  rebound overnight  S P 500 and NASDAQ also closed up 1 57  and 1 58  respectively  All three indices are staying in lower low  lower high pattern for the near term  But oversold condition could limit downside for a while  10 year yield closed up 0 23 at 3 110  30 year yield closed up 0 027 at 3 356  Both are held in near term consolidation  But 30 year yield displayed more resilience  In Asia  at the time of writing  Nikkei is up 2   Singapore Strait Times up 0 66   China Shanghai SSE  LON SSE  is up 1 07   Hong Kong HSI is up 0 91   Japan 10 year JGB yield is up 0 0024 at 0 124  Markets sentiments seem to be back to normal 
Technically  with Dollar s rebound  focus will now be on 1 1335 temporary low in EUR USD and break will put focus on 1 1300 key support level  At the same time  GBP USD might also challenge 1 2661 key support  USD CHF could challenge 1 0067 key resistance  We ll see if Dollar could power through these key levels  or be rejected from there 
BoJ stands pat  lowers inflation forecasts once again
BoJ left monetary policy unchanged today as widely expected  by 7 2 vote again  Short term policy interest rate is held at  0 1   On long term interest rate  BoJ will continue with asset purchases to keep 10 year JGB yield at around 0   G  Kataoka dissented again  pushing for more monetary easing due to  heightening uncertainties regarding development in economic activity and prices   Y  Harada dissented because  allowing the long term yields to move upward and downward to some extent was too ambiguous  
In the Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices report  BoJ noted that the economy is likely to continue to grow above potential in fiscal 2018  For fiscal 2019 and 2020  the economy is expected to continue on an  expanding trend   partly supported by  external demand   But growth is projected to decelerate due to a  cyclical slowdown  in business fixed investments and the scheduled sales tax hike 
CPI continued to show  relatively weak developments  comparing to growth and labor market  Though  BoJ maintained that  further price rises are likely to be observed widely and then medium  to long term inflation expectations are projected to rise gradually   Thus  CPI will gradually increase towards 2  target  On risks  BoJ said both economic and prices risks are  skewed to the downside  
In the updated economic projects  fiscal 2018 growth forecast was downgraded from 1 5  to 1 4   Growth forecasts for 2018 and 2019 were kept unchanged at 0 8   Fiscal 2018 core CPI projection was lowered notably to 0 9   down from 1 1   For fiscal 2019 and 2020  ex sales tax hike core CPI projections were also lowered  to 1 4  and 1 5   down from 1 5  and 1 6  respectively 

Also  note that the ex sales tax hike core CPI projections are notably lower than April s forecasts  at 1 8  in fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020 respectively 

Also from Japan  consumer confidence dropped to 43 in October  Housing starts dropped  1 5  yoy in September  Industrial production dropped  1 1  mom 
BoC Poloz  Interest rate hike to continue to neutral at 2 5 3 5 
Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz reiterated the central bank s stance to continue with rate hike to the House of Commons Standing Committee on Finance yesterday  In his prepared remarks  Poloz noted that there were  some very positive developments  in the Canadian economy  with  solid momentum  and it  continues to operate near its capacity   Also  growth is  relatively broad based across sectors and regions   He expected the economy to  growth at a rate slightly above its potential over the projection horizon   And  while there could be further volatility in inflation in coming months  our core measures remain firmly around 2 per cent   He also highlighted  trade and household indebtedness  as two main risks 
Overall  Poloz said even with last week s rate hike to 1 75   monetary remains stimulative   BoC s policy rate is  still negative in real terms   The current estimated neutral is in range of 2 5 3 5   Poloz said  policy rate will need to rise to neutral to achieve our inflation target   Though  the   appropriate pace of increases will depend on our assessment at each fixed announcement date of how the outlook for inflation and related risks are evolving   BoC will take into account how the economy adjusts to higher rates  as well as global trade policy developments and their implications on inflation outlook 
Australia CPI slowed to 1 9  yoy in Q3  AUD USD dips briefly
Australia CPI rose 0 4  qoq  1 9  yoy in Q3  versus expectation of 0 5  qoq  1 9  yoy  The annual rate slowed quite notably from 2 1  yoy  Trimmed mean CPI was unchanged at 1 8  yoy  Weighted median CPI was also unchanged at 1 7  yoy 
Chief Economist for the ABS  Bruce Hockman said   Annual growth in the CPI fell back below 2 per cent in the September quarter 2018  Modest rises in housing costs  including rents  utilities and property rates  and a fall in child care out of pocket expenses  saw a subdued rise in the CPI this quarter  
AUD USD dips after the release but quickly recovered 
New Zealand ANZ business confidence rose to  37 1  next RBNZ move more likely a cut
New Zealand ANZ Business Confidence improved to  37 1 in October  up from  38 3  Confidence is weakest in agriculture   62 8  and best in construction   14 8   Activity Outlook index dropped  0 4 to 7 4  Manufacturing  16 2  is the strongest  possibly due to lower New Zealand Dollar exchange rate  Services ranks second  12 6   Retail   7 8  and agriculture   2 3  are weakest 
On monetary policy  ANZ noted that  The Reserve Bank argued in the August Monetary Policy Statement that ticking along wasn t going to do the job  in terms of getting CPI inflation sustainably back to target  We therefore continue to believe that while the impacts of higher wage growth  higher oil prices  and the weaker currency certainly mean there s no hurry  it remains the case that an eventual OCR cut is more likely than a hike 
Also from New Zealand  building permits dropped  1 5  mom in September

German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Monday that she would not seek re election as chair of the Christian Democrats  Merkel made the announcement after her party had a poor result in a regional election  The news sent the euro lower briefly and pushed German bond yields higher  Merkel said she will stay on as Chancellor until her term ends in 2021  but her announcement is another dent in the Iron Lady s authority  which has diminished as her CDU party has slipped in popularity  Eurozone confidence indicators have looked sluggish recently  and Merkel s decision to slowly wind up her political career will not help matters

183408,404924,ADP,This week will determine the dynamics of the next months,opinion,"Trading on Tuesday did not make changes to the technical picture  The continued strengthening of the us dollar led to the formation of a number of signals on the time frames H1 and H4  indicating today the possibility of local corrective movements  At the same time  the main question of the current week  which was mentioned in yesterday s overview  remains valid  will the possible update of annual minimum values lead to the formation of a convergence between the minima and the corresponding values of technical analysis indicators on the daily time frame  In the case of a positive response  it will be possible to predict with confidence the completion of the medium term period of growth in the market value of the US dollar and the market reversal  Otherwise  the negative dynamics of the EUR USD and GBP USD currency pair quotes will continue  A lot of important statistics are coming out today  The morning is opened with a meeting of the Bank of Japan  As expected  the Japanese regulator left the rate at the same level  Comments from representatives of the bank did not bring surprises  which may lead to a local decline in the USD JPY pair quotes  as indicated by the formation of a divergence between price peaks and MACD values  In the middle of the day are published the important statistics on consumer inflation in the Eurozone  A significant weakening of the European currency in recent years led to the quotes of the EUR USD pair close to the minimum values of the current year  observed in mid August  Inflation indicators  in the case of strong statistics  can stop the drop in prices  otherwise the pair has all the chances to update the annual minimums  A similar pattern is observed for the pair GBP USD  The British pound is under strong pressure from sellers  which is a consequence not only of the general strengthening of the dollar in the world currency markets  but also the unresolved problem of Brexit  However  tomorrow s meeting of the Bank of England makes the players to take a waiting position  which should stabilize the situation  In the afternoon  there will be a report on the US labor market from ADP  NASDAQ ADP   These statistics precede the publication on Friday of Non Farm Payrolls  In addition  data on Canadian GDP for August will be released  according to the actual results of which the USD CAD pair will be answered on the question  will the quotes be able to break through the long term resistance in the area of 1 3135 1 3150  The technical picture gives a negative answer  Thus  today s day is replete with a large amount of important information  The trading sessions of the current week are decisive for the further dynamics of the international currency market in the coming months before the New Year holidays 
EUR USD
Today morning  the EUR   USD quotes stabilized around 1 1330 1 1340  Thus  as a result of the negative dynamics observed on Tuesday  prices again approached the area of the minimum values of Friday  It is worth noting that the decline in quotations in the last few days led the pair to the lows of the current year  observed in mid August  The important value of trading in the remaining days of the current week is the probability of testing the specified area of the lows and the formation of technical signals on the daily time frame  As a result  it will be possible to predict the further dynamics of the pair in the next weeks  That about was written in the Monday s overview  Today  in the first half of a day  a slight upward correction is expected  This assumption is based on the presence of convergence on the H1 time frame  highlighted on the chart with a yellow marker  between the minima and the values of the MACD indicator  In the middle of the day  statistics on consumer inflation are published by results of October  Players  expectations are at around 2 1   y y   In case of strong values of the indicator  the growth impulse will receive support  Otherwise  the quotes may return to their minimum values  Zones of support and resistance today are in areas 1 1330 1 1340 and 1 1380 1 1400  respectively 

GBP USD
By the morning of today  the GBP USD pair quotes fell into the area just above the 1 2700 mark  At the same time  on the GBP USD H4 chart  there is a convergence between local price minima and MACD indicator values  highlighted on the chart with a yellow marker   This fact indicates the probability of a corrective price movement in the first half of regular trading and the return of prices to the area of 1 2780 1 2800  observed in the night from Monday to Tuesday  Further dynamics of the pair will depend on the important statistics published today  which will determine the mood of the traders to the US dollar  Important for the British pound is tomorrow s meeting of the Bank of England  If the management of the regulator emphasizes the problems associated with Brexit  the pair can resume the negative dynamics in order to test the area of the minimum values of the current year  According to the results of trading this week  the answer will be received to the question about the probability of a reversal in the market and determining the direction of the pair until the end of this year  The support zone is located in the area of 1 2690 1 2710  green oval   The resistance zone is present in the range of 1 2800 1 2820  red oval  

USD JPY
As a result of the positive dynamics  the USD JPY pair reached the area of 113 20 113 30  At the same time  the formation of divergence between the highs of prices and the values of the RSI and MACD indicators is recorded on the H1 time frame  This fact indicates the probability of today s local price decline to the support area 112 65 112 80  At the same time  it is worth bearing in mind that important statistics published today may have an impact on the dynamics of the pair  which can change the general mood of the players on the further strengthening of the US dollar in world currency markets  The support zone is the range 112 65 112 80  green oval   The resistance zone is located in the area of 113 25 113 40  red oval  

USD CHF
The situation in USD CHF is unchanged  According to the results of yesterday s trading session the quotations have stabilized in the area above the 1 0000  At the same time  the technical picture still indicates the probability of a market reversal and a decline in quotations  In favor of this scenario  there is a persistence of divergence between local maxima of prices and the values of the MACD indicator  As noted in yesterday s overview  the situation should be resolved soon  Support and resistance zones are located in areas 0 9940 0 9950  green oval  and 1 0030 1 0050  red oval   respectively 

USD CAD
During the last few trading sessions  the USD CAD quotes periodically test for strength the line of multi year resistance passing through the 1 3150 mark  On the attached chart  USD CAD H1  there is a divergence between the maximum prices and the corresponding values of the RSI and MACD indicators  which allows us to suggest the probability of a reversal of the dynamics and a decline in quotations  It is worth noting that data on Canada s GDP in August may have a significant impact on the course of trading in this pair  The support zone is in the range 1 3085 1 3095  green oval   Resistance is still located at 1 3135 1 3150  red oval  

GOLD
Yesterday and this morning  gold prices continued to decline  On Wednesday morning  prices are around 1215 00 1216 00  It is worth noting that in this range were the minimum prices in the period of October 12 15  On the attached graph  this area is marked with a green oval  Based on this  we can assume the presence in the area of customer support  Today  the support area is located in the same range  In case of its breakout  prices may fall to 1200 00 1210 00  which was the area of maximum prices in the period from mid August to 11 October  when a rapid increase in quotations was recorded  Today  it is predicted that the quotes of gold will be in the range bounded below by the indicated support zone  From above  prices are limited to the lower boundary of the medium term channel in the area of 1229 00 1230 00  Thus  the support zone is located in the area of 1215 00 1218 00  green oval   Resistance is the range 1229 00 1230 00  red oval ",2018-10-31,Airat Sattarov,https://www.investing.com/analysis/this-week-will-determine-the-dynamics-of-the-next-months-200352443,200352443

183428,404944,ADP,BR Or ADP  Which Outsourcing Stock Is Better Positioned ,opinion,Outsourcing is the practice of handling over the control of certain operations  services or processes  which were previously done by the company s internal staff and resources  to external resources or third party contractors  A company may choose to outsource its operations for several reasons such as to reduce and control operating costs  increase focus on its core business competencies  thereby improving efficiency  strengthening its market share and getting access to better external resources  To avoid government rules and regulations  outsourcing is also adopted Per a report by   the global outsourcing industry generated  88 9 billion in revenues in 2017  The outsourcing trends are expected to be more favorable going ahead in 2018 on a worldwide basis Despite multiple tailwinds  outsourcing services have certain disadvantages  Companies need to constantly negotiate terms with their third party contractors to enjoy easy services  At times  third party vendors need to access the company s internal data for proper functioning and this is where the security factor comes in  Given this backdrop  it is not a bad idea to undertake a comparative analysis of two Outsourcing Services stock   Broadridge Financial Solutions Inc    NYSE BR   and Automatic Data Processing Inc    NASDAQ ADP    Both the stocks are part of the broader   one of the 16 Zacks sectors   While Broadridge has a market capitalization of  13 71 billion  Automatic Data Processing s market cap is  61 36 billion Zacks Rank   Style ScoreCurrently  both the stocks carry a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  However  with an  of B  Broadridge enjoys an edge over ADP in terms investment attractiveness  ADP has a VGM Score of C  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2 offer the best investment opportunities for investors  Thus  the company appears to be a compelling investment proposition at the moment Price PerformanceBroadridge clearly scores over ADP  considering its price performance in a year s time  Shares of Broadridge have gained 54 6   outperforming the S P 500 s and  s rally of 13 7  and 25 2   respectively  ADP has gained 37 6   underperforming both the S P 500 Composite and the industry  Earnings ExpectationsEarnings growth along with stock price gains is often an indication of a company s strong prospects ADP s current quarter earnings are projected to grow 38 5  compared with 9 9  for Broadridge   However  for full year 2018  the situation is just the opposite with ADP s expected earnings growth rate of 16 8  being lower than Broadridge s growth rate of 34 5  For 2019  ADP s earnings are expected to register 12  growth compared with 6 9  for Broadridge  Moreover  the long term expected earnings per share growth rate of 11 3  for ADP is higher than Broadridge s growth rate of 10  While Broadridge s earnings are expected to grow higher than ADP in 2018  the situation is expected to reverse in 2019 and the long term Earnings Estimate Revisions The direction of estimate revisions serves as an important pointer when it comes to the price of a stock  Based on the earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and full year 2018 and 2019  in the last 60 days  ADP appears to be more favorably placed The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current quarter earnings improved 9 8  for ADP against a decrease of 2 1  for Broadridge For 2018  the consensus estimate improved 4 3  for ADP and 4 2  for Broadridge  Estimates for 2019 moved up 3 4  for ADP and 2  for Broadridge Earnings Surprise HistoryThe earnings surprise history of a stock helps investors have an idea of the stock s performance in the previous quarters Broadridge and ADP have an impressive earning surprise history  with their earnings surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the previous four quarters However  Broadridge enjoys an edge over ADP as it delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 23 6  as against 5 2  for the latter Net MarginNet profit margin helps investors evaluate a company s business model in terms of pricing policy  cost structure and operating efficiency  and shows how good it is at converting revenues into profits  Hence  a strong net profit margin is preferred by all classes of investors With a TTM net margin of 13 6   ADP not only compares favorably with the industry s figure of 11 8  but also has a lead over Broadridge s 9 4  TTM net margin  Broadridge does not compare favorably with the industry in terms of TTM net margin ValuationThe Price to Earnings Ratio  P E  metric is used to measure a company s value relative to its earnings  In general  a lower number or multiple is usually considered better than a higher one The trailing 12 month price to earnings multiple for Broadridge and ADP is 28 8 and 34 2  respectively  while that of the industry is 28 3  Although both the companies are overvalued relative to the industry  Broadridge has an edge with a lower P E ratio  The EV EBITDA metric is used to compare two stocks within the same industry and offers a clearer picture of a company s valuation because it includes debt  The ratio is often used in addition to the P E ratio We observe that while Broadridge and ADP have EV EBITDA ratios of 16 3 and 21 0  respectively  the industry s figure stands at 13 6  Although both the companies compare unfavorably with the industry  Broadridge is better positioned with a lower EV EBITDA value  Though both the stocks look overvalued relative to the industry  Broadridge is undervalued compared to ADP ROE and ROCReturn on Equity  ROE  is the measure of a company s efficiency in utilizing shareholders  funds  The trailing 12 month ROE for Broadridge and ADP is 45 3  and 45 7   respectively  while that of the industry is 34 7   Although both the companies clearly score above the industry  ADP is a better choice than Broadridge with a higher ROE  Return on Capital  ROC  for Broadridge and ADP is 21 3  and 30 4   respectively  while the industry s ROC stands at 22 9   This implies that ADP generates a higher return on investment than its industry Bottom LineOur comparative analysis shows that Broadridge is superior than ADP when considering price performance  valuation and earnings history  ADP scores over Broadridge in terms of net margin  long term expected earnings growth  earnings

The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of All
Last year  it generated  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  47 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce  the world s first trillionaires   but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early ",2018-06-13,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/automatic-data-processing-hits-52week-high-on-investor-day-200324735,200324735
183434,404950,ADP,Has The Rebound In US Consumer Spending And Income Peaked ,opinion,"Most economic measures continue to paint an upbeat profile for the US  but yesterday s September report on consumer spending and income hints at the possibility that softer growth is approaching  There s still no clear sign of rising recession risk on the immediate horizon  but it s reasonable to wonder if the surge in economic activity following Donald Trump s election two years ago is now in the process of reversing and giving way to a lesser rate of expansion 
One school of thought for explaining a possible slowdown  the previous round of tax cuts that juiced the economy are beginning to fade  Add to that the ongoing risk of the current trade war between the US and China  which could get worse  and the Federal Reserve s plans to keep raising interest rates and it s clear that the macro headwinds are blowing harder 
The stock market is certainly discounting a higher risk of trouble these days  The S P 500 Index continued to fall in Monday s trading  slumping to the lowest close since early May 
 Changes in stock prices can have an adverse effect on spending  at least in the short term   advised Joseph LaVorgna  chief economist for the Americas at Natixis  in a research note last week   If the recent market swoon persists  consumer spending could slow over the next few months with negative effects on retail sales and GDP growth  
Slightly slower growth is on display in the latest release for personal spending and income  The year over year changes on both counts eased in September  according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis  Personal consumption expenditures downshifted to a 5 0  annual pace from 5 5  in the previous month while disposable personal income grew 4 9  vs  the year earlier level  the second month of slightly softer increases  It could be noise  of course  but for the moment it s reasonable to consider the possibility that the recent revival in the consumer sector has peaked 

True  the latest annual increases still align with a healthy trend  which suggests that the nine year old economic expansion will roll on for the near term  But yesterday s results add more weight to the view that the Trump rebound has run its course and that something approximating a  normal  rate of growth   read slower   is coming 
That s certainly the message in the Atlanta Fed s preliminary estimate for GDP growth in the fourth quarter  The bank s GDPNow model yesterday  Oct  29  projected that output will rise by a modest 2 6  in Q4  well below Q3 s 3 5  and Q2 s 4 2   It s still too early in the current quarter to take that nowcast seriously  but it s fair to say that there s a case for expecting economic deceleration to roll on until new numbers tell us otherwise 
 We think U S  growth may have just peaked   says Michael Gapen  chief US economist for Barclays  LON BARC  Capital  He advises that consumer and government spending is on track to slide in the coming months  A key factor  the fading support from income tax cuts 
To be sure  expectations of a slowdown still leave room for a moderate expansion to roll on into next year  Fears of a new recession  in short  are still premature  at least for now  based on the recent business cycle profile 
Meantime  all eyes will focus on this Friday s employment report for October for an update  At the moment  the outlook is encouraging  Econoday com s consensus forecast calls for a solid rebound in private sector jobs growth via a 180 000 gain  up sharply from a 121 000 rise in September  If the estimate is right  the year over year trend for private payrolls will increase by 1 9    a tick below September s 2 0  gain  a two year high   but still strong enough to deflect any concern that a downturn is imminent 
Alternatively  if Friday s numbers disappoint  the crowd may assume the worst  For an early hint of what may be in store at the end of the week keep an eye on tomorrow s ADP  NASDAQ ADP  Employment Report for October  Economists are looking for a softer gain in US private employment via this estimate  a 178 000 increase  according to Econoday com s consensus forecast  down from September s strong 230 000 advance  But that s enough to keep the year over year trend for the ADP numbers growing at a healthy rate of nearly 2 0  
In short  if the consensus outlook prevails this week for October payrolls  the economic outlook will remain upbeat ",2018-10-30,James Picerno,https://www.investing.com/analysis/has-the-rebound-in-us-consumer-spending-and-income-peaked-200351794,200351794
183447,404963,ADP,Italexit Scenario And GDP Data In Focus,opinion,So the markets took a bath in red sauce yesterday  following weekend drama regarding the difficulties Italy faces with a hung parliament  leading to fears that the third largest economy in the European Union will voluntarily exit the EU    Italexit   to coin a phrase  The led to further game theory that said instability in the EU as a whole may eventually lead to a breakup of the Eurozone overall But we are a long way from there  it s far too early to be a true believer in the destruction of the EU  We see this in the pre market rebound this morning  with much of the losses from Tuesday being buoyed back up in early trading today  And  as Zacks Exec VP Kevin Matras said earlier today  Also this morning we see new economic data to help lead new market narratives now that Q1 earnings season is passed  and ahead of the Fed s expected quarter point rate hike in the next couple weeks  The two main headlines in this regard today   the second read on Q1 GDP and the ADP   NASDAQ ADP   private sector payroll survey   are both lighter than expected Starting with the ADP numbers for May  which as usual hit the tape ahead of the big non farm payrolls and unemployment read Friday  we saw a total of 178K new private sector jobs for the month  This is beneath the expected 187K among a consensus of analysts  and April s headline was revised way down by 41K new jobs to just 163K total  I say  just  163K  though in reality this is still consistent with a healthy employment market in the private sector  But ratcheting this far down from a psychologically pleasing 204K last month is worth noting The Services sector again led the way with 114K new jobs in May  but Goods producing jobs performed very well compared to recent history with 64K jobs  The Construction industry outperformed all others for the month with 39K  and Manufacturing also pulled its weight with 14K new jobs  Trade Transportation marked the biggest disappointment  with a loss of 23K new jobs for May What s interesting about this number is that Trade Transportation has been among the biggest growth industries for new jobs over the past quarter or longer  and even led all industries back in March  Trucking  rail and logistics may all play a part in the pullback  and it may suggest higher inventories have put some slack in supply and demand  Trucking  in particular  is also one of those industries having trouble finding enough skilled labor to fill open positions   as such  it would give credence to economists  views that a tight labor market will result in employment strains for certain industries Q1 GDP was taken down 10 basis points this morning on the second read to 2 2   Even though we see strong business investment   9 2  in the quarter   personal consumption came in at a paltry 1   falling from its initial read  If we may be so bold as to try and wring a narrative from this  take a look at the big corporate tax cut boon from early this year  businesses are feeling strong and putting their extra capital to work  whereas most individuals have not felt the wealth effect as of Q1 2018 Looking ahead to Q2 GDP  things improve markedly  an average estimate of 3 4  for our current quarter is very healthy  especially for an economy of the U S  s size  and also helps soften the blow of the 2 2  in seasonally slower Q1  For those looking for the first  3  full year GDP in many years  the recent high was  2 9  in 2015   quarterly growth around three and a half percent for the next three quarters should get us there  and then some  It will be interesting to see if a cap emerges due to the aforementioned skilled worker strain Considering how this may affect the Fed s decision to raise interest rates next month  which is pretty well baked into everyone s expectations right now  Another quarter point raise will bring the federal funds rate to a range of 1 75 2 00   marking the first time since before the Great Recession to see interest rates with a 2 handle This would also be the second hike in calendar 2018  with possibly two more to go in the back half of the year  However  odds of both a third and fourth rate hike have fallen recently  however  possibly with one eye on the situation in the Eurozone  But for now  the U S  is doing its part leading the way in economic strength ,2018-05-29,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/italexit-scenario-and-gdp-data-in-focus-200320572,200320572

183506,405022,ADP,TRU Or DNB  Which Stock Is More Attractive Post Q1 Earnings ,opinion,The first quarter reporting cycle has seen strong earnings and revenue growth  which is expected to reach its highest level in seven years According to the latest   S P 500 members from the  have already reported financial numbers and recorded top  and bottom line growth of 22 5  and 6 8   respectively in the first quarter of 2018  The report also states that 80 8  surpassed revenue estimates and 88 5  outperformed on the earnings front The sector benefited from a strong U S  economy  reduced tax rates  robust manufacturing and non manufacturing activities  easing of the U S  dollar and momentum in oil prices  Notably  it has performed well in the past year compared with the benchmark  It has gained 25 3   significantly outperforming the S P 500 s rally of 19 9  in the said time frame Given this backdrop  let s do a comparative analysis of two Business   Information Services stocks   TransUnion   NYSE TRU   and The Dun   Bradstreet   NYSE DNB    Both companies reported better than expected first quarter 2018 results with year over year earnings and revenue growth As both carry a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   we are using certain other parameters to find out which company is better positioned following their earnings release  You can see  Price PerformanceTransUnion clearly scores over Dun   Bradstreet in this regard  TransUnion has gained 65 7  in the past year  massively outperforming the  s rally of 28 8   Dun   Bradstreet  on the other hand  has underperformed the industry with a gain of 17 9  Earnings Estimate Revisions The direction of estimate revisions serves as an important pointer when it comes to the price of a stock  Based on second quarter and full year earnings estimate revisions in the last 60 days  TransUnion is better placed  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second quarter earnings increased 5 3  for TransUnion against a decrease of 0 7  for Dun   Bradstreet  For 2018  estimates for TransUnion and Dun   Bradstreet have increased 5 2  and 4 3   respectively Earnings ExpectationsEarnings growth along with stock price gains is often an indication of a company s strong prospects  TransUnion s second quarter earnings are projected to grow 27 7  while that of Dun   Bradstreet are expected to increase 7 1    Looking at the full year 2018 picture  TransUnion s earnings are projected to grow 29 4  while that of Dun   Bradstreet are expected to increase 15 1    Thus  TransUnion has an edge over Dun   Bradstreet in terms of quarterly and yearly projected earnings growth Net Margin Net profit margin helps investors evaluate a company s business model in terms of pricing policy  cost structure and operating efficiency  and shows how good it is at converting revenues into profits  Hence  a strong net profit margin is preferred by all classes of investors Even though readings for both the companies compare unfavorably with the industry s figure of 19 3   TransUnion has a lead since its TTM net margin is higher at 17 6   compared with Dun   Bradstreet s 16  ValuationThe Price to Earnings Ratio  P E  metric is used to measure a company s value relative to its earnings  In general  a lower number or multiple is usually considered better than a higher one The trailing 12 month price to earnings multiple for TransUnion and Dun   Bradstreet is 37 and 16 4  respectively  while that of the industry is 26 8  Dun   Bradstreet has an edge with a lower P E ratio and is undervalued relative to the industry The EV EBITDA metric is used to compare two stocks within the same industry and offers a clearer picture of a company s valuation because it includes debt  The ratio is often used in addition to the P E ratio We observe that while TransUnion and Dun   Bradstreet have EV EBITDA ratios of 23 7 and 8 7 respectively  the industry s figure stands at 17 4  Thus  Dun   Bradstreet is better positioned with a lower EV EBITDA value and is undervalued relative to the industry TransUnion is overvalued relative to the industry in terms of both the metrics Bottom LineOur comparative analysis shows that TransUnion scores over Dun   Bradstreet in terms of net margin  expected earnings growth and earnings estimate revisions  Its share price performance over the past year has also been relatively better  Dun   Bradstreet has an edge solely in terms of valuation So  even though TransUnion seems expensive compared to Dun   Bradstreet  it is likely to generate higher capital appreciation Key PicksSome other top ranked stocks in

Matras screens for companies showing their  first  profit  and explains why they are ones to watch Screen of the Week written by Kevin Matras of Zacks Investment Research Winning Stock Picks from the Best Industries for Job GrowthEvery week the government and other entities release economic reports that cover all areas of the economy   from retail sales to housing  to international trade to consumer sentiment In fact  on virtually any given day there could be anywhere from one to a handful of reports And while the financial media does cover them  they usually focus on headline numbers without doing a deeper dive This is unfortunate because within these reports often exists money making details that can quickly be uncovered with just an extra few minutes of reading For example  in the Employment Situation report  it details what sectors saw the most new jobs or labor force expansion  and which ones contracted I can remember countless times where that report got me into the right sectors and industries at the right time before anybody else was talking about them In fact  I still remember getting into housing in early 2012 while everybody else was staying as far away from it as possible  But  after seeing construction jobs continue to rise in report after report after report  I knew the housing market had turned  And that was one of the first alerts to the housing recovery   for those who knew where to look But the headline number and the obligatory one or two sentence write ups on many news sites missed the best part of the story by not going the extra mile

183701,405217,ADP,EUR USD  Pending NFP,opinion,"Strong data on the number of jobs in the private sector  which surpassed expectations  strengthened the dollar  According to yesterday s Automatic Data Processing Inc  NASDAQ ADP   and Moody s Analytics data  in May the number of jobs in the private sector of the US increased by 253 000  which is significantly better than the forecast of 185 000  In April  the indicator was 174 000 seats 
The growth rate of the number of jobs last month reached a maximum since 2014  pointing to the positive outlook for the US labor market 
Now  market participants expect that the NFP report  which is published today at 12 30  GMT   will be equally strong  Investors often consider the ADP report as the harbinger of the NFP  which is published on the first Friday of the month  Among other data published by the US Department of Labor  the average hourly wage  forecasted at 0 2   compared with 0 3  in April    Non Farm Payrolls  projected to grow by 185 000  against 211 000 in April    the unemployment rate in May  which will be 4 4   against 4 4  in April  
The Fed pays particular attention to data on the number of jobs  and by many investors they are perceived as the most important indicator of the state of the American economy 
If the official data from the labor market coincides with the forecast or will be better  then the probability of an increase in the rate at the June meeting of the Fed will approach 100  
In this case  the dollar will receive strong support  Against the background of the same difference between the monetary policies of the ECB and the Fed  the pair EUR USD will be under pressure in the medium term 
Unlike representatives of the Fed  key figures of the ECB leadership repeatedly stressed that it is still early to abandon the program to stimulate the economy of the Eurozone 
Despite yesterday s decline  the pair EUR USD remains positive  being above the short term support level 1 1185  200 period moving average on the 1 hour chart  
EUR USD remains within the ascending channel on the daily chart  Technical indicators on the weekly  monthly charts are still on the buyers  side 
Today  in anticipation of the publication of the NFP  to make a forecast  practically  is useless 
The reaction to the publication of data on the labor market can be unpredictable  Often  a strong movement at the time of publication should be a strong rollback  sometimes overlapping the initial movement  Volatility can well exceed 100 points 
Nevertheless  the range between levels 1 1260 and 1 1185 was formed  It is likely that today s breakout of the range  if it takes place  will set the direction for the further movement of the EUR USD pair  at least until June 13  when the Fed s meeting begins

183748,405264,ADP,Insperity  NSP  To Report Q3 Earnings  What s In Store ,opinion,"Insperity  Inc    NYSE NSP   is set to report third quarter 2016 results on Nov 1  Last quarter  the company reported a negative earnings surprise of 25   It has an average negative earnings surprise of 8 11  over the trailing four quarters  despite beating estimates in two quarters 
Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors to Consider
The company is well placed to benefit from the booming professional employer organization  PEO  industry  strong client retention and growth in worksite employees in the long run  
However  Insperity has not achieved the desired levels despite increasing average worksite employees  WSEs   which remain a major concern  In addition  a sluggish global macro environment can lead to headcount reductions at client companies  An increase in health care costs does not bode well for Insperity as it is one of the major components of operating expenses  Furthermore  client attrition amid increasing competition from the likes of Automatic Data Processing Inc    NASDAQ ADP   and TriNet Group  Inc  remain concerns 
For the third quarter of 2016  Insperity projects adjusted earnings in a range of 72 cents to 78 cents a share  Adjusted EBITDA is projected to be  30 million to  32 million and average worksite employees  WSEs  are expected in a range of 170 000   170 700  representing growth of 14  to 14 5  
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Insperity is likely to beat earnings this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  Insperity currently has a 0 00  ESP because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 63 cents  Please check our  that enables you to find stocks that are expected to come out with earnings surprises
Zacks Rank  Insperity has a Zacks Rank  3  which when combined with a 0 00  ESP  makes surprise prediction difficult 
We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
Stocks to Consider
Here are a couple of stocks that  as per our model  have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter

183750,405266,ADP,Paylocity Holding  PCTY  Q1 Earnings  What s In The Cards  ,opinion,"Paylocity Holding Corporation   NASDAQ PCTY   is set to report first quarter fiscal 2017 results on Nov 3  Last quarter  the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 16 67   Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors to Consider
Paylocity reported better than expected results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016  wherein the loss was narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate and revenues topped 
We remain positive about Paylocity s regular investments in SaaS technology  Notably  over the past few quarters  clients moving from traditional payroll service providers to the company s SaaS based services generated a significant portion of Paylocity s revenues  Therefore  we believe that regular investments in technological upgrades  along with product innovations  will continue to boost the company s top line over the long run  Such initiatives are also likely to have a positive impact on fiscal third quarter results 
Furthermore  higher adoption of Paylocity s ACA dashboard application  which specializes in tracking employee count  employee status and health care plan affordability  will act as a tailwind 
However  competition in the payroll processing sector from new entrants as well as existing players such as Automatic Data Processing  Inc    NASDAQ ADP    Oracle Corporation  NYSE ORCL  and SAP SE  DE SAPG  remains a major headwind

183778,405294,ADP,ADP  Dividend Aristocrat for Income Investors,opinion,"With more than four consecutive decades of dividend increases  Automatic Data Processing  NASDAQ ADP  is one of my favorite   The company s excellent dividend growth track record is the result of its reliable business model 
ADP benefits from providing mission critical services  generating a high percentage of recurring revenues  maintaining a strong client retention rate  running asset light operations  and throwing off loads of free cash flow each year 
Although ADP s stock has nearly doubled the market s performance over the last decade  the company has plenty of room for continued growth 
Not surprisingly  ADP scores extremely well for Dividend Safety and Dividend Growth and is the type of business I like to own in our Top 20 Dividend Stocks portfolio  Let s take a closer look at the business 
Business Overview
ADP has been in business for more than 65 years and is one of the largest providers of human capital management  HCM  solutions in the world  ADP offers a wide range of cloud based software solutions and services  which companies use to pay  recruit  staff  manage  and retain employees 
According to the company s   over 50 million people around the globe depend on ADP for accurate pay  reliable benefits administration  effective performance management  or other human resource services 
The company generates most of its revenue from providing payroll services  handles the preparation of employee paychecks  pay statements  journals  and summaries  but has meaningfully expanded its suite of products over the last decade to cover most of the HCM spectrum 
The HR Business Process Outsourcing market has been a major focus  In this market  ADP offers fully integrated outsourcing solutions that enable companies to outsource their HR  time and attendance management  payroll  and benefits administration functions to ADP 
Overall  ADP provides HCM solutions to more than 630 000 businesses  which range from single employee companies to some of the world s largest enterprises  In fact  ADP serves over 80  of Fortune 500 companies  over 90 Fortune 100 companies  and more than 440 000 small businesses  No client accounts for more than 2  of total revenue 
By geography  approximately 81  of ADP s sales are generated in the U S   11  in Europe  4  in Canada  and 4  in other countries 
Segments
Employer Services  77  of total segment revenue  90  of total segment earnings   provides a wide range of business outsourcing and technology enabled HCM solutions  including payroll services  benefits administration  recruiting and talent management  HR management  insurance services  retirement services  and compliance solutions 
Professional Employer Organization Services  23  of total segment revenue  10  of total segment earnings   serves approximately 8 700 clients with employment administration outsourcing solutions  ADP helps small and mid sized businesses with HR management and employee benefits functions 
Business Analysis
ADP s primary competitive advantages are derived from its scale and long standing customer relationships 
The company has the most complete suite of products and services in the HCM market  ADP also boasts the broadest market coverage by geography and client size  In fact  ADP services 104 countries and covers 99  of multinational employees 
As a result of its scope  ADP can offer a more complete suite of cloud based HCM solutions to expand its existing client relationships  It is also uniquely positioned to serve larger clients with operations spread around the world  This is no small task thanks to the different regulations  languages  and integration issues from one country to the next 
With more than  10 billion in annual revenue and little capital required to run its business  capital expenditures were just 1 4  of sales last year   ADP also has the luxury to reinvest heavily in the latest solutions and technology 
The company has spent several decades building out the depth and breadth of its solutions and invested  767 million in systems development and programming during fiscal year 2015 to further improve its offerings  These investments have helped the company transition more than 80  of its customers to cloud based software and get 5 million people using its mobile app 
ADP can also acquire smaller companies with solutions or technologies it can use to further broaden its suite of HCM solutions 
As ADP becomes more ingrained with clients  switching costs rise because users are trained to use more of ADP s software solutions 
Additional switching costs are created by many of the challenges ADP solves for clients  ADP manages complex regulatory environments for many businesses to make sure they remain compliant with the law 
ADP handles employment taxes  tax credits  unemployment claims  workers compensation  and healthcare reform issues  Its clients must comply with each regulation to remain in business and avoid fees  increasing their dependence on ADP s expertise and ability to manage complex transactions 
Over the years  ADP has established a relationship built on trust and reliability with clients  After all  ADP handles some of the most sensitive information about its clients  employees  e g  tax statements  social security numbers  healthcare information  
Building up the necessary security systems and technology infrastructure to safeguard this data takes many years of heavy investments  but winning clients  trust takes even more time 
As a result  ADP enjoyed a 91 4  client retention rate in fiscal year 2015  Client retention is estimated at approximately 12 years in Employer Services and 7 years in Professional Employer Organization Services  highlighting the important role ADP plays for its clients 
Long lasting relationships with hundreds of thousands of businesses have provided another advantage that will likely become increasingly important over the coming years   big data analytics 
Big data is transforming virtually every industry today  and human capital management is no exception  Companies are constantly looking for ways to better identify talent  hire the right people  retain them for longer  and make them more productive 
ADP has more employee records than all of its competitors  providing it with a treasure trove of data that can be used for more detailed and insightful benchmarking for clients 
Management is also opening up the company s platforms via APIs to add further value for clients  This action allows clients to integrate ADP s HCM platforms with the rest of their enterprise suite  Third party developers can also create applications that exchange data with ADP s core HCM systems to further improve productivity and gain new insights 
While data and analytics could further solidify ADP s market position and provide new growth opportunities  the HCM market is still very attractive as it stands today  The market is estimated to be  110 billion in size  which gives ADP a market share of approximately 10  
The HCM market is also growing at a mid single digit rate  providing plenty of opportunity for ADP s sales team of 5 500 employees to continue expanding the company 
Increasing regulations are further helping growth for the industry and ADP  For example  ADP recently launched the ADP Health Compliance product line  which assists mid and large companies in complying with the requirements of the Affordable Care Act in the U S 
A final unique element about ADP s business is its holding of client funds  ADP holds over  21 billion of client funds that are primarily used to pay clients  employees as part of ADP s payroll processing services 
ADP invests these funds predominantly in AAA AA rated fixed income securities to earn interest income until the funds need to be paid out  This is very similar to insurance companies investing their float  which is one of Warren Buffett s favorite qualities in Berkshire Hathaway s  
Declining interest rates have limited the amount of high margin interest income ADP can earn  The company generated  378 million in interest last year  earning a 1 7  rate 
However  for every 25 basis points that short term and intermediate term interest rates change  ADP sees a  12 million impact to earnings  close to a 1  impact to net income   In other words  ADP would likely enjoy a moderate boost to earnings growth if interest rates were to ever rise 
Overall  Automatic Data Processing appears to be a wonderfully positioned business with numerous strengths  The company provides mission critical services  is a trusted partner with clients  requires little capital  enjoys high recurring revenue and client retention  and has a long runway for growth in a large and fragmented market 
Key Risks
It s difficult to identify many risks that could impair ADP s long term earnings power  The company s continual investments in programming and people help it maintain its leading market position 
However  new entrants are always looking for ways to deliver a similar quality of service at a lower price and in a more user friendly format  As the pace of technology advancements accelerates  this could become increasingly true 
Zenefits  which gives away free software that automates payroll and health insurance for small businesses  has been the big name mentioned as a potential disruptor in the space  the startup launched in April 2013 and was valued as much as  4 5 billion last year   However  the company has  that have severely disrupted its growth path 
Technology advancements could make it easier for new entrants to try and disrupt the industry s pricing structure  However  given clients  need to make sure their businesses remain 100  compliant and fully functional  any such change is likely to be gradual in my view  ADP has the resources to remain relevant   either by building or buying the technology or capabilities it needs to maintain its dominant market positions  It also has something very important that new entrants lack   trust  many of its customer relationships span decades  
Changing laws and regulations could also pose a challenge  After all  ADP primarily makes money because its clients do not want to internally deal with complex tasks that don t add direct value to their businesses 
While there is not much ADP can do to combat this risk  the company has increasingly diversified its business across an entire suite of HCM solutions  which helps reduce the risk of any single product line bringing down the firm 
Dividend Analysis  ADP
We analyze 25  years of dividend data and 10  years of fundamental data to understand the safety and growth prospects of a dividend  Dividend Safety Score
Our Safety Score answers the question   Is the current dividend payment safe   We look at factors such as current and historical EPS and FCF payout ratios  debt levels  free cash flow generation  industry cyclicality  ROIC trends  and more  Scores of 50 are average  75 or higher is very good  and 25 or lower is considered weak 
ADP s Dividend Safety Score of 90 suggests that the company s dividend payment is extremely safe  ADP s strong safety rating begins with its payout ratios 
Over the last four quarters  ADP s dividend payments have consumed close to 60  of the free cash flow and earnings the company has generated 
As seen below  ADP s payout ratios have about doubled over the last decade but have remained remarkably consistent in recent years  Stable payout ratios can indicate a predictable business  and ADP is no exception 
While a payout ratio north of 60  would start to give me pause when dealing with a cyclical business  it is a perfectly healthy level for ADP  The company s high recurring revenue and asset light business model provide very stable earnings each year 

Source  Simply Safe Dividends
As I mentioned earlier  ADP provides essential services that businesses need regardless of how the economy is doing  Payroll still needs to be processed  HR activities must continue  and regulations still need to be complied with 
As a result  ADP performed well during the last recession  The company s sales actually grew by 1   free cash flow per share remained relatively stable  and ADP s stock beat the S P 500 by nearly 30  in 2008 
Changes in employment levels can impact near term growth trends for the company  but expansion of HCM offerings outside of payroll services provides diversification and opportunity to expand existing client relationships Source  Simply Safe Dividends
ADP s strong Dividend Safety Score is further aided by the company s remarkable free cash flow generation  Free cash flow fuels sustainable dividend payments and dividend growth 
Software focused businesses such as ADP generate wonderful cash flow once they have achieved scale  As I previously mentioned  ADPs  business requires very little capital to run and benefits from strong client retention rates and pricing power Source  Simply Safe Dividends
In my opinion  return on invested capital is one of the  to understand  The metric can be a good indicator of a company s economic moat and ability to grow earnings and pay higher dividends 
Since ADP s operations require little capital to operate  the company has enjoyed strong returns on invested capital north of 20  most years  This is a clear sign of ADP s moat and allows the company to compound its earnings at a faster rate than most businesses Source  Simply Safe Dividends
ADP s balance sheet is important to analyze as it relates to dividend safety because companies will make debt payments before issuing dividends  Firms with too much financial leverage can be more likely to cut their dividend if they fall on challenging times 
In ADP s case  its balance sheet is a definite strength  The company has historically remained debt free but recently took on  2 billion of debt  which will be used to repurchase shares 
As seen below  ADP still maintains more cash   3 billion  than total book debt   2 billion   providing it with plenty of flexibility to continue paying and growing its dividend Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Overall  ADP s dividend payment is very safe  The company maintains reasonable payout ratios  provides non discretionary services  generates substantial free cash flow  benefits from high recurring revenue and client retention rates  and has a balance sheet with more cash on hand than debt Dividend Growth ScoreOur Growth Score answers the question   How fast is the dividend likely to grow   It considers many of the same fundamental factors as the Safety Score but places more weight on growth centric metrics like sales and earnings growth and payout ratios  Scores of 50 are average  75 or higher is very good  and 25 or lower is considered weak 
ADP s Dividend Growth Score of 79 suggests that the company has above average dividend growth potential  ADP began paying dividends in 1974 and last increased its dividend by 8  in November 2015  marking 41 years of consecutive dividend increases for the company  I wouldn t be surprised to see ADP join the dividend kings list within the next decade 
The company s dividend has grown by 13 8  per year over the last 20 years  although growth has come in closer to a high single digit rate more recently Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Looking ahead  ADP s management team targets a  of 55 60  and expects the company s earnings growth to remain at a double digit rate longer term 
Since the company s payout ratio is sitting near 60  today  future dividend growth will likely be fueled by earnings growth  I expect ADP s dividend to continue compounding by at least 7 9  per year over the medium term ValuationShares of ADP trade at a forward looking P E multiple of 29 3 and offer a dividend yield of 2 2   which is slightly below the stock s five year average dividend yield of 2 55  
It s hard to argue that ADP is a bargain today  If anything  the stock seems somewhat overpriced   the market is clearly rewarding the company s predictability  high recurring revenue  strong client retention rates  and mission critical services  and ability to deliver reliable earnings growth 
Over the longer term  ADP s management targets 7 9  annual revenue growth and 12 14  annual earnings per share growth with an objective to deliver a total shareholder return in the top quartile of the S P 500 
If the company continues delivering on its promises  ADP s stock certainly has potential for double digit annual returns over the long run  However  the current multiple seems to provide little margin for error ConclusionAutomatic Data Processing is a wonderful business and certainly a blue chip dividend stock  Few companies have a more dependable business model and dividend growth track record than ADP  and the future continues to look bright thanks to large and highly fragmented nature of the HCM market 
The stock doesn t look cheap today but should be watched by income investors seeking long term dividend growth and capital appreciation ",2016-07-25,Brian Bollinger,https://www.investing.com/analysis/adp:-a-favorite-dividend-aristocrat-for-income-investors-200143753,200143753

183802,405318,ADP,S P 500 Hit Record High  4 Growth Mutual Funds To Buy,opinion,Better than expected jobs report cheered up the key U S  indexes  After May s lackluster jobs report  markets remained concerned over June s job data  However  a surprise jump in job additions last month had a positive impact on investor sentiment and all the key U S  indexes reached at their record high levels on July 11 Following this market rally  the addition of growth mutual funds to one s portfolio might prove to be one of the most suitable investment options  Risk taking investors  who give precedence to capital appreciation over dividend payout  may consider growth mutual funds for healthy returns Luster Jobs ReportAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics  BLS   the U S  economy created a total of 287 000 jobs in June  significantly higher than the consensus estimate of 177 000  The economy added higher than expected new jobs for the first time in last four months  The tally was also considerably higher than May s downwardly revised job number of only 11 000 Moreover  the unemployment rate was 4 9  in June  which was higher than the consensus estimate of 4 8  and May s rate of 4 7   This was mainly because more than 400 000 Americans re joined the workforce and the labor force participation rate rose to 62 7  Further  average hourly earnings gained 0 1  or 2 cents from May to  25 61 per hour in June  Although  this was lower than the consensus estimate of 0 2  and May s 0 2  increase  year ago gains advanced 2 6  Moreover  the Institute for Supply Management reported that ISM Services Index advanced from 52 9  in May to 56 5  in June  marking the best rise in the last seven months  Also  the reading was more than the consensus estimate of 53 3  Additionally  a report from Automatic Data Processing  Inc    NASDAQ ADP   revealed that private sector employers added 172 000 jobs in June  which was higher than May s revised figure of 168 000 S P 500 at Its BestEach of the three key U S  indexes reached their respective record highs on July 11  The S P 500 closed at its highest level ever at 2 143 19  beating its previous record settlement of 2 130 82 on May 21  2015  The S P 500 also registered record intra day highs of 2 143 19 Also  the Dow and the Nasdaq also rose to their highest levels this year  Also  the blue chip index closed near the record level of 18 312 39 reached on May 19  2015 and the tech based index finished near the level of 5 000 Buy These 4 Growth Mutual FundsGrowth funds focus on realizing an appreciable amount of capital growth by investing in stocks of firms whose value is projected to rise over the long term  However  a relatively higher tolerance to risk and the willingness to park funds for the longer term are necessary when investing in these securities  This is because they may experience relatively more fluctuations than the other fund classes Here  we have chosen growth mutual funds on the basis of large cap  mid cap and small cap funds  Large cap funds are an ideal investment option for investors looking for a high return potential that comes with lower risk than small cap and mid cap funds  While  mid cap funds are suitable for investors looking for high return that comes with lower risk than their small cap counterparts  Further  small cap funds tend to offer stronger growth potential compared to large  and mid cap counter parts  We have selected four growth mutual funds that boast a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank  1  Strong Buy  and percentage of net assets invested in common stocks of greater than 90   Moreover  these funds have encouraging year to date  three year and five year annualized returns  They also have minimum initial investment within  5000 and low expense ratios We expect these funds to outperform their peers in the future  Remember  the goal of the Zacks Mutual Fund Rank is to guide investors to identify potential winners and losers  Unlike most of the fund rating systems  the Zacks Mutual Fund Rank is not just focused on past performance  but also on the likely future success of the fund Loomis Sayles Growth A  seeks long term growth of capital  The fund invests primarily in equity securities  Loomis Sayles Growth A has year to date  three year and five year annualized returns of 4 1   14 7  and 13 6   respectively  LGRRX has an expense ratio of 0 92  as

183807,405323,ADP,Head Scratcher Time  BLS Jobs At 38K Well Short Of Estimates,opinion,Friday  June 3  2016The much anticipated employment report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics  BLS  fell well short of estimates this morning  38 000 new jobs was all the U S  economy in the month of May  This is more than 100K shy of even the low range of analyst estimates prior to the report s release This is especially a head scratcher considering yesterday s ADP   NASDAQ ADP   private sector employment report yesterday that saw 173K jobs in the month  This is quite a disparity   while these 2 reports often are not in lock step in real time  future revisions usually smooth out most differentials  but when was the last time the BLS report was 3 5 times lower than the ADP The 38K figure is the lowest monthly jobs number since September of 2010  when jobs numbers were still wallowing in negative territory  The unemployment rate  meanwhile  has now dipped to 4 7 percent   the lowest since November  07  a year before the Great Recession hit  This has also ratcheted down the 3 month non farm payroll averages to 116K  and far lower than the one year average of 219K Most watchers were aware the Verizon   NYSE VZ   strike would account for between 25K 35K fewer jobs in the month  but this 38K total remains shocking  Lest we think this may be a single month glitch  revisions to March and April combined resulted in 59K fewer jobs  as well What would account for such a drop  The Verizon strike is only a small percentage of it  and does not apply to the previous months  negative revisions  Temporary employment  Construction  Mining and Manufacturing were all down between 10K 21K for the month  while job gains were made in Healthcare  46K   Food and Drinking Establishments  22K  and Professional Business Services  10K  The Labor Force Participation Rate fell 0 2 percent sequentially to 62 6  and the Civil Labor Force reported down by 458K jobs  The U6 number   often referred to as  full unemployment    was 9 7 percent  The Average Hourly Rate rose 0 2 percent  while the Average Workweek was unched at 34 4 hours On CNBC s Squawk Box this morning  University of Chicago professor Austan Goolsbee suggested we may be returning to normal Productivity rates in the U S  workforce  This would somewhat explain the drastic drop in employment as well as the March and April revisions lower Most importantly  what is the Fed likely to do now  There had been plenty of buzz that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates another quarter percent even with a less than stellar  sub 200K  BLS report  But with this major drop off from expectations  the odds that Janet Yellen   Co  pushes back a rate hike decision to July  or later  depending perhaps on June BLS data  become a lot more likely Mark VickerySenior Editor,2016-06-02,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/head-scratcher-time:-bls-jobs-at-38k-well-short-of-estimates-200133858,200133858
183809,405325,ADP,4 Best Large Cap Value Mutual Funds To Buy In A Torrid Summer,opinion,May s unexpected bleak jobs report muddied the outlook for the U S  economy  while chances of a rate hike in June have begun to fade  Decline in consumer confidence  weak service sector growth and contradictory reports about the strength of the manufacturing sector in May also did little to boost investors  sentiment To top it  polls show a jump in Brexit momentum  which might call for more volatility ahead  In these uncertain times  investing in large cap value mutual funds will be a wise decision since such funds are fundamentally strong enough to withstand any economic downturn Job Gains Lowest Since Sep 2010Friday s jobs report turned out to be nothing short of a disappointment  The U S  economy added just 38 000 jobs in May  the weakest level of hiring in almost six years  according to the Labor department  The pace of hiring also slowed down to an average 116 000 in the past three months  About 35 000 workers were unemployed in May due to a strike in Verizon Communications Inc    NYSE VZ    This factor was  however  not considered in the private sector jobs report by Automatic Data Processing  Inc    NASDAQ ADP   The jobless rate  on the other hand  fell to 4 7  last month  its lowest level since Nov 2007  But  the drop was mostly due to a number of people dropping out of the labor force and were therefore counted as unemployed  Now this isn t a promising sign Dismal jobs report pointed to weakness in the economy and the major indexes incurred losses on Friday  This is also bound to have a repercussion on consumer confidence  This might hamper spending levels that have been one of the bright spots driving the U S  recovery Economic Data Aren t InspiringConsumer confidence had already declined last month  clouding economic outlook  The Conference Board s consumer confidence index dropped to 92 6 in May from 94 7 in April  The index touched its lowest level in six months in May  It also registered its second consecutive monthly decline The services side of the economy also surprisingly slowed down in May as indicated by a pair of surveys  The service index declined to 52 9  in May  the slowest pace since Feb 2014  according to the Institute for Supply Management  ISM    New orders for nonmanufacturers also came in at 54 2  in May  down 5 7 points from April  Business activity also dropped 3 7 points from April to 55 1  in May  Another report  the Markit U S  Services PMI too slipped to 51 3 in May  the lowest level since March When it comes to manufacturing  we are getting a mixed signal  Even though the ISM manufacturing report indicated growth  Markit PMI failed to confirm that  The Markit U S  manufacturing PMI showed loss of momentum across the U S  manufacturing sector last month  The index came in at 50 7 in May  Chris Williamson  chief economist at Markit  said   The survey data indicate that factory output fell in May at its fastest rate since 2009  suggesting that manufacturing is acting as a severe drag on the economy in the second quarter  Regional PMI also painted a weaker outlook for the economy  The Empire State manufacturing index slumped to a negative 9 in May following a positive 9 6 in April  Any reading below zero indicates contraction  Another gauge of regional manufacturing activity in the Philadelphia region came in at a negative 1 8 in May  wider than a negative 1 6 in April  Brexit  WorriesIn addition to these dismal domestic economic reports  Britain will vote whether or not to remain in the European Union  on Jun 23  Many fear that Britain might opt for a Brexit  It was cited that anxiety regarding the migration issue might sway voters in favor of leaving Recent polls showed more Brits are favoring to exit the European Union  This will throw global markets in turmoil  undermine the European Union s confidence and its rippling effect won t spare the U S  as well  A poll by television network ITV  LON ITV  figured out that 45  Brits would  Leave  the 28 country European Union  compared with 41  willing to  Remain   A separate survey by global market research company TNS showed 43  for  Leave  and 41  for  Remain  Buy These 4 Large Cap Value Mutual Funds Thanks to the weak jobs report  U S  stocks ended lower on Friday  with the dilemma about future rate hikes continuing to linger   Such a disheartening report raised doubts about future spending levels as well  A slew of other reports from consumer confidence to service to manufacturing also indicated relative weakness in the economy  And with more Brits wanting to leave the European Union  we are about to brace more volatility Given these uncertainties  it will be prudent to invest in large cap value mutual funds that focus on stocks that are perceived to be  bargains  or are undervalued  Large cap funds are considered since they are more attractive in times of gyrations  Such funds are established industry leaders and can bear market setbacks better than their small cap cousins Here we have selected four large cap value mutual funds that boast a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy   have

183848,405364,ADP,Commodity Sentiment  Violent But Strong,opinion,As was highlighted last week in   the key theme since 2011 has been declining inflation and economic growth rates  Lower inflation and weak economic growth is not the environment that favors investments in commodities or commodity sensitive currencies  CAD  AUD   Amid increased deflation fears  global capital has sought refuge in the USD  leading to a dollar rally since 2011  which has pressured commodities  However  this two year disinflationary trend is getting stretched where sentiment is overly pessimistic on commodities and commodity sensitive currencies while overly bullish on the USD  As I argued previously  we now have an environment conducive toward renewed easing by global central banks  which may produce a very violent and strong recovery in commodities caused by short covering Sentiment At Extreme LevelsAs mentioned above  it s been a near one way street since 2011 with the CRB Commodity Index declining while the USD has been rallying as seen below  Note  USD shown in black and inverted for directional similarity  This two year trend has pushed sentiment toward commodities to an extreme and we are likely at or near a major inflection point  One way to measure sentiment is by using the Commitments of Traders Report  COT  published every Friday by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission  CFTC   COT reports break out positions by commercials  considered  smart money   and non commercials or speculators   dumb money   By examining the net position of non commercials relative to total open interest we can examine sentiment where large net short positions relative to open interest typically marks bottoms as sentiment gets too bearish  while large net long speculative positions relative to open interest typically marks tops as sentiment becomes too bullish CopperLooking at net speculative positions in copper shows that sentiment is the most bearish it has been since 2009 and we may be due for a rally as sentiment appears stretched to the downside GoldLooking at gold shows a similar picture with net speculative interest in gold at the lowest levels since the late 2008 lows in gold  a clear reversal of the 2011 and late 2012 highs in which bullish speculative interest hit multi year highs SilverSentiment toward silver is also at a bearish extreme with the last time we saw sentiment at these levels silver rallied nearly 35  over a few months in late 2012 CADThe Canadian Dollar  CAD  may be the poster child of bearish sentiment as net speculative positions relative to open interest is at its lowest levels since early 2007  After reaching these levels back in 2007 the CAD rallied strongly relative to the USD heading into the 2008 commodity peak  With sentiment this bearish on the CAD  the downside is probably limited AUDNot quite as extreme as the CAD  the Australian Dollar  AUD  appears to be near the lower end of sentiment swings of the last three years and may be attempting to bottom USDIn contrast to the bearish sentiment above  sentiment toward the USD is close to a five year high with current levels typically associated with meaningful tops in the USD SummarySentiment toward commodities  commodity sensitive currencies and the USD are at extremes and it wouldn t take much for sentiment to swing in the opposite direction  As argued last week  renewed central bank easing globally may be the spark to bring a commodity rally on renewed hopes of global growth accelerating from depressed levels  Central banks certainly have the latitude to expand monetary stimulus amidst low growth and low inflation and they ve certainly shown a willingness to print as the past few years have shown  If global growth does accelerate and central banks expand their balance sheets  the commodity coiled spring is likely to lead to a strong rally and may be one of the key investment themes for the rest of the year ,2013-05-09,Chris Puplava,https://www.investing.com/analysis/commodity-sentiment:-violent-but-strong-166336,166336
