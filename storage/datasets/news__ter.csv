Shares of  Teradyne  NASDAQ TER  rose as much as 10 8  early Thursday morning  boosted by a strong fourth quarter earnings report  The maker of automatic testing tools used by manufacturers of semiconductors  circuit boards  and wireless networking modules crushed Wall Street s expectations  set optimistic targets for the next quarter  and added  1 billion to its share buyback program 
So what
Teradyne s fourth quarter sales rose 26  year over year  landing at  655 million  Adjusted earnings increased by 40  to  0 88 per diluted share  Your average analyst would have settled for earnings near  0 79 per share on revenue in the neighborhood of  612 million 
Looking ahead  management set its first quarter earnings guidance at roughly  0 91 per share  assuming revenue of approximately  690 million  For this period  Wall Street had been expecting earnings closer to  0 62 per share on sales near  551 million 
The board of directors also set aside another  1 billion for share buybacks  expecting to consume  250 million of that budget in the next quarter alone 

Now what
These impressive results were due to surprisingly strong orders from makers of memory chips  wireless networking modules  and 5G wireless systems  Industrial automation is taking a break from infrastructure investments until the Chinese American trade wars wind down  but that hardly even mattered in the face of fantastic growth across several other markets 
It s no surprise to see investors embracing Teradyne s strong earnings report  especially since the boosted buyback policy indicates that the company s management sees its own stock as a worthwhile investment  Shares have now soared 131  in 52 weeks  earning every penny of that gain via a string of impressive beat and raise reports ",2020-01-23,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/plzg8,2066242

Andrew Blanchard    Investor Relations
Good morning everyone and welcome to our discussion of Teradyne s most recent financial results  I m joined this morning  our CEO  Mark Jagiela and CFO  Sanjay Mehta  Following our opening remarks  we ll provide details of our performance for 2019 s Fourth quarter and full year along with our outlook for the first quarter of 2020  The press release containing our fourth quarter results was issued last evening  We re providing slides on the Investor page of the website that may be helpful to you in following the discussion 
Replays of this call will be available via the same page after the call ends  The matters that we discuss today will include forward looking statements that involve risk factors that could cause Teradyne s results to differ materially from management s current expectations  Encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statements contained in the earnings release as well as our most recent SEC filings 
Additionally  those forward looking statements are made as of today and we take no obligation to update them as a result of developments occurring after this call  During today s call  we ll make reference to non GAAP financial measures  We ve posted additional information concerning these non GAAP financial measures  including reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure where available on the Investor page 
Also  please take special note of the  Indecipherable  release and slide deck for risks associated to potential changes in US Export regulations  Looking ahead  between now and our next earnings call  Teradyne will be participating in technology or industrial focused Investor Conferences hosted by Goldman Sachs  Citi  Barclays and Susquehanna  Now  let s get on with the rest of the agenda  First  Mark will comment on our recent results in the market conditions as we enter the New Year  Sanjay will then offer more details on our quarterly results  along with our guidance for the first quarter  We ll then answer your questions and this call is scheduled for one hour 
Mark E  Jagiela    Chief Executive Officer and President
Thanks  Andy  and hello everyone  In today s call  I ll note our Q4 and 2019 full year highlights and comment on our outlook for 2020  Sanjay will then provide the financial details and as we do each January update you on our earnings model and capital allocation plans  We ended the year on a very strong  Indecipherable  with sales up 26  from the Fourth Quarter of 2018 and non GAAP earnings per share up 40   That brought our full year sales to about  2 3 billion  up 9  and non GAAP EPS to  2 86  up 21  versus 2018 
Looking back at 2019  our Test businesses performed well above our plan  Industrial Automation showed solid growth but came in below plan on manufacturing sector headwinds in US and Europe  In Semi Test  the above plan results came primarily from three areas  first  5G infrastructure build out in China  Second  significant smartphone complexity growth and third  memory test share gains 
We estimate the 5G infrastructure build out contributed about  200 million to the  3 3 billion SOC TAM in 2019  And we captured a sizable portion of that spending  As stated in prior calls  this build out has  for the moment  been mostly concentrated in China  In smartphones  complexity growth was very strong driving up test intensity and therefore tester demand 
The growth is largely unrelated to 5G as 5G handset volume was insignificant in 2019  Rather  the steady increase in features like multiple  Indecipherable  cameras  enhanced photo and video processing  and new connectivity features drove this demand  In particular  image sensor test demand was very strong  as there was broad adoption of three to four backside cameras in a wide variety 
The third driver was memory  While the memory market declined as expected by about 35  from 2018  our sales were down about 3  as NAND test spending was buoyed by  Indecipherable  for higher speed devices  and by investments from emerging suppliers in memory  Less significant in 2019 revenue  but a significant impact going forward was the successful break into the DRAM  Indecipherable  new Magnum Epic LPDDR5 DRAM tester 
This expands Teradyne s TAM to now serve all four sectors of the test market with our Magnum platform  Our system test and LitePoint test businesses also delivered above plan results  In system test  defense and aerospace  production board test  and storage test all delivered very strong growth for the full year 
Storage test performance is a special  Indecipherable  70  coming from the increased test intensity of terabyte HDD drives and a growing business in the system level test of complex semiconductor devices   Indecipherable  LitePoint  new connectivity standards along with early buying for the 5G handset test market were the principal drivers of 19  growth for the full year 
While our test business is operating above plan  our IA business performance was solid but below plan for the year growing 12  on a pro forma basis  Individually  UR grew 6  and MiR grew 43  on a pro forma basis  As we ve discussed  at UR  we ve had high exposure to the global automotive supply chain and general European manufacturing sector  both of which faced strong economic headwinds throughout the year 
On the other hand  MiRs mobile robots serve a more diverse range of end markets and showed solid growth in the year  2019 was also a big year for Teradyne on the new product front  These new products  both strengthened our core positions and set us up to profitably grow in the future  In Semi Test  we introduced the UltraFLEXplus platform  targeting the AI and big data markets 
The Magnum epic platform for LPDDR5 DRAM final test and the MX44 instrument for 5G millimeter wave device test  At LitePoint  we introduced new members of our IQgig and IQxel families of production testers for 5G handsets and  Indecipherable  with WiFi respectively 
In system test  we ramped production of the spectrum high speed tester for complex defense electronic systems  In industrial automation  we introduced the UR16e cobot for higher payload and began delivery of our bin picking solution for multiple beta site customers in Q4 
In mobile robots  we introduced the MR1000 for increased payloads and the MiR AI camera system that utilizes AI to improve robot traffic flow in busy industrial settings  And our engineering pipeline is full of future products across all groups 
Rounding up 2019  our balanced approach to capital allocation resulted in the strategic acquisition of AutoGuide  serving the nascent autonomous mobile forklift market  We also continued our capital return program with  500 million in share buybacks and  61 million in dividends 
Looking forward to 2020  we see continued strong momentum in our test businesses and an improvement in our IA growth  Early returns on our new products are positive with UltraFLEXplus winning a significant competitive design in during Q4 in the mobility space  and the Magnum Epic tester winning in LPDDR final test  at a major memory maker 
These early wins in Semi Tests contribute to our strong outlook for the first quarter  I d like to give you some context on how we re looking into 2020  First  we expect our smartphone test demand to be strong and back to levels similar to what we saw in 2016 and 2017  As then  we expect our 2020 revenue will be first half weighted in the year 
Second  we expect storage test to be especially strong in the first half for both HDD and system level test applications  For the year it s expected to grow about 40  from 2019  Third  the design wins for the Magnum Epic and the UltraFLEXplus will begin to ramp in Q1 and this represents new customers and new segments that we expect to contribute revenue growth over the mid term 
Balancing this strength  we are seeing the expected pause in the 5G infrastructure test buying to power our 2019 sales  At a high level  we re seeing that 5G demand evolved from infrastructure to smartphones as we outlined in past calls  The Global 5G infrastructure build out is still in the early innings and we expect that test demand will cycle at various geographies build    as various geographies build out their networks  5G smartphone related test demand will begin in 2020  but it will be somewhat modest as it s mostly low band or sub 6G technology rolling out  Millimeter wave investments are still to come over the mid term  Additionally  we do not expect to see any significant recovery in the automotive or analog markets in 2020 
As Sanjay will describe  we will be increasing our 2020 Opex in test to expand these design wins  accelerate some new products and take advantage of what we now expect to be a faster growing test market over the mid term  Taken altogether  our outlook for the 2020 SOC Test market is in the  3 1 billion to  3 4 billion range and memory test is in the  650 million to  750 million range  Of course this assumes no change in the current global trade regulatory environment 
We ll update you on this outlook as we move through the year  For reference  this compares to about a  3 3 billion SOC and about a  600 million memory test market in 2019  Turning to Industrial Automation  recall our strategy is to use the power of advanced technology to democratize automation and make industrial warehouse applications more productive and safer 
We remain confident of the growth opportunity as we execute the strategy and the addition of auto guide gives us access to an even broader set of opportunities  While we expect the automotive and general manufacturing markets in Europe and the U S  to remain weak  we do think this headwind has dissipated  This combined with our expansion into the electronics manufacturing sector  other consumer goods manufacturing  bin picking and the industrial forklift automation market gives us confidence that a higher IA growth profile in 2020 is likely 
Additionally  the UR plus ecosystem continues to grow and we ended the year with 206 certified plug and play solutions available  up from about 130 at the start of 2019  A similar program for our mobile autonomous robots MirGo launched in 2019 and will expand in 2020  Overall  we expect our 14  IA growth in 2019 to increase to above 20  in 2020 
In summary  we enter 2020 very optimistic  While uncertainties remain in trade policies and global economies  the overall technological and economic trends that fuel our business are strong  Our new products are opening new markets and gaining new customers  Test market growth is strong and we are still in the early innings of 5G 
IA growth is solid in the environment of a U S  and European manufacturing slow down and we expect that this headwind is dissipating  This  plus a strong M A pipeline and a commitment to capital returns remains our strategy  Sanjay will now take you through the financial model in details  Sanjay 
Sanjay Mehta    Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Thank you  Mark  Good morning  everyone  Today  I ll cover the financial highlights of Q4 and review the financial details of 2019  Looking forward  I ll provide an update to our mid term model  Q1 outlook and color around 2020 which will include our capital allocation plans 
Now to Q4  revenues were  655 million  which were  25 million above the high end of our guidance range  Semi Test revenue of  439 million led the quarter over quarter growth  driven by memory and SOC Test demand  enabling 5G infrastructure and higher speed flash and DRAM devices  System Test Group have revenue of  83 million which grew quarter over quarter  driven by our storage test solutions enabling system level test for SOCs 
Industrial Automation for IA  revenue of  88 million had a seasonal increase in revenue over Q3 and grew year over year in an environment where significant auto industry headwinds exist  LitePoint revenue of  45 million grew quarter over quarter and year over year with new connectivity standards Wi Fi 6 and cellular 5G driving revenue 
Non GAAP gross margins were 58 5   a bit above our plan and slightly down quarter over quarter due to product mix  you ll see our non GAAP operating expenses were up  19 million to  204 million from the third quarter due to a higher variable compensation on higher profit  increased test spending to support design wins and an ongoing IA investments  Non GAAP operating profit was 27  and non GAAP EPS was  0 88 
The tax rate  excluding discrete items for the quarter and the year was 15 5  on a GAAP basis and 16 5  on a non GAAP basis  We bought back 2 1 million shares for  131 million at an average price of  62 44 in the quarter 
For the full year  we bought back 10 9 million shares at an average price of  45 89  Since the start of 2015  we have spent  1 97 billion to repurchase 60 8 million shares with an average price  32 38 which delivered significant shareholder returns over the 5 year period 
We ended the year with cash and marketable security balances of approximately  1 billion  Turning to the full year results of 2019  Teradyne revenues of  2 295 billion grew  194 million or 9    157 million of the growth is from our test portfolio and  37 million from IA  We had two customers with 10  or greater revenues in 2019 who will be disclosed in our 10 K filing 
Gross margins were 58  and operating profit was 25   which is consistent with 2018  EPS was  2 86  or 21  growth year over year  Breaking down the components of 2019 revenues  as Mark outlined the SOC Test revenues grew  67 million or 6  on strength in 5G sub 6 infrastructure  increased complexity in mobile devices and millimeter wave development demand 
In memory  revenues were  266 million  down 3  in the down market  Demand for higher speed NAND testers from existing customers and new entrants combined with DRAM wafer test demand highlighted the year  Late in the year  we also received initial revenue for our Magnum Epic LPDDR5 DRAM package test system 
In system test  sales grew for third year in a row  Revenue of  287 million grew  71 million or 33  year over year  primarily on growth and storage test for both system level test and HDD test  which had sales of  115 million  up from  67 million in 2018 
We also saw annual growth in our defense and aerospace and production board test components of that STG  At LitePoint  sales grew for a third year in a row as well  Revenue was  157 million  19  above 2018 s level  New connectivity standards were the biggest driver of demand  But we also saw surge in 5G cellular demand in Q4 
IA revenue of  298 million grew 14  from 2018 on an as reported basis or 12  on a pro forma basis  Universal Robots revenue of  248 million or 6  year over year growth was below our original plan  As discussed by Mark  UR s demand has 40  plus exposure to manufacturing in Europe and the automotive industry  both of which face significant market headwinds in 2019 
Recent Eurozone PMI data suggests a moderating trend  but no indication of improvement in the near term  The auto outlook is similar  MiR revenues of  44 million grew 43  on a pro forma basis  or 84  on an as reported basis  Recall we acquired MiR in April of 2018  IA in total had a non GAAP operating profit of 10  for the full year  a rate that we re modeling for 2020 as well 
Shifting to our mid term earnings model  Factoring in both recent history and our latest outlook  we ve updated the high end of our  3 50 to  4 earnings target to  4 25 of non GAAP EPS in 2022  We have growing confidence in the Semi Test end market drivers such as broader complexity for performance  5G subsets and millimeter wave driving capacity needs and infrastructure  phones and IoT devices 
We also expect a continuation of the growing performance trends and memory devices  This  along with some specific mobility and memory share gains and device unit growth  give us confidence to raise the Semi Test revenue growth rates from 3  to 5   to 4  to 8  from our baseline 2019 revenue 
At the same time  to reflect near term industry conditions IA s model growth rate has been reduced to a range of 20  to 35  off of our 2019 baseline revenue as Mark noted  We expect above 20  growth in 2020  In 2019  we experienced a significant slowdown in sales growth tied to macro conditions noted earlier 
However  our long term outlook remains positive  And we ll continue to invest in scaling the business  specifically increasing our distributor capacity  sharpening our focus on marketing efforts for lead generation and closure  investing to expand our reach to major accounts  and continuing to invest in software solutions needed to scale our portfolio 
The net result of these updated growth assumptions as a greater revenue contribution in 2022 from our test portfolio versus the prior model  Our gross margin target has increased roughly 1   which drops down the operating profit  increasing that to 26  to 28  at the top end of our EPS rate  and increasing the top end of our EPS range to  4 25 
Now  to our outlook for Q1  Sales were expected to be between  670 million and  710 million  Non GAAP EPS range of  0 86 to  0 96 on 174 million diluted shares  The first quarter guidance excludes the amortization of acquired intangibles  and non cash imputed interest on the convertible debt  First quarter gross margins are estimated to be between 57  and 58   down slightly from the fourth quarter due to mix 
The first quarter Opex running at 30  to 31  of first quarter sales is up about  6 million from the fourth quarter due to further IA distribution  and product development investments  including the addition of AutoGuide  along with incremental test investments I ll discuss shortly  The non GAAP operating profit at the midpoint of the first quarter guidance is 27  
Now turning to some color around the full year outlook to help your model  As Mark noted  we expect strong first half similar to 2016 and 2017  when the first half revenues were 55  and 54  of the full year sales respectively  Key drivers of the first half revenue include handset test demand  system level testers being sold to enable key product ramp in our storage test segment  and early ramping of LPDDR5 DRAM memory test capacity 
Unlike 2016 and 2017  based on our very early estimates  we expect roughly similar sales levels in Q2 as in Q1  Regarding our Opex plans for 2020  we expect our Opex to grow 10  to 12  from 2019 to  758 million  This is driven by investments across the business  In IA  we will continue to invest to reinforce our competitive position across the sector as noted earlier 
In our test portfolio  we plan to increase our spending in engineering  sales and marketing  primarily in Semi Test  The engineering efforts will include memory and SOC investments to maintain our leadership position  as well as invest in areas of the market that we believe there is opportunity for us to grow  Increased sales and marketing investments are driven by share gains  which require effort to convert and ramp customers on Teradyne s products and then provide ongoing support  Beyond 2020  we model test Opex to have flat to GDP growth  Capital expenditures in 2020 will increase above our normal run rate 
In 2019  our capex was  135 million  used primarily for customer demonstration equipment  operations and engineering  In 2020  we ve earmarked an incremental  40 million or so for real estate investments in locations where we plan to grow significantly over the next several years  We are buying land and developing it to eliminate lease costs and enable more cost efficient spend profile over the mid to long term 
The projects will take two years to complete with the majority of the spending this year  Our GAAP and non GAAP tax rate for 2020 is estimated at 16   Shifting to capital allocation  We will continue to balance strong cash position to support our operating investments and potential M A with direct shareholder returns through dividends and share repurchases 
Recall we have a  460 million face value convertible bond that matures in 2023  Regarding direct returns  we will be increasing our dividend by 11  to  0 10 per quarter  which reflects our confidence in our operating level and growing markets we serve 
With regards to share repurchases  we cancel the unused portion of the prior program and replace that with a  1 billion share repurchase program  We plan a minimum of  250 million of share repurchase in 2020  The program does not have a fixed end date and as in the past  there s a program programmatic and opportunistic component  Recall in 2018 and 2019  we spent approximately  1 3 billion in share buybacks driven by 2017 tax reform which enabled offshore cash to be repatriated efficiently  Our 2020 target represents our getting back to more normal level of share repurchases  In summary  we closed out 2019 very strong and entered 2020 with good momentum  powered by a strong test portfolio  Our updated capital allocation plan and earnings model reflects our confidence in Test and Industrial Automation  while acknowledging the short term impacts of the global slowdown in industrial spending  We ll continue to invest in R D  distribution and internal capabilities to improve our competitive position and drive profitable growth across the business  What we can t predict what lies ahead  for the full year  we have the products  the team and a proven flexible business model that can efficiently scale demand during a fluctuating time period and the strategy to thrive in the new year  With that  I ll turn things back to Andy

Thanks  Sanjay  And Cherry  we would now like to take some questions and as a reminder  please limit yourself to one question and a follow up 
Questions and Answers 
Operator
Thank you   Operator Instructions  Our first question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America 
Vivek Arya    Bank of America    Analyst
Thanks for taking my question  For the first one  in the press release you called out Huawei and HiSilicon as significant customers  I m wondering how big were they directly or indirectly in 2019  And if you have a number for 2018 as well and do you have a sense for how much of that related capacity is being utilized versus any extraneous effects due to tariff or trade or other issues 
Sanjay Mehta    Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah  we re not going to give specific numbers for any specific customer  But what I will say is that certainly they are a significant customer of Teradyne and utilization is 100  plus  There s strong demand  there was demand all through the year  utilization high 
And at this point that situation continues with the exception of 5G infrastrucutre which represents a subset of the demand being weaker now than it was running in the second half of last year 
Vivek Arya    Bank of America    Analyst
All right  And so my follow up on the 5G side  you maintained the  200 million or so contribution or the market size for last year  And I think in the past you had mentioned a  300 million to  400 million opportunity  How do you see your share playing out  which areas you think you are stronger versus your competitor  Thank you 
Mark E  Jagiela    Chief Executive Officer and President
Yeah  good question  So that  200 million number for 2019 was predominantly infrastructure related  And I think our share there was probably 70  plus  As we enter 2020  there ll be a shift towards handsets and infrastructure will come down a bit  And I d say  our share as a consequence of that will probably be somewhere between that 50  to 75     50  to 70  range  in that kind of a mix 
But longer term as more millimeter wave comes online  Again  we re talking probably post 2020  that s when the total market should grow to that  400 ish million range for Semi Test  And then on top of that in LitePoint  there s probably  we ve been talking about  100 ish million adder for 5G handset test 
But the way we see it now it s likely that could be a bit higher  Now that may peak at around  150 million or so  So that s how it progresses out through the next few years 
Vivek Arya    Bank of America    Analyst

Operator
Thank you  Our next question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse 
John Pitzer    Credit Suisse    Analyst 
Yeah  Good morning  guys  Congratulations on the solid results  Mark  I m just kind of curious  your view of calendar year 2020  half on half being 55 45  To what extent is that just lack of visibility into the second half and conservatism versus actually having visibility that the second half is going to be down 
And I guess  help me understand why  16    17 is the right analogy year to compare calendar year 2020  And as you answer the question  if we re going through a pause in 5G infrastructure  currently  what s your expectation for that to come back 
Mark E  Jagiela    Chief Executive Officer and President
Yeah  that s a good question  So I just like to point out that we have very little visibility into the second half  So the 55 45 split is purely based on a historical model or precedent where in 2016 and 2017  we add significant mobility handset test tooling in the first half  And we simply looked at that and said  everything else being equal  let s assume the year follows that pattern 
But we don t have any data points that I would say are strong on that  And then with no infrastructure  we expect because most of the build out in infrastructure was concentrated in China last year  it ran very hot  it s in a pause right now  But there s plenty of geographies that still need to build out 
So  that has to come back at some point  If you don t think it s in the first half of the year where we do have visibility  but it could be in the second half of the year or early next year 
John Pitzer    Credit Suisse    Analyst
That s helpful  Then maybe for my follow on to kind of add on to Vivek s first question  I understand the desire not to talk about absolute levels for a specific customer  But I m kind of curious  just relative to some of the concerns investors have that there might be a change in the de minimis rule from 25 to 10  Would that change as you understand it  impact your business to Huawei  Or how should we think about that in the investment community 
Sanjay Mehta    Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah  hi  It is Sanjay  So the first thing is that    I ll just say that Teradyne is going to be compliant with whatever the regulations are  And then the revenue impact  I d say is a little bit hard to call  I m going to give you some color around there  Depending on there could be a lot of conjecture about what the rules could be 
And whatever they are  I think that if there s that    our inability to ship to Huawei for whatever reason  you d have to consider    if you consider the end market to be the end market  we believe that there would be a shift in to other providers  Now that would have a time gap as that process takes place  But I think it s very hard  A  we don t actually understand    know what the regulations are going to be  And then b  the end market impact  I think that over the mid term we kind of work itself out  but there would be this fluctuation in the short term 
John Pitzer    Credit Suisse    Analyst
Thanks guys  Appreciate it

Thank you  Our next question comes from Timothy Arcuri with UBS 
Timothy Arcuri    UBS    Analyst
Hi  guys  Thanks  The first question  Mark  I just am going back to your comment that the  200 million extra SOC TAM that came from 5G this year your share was about 70   But total SOC share  if I take a  3 3 billion market this year  you actually lost like 300 basis points worth of share for the year  So why would that be if you captured sort of an abnormally high portion of that incremental 5G  Thanks 
Mark E  Jagiela    Chief Executive Officer and President
Yeah  so there s lots going on under the covers in SOC tests  So the 5G bump was one component of it  But analog  and automotive were at a very low level which is another place where we have very high share  So those two  you might say  sort of almost negated each other in terms of share    net share gain 
Then the other effect going on is the    there s a segment of the SOC test market  It is probably the only segment we don t serve which is LCD driver    display driver  That market has grown quite dramatically in 2019  It added I think about  100 million  150 million of market  It s pretty much all advanced  Phonetic  test  And that kind of makes up that difference in the calculations 
Timothy Arcuri    UBS    Analyst
Okay  got it  And then I guess just a follow up question on the topic around export control  So if I take a flat June  which you re sort of implying is going to be flat  And then if I assume that the year sort of plays out that the first half is 55  and the back half is 45  That sort of says that you re going to be at around 2 5 for the year  Does that guidance    what does that assume in terms of export control rule changes  Because if the threshold goes to 10   and they remove the sensitive content requirement  Does that assume that you ll still be able to ship to Huawei or does that assume that there will be some impact  Thank you 
Mark E  Jagiela    Chief Executive Officer and President
Yeah  I think with what we believe is being contemplated at the moment  And again  this is still in daily discussions obviously  in the Commerce Department and the Department of Defense and everything else that it would not have a significant impact to our plans for 2020  But what Sanjay said is true is that let s assume for a minute that something more draconian that we expect happens with restrictions  The demand in the market won t change so the supply will shift to other suppliers  We re well positioned that the likely other suppliers that will shift to  So it s simply a movement of one place to another 
Timothy Arcuri    UBS    Analyst
Okay  Awesome  Thanks so much

Thank you  Our next question comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs 
Toshiya Hari    Goldman Sachs    Analyst
Hi  guys  congrats on the strong results  Mark  you guys lowered your long term growth assumptions around the IA business from 30  to 40  to 20  to 35   I appreciate the near term environment in Europe and automotive from an end demand standpoint remains pretty weak  But why the change 
Have you sensed any change of the competitive landscape or how you think about the economics around the adoption of Cobots or what s changed there  Thank you 
Mark E  Jagiela    Chief Executive Officer and President
Yes  it s no competitive and no long term change  It s simply math  meaning we ve got another ticket to that 2022 year  We ve got three years to get there  We think 2020 is going to be better than  19 in terms of growth  but not in that 30  to 40  range that would make that viable  So we think we re going to again  move back north on growth rates this year  will be north of 20 for the group  And we would expect subsequent years to improve beyond that  But when you average it out over three years  that s kind of the range we think we will be at  Longer term  nothing s changed 
Toshiya Hari    Goldman Sachs    Analyst
Got it  And then as a follow up  I had a question on memory test  Can you confirm what your market share was in 2019 in NAND and DRAM relative to 2018  And then for the TAM for 2020  I think you guys are thinking  15  ish growth on a year over year basis  That seems a little conservative given what we re seeing in terms of the memory market  What s kind of pulling that down  if you will  Thank you
Mark E  Jagiela    Chief Executive Officer and President
Well  let s see  So first of all  share in 2018  we re roughly 30  share and last year we think we will be around 43  ish share  Looking to 2020 market  we re thinking  700 million  roughly would be the market  We ve said the long term average should be about  750 million  I wouldn t be surprised if it was a bit higher 
But again at this point it s hard to forecast  Now in terms of our share in 2020  the success we had    all last year  we talked about this target of cracking in the final wedge of the memory test market  DRAM final test that we didn t participate in  And that was a year long project that finally came to fruition in December  So that sets us up going into 2020 to serve all four segments of the market 
China will continue to be pretty aggressive  So that s a balloon and I think our share    as I think in the last call  I said  expect our share to fall back into the high 30   35  to 40  range as DRAM snaps back in 2020  But now that we re playing in that market  we think share is going to stay up that 40  range in 2020

Thank you  Thank you  Our next question comes from Atif Malik with Citi 
Atif Malik    Citi    Analyst
Hi  Thanks for taking my questions and congratulations on strong results and guide and also good job in winning the LPDDR5 design win at the Korean memory makers  Mark  my first question is  with respect to your expectations on the industrial auto demand not recovering this year  can you remind us how much is that semiconductor test demand down from the prior peak 
Then as my follow up  Sanjay  can you comment on the profitability of your memory test business relative to your overall Semiconductor Test business 
Sanjay Mehta    Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
I m sorry  Atif  I didn t get your first question  Can you just ask it again  please 
Atif Malik    Citi    Analyst
Yes  Mark  what I m asking is  how far is your industrial and auto tech business down from the prior peak  And then  the memory card availability 
Mark E  Jagiela    Chief Executive Officer and President
Got it  Thank you  Yes  So automotive and analog  tends to peak at around  500 million or so of the market   500 million to  550 million  Last year  we expect that it was somewhere in the  300 million to  325 million range  so it s down by about  200 million 
Sanjay Mehta    Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
And from the memory profitability standpoint we see the margins in the profitability similar to the SOC market

Thank you  Our next question comes from CJ Muse with Evercore 
CJ Muse    Evercore    Analyst
Yes  good morning  thanks for taking the question  Curious on your new test outlook of 6  growth at the midpoint versus your prior view of 4   And that s off of a higher base in 2019  How much of that outlook is based on just what you re seeing overall test as in complexity  versus some of the share gains on the gaming console DDR5 etc 
Sanjay Mehta    Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yes  I think that s    it s Sanjay here  I think that you can view it as we see over the midterm growth really driven by  as you said  complexity in end devices  5G both sub 6 and millimeter wave  as well as share gains  So I d say it s more like 30  tied to market and 70  tied to share gains roughly over the mid term 
CJ Muse    Evercore    Analyst
Very helpful  And then on the IAA side  clearly help but UR grew 23  sequentially on its own  Curious  what signal that sends to you  I mean  how much of that was programmatic as opposed to perhaps an early indication of cyclical recovery on the manufacturing side 
Sanjay Mehta    Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Well  I think on the UR front  as well as MiR  seasonally Q4 is a generally high quarter if you look back over time  So that s encouraging  And it was actually one of the drivers of us being higher than our guidance range  However  as we look into the first half  we are seeing that seasonal pattern come down from an IA perspective  And I think it s really early innings to call a recovery in those    in industrials and automotive at this point from our standpoint 
CJ Muse    Evercore    Analyst
So  when you re thinking about growing that business 20  plus in 2020  is that really an indication of kind of the programs that you see for MiR or what s the underlying assumption for UR 
Sanjay Mehta    Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah  So we see MiR and UR both contributing obviously to the 20  plus growth that Mark articulated  And we are investing and as I said  growing in distribution  As you know  MiR is coming from    is a little bit later in years as coming from a smaller base  But we see both contributing quite significantly to that 20  plus growth 
Mark E  Jagiela    Chief Executive Officer and President
And CJ  I just  I would just add on that a bit  The UR has higher exposure to automotive and sort of the general manufacturing issues that we re seeing in the market  But the fact that we did see the strong sequential performance that you alluded to  we did see a little bit of year over year gain 
We introduced a new product last year with the 16 kilogram payload version that s just starting to ramp  And we re just now actually in April going to be rolling out the bin picking solution in North America  So new products  bottoming of the headwinds in the manufacturing sector in Europe and North America are strong  strong indicators for us 
And the other thing is that last year  we saw really good performance in China  in terms of growth  We grew    I think it was 40  or so in China last year where those headwinds were absent  So UR in a very competitive region is still showing that kind of lens  So we re really confident with the new products in this sort of diminishing headwinds

Thank you  Our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG 
Mehdi Hosseini    SIG    Analyst
Yes  Thanks for taking my question  I want to take a more of a broader outlook  If I just look at your commentary for 2020  the 55 45 mix  it seems to me that on the earning side  you would come in at or slightly above the midpoint of your longer term target  And I also under impression that millimeter wave could be a big TAM for SOC  But that s most likely a 2022 catalyst 
So given this kind of a thought process  could we see some fluctuation in annualized earning  as you think about the longer term of maybe a best case 425  And I m just trying to understand the dynamics of different parts of the company  especially with the change of outlook on IA and how SOC market is going to play out 
Mark E  Jagiela    Chief Executive Officer and President
Yeah  we ve been blessed with a pretty stable nonvolatile test market here for quite some number of years  And so it s certainly possible on our way to 425 and beyond  we could see a drop down  We haven t seen that  Our EPS has been monotonically growing here for quite some time  So there s still likely volatility  it doesn t seem eminent 
So  the drivers here  especially around 5G are going to be pretty big balloons  But  at the same time  you and I both know being around for as long as we ve been in this industry  something like a 20  correction can occur  That in no way changes the fundamentals of where 5 nanometer  3 nanometers are going to take us with complexity and what these device  the 5G transceivers and antennas and such that are going into their phones over the next few years are going to bring to the test world 
So  we don t plan or try to    we re on a trend line projection  as you know and that s what we believe 
Mehdi Hosseini    SIG    Analyst
Thank you  And thanks for being sincere  Just as a follow up  I m just thinking that for millimeter wave  there will be some changes to the base station to the networking  And that would have to happen before there will be an SOC upgrade cycle  And the base station cam is like  200 million for test and AP is  400 million  How do you see the impact of millimeter wave on a networking versus the phone itself given the kind of picture that I just laid out 
Mark E  Jagiela    Chief Executive Officer and President
Yes  So I think that from a test intensity point of view  handsets will matter more  So the thing that made last year incredible in terms of infrastructure was the concentration in a very short period of time  So  to roll out China sub 6G or low band to put in the infrastructure to do that  a tremendous amount of capacity was built out in one year to make that happen 
Millimeter wave s going to be spread over many years  I don t think that it s going    it ll be marginally more test intensive than at the base station level than sub 6G  But it s not going to have the same sort of  150 million   200 million pumped into TAM that we saw last year 
On the other hand  the handset side of this is where the real money will be for both LitePoint and Semi Test  And if there s going to be a tipping point that we need to reach specifically in the U S  on deployment of millimeter wave base stations to shift  let s say  half the domestic supply of handsets to millimeter wave capable  And we still think that s probably 2021 or 2022  It may    we re a little more optimistic that it s coming sooner on millimeter wave 
But if we go back to that  400 million bump to the SOC market  If you re thinking about 2022  it s probably  300 million plus of that is going to be handset related

Thank you  Our next question comes from Krish Sankar with Cowen   Co 
Krish Sankar    Cowen   Co     Analyst
Hi  thanks for taking my question  I have two of them  First on  Mark  thanks for the color on millimeter wave  Do you think that when you look at millimeter wave  now that you have dual opportunity both on the SOC test side  as well as LitePoint side  do you think they happen in tandem or does LitePoint lead or lag the AT business  And then I had a follow up on Cobots 
Sanjay Mehta    Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yes  It is Sanjay  I think they come out in similar opportunities  I think what you re seeing right now in millimeter wave on the SOC test perspective  is a lot of engineering work and testers associated with that  And then you do have the LitePoint and device tester in parallel for what millimeter wave devices that are out there 
And then when  as we say  it comes as we ve said before  we believe it comes in waves and arguably 2021 and 2022  I think you ll see both of them come up  Obviously  the chip guys on the SOC test will be slightly ahead  but I think they ll mainly come some early time  And I ve one more thing about LitePoint that we haven t mentioned that LitePoint s traditional strength has been WiFi connectivity test  And there s a lot going on in the next few years in the WiFi that s really encouraging to us  So finally 802 11ax or what s now been rebranded WiFi 6 as well in our phones  that s going to propel our connectivity business 
Then we re going to open up the 7 gigahertz  6 to 7 gigahertz band for WiFi  That s another new need to retool the tester install base for that frequency band  And then we re    and the industry is working on this new 802 11 be standard that is 16x16 MIMO  360 megahertz a channel bandwidth 
Once again  requiring new test capacity  So unlike the past 4 years where connectivity has been kind of dormant  when we look over the next 4 years connectivity is also going to see significant retooling shift 
Krish Sankar    Cowen   Co     Analyst
Got it  That s very helpful  And I just had a follow up on the cobot side  Two part question  Where are we on the installation time reduction for cobots  I think it used to be four to six weeks  but you guys are trying to reduce it  And also do you have any update on the partnership you re doing with    on the vision side for cobots  Thank you 
Sanjay Mehta    Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
I think on the deployment time  Yeah  I alluded earlier to where we re investing  And we continue to invest  I don t have specific metrics around that  but we continue to see improvement and improvement in the initial deployment  as well as the follow on deployments at an existing customer 
Mark E  Jagiela    Chief Executive Officer and President
And then vision 
Sanjay Mehta    Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
And the second question was tied to   
Krish Sankar    Cowen   Co    Analyst
Of vision partnerships 
Sanjay Mehta    Vice President and Chief Financial Officer 
Vision partnerships  I think the answer is you have a lot of UR plus partners that are  that are suppliers 
Mark E  Jagiela    Chief Executive Officer and President
Yeah  I think  we re fielding a bin picking solution that has a vision system embedded in it that we will kind of be a reseller for  But there s a wide variety of partners already in our UR plus ecosystem that are natively embedded in our operating system  So all of that is sort of business as usual  No real new trends there

Thank you  Our next question comes from Richard Eastman with Baird 
Richard Eastman    Baird    Analyst
Yes  Good morning  Just a quick question around the industrial automation business in general  And how did that    how did their P L or gross margin and I think  finish the year  And then also  I think you referenced a nonprofit contribution  a contribution margin there of 10   And that was the expectation going forward into  20 as well  So I m curious is there a kicked up investment there below the gross margin line as a gross margin line kind of held around 60  there 
Sanjay Mehta    Vice President and Chief Financial Officer 
Yeah  It s Sanjay  So I think the gross margin is roughly as you d expect it to be  There s been no degradation at all  And I did comment that our operating profit in IA in general is 10   We should expect that next year  I think    when I think about the industrial automation business and our strategy towards it  fundamentally as we have significant growth  we plan on investing to improve our competitive position 
We believe in this nascent market and our outlook in the long term  as Mark said earlier  is unchanged  I think when you    you should start thinking about it when you expect or when we expect growth in single digits  that s when you d expect us to be at or above kind of our model profit or let s say 20  operating profit plus  as growth tends to slow 
But as we see the market and as we believe that we re going to grow significant double digits  And into the future  we re going to continue to invest to drive the top line  And then when we see the growth table off  you d expect our operating profit to improve 
Richard Eastman    Baird   Analyst 
So when the 50   that s Opex there  is that kicked up on the R D side or is this still kind of go to market support costs and expansion of the distribution base  Or where do you    where do you pull that 50  out to drop the contribution margin of 10   Because it had been writing 15  to 20  
Sanjay Mehta    Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah  it s a combination of both  I d say  The other point I d put    I d add in there is that our 2020 forecast includes auto guidance  But it s both  Really  investments and lead generation and closure  distribution  our partners  where we re really putting forward the go to market  But then also things like fleet management  system software and different software capability to help drive the scalability of our solutions to customers 
Richard Eastman    Baird    Analyst
Okay  And then just as my second question  Just Mark  I want to return to something you talked about the 5G infrastructure business in the Semi Test  You referenced there that the market there and the demand there is pausing in the China market  I m trying to get my arms a little bit around the timetable here 
Just from the standpoint of you continue to see some fairly aggressive production and deployment numbers around base station in China in the Asian market in general  And so is your reference to the test demand that that is in place ahead of the production  So there was just some inventory of the chip content into the base stations 
Or how do we reconcile the aggressive forecasts around production and deployment of base stations with your commentary about the market pausing now 
Mark E  Jagiela    Chief Executive Officer and President
Yeah  that s exactly what you said  So  in advance of deployments of the actual base stations  a lot of silicon test capacity goes in place  So now those base stations are churning out like mad out of the factories  which is why utilization of test equipment is very high  So it will require an additional bump in deployment rate of base stations to drive the next round of test equipment 
So U S   Europe  the rest of the world  And  China as well  there s not enough really capacity in China to totally facilitate China where it has to get to  but what they need to do for 2020 is probably sufficient 
Richard Eastman    Baird    Analyst

Thank you  Our next question comes from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank 
Sidney Ho    Deutsche Bank    Analyst
Great  Thanks  You talk about second quarter revenue to be flat quarter over quarter in Q2  And that s different from how it was a few years ago  2016 and 2017  Can you add a little more color  what are some of the factors that make it different than those two years 
Sanjay Mehta    Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah  Hi  it s Sanjay  So I think  in Q1 we ve had  we ll have some significant drivers outside of SOC test and then inside  The first one is storage test  or system level test and HDD where we ll have a significant revenue in Q1  which will decline in Q2  The second comment I d make is that within Semi Test  we ve got some share gains that require some initial tooling in Q1 that we will be moderating in Q2  The last point I d leave you with is that it s still early stages of Q2  So it s roughly where we think we re going to end up 
Sidney Ho    Deutsche Bank    Analyst
Okay  that s helpful  My follow up is that you guided the SOC tend to be called the roughly flat in 2020  How do you think about the different moving parts in terms of end market  And related to that how do you expect your share in SOC test to do this year  I think last year it was around 40   Any color end market customer mix  product mix that s driving these shares will be helpful  Thanks 
Mark E  Jagiela    Chief Executive Officer and President
Yeah  So our expectation this year is that the mix  the combination of some of the design wins  I alluded to in my remarks around the UltraFLEXplus platform  plus a little bit I would say of a shift toward our customers in this year will bring our share likely up into the mid four year is what we expect

Tom Diffely    D A  Davidson    Analyst
Yes  hi  I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about the service components in semi  in particular going forward and how you see that playing out 
Mark E  Jagiela    Chief Executive Officer and President
So the semi service for us for years has been a very strong part of the portfolio  it s roughly runs around 20  of semi revenue  And  it s up into the  300 million range  we don t expect as a percentage of revenue it will vary that much  But that s roughly where it is 
Tom Diffely    D A  Davidson    Analyst
Okay  so there is not a view into that increasing markedly over the next few years as you get to your target model 
Mark E  Jagiela    Chief Executive Officer and President
Yeah  I think it ll scale with system revenue  I think on the industrial automation side  that s an area where service will go from when we acquire these companies having essentially no service business  We re now growing service in those businesses at a faster rate than the top line  So that will be a story that evolves here over the next few years  but in semi it should stay consistent 
Tom Diffely    D A  Davidson    Analyst
Okay  that s it  Thank you

152528,374044,TER,Buy These 5 Top Ranked Stocks With Robust Sales Growth,opinion,Investors often fail to consider sales growth as a dependable metric when it comes to selecting stocks  This might be because of their preconceived notion that a company s stock price is typically sensitive to its earnings momentum  However  betting on stocks based on such a perception may not prove worthwhile It s worth keeping in mind that in cases when companies incur a loss  althoughbriefly  they are valued on their revenues not earnings  as top line growth  or decline  is usually an indicator of a company s future earnings performance Further  in contrast with price to earnings and price to book ratios  which can turn negative and cease to be relevant  the price to sales  P S  ratio is available even for firms that have hit choppy waters Also  a company can improve earnings by resorting to cost control measures while maintaining stable revenues  However  superior profits could be achieved through continued revenue growth Further  earnings and book value are largely influenced by several factors  However  management has limited opportunities to manipulate sales  which further underscores the importance of P S ratio A huge sales number does not necessarily convert into profits  Hence  considering a company s cash position along with its sales number can prove to be more prudent  Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow lend a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and investments Selecting Winning StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance  we have selected 5 Year Historical Sales Growth     greater than X Industry and Cash Flow more than  500 million as our main screening parameters But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks  So  we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy P S Ratio less than X Industry  This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company s revenues  The lower the ratio  the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales   Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions  four weeks  greater than X Industry  Estimate revisions  better than the industry  are often seen to trigger an increase in stock price Operating Margin  average last five years  greater than 5   Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company s sales translates into profits  A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs   an optimal situation for it Return on Equity  ROE  greater than 5   This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash  A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to

152529,374045,TER,A Tale of 3 5G Stocks   2 to Buy  and 1 to Sell,opinion,Apple  Verizon  Nokia   there are almost as many stocks you can use to play the  5G revolution  as there are investors attempting to play it  Today  we re going to use data from TipRanks  Stock Screener to explore two lesser known names that might be worth buying   and also examine why another could be one to avoid Without further ado   but with a word of thanks to Susquehanna Financial Group for doing the legwork    let s dive right in and introduce you to all three Keysight Technologies  KEYS We ll begin with Keysight   at  19 4 billion in market cap  possibly the biggest 5G play you ve never heard of Santa Rosa  California based Keysight provides electronic design and test solutions to the 5G industry  ensuring that products designed to implement this new technology will work as promised  and with an emphasis on infrastructure testing as well as R D work  Within 5G  Susquehanna analyst Mehdi Hosseini notes that Keysight  has exposure throughout the entire  5G  ecosystem including chipsets  devices  network infrastructure and data centers   and plays a role in testing base stations and network upgrades as well Keysight is coming off a strong Q4 report in November  says Hosseini  in which the company reported 8  sequential sales growth  that might have been 10  growth but for the impact of the Trump administration s ban on sales to customer Huawei   Based on how the stock is performing so far  Hosseini predicts Keysight could earn as much as  4 73 per share in fiscal 2020  and  5 77 in 2021  en route to consistent annual earnings in the  6 plus range  Not bad for a stock selling for only about  103 a share The analyst establishes his  127 price target on the stock based on the fiscal 2021 earnings estimate  applying a 22x multiple to those earnings  roughly in the middle of  peer group  stocks that are being valued at between 20 and 24x FY2021 earnings  which seems fair   To watch Hosseini s track record  click here For the record  six of the seven Street analysts who have published ratings on Keysight stock in the past two months  have rated it a  buy   Even with average price targets a bit short   122  of what Susquehanna is saying   127   the consensus on the Street is that Keysight buyers today can expect to earn an 18 5  profit on their investment   See Keysight stock analysis on TipRanks Viavi Solutions  VIAV Next up  San Jose  California based Viavi Solutions  another testing provider that also offers monitoring and assurance solutions to the 5G industry  Once again  this is one of Hosseini s favorites  and  a leader on fiber network testing and testing of base stations   Hosseini goes so far as to describe it as  the king of fiber   But wait   you object  Aren t we talking about 5G wireless internet  What does fiber have to do with that Hosseini explains  Even if 5G is a wireless technology  wireless providers still  need more fiber at points of access and as networks continue to replace legacy cables with advanced fiber technology   What s more  because 5G technology won t appear by magic  and all in an instant   between the 5G network buildout and the core network upgrade  the fiber business is in a strong position to capitalize on new opportunities   which is a good reason to own Viavi in the time period leading up to the 5G buildout Hosseini has a  19 price target on this one  and viewed from one perspective  it s slightly more aggressive than what some other analysts are saying So why does Hosseini think  19  20  upside  is a more likely price  As the analyst points out   19 a share is only about 20x to the company s fiscal year 2022 earnings estimate  For comparison  some of Viavi s competitors are trading for even richer multiples  approaching 27 times forward earnings  Viewed in that light  a  19 target price doesn t look all that unreasonable TipRanks  records show that over the last three months  even as six rating analysts have unanimously declared Viavi a  buy   their average price target is only  17 50 per share  Which by the way is till 11  upside   See Viavi stock analysis on TipRanks Teradyne  TER But will tell you what Hosseini does think unreasonable  Buying and holding Teradyne stock The only one of these three stocks that Hosseini dislikes enough to tar with a  negative  rating  North Reading  Massachusetts based semiconductor tester Teradyne is almost certainly the best known of the three stocks discussed in Hosseini s report  It s also  at a valuation of just 26 5 times earnings  arguably the best bargain of the three   Keysight stock costs almost 32 times earnings   and Viavi   more than 133x  So why doesn t Hosseini like it Simply put  he doesn t think this stock s earnings power is going to stick around much longer  Earnings per share are  peaking  at Teradyne  says the analyst   with no rebound till mid 2021    and 18 months may feel like a long time to wait for investors as they see competitors to Teradyne stock pulling ahead  Meanwhile  Teradyne stock is priced close to a 20 year high right now  which suggests there s substantially more downside risk than upside potential in the near term With revenues slowing and costs rising  Teradyne s current share price north of  72 just isn t sustainable  argues Hosseini  and he believes that a year from now  the shares could be selling for as little as  55   24  downside risk Simply put  Hosseini thinks you can do better than that   and thinks buying Keysight and Viavi are the best ways to do it Granted  the analyst may be early to this call  Most of the other bankers following Teradyne today rate the shares no worse than  hold   But even these optimists think Teradyne stock won t climb much farther than  75 a share over the next 12 months   a bare 5  profit off of today s prices   See Teradyne stock analysis on TipRanks ,2020-01-27,TipRanks,https://invst.ly/pnedq,200501714

choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Teradyne has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 19 9  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at 20 7  If we focus on the long term PE trend  the current PE level is above its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with its industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 29 3  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Teradyne has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 19 3  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for the stock in the near term too P CF RatioAn often overlooked ratio that can still be a great indicator of value is the price cash flow metric  This ratio doesn t take amortization and depreciation into account  so can give a more accurate picture of the financial health in a business  This is a preferred metric to some valuation investors because cash flows are  a  generally less prone to manipulation by the company s management  and  b  are less affected by variation in accounting policies between different companies The ratio is generally applied to find out whether a company s stock is overpriced or underpriced with reference to its cash flows generation potential compared with its competitors  However  it is not commonly used for cross industry comparison  as the average price to cash flow ratio varies from industry to industry In this case  Teradyne s P CF ratio of 16 4 is lower than its industry average of 24 2  which indicates that the stock is undervalued in this respect Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Teradyne currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Teradyne a solid choice for value investors For example  the PEG ratio for Teradyne is 1 6  a level that is lower than the industry average of 2 3  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Clearly  TER is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Teradyne might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of A and a Momentum score of B  This gives TER a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current quarter has seen six estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to none lower  while the full year estimate has seven eight up and none down in the same time period As a result  the consensus estimate for the current quarter has risen by 14 3  in the past two months  while the current year estimate has inched higher by 12 1   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Teradyne  Inc  Price and Consensus   This bullish trend is why the stock boasts a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and why we are expecting outperformance from the company in the near term Bottom LineTeradyne is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  With a good industry rank  among the Top 8   and strong Zacks Rank  Teradyne looks like a strong value contender  In fact  over the past one year  its industry has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below  So  it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company s prospects  as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pick Looking for Stocks with

and thereby earn escalated profit margins  However  the higher the degree of financial leverage  higher is the interest payment for the capital borrowed Nevertheless  this should not dissuade companies from adopting debt financing as a strategy  because after all debt comes cheaper when compared to equity  Still  debt is something that gives you the chills since it brings with it the burden of repayment with additional interest in the future In corporate finance  as long as companies successfully generate higher returns than the interest they need to pay  they remain safe havens for investors  But the problem arises when the level of debt a company bears exceeds the return it offers Especially  in times of crisis no one can be fully sure of how a company will perform the next

Vodafone Group PLC  LON VOD   NASDAQ   NASDAQ VOD       Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research Buy These 5 Low Leverage Stocks to Be on the Safe Side When you buy anything with lots of leverage  it does not require a whole lot to go wrong to lose it all     Barry RitholtzGiven the easy availability and affordability of debt  the majority of corporations do resort to debt financing rather than opting for equity  But at times  debt burden can become detrimental to the company s existence The crux of debt financing is that as long as corporations can generate a higher rate of return compared to the interest rate they have to pay  there s nothing to worry  However  the problem arises when leverage  referred to as the amount of debt a company bears  becomes exorbitant or exceeds the rate of return Since companies with large debt loads are more vulnerable during economic crisis and can even go bankrupt in the worst case scenario  understanding the amount of financial leverage a company bears is crucial Over time  varied benchmarks based on leverage ratio have emerged as an efficient tool to evaluate a company s credit worthiness for potential equity investments  The most popular among them is the debt to equity ratio Analyzing Debt to EquityDebt to Equity Ratio   Total Liabilities Shareholders  EquityThis metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears  A company with a lower debt to equity ratio implies that it has a more or less financially stable business  thereby making it a more worthy investment opportunity With the second quarter earnings season in full swing now  investors must be eyeing companies that exhibit a solid growth trajectory  However  blindly pursuing high earnings yielding stocks might be a drain on your resources if these have a high debt to equity ratio This is because a high debt to equity ratio indicates a huge level of repayment that the company has to make in connection with the large debt amount  which had once boosted its earnings growth  This makes the company s so called solid earnings very volatile Therefore to avoid losses  it is wise to go for stocks bearing low debt to equity ratio The Winning StrategyObviously given the fact that uncertainty can hit the global market anytime  choosing low leverage stocks will be a safe strategy However  an investment strategy based solely on the debt to equity ratio might not fetch the desired outcome  To choose stocks that have the potential to give you steady returns  we have expanded our screening criteria to include some other criteria  as discussed below Here are the other parameters Debt Equity less than X Industry Median  Stocks that are less leveraged than their industry peers Current Price greater than or

152887,374403,TER,5 Top Ranked Stocks Likely To Beat On Earnings ,opinion,"Gone are the days when investors were content with just earnings growth  Now  earnings improvement  no matter how big  seems inadequate for solid moves in the market  It is the  BEAT  that matters the most 
What is Earnings Beat 
A positive earnings surprise or earnings beat is typically the case when actual or reported earnings come in above the consensus estimate  Historically  if a company s earnings manage to beat market expectations  its stock surges post release 
This is becauseinvestors always try to take position ahead of time and look for stocks that are likely to come up with a stellar performance  Now since Wall Street analysts project earnings of companies after much brainstorming  their estimates act as investment leads 
Why Earnings Beat is Superior to Earnings Growth 
After all  only earnings beat can give investors a clear picture of a company s strength when an industry wide earnings recession is felt Also  a 20  earnings rise  though apparently looks good  doesn t say everything about the company s performance  This might represent a decelerating earnings growth momentum over the years or quarters  raising questions over the company s fundamentals 
Also  seasonal fluctuations come into the play at times  If a company s Q1 is seasonally weak and Q4 is strong  then it is likely to report a sequential earnings decline  In such cases  growth rates are misleading while judging the true health of a company 
On the other hand  analysts put together their insights and a company s guidance when coming up with an earnings estimate  Thus  outperforming that estimate is almost equivalent to beating the company s own expectation as well as market perception 
Last but not the least  sometimes companies manipulate earnings by resorting to accounting tricks  thereby leading to inaccuracy  So  it becomes necessary to match the performance with what analysts are expecting 
How to Find Stocks that Can Beat 
Now  since it is difficult to foretell if a company will beat or miss in the upcoming earnings season  investors can check the earnings surprise history  An impressive track in this regard generally acts as a catalyst in sending a stock higher  And investors generally believe that the company will have the same trick up its sleeve or in other words is smart enough to beat on earnings in its next release 
The Winning Strategy
In order to shortlist stocks that are likely to come up with an earnings surprise  we chose the followingas our primary screening parameters 
Last EPS Surprise greater than or equal to 10   Stocks delivering positive surprise in the last quarter tend to surprise again 
Average EPS Surprise in the last four quarters greater than 20   We lifted the bar for outperformance slightly higher by setting the average EPS surprise for the last four quarters at 20  
Average EPS Surprise in the last two quarters greater than 20   This points to a more consistent surprise history and makes the case for another surprise even stronger 
In addition  we place a few other criteria that push up the chance of a surprise 
Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Only companies with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  can get through 
 greater than zero  A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of  1  2 or 3  Hold  for an earnings beat to happen  as per our proven model 
In order to zero in on those that have long term growth potential and high trading liquidity we have added the following parameters too 
Next 3 5 Years Estimated EPS Growth  Per Year  greater than 10   Solid expected earnings growth exhibits the stock s long term growth prospects 
Average 20 day Volume greater than 100 000  High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity 
A handful of criteria has narrowed down the universe from over 7 700 stocks to around 11 
Here are five out of the 11 stocks 
Mitek Systems Inc    NASDAQ MITK    This company develops  markets and sells mobile capture and identity verification software solutions for enterprise customers worldwide  Mitek has a Zacks Rank  2  The Zacks Industry Rank of the stock is in the top 2   at the time of writing
