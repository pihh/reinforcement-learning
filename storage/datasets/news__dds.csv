24265,245780,DDS,4 Sector ETFs   Stocks To Win Despite Soft December Jobs Data,opinion,"The U S  jobs report for the month of December came in weaker than expected  The December non farm payroll reading of 145 000 was well below the estimated 164 000 as well as the downwardly revised November s reading of 256 000  For the whole of 2019  payroll employment growth came in at 2 1 million  the minimum since 2011 
 A later than normal Thanksgiving Day in 2019  which could have shifted hiring of seasonal workers  and a boost in November from the return of workers from a GM strike  are being held responsible for this downcast job data   
Overall  the unemployment rate was 3 5  in the month  down from 3 9  recorded in the year ago period  Average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls increased 0 1  to  28 32  after an upwardly revised 0 3  gain in November and missing market estimates of a 0 3  gain  In a nutshell  subdued wage growth is a concern 
Still  there are some corners in this downbeat job report that are sizzling  As a result  investors should bet on stocks and ETFs that are the largest beneficiaries of job gains  Below  we have highlighted some of these that will likely see smooth trading in the days ahead 
Health Care
Per trading economics  health care added 28 000 jobs in the month  Health care employment increased by 399 000 in a year s time  This is one of the sectors which have been adding jobs continuously  The December job gains occurred in ambulatory health care services   23 000  and in hospitals   9 000  
The fund iShares U S  Healthcare Providers ETF  should thus benefit  The index of the fund looks to track stocks of health maintenance organizations  hospitals  clinics  dentists  opticians  nursing homes  etc  The Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock added about 0 2  on Jan 10  read    
Investors can also take a look at Zacks Rank  3 HCA Healthcare Inc     NYSE HCA     The company is the largest non governmental operator of acute care hospitals in the United States 
Retail 
Last month  retail employment grew by 41 000  thanks mainly to a gain   33 000  in clothing and accessories stores  Gain in retail positions during the peak of the holiday season  the best selling period the sector  is understandable  It also paints a brighter picture of the brick and mortar retailing Employment in retail trade did not change much in 2019 and 2018     respectively  
The data makes SPDR S P Retail  NYSE XRT  ETF    a timely investment  The fund has a Zacks Rank  2 with a Medium risk outlook  Apparel retail takes the top spot in the fund with about 22 45  exposure  read     
Our pick in this regard is Zacks Rank  2 Dillard s Inc     NYSE DDS     The company s primary product categories comprise women s and children s apparel  shoes and accessories 
Leisure   Hospitality
About 40 000 jobs were created in the sector in the month  The industry added 388 000 jobs in 2019  in line with 2018   359 000  
Obviously  such positive data makes us keep a close watch on Invesco Dynamic Leisure And Entertainment ETF     The underlying Dynamic Leisure   Entertainment Intellidex Index comprises stocks of U S  leisure and entertainment companies  The fund has a Zacks ETF Rank  3 
In this regard  one can have a look at the Zacks Rank  1 stock Marriot Vacations Worldwide Corporation   NYSE VAC   
Construction

24266,245781,DDS,Should Value Investors Now Choose Dillard s  DDS  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Dillard s  Inc    NYSE DDS   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Dillard s has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 15 61  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 42  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Dillard s current PE level puts it above its midpoint of 12 40 over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months  However  the current level stands significantly below the highs for the stock  suggesting that it can be a solid entry point  Moreover  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Retail Wholesale Market sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 29 09  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that Dillard s has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 17 82  so it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near future P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Dillard s has a P S ratio of about 0 27  This is much lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 53 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years  Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Dillard s currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Dillard s a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Dillard s might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of C and Momentum Score of F  This gives DDS a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current year has seen two upward revisions in the past sixty days compared to one downward revision  while the full year 2021 estimate has seen three upward revisions compared to no downward revision in the same time period The current year consensus estimate increased 6 9  in the past two months  whereas the full year 2021 estimate rose 14 5   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Dillard s  Inc  Price and Consensus   Notably  the stock with a solid earnings surprise history and favorable estimate trends has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   which is why we are looking for outperformance from the company in the near term Bottom LineDillard s is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Furthermore  the Zacks Rank  2 company indicates that the broader factors are favorable for the company So  value investors might want to delve deeper in this stock as it appears to be a compelling pick Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana Ignited by new referendums and legislation  this industry is expected to blast from an already robust  6 7 billion to  20 2 billion in 2021  Early investors stand to make a killing  but you have to be ready to act and know just where to look ,2020-01-12,Zacks Investment

24338,245853,DDS,Alibaba  Dillard s  Coca Cola  McDonald s And Comcast Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   August 22  2019    Alibaba   NYSE BABA   as the Bull of the Day  Dillard s   NYSE DDS   as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Coca Cola   NYSE KO    McDonald s   NYSE MCD   and Comcast   NASDAQ CMCSA   Here is a synopsis of all five stocks  Alibaba easily topped our quarterly estimates last week  with sales up 42  amid the ongoing U S  and China trade war  The Chinese e commerce powerhouse s stock price has been volatile during the past two years  But Alibaba looks strong as it prepares to enter a new era  with billionaire founder Jack Ma set to step down as chairman soon Quick June Quarter Overview Alibaba s revenue surged 42  from the prior year quarter to 114 9 billion yuan  or  16 58 billion  which topped our Zacks Consensus Estimate  Investors should note that Alibaba reports its metrics in Chinese RMB and then offers a comparable U S  dollar equivalent for the  convenience of the reader  The company posted first quarter fiscal 2020 earnings of  1 83 per share  This crushed our  1 50 estimate and marked a 56  climb from the year ago period BABA s annual active consumers on its retail marketplaces reached 674 million  up 20 million from Q4 2019 and 98 million from the year ago period  On top of that  and perhaps more importantly  mobile MAUs on its China retail marketplaces reached 755 million in June 2019  an increase of 34 million over March 2019 and a whopping 121 million above Q1 2019 The Basics Alibaba operates the two largest e commerce platforms in China  Taobao and Tmall  which led to its core commerce business accounting for 87  of total Q1 sales  But like its U S  counterpart Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   Alibaba has expanded its cloud computing business in recent years BABA s cloud computing unit saw its sales soar 66  to make up 7  of total revenue  Plus  Executive Vice President Joseph Tsai last week said that Alibaba s cloud segmented is set to profit from the 5G transition Along with cloud computing and e commerce  Alibaba operates a digital media and entertainment business  which accounted for 5  of total quarterly revenue  Investors should also note that Alibaba and Salesforce in late July announced a partnership   Alibaba will become the exclusive provider of Salesforce to customers in mainland China  Hong Kong  Macau  and Taiwan  and Salesforce will become the exclusive enterprise CRM product suite sold by Alibaba    Alibaba reportedly holds about two thirds of the e commerce market share in the world s second largest economy  The company has also beefed up its logistics business as its core Chinese marketplaces  such as Beijing and Shanghai  become more saturated  The firm said that 70  of its new customers in the past quarter live in less developed areas Alibaba s ability to expand its reach to more of the country s roughly 1 42 billion people will prove vital going forward  Clearly  U S  China trade war fears still linger over the firm  But Alibaba just proved that the fight hasn t hurt the company as much as some on Wall Street might have assumed Outlook   Earnings Trends Moving on  our current estimates call for Alibaba s quarterly revenue to jump 35 7  to reach  16 82 billion  The company s full year fiscal 2020 revenue is then projected to climb 32  from roughly  56 billion to  73 46 billion  Peeking further ahead  the company s 2021 sales are expected to climb 31  above our current year estimate to reach  96 62 billion  in a sign of strong and stable top line expansion At the bottom end of the income statement  BABA s adjusted quarterly earnings are expected to climb 11 3  to  1 56 per share  Alibaba s full year fiscal 2020 EPS figure is then expected to surge nearly 26   with 2021 projected to come in 25  higher than our current year estimate Alibaba has easily topped our earnings estimates in the trailing four periods  by a 19  average  Furthermore  BABA s earnings estimate revision activity has moved in the right direction following its recent earnings release  especially for the current quarter and fiscal year  Bottom LineAlibaba is a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  at the moment that also holds a  B  grade for Momentum in our Style Scores system  The firm s top line growth is expected to slow down on a percentage basis  which is to be somewhat expected as its overall sales reach eye popping totals The Chinese e commerce power has  of course  diversified and cloud computing could help prove to be a catalyst for expansion into other areas  much like it has been for Amazon  We should also note that shares of BABA rest roughly 11  below their 52 week high  which could give them some room to run  Dillard s posted worse than projected second quarter results on August 15 as the department store chain s struggles to adapt to the e commerce and delivery age remain  DDS shares are now down over 26  in the last 12 months and Dillard s outlook doesn t appear as though it will help boost investor confidence Second QuarterDillard s posted an adjusted quarterly loss of  1 74 per share last week  This marked a massive downturn from the year ago period s loss and came in far below our Zacks Consensus Estimate that called for a loss of  0 66  Meanwhile  DDS Q2 revenues slipped roughly 3   while comparable store sales dipped 2  Investors should also note that the company did not even provide any positive management updates or quotes in its latest quarterly press release  In fact  Dillard s provided almost no guidance whatsoever  which is hardly a good sign  The Little Rock  Arkansas based company s rough second quarter is part of ongoing disappointment from fellow department stores DDS Overview We can see that Dillard s sales have slipped in recent years amid a quickly changing retail landscape  DDS executives have focused on trying to reward shareholders with buybacks and dividends instead  The company bought back roughly 0 8 million shares during Q2 for a total  48 9 million  under its  500 million repurchase program As we mentioned at the top  DDS stock has tumbled recently  Shares of DDS are down roughly 6  in 2019  But this actually comes in far better than the broader department store market s 38  average decline  The chart below  however  shows just how terrible the last five years have been for Dillard s  especially against the larger retail market s impressive climb Outlook   Earnings Trends Moving on  the company s third quarter revenue is projected to fall approximately 4  to  1 40 billion  with full year fiscal 2019 revenue expected to sink 2 5   Peeking further down the road  the company s 2020 revenue is projected to fall 0 50  below our current year estimate Dillard s earnings estimates appear even worse at the moment  The company s adjusted Q3 earnings are projected to tumble from positive  0 27 a share in the year ago period to a loss of  0 21 per share  The firm s full year EPS figure is also expected to sink 42   with 2020 projected to come in 9 4  below our current year estimate  Investors will also see just how much worse its earnings estimate picture has turned 3 Blue Chip Dividend Stocks to Buy as Bond Yields Fall  Global Worries RiseFears of a global economic slowdown have hung over markets recently  Growing worries about the trade war between the U S  and China have also helped drag the S P 500 down roughly 2 7  in the past month  And yields on the 10 year U S  Treasury note have tumbled as investors pour into one of the world s safest investments By now  many investors might have heard about last week s yield curve inversion  which saw yields on the 10 year U S  Treasury briefly slip below 2 year yields for the first time since 2007  Some fear the yield curve inversion could signal a recession  as it has in the past  But even if this proves not to be the case  investors do need to pay attention to the yields on 10 year U S  Treasury notes because they could make dividend paying stocks even more valuable Yields on 10 year U S  Treasury notes rested at 1 57  through morning trading Wednesday  down from 2 05  on July 24 and 2 39  three months ago  These low yields could make Wall Street and investors look for higher returns elsewhere  in a phenomenon known as the Tina effect or  there is no alternative  to stocks With this in mind  we searched for strong companies that boast impressive  stable business models that wouldn t likely be impacted too greatly by a possible U S  economic slowdown  We then added a solid dividend yield to our criteria using the  1  Coca Cola Coca Cola topped estimates last quarter and raised its full year organic revenue growth forecast  Coca Cola Zero Sugar posted its seventh consecutive quarter of double digit volume growth globally and the firm rolled out its first ever Costa Coffee ready to drink product in Great Britain  KO purchased the British coffee chain for  5 1 billion earlier this year as part of its plan to expand beyond the soda  pop  market  This also includes investments in Gatorade rival BodyArmor  the introduction of its first energy drink under the Coca Cola brand  and more KO s organic revenue excluding currency swings  acquisitions  and divestitures jumped 6  in Q2 2019  The firm now expects its full year organic revenues to pop 5   Our Zacks Consensus Estimates call for the company s fiscal 2019 revenue to jump 15 7   including acquisitions and divestitures  with the company s 2020 growth set to come in roughly 5  above our 2019 estimate in a sign of stabilized expansion Coca Cola s adjusted fiscal 2019 EPS figure is expected to climb 1   with 2020 projected to come in 8  higher  Plus  KO currently pays an annualized dividend of  1 60 per share  with an impressive 2 97  yield  Coca Cola is also a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  that boats a  B  grade for Growth in our Style Scores system  And just so we don t think KO s yield is artificially inflated  shares of the beverage power have surged 18  over the last 12 months to outpace the S P s sideways movement 2  McDonald sShares of MCD have soared over 37  over the last 52 weeks and are up 10  in the past three months  McDonald s stock has also destroyed the S P 500 during a three year stretch  up 91  against the S P s 32  expansion  In the second quarter  the global fast food powerhouse s same store sales popped 6 5   with U S  comps up 5 7   Company management noted that higher prices helped boost sales  along with increased delivery offerings and self ordering kiosks The firm announced in mid July that it added DoorDash as a delivery partner  which ended its exclusive relationship with UberEats  MCD s delivery push has become the norm in the Amazon age as rivals such as Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX  race to offer consumers more options  McDonald s also expects to open roughly 1 200 restaurants this year and try to remodel and upgrade stores  while encouraging franchisees to do the same McDonald s longer term earnings estimate revision activity has trended heavily in the right direction following its Q2 earnings release  Our estimates call for the company s fiscal 2019 earnings to jump 1 4   with 2020 s figure projected to come in 9 5  higher  MCD is a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  at the moment  with an annualized dividend of  4 64 per share  up roughly 11  from the previous year period  Meanwhile  the company s yield rest at 2 12  3  Comcast Comcast stock is up 23  in the past year and 28  in 2019  The communication and entertainment giant s booming internet business helped offset the industry wide cord cutting dilemma  Second quarter high speed internet revenue jumped 9 4   while business services sales surged 9 8   The company also saw its newer wireless business soar 21   Xfinity Mobile  which launched in 2017  hopes to challenge the likes of AT T  NYSE T  Comcast s Sky acquisition is also set to help the firm expand its reach  Plus  CMCSA said it plans to launch its own streaming service through its NBCUniversal unit in April 2020  The platform  which will be home to The Office and much more  expects to compete alongside Netflix  NASDAQ NFLX   Amazon Prime  and others The firm s full year revenues are expected to jump 16 6  to reach  112 24 billion  Peeking further ahead  2020 revenues are projected to climb a solid 5 3  above its Sky boosted 2019 results  CMCSA s full year EPS figure is expected to climb 20   with 2020 s earnings projected to jump roughly 10 3  above our current year estimate  Like its blue chip peers  Comcast is a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  right now that sports an  A  grade for Value  CMCSA currently pays a quarterly dividend of  0 21 per share  up from the prior fiscal year s  0 19  with a 1 9  yield Biggest Tech Breakthrough in a GenerationBe among the early investors in the new type of device that experts say could impact society as much as

24379,245894,DDS,Will Macy s Stock Continue Its Plummet After Q3 Earnings  ,opinion,"Macy s   NYSE M   will report its third quarter financial performance before the market opens on Thursday  November 21  The once storied retailer has seen its shares plummet over 49  in 2019 as top and bottom line declines continue to plague Macy s 
However  fellow struggling retailer JC Penney   NYSE JCP   provided hope for Macy s and the department store industry when it reported a solid quarter last Friday that sent its shares up over 11  in intraday trading  However  JC Penney is still trading for around  1 which may demean its large jump  Can Macy s follow in JC Penney s footsteps and make up some of its losses in the closing months of the year 
Long Recovery Road 
Macy s definitely has its work cut out if it wishes to get its business back on the right track  The department store giant is coming off a quarter where it marked its seventh consecutive quarter of same store sales growth  However  the comparable store sales growth came at the expense of the firm s gross profit margin  which led Macy s to slash its full year bottom line guidance  The company s probability issues and lowered full year EPS guidance prompted investors to flee the stock 
Macy s is also weighed down by heavy debt  which dims the outlook for the department store  The retailer s outstanding debt in August 2019 was  4 7 billion  with  674 million in cash on the balance sheet  Earnings before interest and taxes fell 21  in the past year and if this continues the company might have a hard time paying off its debt 
Macy s is tasked with mitigating the aforementioned headwinds to survive the retail apocalypse that has consumed department stores  Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN   has captivated users with the convenience of next day delivery thanks to the company s logistics network  which has helped  of clothing sales in the US to the digital marketplace  Consumers are now visiting malls for food and time with friends  instead of discovering new fashion trends at big box stores 
Moving Forward   
Macy s must figure out a way to drive traffic in its stores in a cost efficient manner instead of sacrificing its bottom line to sustain its comp sales growth  Younger consumers often prioritize experience and ambiance  which department stores like Macy s can try to cater to 
For example  some retailers often have workers who help customers create an outfit which is something that can t be easily replicated online  The friendly experience of having a fashion inclined worker help an indecisive customer pick out an outfit is something that could resonate with customers and Macy s could consider trying out 
Brick and mortar chains also can look to offer an optimized omnichannel experience that can combine the conveniences of both realms  However  implementing such changes may be difficult for Macy s as its outstanding debt may make it more difficult to allocate capital to costly initiatives 
Investors should note that Macy s faces a difficult Y Y comp sales comparison in the upcoming third quarter after it posted a 3 3  jump in comps in Q3 2018  Macy s CFO  Paula Price  acknowledged that this means the company s Q3 results could be  outside of our annual guidance range   However  in the fourth quarter  management expects same store sales to pick back up again  as in Q4 2018 comp sales rose a moderate 0 7  
Our Q3 consensus estimates call for earnings to plummet over 96  to  0 01 per share and for net sales to slip 1 74  to  5 31 billion  Same store sales for the third quarter are projected to come in at  1 2  and 190 stores are expected to be added onto Q2 2019 s figure  Looking ahead to the full fiscal year  earnings are forecasted to fall 32 54  to  2 82 per share and net revenue is projected to miss last year s figure by 0 59  
Takeaway 
Macy s has been hit with an onslaught of headwinds that have sent the stock spiraling downward over the year  The firm s eroding margins are a cause for concern  which the company should address in the coming report  The diminishing forward guidance continues to deter investors from the stock even as it trades below 6X its forward earnings and pays out a dividend with an 8 95  yield 
For the time being  Macy s hasn t given Wall Street much hope about mounting a comeback any time soon  Macy s sits at a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  and has underperformed other retailers like JC Penney  Nordstrom   NYSE JWN    and Dillard s   NYSE DDS   YTD

24508,246023,DDS,Trump blasts retailer Nordstrom  raising new concern on business ties,news,"By Nandita Bose and Timothy Gardner WASHINGTON CHICAGO  Reuters    President Donald Trump blasted department store chain  Nordstrom Inc   N JWN  on Wednesday for dropping his daughter Ivanka s clothing line  prompting critics to accuse him of misusing public office to benefit his family s sprawling business empire  After Trump s highly unusual move to use a White House platform to intervene in a commercial matter involving his daughter  Nordstrom reiterated that its action last week was based on declining sales of the Ivanka Trump products  But White House spokesman Sean Spicer characterized the move as a  direct attack  on the president s policies   My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by  Nordstrom  She is a great person   always pushing me to do the right thing  Terrible   Trump wrote on Wednesday on both his personal and official presidential Twitter accounts  Ethics officials who served past Republican and Democratic administrations said Trump s tweet was both unprecedented for a president and troublesome   This is misuse of public office for private gains   Richard Painter  who served as Republican President George W  Bush s chief ethics lawyer  said in an email to Reuters   And it is abuse of power because the official message is clear   Nordstrom is persona non grata with the administration   Norman Eisen  an ethics adviser to Democratic President Barack Obama  noted that several states have unfair competition laws  including California where Nordstrom operates many stores  The tweet  he said  could spark lawsuits if the company s brand was being injured by an unfair attack  The wealthy New York real estate developer who became president on Jan  20 has declined to sell off his businesses despite demands from critics that he do so to avoid thorny conflicts of interest  Trump on Jan  11 said he would maintain ownership of his global business empire but hand off control to his two oldest sons during his presidency  Trump s web of international companies remains a bit opaque since he has refused to release his tax returns  which experts have said would provide a clearer view of his business interests  Ethics experts have said Trump s arrangement does little to address potential conflicts because he would still know what assets he owned  such as Trump branded golf courses and hotels  and his family would continue to profit from them  Ivanka Trump ran a clothing and jewelry business bearing her name  in addition to other work for the Trump Organization  before saying she would resign when her father was sworn in as president  Her father s various contentious actions and comments have prompted boycott efforts by critics and have driven some consumers away from Trump family businesses  During a White House press briefing  Spicer painted Nordstrom s action as an attack on the president s daughter   For someone to take out their concern with his policies on a family member of his is just not acceptable  And the president has every right as a father to stand up to them   Spicer said  A spokeswoman for the Ivanka Trump brand declined to comment  On Tuesday  First lady Melania Trump filed a  150 million defamation lawsuit accusing the Daily Mail British tabloid of damaging her brand by falsely reporting she had worked as an escort  The lawsuit said the article ruined a  unique  once in a lifetime opportunity  for the first lady but her lawyer said she  has no intention of using her position for profit    TOTALLY INAPPROPRIATE  Democrats pounced on Trump for the tweet   I think it s inappropriate  but he s a totally inappropriate president   said Nancy Pelosi  the top U S  House of Representatives Democrat  Senator Bob Casey  a Democrat  in a tweet indicated the matter should be referred to the federal Office of Government Ethics  Nordstrom said it informed Ivanka Trump about its decision in early January   Over the past year  and particularly in the last half of 2016  sales of the brand have steadily declined to the point where it didn t make good business sense for us to continue with the line for now   the retailer told Reuters  Nordstrom shares initially fell after the president s criticism but closed up 4 percent on the New York Stock Exchange  Retailers still selling Ivanka Trump products include  Macys  Inc  N M   TJX Cos  N TJX   Hudson s Bay Co  TO HBC   which runs high end chains like Lord   Taylor  and  Dillards  Inc  N DDS   Retailers that have dropped Ivanka Trump include Neiman Marcus  NMRCUS UL  and  HSN  Inc  O HSNI  The move by some retailers to drop her products comes amid an ongoing campaign called  GrabYourWallet  which encourages shoppers to boycott products with ties to President Trump  his family and his donors  Usage of the hashtag on Twitter rose dramatically on Wednesday    President Trump said he is going to have nothing to do with his family businesses   said Robert Weissman  president of liberal watchdog group Public Citizen   His reaction to developments with his daughter s business line suggests that claim is untrue   Trump s tweet left fellow Republicans in an uncomfortable position  Republican Senator David Perdue of Georgia told Reuters of Trump s tweet   That sounds like a personal matter to me   Perdue added   He is a citizen and he is a citizen who is now president of the United States   Republican Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin  asked whether the president should be criticizing a publicly traded company over its business dealings with Trump s daughter  said   I don t know the answer to that question  Let me think about what the answer is   Since winning the presidential election on Nov  8  Trump has castigated specific companies on Twitter but this was his first tweet involving a business tied to his family since the victory

24540,246055,DDS,Nordstrom family explores taking retailer private  shares surge,news,"By Nandita Bose and Gayathree Ganesan  Reuters    Department store operator  Nordstrom Inc   N JWN  said on Thursday that some members of the Nordstrom family were considering taking the company private as it struggles with an industry wide sales slowdown  Going private  which would involve raising debt  would be a risky but potentially profitable bet by Nordstrom s founding family and largest shareholder bloc that the company can reshape itself and emerge from the retail meltdown stronger   Shares of the Seattle based clothing and accessories retailer ended 10 3 percent higher after having surged as much as 18 percent in their biggest intraday percentage gain since February 2009  The company has a market value of about  7 4 billion  U S  malls have been struggling with slowing customer traffic and mall anchors like Nordstrom and Macy s Inc  N M  are trying to revive sales   Nordstrom in May reported first quarter same store sales that fell short of estimates  triggering a drop in its shares  Once it goes private  Nordstrom may be able to restructure its business  which is more difficult as a public company  said Erich Joachimsthaler  chief executive of Vivaldi  a consulting firm that works with retail brands   It s the right move   he said  At a share price of  46  the retailer would need to raise  5 45 billion to  8 19 billion of additional debt to fund the takeout  said Chuck Grom  analyst with Gordon Haskett  Such a move would come amid a wave of store closures and bankruptcies in the retail industry   High end department store chain Neiman Marcus  which went private in 2005  said in March it is exploring options as it seeks relief from its swelling debt pile  Analysts and consultants were divided on how successful Nordstrom could be in going private   UBS Group AG analysts said in a report that they were cautious about Nordstrom s ability to secure financing given problems in the retail sector  They also flagged a bid by the founder of electronics retailer  Best Buy  Co Inc  N BBY  to take the company private that failed in 2013 when he was unable to raise  2 5 billion to  3 billion in debt  Other analysts said that going private may be slightly easier for Nordstrom   Nordstrom is not highly levered  they have quite a bit in their way of real estate assets so is it probably easier for them to actually get this transaction done   said Jan Rogers Kniffen  chief executive of retail consultancy J  Rogers Kniffen WWE   Founded in 1901 as a shoe store in Seattle  Nordstrom went public in 1971  The retailer  known for its high end department stores and customer service  sells designer items including Jimmy Choo stilettos and Burberry trench coats   Nordstrom operates 354 stores in 40 states which includes its Nordstrom branded full line stores and off price discount chain Nordstrom Rack  The company also operates stores in Canada and Puerto Rico   Shares of other U S  department store chains rose after Nordstrom s announcement   Dillard s Inc  N DDS  gained as much as 6 3 percent  Macy s rose 3 3 percent and  Kohls Corp   N KSS  climbed 1 3 percent early on Thursday  The stocks pared gains in afternoon trade  with Macy s and Kohl s ending the day in negative territory   TAKING IT PRIVATE In a filing with the U S  Securities and Exchange Commission  the department store operator said the group formed to consider going private had not made a formal proposal   The group comprises Chairman Emeritus Bruce Nordstrom  his sister Anne Gittinger  President James Nordstrom and co Presidents Blake  Peter and Erik Nordstrom  The group  which owns 31 2 percent of the company  said it was not interested in selling its stake to third parties or voting for an alternative deal  With the Nordstrom family s share ownership  the odds of a deal getting done are higher  said Grom with Gordon Haskett  The ownership would appear to satisfy the requirements of a leveraged buyout transaction  he said  The largest shareholders in the company from the group include Bruce Nordstrom with 16 9 percent of outstanding shares  followed by Gittinger with 9 3 percent  according to Thomson Reuters data  Peter and Blake Nordstrom own about 1 7 percent each    Because of the changing dynamics in the retail environment  the group is evaluating whether the long term interests of the issuer  Nordstrom  are better served as a privately held company   the members of the Nordstrom family said in a filing  The company s board has formed a committee of independent directors to explore the possibility of any transaction that could be made by the group   The committee said it had entered into an agreement with the Nordstrom family members over some standstill provisions that would prevent them from taking certain actions until Jan  31  2019   The special committee has hired Centerview Partners as its financial adviser and Sidley Austin as legal counsel   The Nordstrom family is working with investment bank Moelis   Co  N MC  as its financial adviser and Hogan Lovells as legal counsel

24585,246100,DDS,U S  banks ramp up credit card lending but margins may suffer,news,"By David Henry
NEW YORK  Reuters    As traditional Wall Street moneymakers like stock and bond trading suffer  banks are growing increasingly willing to invest in less glamorous operations  their credit card businesses 
JPMorgan Chase   Co   N JPM  Citigroup Inc  N C  and other big banks are making more credit card loans  after years of focusing mainly on customers who paid off their balances each month  Lenders hope that in an era when consumers are conducting more of their banking online and less in branches  an increased emphasis on credit cards will help them sell more products to their customers 
The shift underscores how seemingly staid businesses have become increasingly attractive on Wall Street as tougher capital rules and lower trading volume have cut into profits at trading units  Bank of America and Citigroup now make about 25 percent or more of their income from credit cards  after excluding businesses they are shedding  That is up from about 15 percent before the financial crisis 
Analysts will be closely watching credit card results as banks post earnings this week  They are primed after seeing Citigroup  for example  take in more revenue from cards last year than from stock and bond trading  and after seeing card loan balances increase this year in national banking data 
Bank executives have noticed a change in how rivals are pushing for more card business 
 A lot of companies are getting back to marketing their products aggressively   said Eileen Serra  chief executive for cards at JPMorgan  which was earlier than others with a bigger push into the cards business 
Banks cut back on advertising  mailings  and rewards programs during the financial crisis  when losses jumped  But the marketing is now increasing again  According to Mintel  a market research firm  banks are on track to mail out about 17 percent more offers for credit cards this year compared with 2010 
BIG SPENDERS
So far  the big banks have shown no sign of seeking more subprime borrowers  industry experts say  but some expect banks will gradually ease credit standards as increased competition and the drive for higher profits pushes them to look harder for new borrowers 
In the years after the financial crisis  banks focused on credit card customers who were big spenders  charging upwards of  15 000 a year on their cards  but who also generally pay down their balances in full every month  They make little money directly from these customers  but they earn high fees from merchants  every time a consumer spends using a credit card  the merchant pays fees of roughly 2 percent to the banks and the processors of the transactions  That fee income is stable and low risk 
 The lending business generates significant  sustainable  quality revenue   said Jud Linville  the chief executive for Citigroup s branded cards 
However  the potential profit growth from those fees is tailing off because of intense competition  Spending on JPMorgan Chase cards increased 12 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier  while fee revenue after rewards program costs fell 1 percent 
Banks are all looking for the holy grail  consumers who spend a lot  and will carry a balance from time to time  including all the interest rate charges that often run to a rate of 15 percent or more 
About 25 to 30 percent of card customers fit into this category and generate as much as 90 percent of card profit  according to a September report from the Boston Consulting Group 
Finding these customers is not always easy  but  teaser rates   such as offering low or no interest charges for the first year the consumer uses the card  is one way to win them  Good customer service can also help 
There is some evidence that consumers overall are more willing to borrow on their credit cards  Banks  outstanding credit card loans rose at a seasonally adjusted  annualized rate of 5 5 percent in September  Federal Reserve data show  far exceeding 2013 s increase of 0 8 percent  While the pace of card loan growth has varied in recent months  bankers   such as JPMorgan Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake   have said they are increasingly optimistic about rising balances 
 ARMS RACE 
Since the financial crisis  banks have competed intensely for big spenders by offering rewards or cash back on credit cards  But by now almost all of the most creditworthy customers already hold cards that pay rewards  said Marianne Berry  a managing director and payments expert at Auriemma Consulting Group 
At this point banks are in what Berry called an  arms race  to make their rewards programs attractive enough to lure customers from other banks and to keep the ones who have already signed on 
Cash back offers have increased from 1 percent of spending under certain conditions to 1 5 percent with no conditions  Citigroup has introduced a card that offers 2 percent cash back  1 percent when the charge is made and 1 percent when the customer pays his or her credit card bill 
That 2 percent is  kind of the limit  of what banks can practically afford to pay in cash back or other rewards because of the costs of preparing statements  issuing cards  and providing account security  said Odysseas Papadimitriou  founder of CardHub com  which tracks card terms 
Citigroup s Linville said the card drives enough revenue for the bank that it makes sense 
Some competitors have made new commitments to the race  Wells Fargo   Co   N WFC  the fourth biggest U S  bank by assets  earlier this year teamed up with American Express Co  N AXP  to offer two new cards designed to appeal to big everyday spenders or frequent fliers as it tries to bulk up its card portfolio  The bank made another deal with retailer Dillard s Inc  N DDS  in April to offer and service credit cards to store customers 

Portales Partners analyst Charles Peabody said the increased competition is going to yield profits that are less than many people anticipated  which will likely spur lenders to take more risk   They are going to get more aggressive   he said

24626,246141,DDS,Intel  Dillard s And Boeing Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day ,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   November 29  2018    highlights Intel Corporation   NASDAQ INTC   as the Bull of the Day  Dillard s Inc    NYSE DDS   as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Boeing   NYSE BA   Here is a synopsis of all the three stocks   Intel Corporation has been a chipmaking powerhouse for decades after it officially became the world s largest semiconductor supplier in the early 1990s  Today s market is more crowded and Intel has faced some serious setbacks  But Intel is coming off an impressive quarter and its Q4 and full year projections look strong Overview Intel announced earlier in November that its board approved a  15 billion increase in its stock repurchase program  Right off the bat  this likely signals that Intel executives believe INTC stock is undervalued  Plus  it helps create more value for shareholders as the relative ownership stake of each investor increases Meanwhile  Intel posted strong third quarter financial results at the end of October  The company s revenues surged 19  to  19 16 billion  which not only topped expectations but marked an all time Q3 record  Some of Intel s more buzz worthy segments  such as IoT and its Mobileye  F 0ME  autonomous vehicle unit  both achieved record revenue On the other side  the company s adjusted quarterly earnings soared 39  to  1 40 per share  Intel also raised its fourth quarter earnings and revenue outlook   Dillard s Inc  is coming off a disappointing bottom line miss last quarter and its stock price has plummeted over the last six months  Looking ahead  the fashion retailer s holiday quarter earnings and revenue outlook appears less than inspiring Overview Dillard s closed its most recent quarter with 267 official Dillard s locations and 25 clearance centers  The Little Rock  Arkansas based firm s adjusted Q3 earnings plummeted roughly 34  from the year ago quarter to hit  0 27 per share  which also fell well short of our  0 56 a share Zacks Consensus Estimate Meanwhile  the department store operator posted revenue of  1 46 billion  This came in above our estimate and marked a 4 2  jump from the year ago period   While we are encouraged by our 3  comparable sales performance  this was a disappointing quarter as markdowns weighed heavily on gross margin  particularly in the first month   CEO William T  Dillard  II said in a company statement Stock Price Movement As we mentioned at the top  shares of DDS have tumbled roughly 14  in the last six months  which is worse than its peer group s 3  decline  Plus  we can see that the last five years have been a rollercoaster for Dillard s DDS stock closed regular trading Wednesday up 2 54  to  70 53 per share  This still represented a roughly 29  downturn compared to the company s 52 week high of  98 75 per share Outlook   Earnings Trends  Looking ahead  our current Zacks Consensus Estimate is calling for Dillard s Q4 revenues to sink by 5 4  to reach  1 99 billion  The fashion retailer s full year revenues are projected to slip by 0 25  to hit  6 41 billion  Plus  if we take a peek ahead to fiscal 2019  the company s revenues are projected to drop marginally from our current year outlook Moving on  Dillard s adjusted quarterly earnings are expected to fall by 7 1  to hit  2 62 per share  Investors should note that the company s adjusted fiscal 2018 earnings are projected to surge by 19 38   However  fiscal 2019 s earning picture is then expected to dip 5  below our 2018 estimate   Maybe more importantly  Dillard s earnings picture has turned more negative over the past 30 days  DDS  Q4 earnings estimate has slipped by  0 19 per share during this stretch  Meanwhile  the company s full year earnings estimate fell by  0 75 a share Additional content Why Was Boeing  BA  Surging on Wednesday Shares of Boeing were up more than 4 5  in afternoon trading hours Wednesday  as investors reacted positively to Fed chair Jerome Powell s speech and a pair of headlines involving the aerospace behemoth specifically U S  stocks in general moved higher Wednesday afternoon on the back of Powell s statement that interest rates are close to neutral  Wall Street interpreted this as an indication that the Fed is nearing the end of its rate hike cycle  which is a shift in tone from where the central bank stood just a few months ago Powell and the rest of his committee are expected to raise rates by 25 basis points in December  Investors in recent months have grown concerned that the Fed is raising rates too quickly  but now it appears some reprieve is on the horizon The S P 500 jumped as much as 1 8  on the news  The Dow Jones Industrial Average added about 550 points  putting the blue chip index on track for its best trading session since late March Dow component Boeing saw added gains in the wake of a few headlines  Notably  a WSJ report said that investigators in Indonesia are now exploring whether maintenance issues were at fault for a deadly crash involving a Boeing 737 in October  It appears possible that human maintenance mistakes  rather than fundamental issues with the 737  contributed to the accident Investors also reacted favorably to the news that Boeing inked a new deal with Israel Aerospace Industries  Boeing will reportedly provide the state owned aerospace company with contracts worth billions of shekel Boeing recently agreed to a  reciprocal procurement  with Israel that will see the Chicago based company spend billions of dollars in the country if its wins certain defense contracts Analysts have been largely impressed with Boeing recently  The stock has seen nine positive revisions to its full year and next year EPS estimates within the last 60 days  with no negative revisions to any estimates coming in over that time Boeing is now expected to see earnings of  18 08 per share in 2019  which would represent growth of 20  from this year s projected total  Full year earnings growth is expected to reach 25  in 2018  Positive estimate revisions and upbeat earnings surprises in recent quarters have earned Boeing a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  More Stock News  This Is Bigger than the iPhone It could become the mother of all technological revolutions  Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  sold a mere 1 billion iPhones

24630,246145,DDS,5 Great Retail Stocks To Buy Ahead Of Q4 Earnings ,opinion,For most U S  retailers  2018 was an extremely good year  On the one hand  traditional retailers found the balance between and offline and online presence  extending their life span in the process  On the other hand  digital marketers continued to challenge the status quo with innovations It was a different story for the sector s stocks of course  with the sector ending the year in the red  However  a nascent recovery has been witnessed in the last one month  with the stocks gaining from a late Santa Claus Rally With the economy remaining strong and the job market continuing to be bullish  retail remains a good investment option  This is why it is a good idea to pick up select stocks from the sector that are likely to outperform their earnings estimates Retailers Enjoyed Strong 2018A strong economy and a robust labor market propelled retail higher in 2018  According to Matthew Shay  president and CEO of the National Retail Federation  2018 was  one of the best years for the retail industry in a decade  Shay added that forecasts of a  retail apocalypse  have all but disappeared  However  he agreed that there are factors which  are out of our control   At the same time  if the sector manages to  avoid self inflicted wounds   a successful 2019 is within sight Further  retailers enjoyed a great holiday season with sales hitting a six year high  Excluding automobiles  holiday retail sales grew 5 1  between Nov 1 and Dec 24 compared with the year ago period  per MastercardSpendingPulse  which tracks both online and in store spending with all forms of payment Per the report  shoppers spent more than  850 billion this holiday season  Given that Christmas Eve fell on Monday  retailers benefited from the last minute push from shoppers  who were counting on the final weekend to complete their gift buying   Read   Q4 Earnings Prospects HealthyEarnings and revenue growth for sectors across the board are expected to decelerate appreciably in the fourth quarter  For retail stocks  total Q3 earnings were up 26 1  on 6 4  higher revenues But total Q4 earnings for the sector are expected to be up 18 7  on 4 7  higher revenues  This represents a considerable decline in pace  but is still better than autos  conglomerates and utilities  Earnings growth for these sectors is set to decline 15 4   13 1  and 6 3   respectively Overall  retail stocks had a torrid 2018  The SPDR S P Retail ETF  NYSE XRT  is down 8 3  over the past year and 4  over the past three months  However  a late Santa Claus rally has boosted the sector and it is up 16 7  over the past one month and 9 4  year to date For the S P 500 index as a whole  total Q4 earnings are expected to be up 10 7  from the same period last year on 5 3  higher revenues   Read   Our ChoicesIt now seems that retailers have emerged from 2018 relatively unscathed  While the sector still faces a number of challenges  a strong economy and robust labor market remain its main driving forces  A robust holiday sales season indicates that the sector may have sufficient momentum left after all  is our proprietary

bearing on consumer sentiment  Per the preliminary report from the University of Michigan  consumer sentiment index dipped to its lowest level in two years in January  owing to a host of reasons that raise concerns about the prospects of the economy Issues such as U S  China trade conflict  volatile crude prices  tightening of monetary policy  partial government shutdown and slowing global economy gravely hurt the consumer sentiment that tumbled to 90 7 in January 2019   its lowest since October 2016   from 98 3 in December 2018  Fading of tax cut benefit and concerns related to the moderating pace of economic growth in 2019 were other dampening factors Apparently  consumers  expectations about the economy have somewhat petered out  There is a lingering fear that a fall in consumer sentiment may impact consumers  spending pattern  which accounts for over two thirds of the U S  economic activity  Undoubtedly  reluctance on the part of consumers to spend more is the last thing retailers want A group of investors believe that these factors will weigh on markets  Nonetheless  some experts chose to look on the sunny side with a strengthening labor market and rising disposable income  An uptick in this metric is welcome news for retailers  Notably  the U S  economy added 312 000 jobs in December  Further  October and November s job data were revised higher It is hard to predict what awaits investors but with earnings season underway it would be prudent to invest in stocks that are likely trump earnings estimates  Here we have highlighted four  stocks with the

24723,246238,DDS,Week Ahead  Equities  Yields  Dollar Slump  Is Risk Off Sentiment Back ,opinion,"Most US stocks rose on Friday but finished the week lower
Yields set to top out  suggesting more equity selloffs  VIX rose as well
Dollar fell from 17 month high to bottom of rising channel
WTI on course for Death Cross
Renewed hopes of a resolution to the ongoing trade dispute pushed major US benchmarks the S P 500  Dow  and Russell 2000 higher for a second day on Friday  However  the NASDAQ Composite slipped yet again  All US averages ended the week lower as well  as the retail picture soured and technology shares languished  Treasury yields dropped  dragging down the dollar  signaling the possibility of risk off sentiment returning to markets 
This is the opposite pattern seen in the previous two weeks  when stocks gained for the week but finished lower on Friday  We posited then that perhaps traders were losing their nerve and were unwilling to commit to weekend positions  yet were unable to forego investing when both the economy and earnings have been on fire  According to Gallup s economic survey  this is the best economy in 19 years  reports also indicate we re seeing the highest consumer confidence in 14 years  As well  equity markets are just finishing their best earnings season since the financial crisis 
3 Reasons For Risk Off s Return
So why is risk off sentiment returning  A number of reasons 
Apple  NASDAQ AAPL   which accounts for 12  of the NASDAQ s weighting and 5  of the Dow Jones Industrial Average  had its worst week in seven months last week  down 5   16  off its recent high  Concerns about disappointing iPhone sales and slower growth led shares to their seventh straight weekly loss  the longest negative stretch for the stock since 2012 
Crude oil volatility also continued  While higher gasoline prices boosted inflation in October  the recent slump in prices will have the opposite effect  Overall  however  consumer prices rose as much as expected last month  easing fears of overheating inflation and faster interest rate hikes 
On the Brexit front  a draft deal for the withdrawal of Britain from the European Union was reached  but that plan needs to survive vetting in Parliament and cabinet defections are pointing to continued uncertainty for a final deal 
Mega Caps Back On Top
In a rare occurrence  not seen since March  on Friday  both small caps and mega caps outperformed  Since the trade war broke out  the two indices have had a negative correlation  as traders rotated to domestic companies when trade risk increased  since growth for those companies was not reliant on exports  then rotated back to mega caps when headlines spurred hopes for a trade deal  Technically  however  they are on the opposite ends of the spectrum  with the Dow providing the strongest picture and the Russell the weakest 

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0 49 percent on Friday  for a second day  gaining a total of 1 33 percent  The 30 component index jumped after US President Donald Trump appeared to signal a willingness to come to a deal with China at this month s G 20 summit 
Energy firms Chevron  NYSE CVX  and ExxonMobil  NYSE XOM  which together have over a 5 percent weighting of the average  tracked crude s rally  for a third day  Technically  the Dow outperformed among the major US indices 
It remains above its uptrend line since the previous  early 2016 correction  as well as above its 200 DMA  with MAs in a bullish pattern  shorter MAs above longer MAs  demonstrating that performance improves with time   and  finally  the mega cap index is the only one trending upward in the mid term  as it trades within an ascending channel 

The Russell 2000 climbed 0 51 percent on Friday  for the second day to a combined gain of 1 67 percent  It outperformed among the major US indices both on Friday and over the course of the two day rally 
Still  it s showing the weakest technical picture  in a mirror image of the Dow  despite the ongoing trade war  The Russell is almost 6 percent below its uptrend line since the February 2016 bottom  as well as the 200 DMA  The 50 DMA just crossed below the 200 DMA  executing a death cross  an ominous sign that prices are heading in the wrong direction  a signal that s watched not just by technically oriented traders 
Finally  the supply demand equation has been forming a symmetrical triangle  bearish after the 16  decline since September  Its bearishness is confirmed by its formation below the long term uptrend line  compounded by developing below the 200 DMA  which just executed a Death Cross  no less 
The S P 500 Index climbed 0 22 percent for the second day  for a total 1 28 percent gain  The index surged Friday after President Trump appeared to signal a willingness to finally reach a trade deal with China  But those gains were tempered by flagging consumer and retail shares 
Department store chain Nordstrom  NYSE JWN  slumped on disappointing results  following earnings misses earlier in the week from Macy s  NYSE M  and Dillard s  NYSE DDS   Technology stocks wavered after chipmaker Nvidia  NASDAQ NVDA  released its less than stellar earnings report and forward guidance at the end of the day  further pressuring the Tech sector 
Utilities outperformed   1 54 percent   followed by Energy   1 19 percent   Technically  the SPX is below both its long term uptrend line and its 200 DMA  As well  the 50 DMA just crossed below its 100 DMA 
The only US index to finish the week in the red  the NASDAQ fell 0 15 percent  dragged lower by Nvidia which had its worst trading day in a decade  Nevertheless  it s still higher on a Thursday Friday basis than all indices but the Dow  up 1 56 percent  Technically  while it remains above its uptrend line since the bottom of the previous  January 2016 correction  it is also still above its 200 DMA  However  its 50 DMA just crossed below its 100 DMA  Finally  trade formed a symmetrical triangle  bearish after the October 1 29  14 6 percent plunge 
For all the negative headlines  adverse pundit opinions and softer guidance by company executives  current market stats present a different picture for mega caps  the Dow is still up 2 81 percent year to date  second only to the NASDAQ s 5 9 percent gains for the same period  however the Russell has underperformed during that timeframe  for a loss of 0 5 percent  Thus  while the debate over the longevity of the current bull market may resume as China s growth slows and the Fed continues raising interest rates  the trade war is empirically not one of the market s headwinds 

Some of the pressure on the dollar and bond yields followed remarks by Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Richard Clarida  who said on Friday that policy is getting close to neutral and there is some evidence of global slowing 
Last Monday  when the 10 year yield reached 3 186  we alerted of the potential for a double top reversal  Currently at 3 065  after having closed at the very lowest point of the session  the rate is about to provide a downside breakout  with a target of 2 87 percent 

While investor bets on volatility dropped on Thursday and Friday  overall they rose for the week  for the first time after two weeks during which the VIX fell  in a mirror image of equities  The index is still above levels seen during all of 2017 and April through October of 2018 

After its highest close in almost 17 months  the dollar s correction is taking back all of its gains  bringing the global reserve currency to the bottom of an ascending channel  which is above both the 50 and 100 DMAs  providing an attractive risk reward ratio for a short to mid term long position  However  should yields complete a double top  the lower return would attract fewer foreign investors  reducing demand for the greenback  in which case it could fall below the rising channel 

After 12 straight days of losses  oil s longest losing streak on record  the commodity bounced  gaining 2 percent over the last three days  Still  it closed well off its Friday high  demonstrating just how much pressure there is on the price 
It s noteworthy that the dollar has fallen in three of the previous four days  to the tune of 1 15 percent  making oil cheaper  Technically  the 50 DMA fell below the 100 DA and is set to cross below the 200 DMA for a Death Cross

24747,246262,DDS,Unemployment Falls To 18 Year Low  6 Winning Picks ,opinion,Nearly an hour before its release  President Trump tweeted that he was  looking forward  to May s jobs data  Ultimately  the report was able to live up to investors  expectations  heightened primarily by Trump s comments  The unemployment rate declined to the lowest level witnessed since April 2000  Job additions also increased substantially May s jobs report has successfully dispelled concerns about slowing jobs growth  Retail trade led job gains  followed by healthcare and construction  With job gains likely to continue in the months ahead  picking stocks from these sectors looks like a prudent option at this point Unemployment Lowest Since April 2000The unemployment rate declined from 3 9  in April to 3 8  in May  the lowest in 18 years  The U6 unemployment rate that includes people forced into part time work and people only sporadically looking for jobs declined to 7 6   the lowest level witnessed since May 2001 The decline in the unemployment rate was also attributable to a marginal fall in the labor participation rate  which declined from 62 8  to 62 7  However  economists now think that unemployment can decline further since 60 4  of the U S  population is still unemployed  Since this is still lower than pre recession levels  the slack in the labor market prevails Meanwhile  average hourly earnings increased by 0 3   or 8 cents to  28 92 an hour  Consequently  wages increased by 2 7  year over year in May  This is particularly significant since the metric remained unchanged at 2 6  for three consecutive months  The average workweek remained flat at 34 5 hours Retail Trade  Healthcare  Construction Lead GainsThe economy added 223 000 jobs in April  exceeding the consensus estimate of 190 000  This was the largest number of job additions in three months  Notably  monthly job additions have averaged 191 000 over the past one year  Job additions for March and April were revised upward by a combined 15 000 At the forefront of job gains were healthcare and construction  These sectors added 29 000 and 25 000 jobs  respectively  However  leading the pack was the retail trade sector which added 31 000 jobs  The sector has added 125 000 jobs in the past 12 months Our ChoicesThe decline in the unemployment rate indicates the extent to which the labor market has tightened  This is also probably why job additions have declined to a pace lower than what was witnessed earlier this year  However  most economists think job additions will continue and that the unemployment rate will decline further Retail trade  healthcare and construction have been the highest recruiters according to the May jobs report  Adding stocks from these sectors looks like a smart choice at this point  However  picking winning stocks may be difficult This is where our  comes in  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners  However  it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight

increased conversions at Kirkland s brick and mortar stores  which countered soft traffic  Management remains impressed with its first quarter performance and remains on track to solidify e commerce operations  The company intends to extend its vendor direct shopping  enrich assortments and improve mobile experience Robust Sales TrendNotably  Kirkland s sales have been improving year over year for ten straight quarters now  The company has been gaining from its efforts to enhance merchandise assortments  develop e commerce business and constant store additions  Prior to the first quarter  Kirkland s comps increased 2   0 7   1 2  during the fourth  third and second quarters of fiscal 2017  respectively  This indicates that the company s efforts to drive sales have been yielding and inflicting positive response from consumers toward its product assortments  Management remains committed toward making efforts to attract more customers   both online and in stores Focus on Store Expansions   E Commerce GrowthKirkland s is closing the smaller underperforming stores in the malls  It expects to open bigger off mall stores at popular locations  which are likely to boost sales  During the first quarter  Kirkland s introduced 10 stores  while shutting three  For fiscal 2018  management intends to open 10 15 new stores  Also  Kirkland s has been strongly focused on enhancing its e commerce business to resonate with the changing consumer trends  Incidentally  the company has redesigned and leveraged the rollout of new information systems to improve online purchase and planning execution  These efforts have been yielding significant results  as evident from the strong e commerce momentum witnessed  of late Increased Operating Costs Pose WorriesKirkland s has been incurring higher store occupancy costs for a while now  This was also witnessed in first quarter fiscal 2018  wherein store occupancy expenses rose 15 bps as a percentage of sales  Also  the company witnessed a 65 bps increase in outbound freight costs  including e commerce shipping  as a percentage of sales  thanks to greater e commerce penetration  The quarter also saw a rise in inbound freight costs and central distribution expenses  Moreover  Kirkland s gross margin has been declining for a while  essentially due to higher cost of sales The persistent of such factors is likely to dent the company s profitability and hurt performance in the forthcoming periods  Nevertheless  we expect Kirkland s constant sales endeavors and efficient inventory management to help the company offset these hurdles and attain greater heights Looking for More Promising Stocks  Check TheseDillard s   NYSE DDS    with a long term earnings growth rate of 9 9   carries a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can

24752,246267,DDS,5 Top Ranked Stocks From Sectors Unfazed By Rising Yields,opinion,Treasury yields have been on a tear in recent week with the 10 year yield almost touching the important 3  threshold  which caused jitters in the financial stock market in 2013  Notably  the 10 year Treasury yields hit its highest level in more than four years at  on Apr 23  pushing the gap or spread to German bonds to the widest in 29 years  Meanwhile  the two year yields rose to high of 2 483    the highest since September 2008 Worries about growing supply of government debt and inflationary pressures from the recent spike in commodity prices  especially oil and metals  triggered the rise  Per the latest CME s FedWatch tracking tool  the market is projecting 50  chances of a total of four interest rate hikes this year  This compares with 33  probability a month ago and less than 40  late last week A Reason to WorryHigher rates would attract more capital to the country  thereby boosting the U S  dollar against the basket of other currencies  This would leave a huge impact on commodity linked investments  implying that a rising rate environment will hurt a number of segments  Higher rates would result in tighter lending conditions and curtail consumer spending on a wide range of products like cars and houses  This will in turn dent profitability across various segments  Further  businesses will also face higher loan rates over time Winning SectorsA rising rate environment is highly beneficial to cyclical sectors like financial  consumer discretionary  technology and industrials In particular  banks are at the most advantageous position as they seek to borrow money at short term rates and lend at long term rates  If interest rates rise  banks would be able to earn more on lending and pay less on deposits  This would expand net margins and bolster banks  profits  Also  insurance companies are able to earn higher returns on their investment portfolio of longer duration bonds Higher interest rates usually indicate a healthy economy  which in turn leads to greater consumer power  An improving economy coupled with a surging stock market will continue to add wealth effect  resulting in higher consumer confidence  and making the consumer discretionary sector tempting to investors amid higher yields  The technology sector should benefit as rising interest rates usually correlate with an economy that is gaining strength and is expected to grow at a faster pace  leading to increased IT spending While there are several compelling options in these sectors

24848,246363,DDS,Avoid Chinese Trade War Concerns With These 3 Retail Stocks,opinion,"The U S  and China inched closer to a possible trade war after the Trump administration threatened to impose tariffs on  50 billion worth of Chinese imports on Tuesday night  The Chinese have since responded in kind  and investors are now seemingly more worried than ever about market wide repercussions  But fashion based retail is one area of the U S  economy that might be able to stay above the fray  
The Trump administration announced possible 25  tariffs across 1 300 categories and products  in a move that escalates recent tensions between the world s two largest economies  Notably left off Trump s latest  are  from shoes to clothing  This means that some U S  retailers could avoid a trade war induced downturn 
Clearly  most investors hope a compromise can be reached before competing Chinese and U S  tariffs are imposed  But it never hurts to prepare for the worst 
With that said  let s take a look at three shoe and clothing heavy retail stocks that might be able to come out of any possible trade war unscathed 
1       Dillard s   NYSE DDS  
This department store chain operates around 300 stores around the U S  and saw its comparable store sales climb by 3  last quarter  Dillard s revenue growth amid the shifting retail market is notable  but the company s ability to turn a profit going forward might excite investors even more 
Dillard s has seen its first quarter consensus earnings estimate climb by  0 48 in the last 60 days  based on upward earnings estimate revision activity  Our current Zacks Consensus Estimates are now calling for Dillard s earnings to surge by nearly 29  to reach  2 73 per share  This bottom line expansion is projected to continue for the rest of the year 
The retailer s fashion based business should also be able to keep running smoothly if a trade war were to break out  Lastly  Dillard s is currently a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and rocks an  A  grade for Value and a  B  for Growth in our Style Scores system 
2        Burlington Stores   NYSE BURL  
Burlington s growth has been notable at a time when e commerce has forced many brick and mortar retailers to close  The company posted strong comp sales growth last quarter and is projected to see its first quarter revenues climb by 10 7  to reach  1 49 billion 
Investors will also be happy to note that Burlington s bottom line is expected to expand by 48  in Q1 to reach  1 08 per share  Looking even further ahead  the department store is projected to see its EPS figure grow at an annualized rate of 18 7  over the next three to five years 
Burlington is currently a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  that has experienced a slew of Q1 and full year earnings estimate revisions  with almost complete agreement to the upside  over the last 60 days  Furthermore  Trump s new tariffs will try to avoid U S  shopper backlash  which is great news for this footwear and clothing focused off price retailer 
3        Macy s   NYSE M  
Macy s Forward P E of 8 2 compares favorably to its industry s 10 4 average and offers even better value than it did just a month ago due to the recent market wide selloff  This industry bellwether has also traded at a substantial discount to the  Retail   Regional Department Stores  average for more than a year  as it fights its way back through a series of digital sales innovations 
Looking ahead  Macy s Q1 earnings are projected to surge by 50  to hit  0 36 per share  while revenue is expected to climb at a more modest rate  Meanwhile  with a beta of 0 75  Macy s is theoretically 25  less volatile than the market average  which is great for investors in search of stability amid this recent bearish turn 
Macy s is currently a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  that has earned seven upward earnings estimate revisions for its full year  all within the last 60 days  The retail giant is also far less likely to suffer tariff related business setbacks as these proposed tariffs take on goods such as dishwashers and televisions

last two quarters were really good  but the two preceding those were pretty soft The most recent quarter saw EPS of  0 22 and that was  0 09 ahead of estimates for a positive earnings surprise of 69  The report before that was a 60  positive surprise  just off a much smaller basis  Before that  there was a 43  miss and an 11  miss before that  So the earnings history isn t the best  but it is far from the worst seeing as the last two beats were really strong EstimatesSo this is a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  yet I only see 1 revision higher for this year and next year over the last 60 days  That could also speak to the lack of coverage on this name  In any event  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 has moved from  0 87 90 days ago to  1 11 60 days ago and then to  1 59 which is where it stands right now  Those are some big moves and thanks in part to the good earnings release ValuationI see VIRT trading at 21x forward earnings and this multiple is hard to compare to financials  That is because most of VIRT is based on the idea of it being a tech company  The revenue growth of 70  from the previous quarter and 169  from the year ago period tell me that this HFT can handle the volatility that has come about in a big way The price to book is over 5x and price to sales is over 6x  both measures are high anyway you look at them  I think this stock runs  as volatility is here to stay for the time being  Trump can be both good and bad for stocks  and that recipe makes VIRT a must own  Empire State Realty Trust is a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  and sports an  F  for both its Value and Growth Style Scores   Today  ESRT is the Bear Of The Day  so let s take a look at why that is the case DescriptionEmpire State Realty Trust  is a real estate investment trust  REIT   owns  manages  operates  acquires and repositions office and retail properties in Manhattan and the greater New York metropolitan area  including the Empire State Building  the world s most famous building  Headquartered in New York  New York  the Company s office and retail portfolio covers 10 1 million rentable square feet  as of December 31  2017  consisting of 9 4 million rentable square feet in 14 office properties  including nine in Manhattan  three in Fairfield County  Connecticut  and two in Westchester County  New York  and approximately 700 000 rentable square feet in the retail portfolio Earnings HistoryWhenever I see a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  I look at the earnings history for a clue as to why it holds the lowest Zacks Rank  In the case of ESRT  I see a recent meet  a miss and two beats That is not the worst earnings history I have ever seen and hardly enough of a reason for the stock to be the Bear of the Day Estimate RevisionsThe core of the Zacks Rank is driven by estimate revisions   ESRT has revisions of late and most are negative   I see the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 moving from  1 02 to  0 93 over the last 90 days   Similarly  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 has moved from  1 06 to  0 95 That downward pressure has caused the Rank to slide in an environment when most stocks are seeing earnings estimate rise At the same time  I see things to like here for ESRT   Revenue for the 2018 year is expected to be  487 7M and that number grows to  500 3M next year  Say what you will  but I am all about revenue growth   Additional content Avoid Chinese Trade War Concerns with These 3 Retail StocksThe U S  and China inched closer to a possible trade war after the Trump administration threatened to impose tariffs on  50 billion worth of Chinese imports on Tuesday night  The Chinese have since responded in kind  and investors are now seemingly more worried than ever about market wide repercussions  But fashion based retail is one area of the U S  economy that might be able to stay above the fray  The Trump administration announced possible 25  tariffs across 1 300 categories and products  in a move that escalates recent tensions between the world s two largest economies  Notably left off Trump s latest  are  from shoes to clothing  This means that some U S  retailers could avoid a trade war induced downturn Clearly  most investors hope a compromise can be reached before competing Chinese and U S  tariffs are imposed  But it never hurts to prepare for the worst With that said  let s take a look at three shoe and clothing heavy retail stocks that might be able to come out of any possible trade war unscathed 1       Dillard sThis department store chain operates around 300 stores around the U S  and saw its comparable store sales climb by 3  last quarter  Dillard s revenue growth amid the shifting retail market is notable  but the company s ability to turn a profit going forward might excite investors even more Dillard s has seen its first quarter consensus earnings estimate climb by  0 48 in the last 60 days  based on upward earnings estimate revision activity  Our current Zacks Consensus Estimates are now calling for Dillard s earnings to surge by nearly 29  to reach  2 73 per share  This bottom line expansion is projected to continue for the rest of the year The retailer s fashion based business should also be able to keep running smoothly if a trade war were to break out  Lastly  Dillard s is currently a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and rocks an  A  grade for Value and a  B  for Growth in our Style Scores system 2        Burlington StoresBurlington s growth has been notable at a time when e commerce has forced many brick and mortar retailers to close  The company posted strong comp sales growth last quarter and is projected to see its first quarter revenues climb by 10 7  to reach  1 49 billion Investors will also be happy to note that Burlington s bottom line is expected to expand by 48  in Q1 to reach  1 08 per share  Looking even further ahead  the department store is projected to see its EPS figure grow at an annualized rate of 18 7  over the next three to five years Burlington is currently a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  that has experienced a slew of Q1 and full year earnings estimate revisions  with almost complete agreement to the upside  over the last 60 days  Furthermore  Trump s new tariffs will try to avoid U S  shopper backlash  which is great news for this footwear and clothing focused off price retailer 3        Macy sMacy s Forward P E of 8 2 compares favorably to its industry s 10 4 average and offers even better value than it did just a month ago due to the recent market wide selloff  This industry bellwether has also traded at a substantial discount to the  Retail   Regional Department Stores  average for more than a year  as it fights its way back through a series of digital sales innovations Looking ahead  Macy s Q1 earnings are projected to surge by 50  to hit  0 36 per share  while revenue is expected to climb at a more modest rate  Meanwhile  with a beta of 0 75  Macy s is theoretically 25  less volatile than the market average  which is great for investors in search of stability amid this recent bearish turn Macy s is currently a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  that has earned seven upward earnings estimate revisions for its full year  all within the last 60 days  The retail giant is also far less likely to suffer tariff related business setbacks as these proposed tariffs take on goods such as dishwashers and televisions Wall Street s Next Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all

24852,246367,DDS,Burlington Stores  BURL  Hits A 52 Week High  Can The Run Continue ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Burlington Stores   NYSE BURL    Shares have been on the move with the stock up 9 7  over the past month  BURL hit a new 52 week high of  140 15 in the previous session  Burlington Stores has gained 12 2  since the start of the year compared to the 4 4  move for the Retail Wholesale sector and the 5 2  year to date return for its peer group 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises  having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on March 8  2018  Burlington Stores reported EPS of  2 17 versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 09 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 2 92  
For the current fiscal year  Burlington Stores is expected to post earnings of  5 76 per share on  6 6 billion in revenues  This represents a 31 81  change in EPS on an 8 5  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  6 74 per share on  7 16 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 16 93  and 8 42   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Burlington Stores may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for BURL  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Burlington Stores has a Value Score of C  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are A and D  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of A 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 23 9X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 18 6X versus its peer group s average of 15 99X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 1 30  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective Burlington Stores  Inc  Price and Consensus   Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Burlington Stores currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2 and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Burlington Stores passes the test  Thus  it seems as though BURL shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term 
How Does Burlington Stores Stack Up to the Competition 
Shares of Burlington Stores have been moving higher  and the company still appears to be a decent choice  but what about the rest of the industry  Some of its industry peers are also impressive  including Dollar General Corporation   NYSE DG    Dillard s   NYSE DDS    and ASOS  LON ASOS  PLS ADR   OTC ASOMY    all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least  2 and a VGM Score of at least B  making them well rounded choices 
The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 38  of all the industries we have in our universe  so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for BURL  even beyond its own solid fundamental situation ",2018-04-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/burlington-stores-burl-hits-a-52week-high-can-the-run-continue-200306518,200306518
24862,246377,DDS,5 Top Ranked Stocks That Ruled The Markets In Q1,opinion,"Markets endured a particularly volatile start to the year  ultimately losing significantly in the first quarter  Key indexes touched record levels in January before encountering a correction in February  These losses were caused by a jump in wages which triggered fears of higher inflation and faster rate increases After a short recovery toward the end of February  markets encountered further losses in March  Fears of an impending trade war between the United States and China weighed on investor sentiment  Tech stock related losses also acted as a drag on broader markets Most Volatile Quarter Since 2011During the first quarter  the Dow and the S P 500 declined 2 3  and 1 2   respectively  The period also brought to a close a nine quarter long stretch of gains for both these benchmarks  These were the first quarterly losses for the S P 500 since 2015  But despite tech induced losses in February and March  the Nasdaq closed the quarter 2 3  higher   Additionally  it was the most volatile quarter in recent memory  Last year  markets experienced the lowest levels of volatility in decades  hitting an all time low in November  2017  But over the recently concluded first quarter  the market s fear gauge  the VIX increased a staggering 81   This is the highest advance recorded since the third quarter of 2011 Blistering Gains in January  Correction in FebruaryFor the month of January  the Dow  the S P 500 and the Nasdaq increased 5 8   5 6  and 7 4   respectively  The passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 contributed heavily to January s gains Moreover  during the month  the Senate gave its consent to pass a short term spending Bill that ends the recent government shutdown  Additionally  upbeat fourth quarter earnings season also contributed to strong market performance   Read   However  an unexpected correction hit stocks in February  For the month  the Dow  the S P 500 and the Nasdaq decreased 4 3   3 9  and 1 9   respectively  Markets suffered huge losses during the month following concerns over the decline in attractiveness of equities compared to bonds  In February  all the key indexes declined more than 10  from the all time highs achieved on Jan 26  to enter correction territory Strong Economic OutlookEconomic data released over the quarter remained largely encouraging  Over the fourth quarter  U S  GDP advanced at a 2 9  annual rate of growth  The figure exceeded the second estimate of 2 5   marked a marginal decline from the 3 2  pace recorded in the third quarter Personal consumption increased by 0 2  during both January and February  However  inflation cooled slightly in February  with PCE inflation increasing 0 2  after advancing 0 3  in January  However  core PCE inflation experienced a yearly advance of 1 6   the highest increase since February 2017 On the jobs front  average hourly earnings surged 0 3  in January  boosting the yearly average to 2 9    the highest since June 2009  Monthly wage gains moderated to 0 1  in February but the unemployment rate remained unchanged at a 17 year low of 4 1   Further  for the week ended Mar 24  jobless claims plunged to a 45 year low Yield Spike  Inflationary Concerns Worry InvestorsOn Feb 8  U S  markets officially entered correction territory  During the second week of February  the 10 year Treasury yield moved above 2 85  twice  Both these instances were followed by widespread losses for stocks  Meanwhile  average year on year hourly earnings for January increased to 2 9   the highest since June 2009 The record increase in wages led to concerns that retail prices would increase  Such fears  taken together with soaring yields  led to speculation that the pace of rate hikes would likely quicken over the year   Read   Ultimately on Mar 21  the Federal Reserve increased the federal funds rate by 0 25 percentage point following its first meeting under new Fed Chair Jerome Powell  At the same time  the Fed reiterated that it intends to raise rates only three times this year  sticking to a gradual path of increases   Read   Trump Triggers a Trade WarOn Mar 1  President Donald Trump said in a meeting with executives of steel and aluminum companies at the White House  said he would levy a 25  tariff on steel imports and 10  tariff on aluminum imports  The tariff announcement stoked fears of an international trade war and sparked a selloff  Ultimately  on Mar 8  Trump signed off on these tariffs but exempted key trading partners Canada and Mexico But the drama on the trade front was far from over  On Mar 22  Trump finally set in motion tariffs on as much as up to  60 billion in Chinese imports  Consequently  China announced plans for reciprocal tariffs on  3 billion of imports from the United States  giving rise to fears of an ensuing trade war Overall  China has said that it will impose tariffs on 128 U S  products  including fruit and pork  Meanwhile  Trump is slated to reveal details of his tariffs on Chinese goods later this week  The focus is expected to be primarily on  high technology  products  Naturally  markets have not taken kindly to these developments and have sustained severe losses on more than one occasion Tech Stocks Continue to Plunge While investors had hoped that tech stocks would firm up after February s correction  the sector incurred heavy losses in the closing weeks of March  During the fourth week of last month  shares of Facebook Inc    NASDAQ FB   took a massive hit in the wake of a data misuse scandal The carnage for tech stocks continued during the last week of the month Even as Facebook continued to plunge  shares of Nvidia Corporation   NASDAQ NVDA   and Tesla  Inc    NASDAQ TSLA   were plagued by incidents and investigations related to the self driving arena  Though tech stocks managed to recover somewhat during the last trading day of the quarter  the Technology Select Sector SPDR  XLK  still ended March 4  lower

the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Dillard s has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 18 4  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 8  If we focus on the long term PE trend  the current PE level of Dillard s puts it above its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months However the stock s PE compares unfavorably with the  s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 7 8  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively overvalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Dillard s has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 15 1  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Dillard s stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Dillard s has a P S ratio of about 0 4  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 3x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  DDS is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Dillard s currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Dillard s a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Dillard s might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of A and a Momentum Score of A  This gives DDS a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been pretty encouraging  The current quarter has seen one estimate to go higher in the past sixty days compared to none lower  while the full year estimate has seen three up and no down in the same time period This has had a significant impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 35  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has gone up by 67   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Dillard s  Inc  Price and Consensus   This bullish trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and why we are looking for better performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineDillard s is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  a strong industry rank  Top 1  out of more than 250 industries  further strengthens its growth potential  In fact  over the past one year  the industry has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company s prospects  as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pick The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of AllLast year  it generated  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  47 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce  the world s first

24879,246394,DDS,Buy These 3 Consumer Stocks Amid Chinese Trade War Concerns  ,opinion,"Stocks experienced substantial declines on Thursday  spurred by concerns surrounding possible tariff related retaliation from China against U S  giants such as Boeing   NYSE BA    while Facebook   NASDAQ FB   sunk further on data breach woes 
Speculation about a possible trade war between the U S  and China might have turned into a legitimate concern after President Donald Trump announced a new set of tariffs on up to  50 billion of Chinese imports on Thursday 
With that said  some industries don t seem like they will be negatively impacted by Trump s Chinese sanctions  One particular sector that seems like it could avoid retaliation is U S  consumer discretionary spending 
So now let s take a look at three companies that are currently Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  stocks that look poised to fly under the radar of any possible counter tariff measures China might deploy  
1       Macy s   NYSE M  
This retailer is coming off a strong fourth quarter that saw investor faith renewed  Looking ahead  Macy s is projected to expand its earnings by 50  in the first quarter to reach  0 36 per share  based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates The retailer s Q1 earnings estimates have also been trending upward in a big way recently  with our consensus mark jumping from  0 23 to  0 36 within the last seven days 
Macy s also looks like a strong value play at the moment  The company is trading with a P E of 7 9  which is far below the  Retail   Regional Department Stores  industry s average P E of 13  Macy s is also trading at a substantial discount compared to where it was at earlier this month  as well as competitor Dillard s   NYSE DDS   P E of 13 9 
Investors should be happy to get similar exposure to the retail sector at a much more attractive earnings multiple for a bellwether firm  nonetheless The retailer is also far less exposed to a possible trade war  as China is reportedly much more likely to go after Trump s manufacturing base than attack an upscale retailer 
2        Weight Watchers   NYSE WTW  
Weight Watchers recently announced a new line of retail kitchenware and meal prep kit offerings as part of a larger goal to expand beyond its membership based weight loss program  Coupled with Oprah Winfrey s presence  the company seems ready to soar to new heights 
Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2018  Weight Watchers  sales are projected to climb 14  to hit  375 05 million  For the full year  revenues are expected to reach  1 55 billion  which would mark a nearly 19  climb  At the same time  WTW s earnings are projected to surge over 29  to hit  2 13 per share this year 
And it is hard to imagine exactly how much heat  if any  Weight Watchers would feel during a possible Chinese trade war 
3        Sony   NYSE SNE  
This Japanese entertainment and electronics powerhouse is highly diversified  from its movie studio and consumer electronics staples to its recent foray into virtual reality  Maybe more importantly  Japan is a major U S  ally that could be effectively propped up amid a trade war with China    
Sony is expected to see its current full year revenues surge 11 5  to reach  78 12 billion  and the company s bottom line expansion projection is even more impressive for a company its size  Sony s earnings are expected to skyrocket 656 9  to hit  3 86 per share  Sony also currently offers a great deal of value for a company that is poised to grow at such a substantial clip 
Sony is currently trading at 12 6x forward earnings  which marks a major discount compared to it industry s average P E of 19 9  as well as peers such as Panasonic   OTC PCRFY

24881,246396,DDS,Why Macy s  M  Stock Looks Like A Buy,opinion,"Shares of Macy s   NYSE M   popped over 1 5  on Thursday to inch closer to their 52 week high as investors begin to assess the possibility of a brighter future for the much maligned retailer 
Some of the most recent Macy s positivity might be attributed to President Donald Trump s renewed public attack on Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN    based on what he views as unfair tax treatment toward the e commerce powerhouse 
The validity of these concerns aside  Macy s has to do far more than bank on any Amazon downturn  Luckily for investors  the department store has indeed made improvements to its business that might warrant investor consideration 
Macy s announced last week that it is set to debut app based mobile checkout at locations around the country  designed to decrease wait times  The company is also expected to roll out a new augmented reality furniture shopping feature that will be accessible through the Macy s app as early as April 
These moves are part of a bigger digital push that includes offerings such as Amazon like locker pickups for online sales  which have led to real results 
The fourth quarter marked the 34th straight quarter in which Macy s posted double digit growth in its digital business  Meanwhile  the company s overall Q4 revenues climbed by 1 8  to reach  8 67 billion  with comps up 1 4   Macy s adjusted earnings surged nearly 40  from the year ago period and also beat our Zacks Consensus Estimate 
Recent Price Performance
Shares of Macy s have dipped slightly since the company reported its Q4 earnings results last month  However  this shouldn t detract from the bigger picture  as Macy s stock has soared over the last six months  outpacing its industry s average 
Valuation
Investors should also note that  despite Macy s recent price performance strength  the company has consistently traded at a substantial discount to its industry s average  Macy s Forward P E of roughly 8 2 also marks a discount to direct rivals Dillard s   NYSE DDS   and Kohl s   NYSE KSS    which are currently trading at roughly 13x forward earnings 
Outlook
Macy s has earned seven earnings estimate revisions  with 100  agreement to the upside  all within the last 60 days  This has raised the retailer s full year earnings estimate from  2 80 per share to  3 63 per share 
Our latest Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for Macy s first quarter earnings to soar by 50  to hit  0 36 per share  The retailer s Q1 revenues are projected to reach  5 42 billion  which would mark a more modest 1 5  climb 
Bottom Line
Macy s has been able to fight through some rough times and has seen its shares surge accordingly  The retailer has also committed to improving its e commerce business and deployed some app based innovations aimed at sparking continued growth 
Furthermore  the department store bellwether is trading at a discount to some of its biggest competitors and is trading at an even more attractive valuation than it was just a month ago  
Coupled with the fact that Macy s stock is currently a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and sports an  A  grade for both Value and Growth in our Styles Scores system  now might be an intriguing time to buy

analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 12 major stocks  including Gilead  BNY Mellon and State Street  These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today You can see Gilead s shares have outperformed the Zacks Biotech industry in the last six months  increasing  6 1  vs  a decline of  4 6   Gilead topped both earnings and revenue estimates in the fourth quarter The HIV franchise maintains momentum driven by the rapid adoption of TAF based regimens in the United States and EU  The TAF based regimens now represent 62  of total HIV prescription volume following the launch of Genvoya  Odefsey and Descovy in 2016 The Zacks analyst thinks that the approval of Gilead s latest triple HIV therapy is likely to provide an impetus to the stock as Gilead is now banking on its HIV franchise and newer avenues like the CAR T therapy  However  the HCV franchise is under tremendous pressure due to lower patient starts and increasing competition Both pricing and market share are expected to stabilize by mid 2018 while patient starts are expected to decline further  The company s guidance for 2018 also lacks luster  You can   Shares of BNY Mellon have underperformed the Zacks Major Regional Banks industry in the last six months   11 3  vs   21 6    The company s earnings surpassed expectations in only two of the trailing four quarters  Concentration risk arising from significant dependence on fee based income remains a matter of concern for the company If there are any changes in individual investment preferences  regulatory amendments or a slowdown in capital market activities  it could hurt the company s financials  However  The Zacks analyst thinks easing margin pressure  driven by gradual higher interest rates  and rising loan demand will drive revenue growth  Also  potential lesser regulations  lower tax rates and cost saving initiatives are likely to drive profitability  You can   State Street s shares have underperformed the Zacks Major Regional Banks industry in the last six months   16 5  vs   21 6    The company has an impressive earnings surprise history  having surpassed expectations in each of the trailing four quarters The Zacks analyst likes its new business wins  synergies from GE Asset Management deal and rising interest rates  all of which are likely to continue supporting profitability  Further  the company s cost saving efforts through multi year restructuring plan is expected to a success However  continuous decline in trading services revenues is a concern  Also  mounting expenses remain a major near term concern for the company  You can   Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Alliant Energy and Dillard s Wall Street s Next

24993,246508,DDS,Healthcare  Vertex To Drive 3D Systems  DDD  Q4 Earnings ,opinion,"3D Systems Corporation   NYSE DDD   is scheduled to report fourth quarter and full year 2017 results on Feb 28  after the closing bell 
The company has a dismal earnings surprise history  with earnings missing estimates by a huge margin in three of the trailing four quarters  This resulted in an average negative surprise of 83 8   Last quarter  the company s earnings missed estimates by 281 8  
Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement 
Factors to Consider
3D Systems is poised to grow on the back of its strong healthcare business  which has proved to be a profit churner in the past quarters  The company is enjoying steady demand for its healthcare solutions and industrial offerings as well as strength in the EMEA region  However  the demand remains constrained in the Americas and the Asia Pacific region  which can hurt revenues in the upcoming quarterly results 
Nevertheless  the company continues to witness steady performance of its Software business  We expect the segment to be one of the positive growth drivers in the upcoming results 
The company s focus on strengthening foothold on 3D printing industry foothold is expected to present a favorable long term opportunity  As a matter of fact  majority of 3D Systems customers are shifting from prototyping to end use production using 3D printing technology  and the company believes it is well positioned to aid customers in their transition  This apart  demand for production printers  materials and software is expected to act as a major catalyst and support growth 
3D Systems Corporation Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
   Moreover  the company has been making acquisitions to diversify offerings  add synergistic technology and expand domain expertise in operating markets  In January 2017  it announced the acquisition of dental materials provider  Vertex Global Holding B V   which operates under the Vertex and NextDent brands 
Concurrent with third quarter 2017 results  the company announced that it has conducted a deep and extensive review of inventory based on year to date demand  customer data and market trends  Consequently  the company recorded a significant adjustment to inventory  It implemented organizational changes to improve execution as well as increased investments as it shifts to a worldwide go to market structure 
In light of such major transformational initiatives  the company decided that it is not able to predict earnings and sales numbers accurately  and has thus decided to withdraw guidance 
Further  3D Systems successfully improved cost structure and optimized supply chain through concerted restructuring efforts  We believe that such diligent restructuring efforts are likely to boost fourth quarter financials 
However  the fact remains that the company s financial performances have been hit by unfavorable broader market conditions  Particularly  revenues from 3D printing products and services were significantly undermined due to a widespread decline in industry demand  Other headwinds  including economic slowdown  inflation  currency fluctuations and commodity prices vagaries have also affected performance  These factors are expected to dent revenues in the upcoming quarter as well 
In addition  the company s high operating and acquisition costs have hurt its near term operating income performance  Further  the company also believes that investment in IT and go to market initiatives will result in higher expenses  consequently restricting near term operating income growth 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not show that 3D Systems is likely to beat estimates in this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or at least 3  Hold  for this to happen  This is not the case here as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  The company s Earnings ESP is  115 39   as the Most Accurate Estimate is 4 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 2 cents  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our 
Zacks Rank  3D Systems has a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Strong Sell  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
Stocks That Warrant a Look
Here are some companies that you may want to consider  as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter 
Etsy  Inc    NASDAQ ETSY   has an Earnings ESP of  31 34  and a Zacks Rank of 3  The company is expected to release quarterly numbers around Feb 27  You can see  
Inogen  Inc    NASDAQ INGN    with an Earnings ESP of  25 30  and a Zacks Rank of 2  is slated to report results on Feb 27 
Dillard s  Inc    NYSE DDS   has an Earnings ESP of  15 83  and a Zacks Rank of 1  The company is likely to release earnings on Feb 27 
Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars 
Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge 
With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply  one company stands out as the  1 stock to buy according to Zacks research 
It s not the one you think ",2018-02-26,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/healthcare-vertex-to-drive-3d-systems-ddd-q4-earnings-200294407,200294407
24994,246509,DDS,After Macy s And Dillard s Beat  Will Nordstrom Extend Retail Earnings Streak ,opinion,"Shares of several major department store retailers gained on Tuesday morning following positive earnings from Macy s   NYSE M   and Dillard s   NYSE DDS    With several more players in the industry set to report this week  the focus will now shift to the likes of Nordstrom   NYSE JWN   to continue the trend of strong results 
Macy s shares climbed more than 11  in early trading following the release of its latest report  The industry bellwether posted adjusted earnings of  2 82 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 69 
The company saw revenue figures of  8 67 billion  missing our consensus estimate of  8 72 billion but improving 1 8  from the year ago period  Same store sales increased 1 3  during the holiday quarter  also read    
Macy s expects fiscal 2018 earnings to fall in the range of  3 55 to  3 75 per share well ahead of our current Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 89  Management also said that it expects comps to be flat to up 1  on the year 
Meanwhile  department store chain Dillard s also topped earnings expectations  The company reported adjusted profits of  2 82 per share  crushing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 82 and soaring more than 50  on a year over year basis  Dillard s shares popped more than 15  in the wake of the report 
Upbeat results from Macy s and Dillard s helped lift fellow retailers  including Kohl s   NYSE KSS   and JCPenney   NYSE JCP   on Tuesday morning  The SPDR S P Retail  MX XRT  ETF  was up nearly 1  in early trading hours 
But now the attention will turn to those yet to report this week  including Macy s rival Nordstrom  The Nordstrom family is expected to finalize a go private deal soon  and that premium is likely factored into the stock already  However  the company s results will still be a great indicator of the health of the retail industry right now  so investors will want to pay close attention 
So what does Nordstrom have in store  Let s take a closer look 
Latest Outlook
Based on our latest consensus estimates  we expect Nordstrom to report adjusted earnings of  1 24 per share and total revenues of  4 61 billion  This bottom line result would represent a year over year slump of 9 5   but the company s top line is expected to improve by more than 6 8  
Nordstrom already posted its November and December sales figures  reporting revenue growth of 2 5  and comps growth of 1 2  for that period 
Earnings ESP
Investors will also want to anticipate the likelihood that Nordstrom surprises investors with better than anticipated earnings results  For this  we turn to our Earnings ESP figure 
Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst estimates  This is done because  generally speaking  when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release  it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago 
A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat  In fact  our 10 year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70  of the time 
Just a few days before its report  JWN is sporting a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and an Earnings ESP of  0 72  This is because the company s Most Accurate Estimate for earnings sits at  1 23 per share  meaning that the most recent analyst estimates have been lower than the consensus 
Despite the stock s strong Zacks Rank  our model does not conclusively indicate that we are in store for a beat

Source  Bloomberg com
Two closely watched parts of the report will indicate if the increasing interest rate trend will begin show any signs of having a negative impact on the index   And if the uptick in mortgage rates is impacting housing affordability 
This report coupled with Friday s Housing Starts data will be an important barometer for the housing sector and several other sub sectors that rely on new housing 
Housing starts took a bit of a dip last month due to weather related issues as you can see in the chart below 

Source  Bloomberg com
But this month s data should be clean of weather related issues  and is currently expected to show a snap back to 1 23 million units  well above December s reading of 1 1 million units   Also  housing permits are expected to remain high at 1 3 million  
A combination of an uptick in both the housing market index  and housing starts will be beneficial for home builders like KB Homes   NYSE KBH    Lennar Corp   NYSE LEN    and D R  Horton   NYSE DHI    all of which currently carry a Zacks Rank  2 Buy rating 
The data will also be a forward indicator for companies that depend on new homes who supply them with furniture  appliances  and other household needs  Companies that can benefit from positive housing data include  Restoration Hardware   NYSE RH    At Home Group   NYSE HOME    Beacon Roofing   NASDAQ BECN    and Eloctorlux   all of which currently carry a Zacks Rank  1 Strong Buy rating  
If these data points come in as expected  it will set an overall positive tone for the markets for the next several weeks

processor It should be noted that eBay accounts for 13  of PayPal s total payment volume  TPV   thereby contributing a major portion to its total revenues  Therefore  if this volume tanks by nearly 50

25102,246617,DDS,Another Sharp Panic Paves The Way For Fresh SPX Buying ,opinion,"AT40   60 6  of stocks are trading above their respective 40 day moving averages  DMAs AT200   59 6  of stocks are trading above their respective 200DMAsVIX   11 4Short term Trading Call  cautiously bullish
Commentary I call it a mini panic dip 
Political news roiled the stock market for a brief moment  a grand 30 minutes in total  it sure seems like these dips get shorter and shorter in duration    The market was buffeted by the cross currents of President Trump s potentially deepening legal troubles    and the promise of tax reform winning the day in Congress  In the end  the buyers won as has been the case for a very long time  The S P 500  SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   ended the day with a tiny fractional loss of 0 2  

The S P 500  SPY  swooned for about 30 minutes  This 5 minute chart shows the sharpness and brevity of the selling 

By the close  the S P 500  SPY  erased almost all its losses and finished on TOP of its upper Bollinger  Band  BB  
The volatility index  the VIX  suffered one of its worst one day fades in a long time  The temporary angst drove the VIX as high as 14 58 and a 29  gain  The VIX ended the day with a paltry 1 3  gain  Per the trading plan I outlined in   I sold my latest tranche of call options on the ProShares Ultra VIX Short Term Futures  NYSE UVXY   The trade was good for a little over a double  I am not sure yet what conditions will motivate me to pull the trigger yet again 

The volatility index  the VIX  is on an upswing but Friday s massive fade may have deflated the momentum 
I read an interesting piece in Business Insider about a  mystery trader  who keeps rolling  on a spike in volatility  Apparently  the big bet started as a bet on a volatility spike   September and October were of course uncharacteristically calm and August absorbed all the big volatility hits instead  Apparently  the August move was not enough  and the trader rolled the position to a bet on a volatility spike by December  Now  the bet targets January  Business Insider relied on Bloomberg for this information 
I am intrigued by the configuration of the bet  The trader sold around 260 000 VIX January  12 puts to fund the purchase of a VIX January  15 25 call spread  The call spread has a ratio of 1 2 with 260 000  15s and 520 000  25s  This is a very intricate bet because the trader cannot afford to see volatility spike  too much  by the time s he closes out the position  However  since the VIX last soared over 25 in June  2016 with the Brexit vote  history is on the side of this trader  YET  if volatility remains in this period of extremely low volatility  the trader may have to accept a substantial loss unless the position gets rolled again in time to avoid a major loss 
I do not think this is a case where a trader thinks s he knows something the rest of us do not understand  This trade looks like a structured approach for betting on the timing for the end of this historically extended period of extremely low volatility 
AT40  T2108   the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 40 day moving averages  DMAs   took a deep dive and confirmed that the selling in the market was broad based  My favorite technical indicator fell all the way from 60 5  to 50 0   AT40 ended the day at 60 6   Along with the S P 500  AT40 looks ready to resume the previous momentum 
STOCK CHART REVIEWS
Bed Bath   Beyond Inc   NASDAQ BBBY  The hunt is on for 2018 bargains  and one investor gave BBBY a good look  I was intrigued by the potential because sellers have truly beaten the stuffing out of BBBY  The owner of Cost Plus World Market  Christmas Tree Shops  buybuy BABY  Linen Holdings  Chef Centra  and of course Bed Bath   Beyond has a paltry 0 3 price sales ratio  5 7 trailing P E  and a 8 2 forward P E  At its lows last month  BBBY traded within a hair of its March  2009 low  BBBY is a stock that is one positive catalyst away from a massive run up  Last week s rotation into retail lifted the stock into a 50DMA breakout  This breakout is BBBY s fourth of the year  so the stock still has plenty to prove  A close at a new post earnings high would provide a good start 

Bed Bath   Beyond Inc   BBBY  is trying again to hold onto a 50DMA breakout in the middle of a year that at one shaved 50  off the company s value 

This is an increasingly rare sight in this bull market  Bed Bath   Beyond  BBBY  almost retested its March  2009 low  Note the double top and the confirming breakdown that made BBBY one juicy short candidate 
Ulta Beauty  NASDAQ ULTA  ULTA failed the earnings test  but its bottom remains well intact  Even more importantly  after a lot of churn  the stock closed above its 50DMA support  ULTA reaffirmed its guidance for 2017  but apparently investors were displeased with lower margins  If ULTA breaks its post earnings low  I will assume sellers are once again taking over 

Ulta Beauty  ULTA  gapped down post earnings but ended up holding firm at its uptrending 20DMA and 50DMA support 
U S  Steel  NYSE X  U S  Steel continues to melt higher  Analysts tried to take the stock down but failed  Earnings generated a gap up  The reversal of post earnings gains quickly transitioned into a a fresh 200DMA breakout  The 50DMA held as support  All thees features add up to an on going bullish story for X on this post collapse recovery  A fill of the April gap down is right around the corner 

The process has taken months  but U S  Steel  X  is following its 50DMA to a fill of the April gap down 
Kroger  NYSE KR  Speaking of recoveries  Kroger s earnings all but put the Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  panic to bed with a tremendous earnings performance last week  I promptly sold my call options into the buying frenzy  I covered my short put option a few weeks ago as it fell near worthless 

Kroger  KR  gapped up 12 1  post earnings but closed just above its 200DMA  That support held a second day 
Nordstrom  NYSE JWN  Some key retailers are delivering a solid recovery action ahead of next year  Nordstrom was hit in October when the company ended its efforts to privatize  I used that sell off as another buying opportunity  A post earnings bounce appeared to confirm a bottom  Last week s  into retail stocks gave me my opportunity to complete another profitable trade on JWN 

Nordstrom  JWN  has bounced right back  again  toward the value the market assigned on privatization news 
Dillard s  NYSE DDS  Dillard s is a VERY intriguing retail play    yes  SIXTY  of float  Ahead of earnings  I decided to speculate on the bearish side ahead of earnings with a put spread  DDS inadvertently released earnings before the market closed  and the stock promptly rallied  DDS benefited from last week s rotation into retail but its pullback the last two days was surprisingly steep  Sellers returned in heavy volume and managed to completely reverse Wednesday s gain  I am now looking to see whether 50 or 200DMA support can hold  DDS will return to bearish territory if it breaks November s low  The shorts will be under increasing pressure if support holds 

Dillard s  DDS  finally got a positive jump out of earnings  Can the 200DMA breakout hold 
Restaurant Brands International Inc   NYSE QSR  QSR is the company that made a chicken trade earlier this year by buying Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen  PLKI   The stock s rally took an ever so brief pause after that news  Last week  the stock took a surprising downturn as it broke below its 50DMA and made a new post earnings low   Something  is not right here  especially given the post earnings upgrade from Citigroup  NYSE C   So I am back to watching QSR closely 

Restaurant Brands International Inc   QSR  continued its breakdown since a bearish engulfing post earnings sell off 
Twilio  NYSE TWLO  Speaking of  something  not being right  TWLO broke down last month going into earnings  It proceeded to sell off again the day following earnings  While the stock has managed to consolidate since then  the performance was very disappointing given the CEO expressed enough confidence in the company to load up on more stock near or at the all time low in May  I took some of the profits from my last TWLO trade to buy calls after the post earnings selling in August  I figured the CEO s confidence would translate into a relatively quick recovery  The stock never did fully recover  I am content now just to see how much salvage value I can get on my current position  Otherwise  I am watching to see whether the stock retests its all time low 

After a promising bounce from all time lows  Twilio  TWLO  looks like it could retest those lows in due time

25135,246650,DDS,Sonus Networks  Dillard s And Las Vegas Sands Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day ,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   Oct 26  2017    highlights Sonus Networks   NASDAQ SONS   as the Bull of the Day and Dillard s   NYSE DDS   as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis ontheLas Vegas Sands Corp    NYSE LVS   Here is a synopsis of all three stocks  Tech is one of those sectors of the market that s just always going to be leading the way  Almost by definition tech stocks are going to be growthy and expanding into new markets  That s exactly the sort of thing you should be looking for when figuring out where to invest your hard earned money for the long term  Today s Bull of the Day is a company that s trying to expand the voice and data network globally Sonus Networks provides networked solutions worldwide  The company offers Session Border Controllers  SBCs  that address security and interworking requirements for small  medium  and large businesses  as well as regional and global communications service providers  Sonus GSX9000 Open Services Switch  which bridges IP and TDM networks by converting voice signal into Internet Protocol  IP  IP packets and transmitting those IP packets on a data network  and Sonus T7000 Intelligent Switching System  a class five end office soft switch that provides residential and business voice services  as well as IP IP multimedia processing engine services The stock is a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  in an industry that ranks in the Top 15  of our Zacks Industry Rank  A big reason for the favorable Zacks Rank is the recent earnings estimate revisions to the upside the company has seen from analysts  Over the last thirty days  three analysts have increased their estimates for the current quarter while two have done so for the current year  The bullish sentiment has increased our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 16 cents to 23 cents while increasing current year estimates from 23 cents to 27 cents Another boost for bullish shareholders comes from Sonus Network s valuations  Looking at its price to sales ratio  SONS is only trading 1 5x sales  Compare that to the S P 500 average of 3 0x earnings and you see why some feel SONS is undervalued here  I feel like beating up on retail is kicking a dead horse  We all know the plight of the brick and mortar shop  As more and more shopping goes online  retailers are struggling to keep afloat  Frankly  I feel it s a great opportunity for retailers to differentiate themselves  It also kills off the weak hands and those companies that have been slacking off for too long  If you offer an inferior customer experience to go along with zero customer service and homogenous products then guess what  You deserve to go out of business I m not saying that today s Bear of the Day is going out of business  I m just saying that there are more attractive corners of the market than this one  And this one is Dillard s Dillard s  Inc  operates as fashion apparel  cosmetics  and home furnishing retailer in the United States  It operates through two segments  Retail Operations and Construction  The

25136,246651,DDS,Macy s Downgrade  JC Penney s Guidance Prompt Industry Wide Selloff ,opinion,"Shares of several major U S  department store chains plummeted on Monday after a Citigroup   NYSE C   analyst downgraded Macy s   NYSE M    and JC Penney   NYSE JCP   lowered its third quarter earnings guidance 
Macy s
Citigroup downgraded Macy s stock from  Neutral  to  Sell  on Monday morning  citing poor performance from the company s retail business as the primary reason  Citi analyst Paul Lejuez   as seen significant pressure on sales margins for several years  they no longer make much money as a retailer  
The analyst went on to say that Macy s  core business is weak and  we believe  is getting weaker   The analyst pointed to an overall decrease in foot traffic and a decline in brick and mortar overall as other reasons for the downgrade 
On top of that  Citi cited JC Penney s recent poor performance as yet another factor for downgrading Macy s to sell 
On the back of the Citi downgrade  shares of Macy s slumped over 3  to touch a new 52 week low of  18 94 per share 
JC Penney Guidance 
Retail industry investors are also spooked the day before Halloween because JC Penney provided new  weaker updated third quarter and full year 2017 guidance on Friday 
The department store chain now expects comparable store sales will fall as much as 1  for the full year  with flat growth presented as the best case scenario in this vital retail category  JC Penney also projects the cost of goods sold will jump as much as 120 basis points  What s more 
JC Penney now expects to post an adjusted third quarter EPS loss in the range of  0 40 to  0 65 
JC Penney noted that its inventory liquidation  favorably impacted sales during the months of September and October   However  the company has been forced to make other larger strategic changes to its business that has some investors nervous 
 Although these actions will create a short term negative impact to cost of goods sold and earnings  long term  we firmly believe it was the right decision for the Company as we transition into the fourth quarter and fiscal 2018   CEO Marvin R  Ellison said in a statement 
 In addition  based on the way our business is growing  including continued comp sales growth penetration in major appliances and omnichannel in the third quarter  we are taking a renewed approach to aligning our expense structure to match the mix of our growth initiatives  
Shares of JC Penney sunk over 8 3  on Monday to hover just above their 52 week low in response to the company s poor full year and quarterly projections 
Other Department Stores 
As is often the case  big movement from Macy s and JC Penney based on negative industry trends has helped push much of the rest of the retail industry down 
Shares of Nordstrom   NYSE JWN   and Dillard s   NYSE DDS   dipped around 2   while Kohl s   NYSE KSS   saw its stock price fall marginally 
Retail sector ETFs also fell on Monday  Shares of the SPDR S P Retail  MX XRT  ETF  fell 1 15   while the Direxion Daily Retail Bull 3x Shares ETF  dropped 2 93   The VanEck Vectors Retail ETF   V RTH   experienced a marginal decline 
What s Next 
The second week of November is one that retail investors will want to pay close attention to as a ton of department store heavyweights are set to report third quarter earnings 
Macy s  Nordstrom  and Kohl s are all set to report Q3 earnings on Thursday  Nov  9  JC Penney is ready to announce its results Friday  Nov  10 
Department store chains  third quarter earnings are important  but investors will also try to hone in on their fourth quarter and full year guidance ahead of the all important holiday shopping season  Luckily  there are some signs that things could pick up for department stores as the country s biggest retail trade group  National Retail Federation  projects retail sales for November and December  excluding autos  gas and restaurant sales  will jump as much as 4  to  682 billion  and account for up to 30  of annual sales for some retailers  also read

25137,246652,DDS,JC Penney  JCP  Plunges On View Cut  Drags Other Retailers,opinion,"The stock market runs on sentiment and any unforeseen event in a particular sector has a ripple effect on others with a clear reflection on major indices that bear the brunt  The case is more or less the same for specific sectors that often observe good or bad performance by one player influencing the performance of others 
While major indices   Dow Jones Industrial Average  Nasdaq and S P 500 ended the Friday s trading session on a positive note  the SPDR S P Retail ETF  MX XRT  fell 1 5   We believe J  C  Penney Company  Inc    NYSE JCP   disappointing forecast may have been one of the reasons behind the SPDR S P Retail ETF s decline 
Dismal Forecast

25145,246660,DDS,Why Did Nordstrom  JWN  Stock Sink Today ,opinion,"Shares of Nordstrom   NYSE JWN   sunk on Monday after the department store chain announced that its plan to go private has been put on hold until after the holiday season  at the earliest 
The Nordstrom family told a special committee of Nordstrom s board which was appointed to oversee any possible sale that they have paused their search for a private equity partner to take the business private  The family  who own roughly 31  of the company  said they will resume their efforts to take the company private after the holiday season 
 The Special Committee  which is committed to protecting the interests of the Company  Nordstrom  and all its shareholders  is prepared to thoroughly evaluate such a proposal from the Group at that time  if one is made  No assurances can be given regarding the terms and details of any transaction   a Nordstrom company release stated 
The Nordstrom family announced during the summer that they were in the process of trying to take the company private amid a quickly changing retail environment  Over the last several months  talk surrounding Nordstrom s possible buyout has included KKR   NYSE KKR    Apollo   NYSE APO    and Leonard Green   Partners 
In the potential deal  Leonard Green or other firms would supply roughly  1 billion to the Nordstrom family to help fund a deal to go private  However  the news has always been relatively speculative  causing the company s stock price to fluctuate wildly 
The possibility of a deal being reached has been hampered because the family and potential private equity partners have found it hard to raise enough debt at reasonable rates in order to completely fund a buyout of the  6 67 billion company 
 that they would have trouble selling Nordstrom s debt before the holiday shopping season ends and would then be forced to wait until next year  This could leave banks vulnerable if Nordstrom s sales falter during its holiday quarter  which would make offloading its debt much harder 
Banks  along with many investors  are concerned that shifting retail trends  including a slump in mall foot traffic and the rise of e commerce powers such as Amazon   NYSE M    will hurt the high end retailer even further 
Nordstrom shares fell over 6  Monday morning  Shares of the historic U S  department store now sit just above its 52 week low heading into the most important season of the retail year

25157,246672,DDS,DSW Sinks Retail Stocks Ahead Of  Black Friday ,opinion,"Only days before Black Friday  shares of some of the biggest U S  retailers  including Macy s   NYSE M    Nordstrom   NYSE JWN   and Dillard s   NYSE DDS    sunk on Tuesday after DSW   NYSE DSW   reported lower than expected third quarter results and weakened fourth quarter guidance 
DSW failed to meet third quarter earnings estimates  citing negative impact from the wave of early fall tropical storms and hurricanes  along with warmer than usual weather  Although the discount shoe retailer s third quarter revenues rose 1 7   they missed expectations  and comparable store sales fell 0 4  
On top of that  DSW updated its full year outlook and now expects earnings to fall between  1 40 and  1 45 per share  which reflects the retailer s newly lowered expectations  Furthermore  the company noted that one of its newest acquisitions   bought in the hopes of boosting its online presence is not performing up to expectations 
 At Ebuys  we ve moderated the long term financial expectations and have reduced its carrying value on our balance sheet   CEO Roger Rawlins said in a statement  
Shares of DSW tumbled over 11  in morning trading after it released its third quarter earnings report  Before Tuesday s descent  DSW stock had dipped roughly 0 50  since the start of the year 
DSW s rough Q3 also has some investors dumping other notable retailer players far beyond the scope of the shoe industry 
Other Retailers 
Macy s shares dipped over 1 50   while Nordstrom saw its stock price sink by as much as 1 70   Dillard s stock dropped by more than 2 33   and Kohl s  KSS  experienced a marginal decline  
DSW s poor performance and lowered guidance also negatively impacted shares of American Eagle   NYSE AEO   and The Gap   NYSE GPS    Shares of Dick s Sporting Goods   NYSE DKS   also dipped  while sports footwear retailer  Finish Line   NASDAQ FINL   stock sank by over 1 80  
Retail sector ETFs also fell on Tuesday  Shares of the SPDR S P Retail  MX XRT  ETF  dropped over 1   while the Direxion Daily Retail Bull 3x Shares ETF  dipped over 2 60  
This downturn  directly ahead of what has become retail s most important week  does not bode well for the industry  It s also worth noting that DSW is not known to be a bellwether for the retail industry  which could mean retail investors are simply skittish overall 
What might make investors even more nervous is that  over the last decade  this two week period has proven to be one of the industry s strongest  In fact  since 2007  retail is the top U S  equities sector during the week before and after Black Friday   
Now  only three days away from Black Friday and the start of the holiday shopping season  retailers and investors will hope customers eager for deals come out in droves 
Luckily  this year despite pushback against the now decades long practice and an overall retail shift the National Retail Federation estimates 164 million people plan to shop on Black Friday  which is up from 87 million in 2014  also read

Retailers from Macy s   NYSE M   to Walmart   NYSE WMT   count on Black Friday sales to help both fuel and kick off their holiday season sales  Yet  in the changing retail environment  the rise of  Cyber Monday  might merit more attention  also read    
A Brief History 
The National Retail Federation  which is one of the world s largest retail trade associations and tracks retail consumer spending  began to notice a massive uptick in online consumer spending the Monday following Thanksgiving  Back then  many consumers did not have the best high speed internet access at home  and therefore often waited until they got to work on Monday to start searching for holiday gifts and deals online 
The NRF officially  in November 2005  via a Shop org press release entitled   Cyber Monday  Quickly Becoming One of the Biggest Online Shopping Days of the Year  
In fact  according to a   the origin of the phrase can be attributed to   who is now the SVP of Research and Strategic Initiatives at the NRF   It s surreal to think that I m associated with a term that has taken off like this   Davis told the publication in 2015 
The release noted   77 percent of online retailers said that their sales increased substantially on the Monday after Thanksgiving  a trend that is driving serious online discounts and promotions on Cyber Monday this year  2005   
Cyber Monday caught on relatively quickly  as The New York Times and Wall Street Journal  the catchphrase in association with the online shopping sales day as early as December 2005 
Soon after  retail giants  online shopping powers  and media outlets co opted the phrase that is now one of the biggest online shopping days of the year 
2017 Iteration

25217,246732,DDS,Kohl s   Macy s Fall Despite Upbeat Q2 Earnings  Here s Why,opinion,"Last week  retail majors Kohl s Corporation   NYSE KSS   and Macy s Inc    NYSE M   reported their quarterly results wherein both delivered better than expected earnings and revenues  Despite delivering upbeat results  both companies  shares tanked  as they are still struggling with industry specific headwinds 
Let s delve into the details 
Better Than Expected Quarterly Results
On Aug 10  both Kohl s Corp  and Macy s posted second quarter fiscal 2017 results 
 of  1 24 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4 2  and prior year quarter earnings by 2  owing to improved sales in all lines of business  strong inventory and expense management  Net sales of  4 144 billion marginally beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  4 138 billion  However  it dipped 0 9  from the prior year quarter due to a challenging sales environment and lower comparable store sales  comps  
On the other hand   of 48 cents a share that topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 45 cents but declined substantially from 54 cents reported in the year ago period  Total sales of this Cincinnati  OH based company also came ahead of the estimate after missing the same in the preceding two quarters  However  the company s top and bottom lines continued to decline year over year 
Comps on an owned plus licensed basis dipped 2 5   while on an owned basis comps fell 2 8   Gross profit in the quarter declined 6 6  year over year  whereas gross margin contracted 60 basis points to 40 3   Operating income plunged 18   while adjusted operating margin shriveled 90 basis points to 5 5  in the quarter 
Improved Comps
We note that these companies have delivered lower comps in the second quarter  but the decline was narrower than expected  While Kohl s posted comps decline of 0 4   it was narrower than management s expectation of 1 5  fall  backed by increased traffic momentum and improvement in transactions in the month of July  Macy s comps declined 2 5   narrower than the 3 2  fall 
Initiatives Which Boosted Sales 
Both Kohl s and Macy s are making efforts to strengthen their position in the retail space  amid competitive pressure from both brick and mortar discount stores and online retailers  such as Amazon com  Inc    NASDAQ AMZN   
In an attempt to augment sales  profitability and cash flows  Macy s has been taking steps such as cost cutting  integration of operations as well as developing its e Commerce business and Macy s Backstage off price business  along with the expansion of Bluemercury and online order fulfillment centers  Moreover  as a part of store rationalization program  the company plans to shut down underperforming stores 
Kohl s has also been making continuous efforts to improve its base business  Lately  the company has started offering more outside famous brands and cutting down on the number of in house clothing brands it sells  Kohl s has started selling Under Armour products  as well as Clarks shoes and is looking for other brands to add to store aisles  The company also plans to continue selling the best selling of its private label brands  such as Sonoma  Croft   Barrow and Apt  9  in order to drive traffic  Kohl s has also undertaken several initiatives to reduce its inventory to boost profits 
Despite the efforts  shares of both the stocks have been declining over the last few quarters  If we look into the share price performance of these stocks over the last one year  we note that while Kohl s fell 17 3   while Macy s plummeted 50 2   in comparison to the   which declined 40 9   We believe waning mall traffic and increased online competition has grappled the overall industry and is hurting these stocks 

Both Kohl s and Macy s currently carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see   Other than Kohl s and Macy s  retailers like J  C  Penney Company  Inc    NYSE JCP   and Dillard s Inc    NYSE DDS   also failed to impress investors with their quarterly numbers  pulling down the shares 
Challenges Galore
We note that the retail sector has been witnessing rapid changes of late  Customers now prefer online shopping than buying goods from stores  Thus the e Commerce business is improving and is acquiring substantial market share of brick and mortar stores  This in turn has adversely impacted the store traffic  Retailers are focusing on improving their e Commerce businesses to tap in on the growing popularity of online shopping  However  by no means are they able to compete with Amazon com  which dominates the e Commerce market space 
The retail industry is also facing major challenges from a still strong U S  dollar  volatile commodity costs and uncertain economic environment  A strong dollar has resulted in lower spending from foreign tourists and is impacting retailers  overseas operations  Lower spending on apparel and accessories and a general slowdown in consumer spending are hurting sales at department stores  A highly promotional environment is also forcing retailers to slash prices thus impacting margins negatively 
Bottom Line
Though the companies have reported better than expected results  we remain skeptical about the stocks  as the retail chains still have a number of deterrents to overcome  While we are encouraged with the initiatives taken by the companies to grow their sales and market shares  we would still prefer to wait and watch these stocks as retailers will still have to compete against the back to school and holiday sales

25226,246741,DDS,Why Did Francesca s  FRAN  Stock Hit New Low ,opinion,"Shares of women s fashion boutique Francesca s   NASDAQ FRAN   plummeted to a new 52 week low on Monday after the struggling company announced the departure of a top executive 
The boutique chain announced that its chief merchandising officer and executive vice president  Laurie Hummel  who previously held leadership positions at Kohl s   NYSE KSS   and Macy s   NYSE M    is set to leave the company after less than two years at Francesca s

Retail Sector 
Francesca s is a small company with a market cap of roughly  275 million  so even though its shares have traded hands over four times above its average volume on Monday  it isn t likely to drag the whole retail sector down with it  But the fact that the company cited poor back to school sales as a reason for its projected revenue decline might frighten some retail investors

25228,246743,DDS,Should Value Investors Consider Dillard s  DDS  Stock Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Dillard s  Inc    NYSE DDS   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Dillard s Inc  has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 14 3  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 20 0  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Dillard s Inc  s current PE ratio somewhat above its midpoint  which is 12 6  over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 27 3  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Dillard s Inc  has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 17 1  so it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near future P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Dillard s Inc  has a P S ratio of about 0 3  This is significantly lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 1 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is somewhat below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Dillard s Inc  currently has a Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes DDS a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Dillard s Inc  might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of C and a Momentum score of F  This gives DDS a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been disappointing  The current quarter has seen two estimates go lower in the past sixty days  compared to none higher  while the full year estimate has seen a similar trend in the same time period This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has plunged about 25 7  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has fallen about 16   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Dillard s  Inc  Price and Consensus    This bearish trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineDillard s Inc  is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  a decent industry rank  top 45  out of more than 250 industries  further supports the growth potential of the stock  However  with a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past one year  the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates  analyst sentiment and broader factors to turn favorable in this name first  but once that happen  this stock could be a compelling pick More Stock News  This Is Bigger than the iPhone It could become the mother of all technological revolutions  Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  sold a mere 1 billion

25229,246744,DDS,Nordstrom  JWN  Stock Soars On Renewed Buyout Talk ,opinion,"Shares of Nordstrom   NYSE JWN   climbed on Wednesday after reports surfaced that the department store chain would once again consider taking on a private equity client in order to fund a buyout 
 first reported that Nordstrom family members are close to picking an investment firm to help the family facilitate a buyout of the publicly traded company  of which they own roughly 31   In the potential deal  Leonard Green   Partners would supply roughly  1 billion to the Nordstrom family to help fund a deal to take the company private 
Nordstrom s shares popped 6 1  premarket and have since surged over 6 02  in morning trading Wednesday  Still  the historic U S  department store sits almost  15 below its 52 week high of  62 83 per share 
The company  it would consider taking the company private in June  Nordstrom s statement noted that the family was looking into the possibility of acquiring 100  of JWN s outstanding shares of common stock 
Talk surrounding Nordstrom s possible private buyout continued in early August  when it was reported that the family was in  KKR   NYSE KKR    Apollo   NYSE APO    and Leonard Green   Renewed buyout speculation seems to have piqued investors  interests on Wednesday  but the privet equity deal has not been finalized 
The department store giant with a market cap of roughly  7 9 billion is also reportedly in talks with banks to raise around  8 billion in debt in order to completely finance the deal to go private 
Nordstrom has seen its stock price fluctuate since the beginning of the year as it tries to navigate the changing retail waters  Now  it seems that the Nordstrom family thinks that it would be able to make changes and investments that help the chain adapt without having to worry about negative  short term shareholder reactions 
The renewed energy to go private comes only two days after the company announced it will debut a new concept store in California in early October  Branded  Nordstrom Local   the company won t even sell clothes at the new store  opting instead to focus on personal styling and consultations  also read

25245,246760,DDS,Retail Stocks Slump As Nordstrom Buyout Talks Stall ,opinion,"Shares of Nordstrom   NYSE JWN   tanked on Monday after a report surfaced that suggested the department store chain s attempt to finance a private equity buyout could fall through 
Nordstrom sank over 6 50  after the  reported on Sunday that talks to take the retailer private have started to fade  The Seattle based chain has been in buyout talks with private equity firms for months  in an effort to reach a deal that is estimated to be worth as much as  10 billion 
The Nordstrom family and private equity firms including KKR   NYSE KKR    Apollo   NYSE APO    and Leonard Green have reportedly found it hard to lock in solid interest rates from lenders in order to completely finance the deal  Banks have begun to seek high interest rates  pointing to negative downward trends in the retail industry as a whole 
The New York Post report cited declining foot traffic in malls and Toys  R  Us  recent bankruptcy filing as massive  potentially detrimental signs that the retail world is in serious long term trouble 
 The financing has not worked out  I hear that the Nordstrom financing is not done and no one knows if it can be done   a retail industry expert with knowledge of the situation told the New York Post   Toys R Us isn t good for anyone  
Nordstrom  it would consider taking the company private in June  Nordstrom s initial statement noted that the family was looking into the possibility of acquiring 100  of JWN s outstanding shares of common stock 
The retail giant has seen its stock price fluctuate since the beginning of the year as it tries to navigate the changing retail waters  The family seemingly wanted to go private in order to make changes and investments that help the company adapt without having to worry about shareholder reactions 
Last month  renewed energy to go private came just two days after the company announced it would debut a new concept store in California  Branded  Nordstrom Local   the company won t stock clothes at the new store  opting instead to focus on personal styling and consultations

Shares of Dillard s sank 14 64  on Thursday on the back of its less than impressive second quarter results 
Other Department Stores 
Macy s often has the power to swing the whole retail sector when it reports  as it showed last quarter  Now  on the back of the department and retail giant s second quarter earnings  other retail chains have felt the hit

25270,246785,DDS,Red Robin s  RRGB  Q2 Earnings  Disappointment In Store ,opinion,"Red Robin Gourmet Burgers  Inc    NASDAQ RRGB   is scheduled to report second quarter 2017 results on Aug 8  after market close 
Last quarter  Red Robin came up with a positive earnings surprise of 53 45   In fact  the company s earnings surpassed met the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters  with an average beat of 17 27  
Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Red Robin Gourmet Burgers  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise
   Factors Likely to Influence Q2 Results
Red Robin s brand revitalization initiatives such as menu innovation  operational improvement and the introduction of a better customer service platform to enhance guest experience continue to drive revenues  Also  the company s local marketing initiatives and media campaign are expected to attract customers 
Notably  the company has rolled out Kitchen Display System  which is linked to table management software  This is expected to result in major sales growth as kitchens can handle higher peak volumes  Moreover  Red Robin s increased focus on its remodeling initiative is likely to boost its potential as a brand and improve client experience  thereby driving traffic 
Meanwhile  the company is moving smartly on new revenue streams such as its off premise  online ordering business via carry out  delivery and catering  Although these are expected to meaningfully support the top line in the second half of 2017  they might provide marginal additional yields in the to be reported as well 
However  as the operating environment has become increasingly challenging  the decline in sales volumes have begun to impact the returns on new restaurant openings  As a result  Red Robin is slowing down its development plan significantly for 2017  This  in turn  may hurt the top line in the quarter 
Moreover  the company has been witnessing rising labor costs  food costs  expenses related to initiatives as well as pre opening and remodeling costs  which might continue to put pressure on margins in the second quarter  Nevertheless  it remains to be seen if the Red Robin s new supply chain management software could provide some relief to this end 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not show that Red Robin is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here  as elaborated below

25278,246793,DDS,State Of Retail  JCPenny Plunges  Now a  Penny  Stock  Amazon To Blame ,opinion,"JCPenney announced a  62 million dollar loss for the quarter  With the announcement  its share price plunged 16  breaking the  4 barrier for the first time  Stocks under  5 are considered  penny  stocks 


Please consider  

Yup  JCPenney is now a penny stock   a Wall Street term for a company trading under  5  JCPenney  JCP  said it lost  62 million in its second quarter  That s more than a year ago  The retailer also said that same store sales   a measure of how well stores open at least a year are doing   fell more than 1  during the quarter 
JCPenney is the latest department store chain to announce dismal results  Macy s Inc  NYSE M   Kohl s Corporation  NYSE KSS  and Dillards Inc  NYSE DDS  all reported a decline in same store sales on Thursday as they struggle to compete against Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  Tech30  and Walmart  NYSE WMT  
The massive shift in the retail landscape has led many chains to shut down underperforming stores  JCPenney is one of them  announcing earlier this year it would be closing 138 stores  JCPenney wound up delaying the closings by a month though after consumers rushed to many of the stores to take advantage of the massive liquidation sales 
Ellison also said during the analyst call that JCPenney expects many retailers to ramp up promotions and discounts to try and lure shoppers into their stores  The CEO warned these sales may be even more aggressive than  what we ve traditionally seen  

Don t Blame Amazon
Amazon is not to blame  but Amazon sure does not help either 
Retail is massively overbuilt  That s the big problem  And it s not just the box retailers  The fast food restaurants are all cannibalizing each other s sales too 
Vitaliy Katsenelson accurately states 

Retail stocks have been annihilated recently  despite the economy eking out growth  The fundamentals of the retail business look horrible  Sales are stagnating and profitability is getting worse with every passing quarter 
Jeff Bezos and Amazon get most of the credit  but this credit is misplaced  Today  online sales represent only 8 5 percent of total retail sales  Amazon  at  80 billion in sales  accounts only for 1 5 percent of total U S  retail sales  which at the end of 2016 were around  5 5 trillion  Though it is human nature to look for the simplest explanation  in truth  the confluence of a half dozen unrelated developments is responsible for weak retail sales 
Our consumption needs and preferences have changed significantly  Ten years ago we spent a pittance on cellphones  Today Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  sells roughly  100 billion worth of i goods in the U S   and about two thirds of those sales are iPhones 
Consumer income has not changed much since 2006  thus over the last 10 years  190 billion in consumer spending was diverted toward mobile phones  Between phones and their services  this is  340 billion that will not be spent on T shirts and shoes 
But we are not done  The combination of mid single digit health care inflation and the proliferation of high deductible plans has increased consumer direct health care costs and further chipped away at our discretionary dollars  Health care spending in the U S  is  3 3 trillion  and just 3 percent of that figure is almost  100 billion 
Then there are soft  hard to quantify factors  Millennials and millennial want to be generations  speaking for myself here  don t really care about clothes as much as we may have 10 years ago 
All this brings us to a hard and sad reality  The U S  is over retailed  We simply have too many stores  Americans have four or five times more square footage per capita than other developed countries  This bloated square footage was created for a different consumer  the one who in in the  90s and  00s was borrowing money against her house and spending it at her local shopping mall 

Hugely Overbuilt
Malls  retail stores  and fast food restaurants are all hugely overbuilt  Analysts still have not put 2 and 2 together on what this means 
It s the overbuilding of all kinds of retail and fast food stores that has provided the high job growth  low wage growth environment that we are in 
You can blame  or thank  the Fed for that  depending on your view  Regardless  the expansion will come to an end at some point  And when it does  the Fed governors will not know what hit them 
Lowering interest rates further will not do a thing for the economy in this overbuilt setup  once the turn takes place ",2017-08-13,Mike (Mish) Shedlock,https://www.investing.com/analysis/state-of-retail-jcpenny-plunges-now-a-penny-stock-amazon-to-blame-200206896,200206896

25320,246835,DDS,Here s Why JCPenney  Yelp  And Others Were Removed From The Russell 1000 ,opinion,"Major companies are set to be pushed out of the Russell 1000 Index Friday as the Russell Investment Group evaluates what companies have a high enough market cap to be a part of the index s rank 
Major retailers like JCPenney   NYSE JCP   and Dillard s   NYSE DDS   and tech companies like Yelp   NYSE YELP   and Groupon   NASDAQ GRPN   will leave the Russell 1000  while growing companies like Advanced Micro Devices  Inc    NASDAQ AMD   are set to join the Russell 1000 
The Russell Indexes
The Russell 3000 Index is an index weighted by market capitalization  or the companies with the largest market value  It is maintained by the Russell Investment Group which strives to make the index the benchmark for the entire U S  stock market 
The Russell 3000 has two subset indexes  the Russell 1000 and the Russell 2000  The Russell 1000 Index is based on the 1 000 largest companies in the Russell 3000 and the U S  market  comprising over 90  of the total market capitalization of all listed U S  stocks  The Russell 2000 Index comprises of the remaining small cap companies from the Russell 3000 not included in the Russell 1000 
Stocks within the Russell 3000 Index are reconstituted once a year  usually around June  At this time  the companies are re ranked based on their market cap for the previous year  As a result  companies that have maintained their market value will stay in their current residing index  while others may move up to the Russell 1000 or down to the Russell 2000 accordingly 
What Companies Are Moving Up or Down
This year  some major companies are moving down from the Russell 1000 to the Russell 2000  For instance  JCPenney  whose market cap has shrunk to  1 4 billion  and Dillard s  which is down to  1 5 billion  will be moved to the Russell 2000  Major tech companies are also going down to the Russell 2000  including Groupon  Yelp  and Fitbit   NYSE FIT   
Many energy stocks are also moving to the Russell 2000 this year  The Russell 1000 RGS Energy Index is down 15 2  since the start of 2017 and down 9  since last June  This makes it likely that energy companies will shift from the Russell 1000 to the Russell 2000  including companies such as Diamond Offshore   NYSE DO    Noble   NYSE NE    Ensco   NYSE ESV    Rowan   NYSE RDC    and Penn Virginia   NASDAQ PVAC   
However  other companies are graduating to the Russell 1000  For instance  AMD had a very good year with its shares going from  5 to  14 in 12 months  This year has also been successful for financial companies  as the Russell 1000 Financial Services Index is up 21  since last June  Various financial companies are expected to replace the energy stocks leaving 
The Impact
This reconstitution of the Russell Index makes a huge difference in the stock market because many major mutual funds and ETFs are benchmarked to these indexes  such as the Vanguard Russell 2000 ETF   In total   8 5 trillion is invested in products based on the Russell U S  indexes 
Consequently  these investors buy stock from the companies that the Russell Index includes or sell based on what the index removes  Investors will be working to rebalance their portfolios  wanting their investments in various sectors to be proportional to the Russell 1000 Index 
As the Russell Investment Group works to reconstitute their indexes  investors will sell some major companies and buy shares of newer  growing companies  When this happens  some companies  stock will be bought by new investors and will continue to grow  while those leaving the Russell 1000 may not recover

25373,246888,DDS,5 Broker Favorite Stocks Your Portfolio Must Have,opinion,As the second quarter reporting cycle gets underway  investors would look to add stocks that have the potential to surpass earnings expectations in the quarter  This is because an earnings beat generally leads to stock price appreciation Investors  after all  are driven by the sole objective of generating handsome returns from their portfolio  None of them want their hard earned money to go down the drain However  the task of including potential outperformers in one s portfolio is not an easy one  In fact  equity market tricks are not easy to master with a deluge of stocks flooding the space at any point of time  The task becomes even more daunting when one tries to select a winning portfolio without proper guidance  Given time constraints  it is in the best interest of investors to be guided by experts in the field Seek Broker Advice The concerned experts are brokers  Generally  three types of brokers  sell side  buy side and independent  are present in the investment world  with sell side analysts being most common  They are employed by various brokerage firms to provide unbiased opinion to investors on the stocks under their coverage after thorough research  Buy side analysts are employed by hedge funds  mutual funds etc  while the independent ones simply sell their reports to investors  Brokers  irrespective of their types  do intense research on stocks in their coverage before coming up with recommendations Brokers analysts attend company conference calls presentations and scrutinize every detail available publicly before advising investors about their course of action  buy  sell or hold a stock  Be Guided by Earnings Estimate RevisionsBrokers arrive at their recommendation on a stock after thoroughly analyzing the nitty gritty  Therefore  it is natural for investors  on seeing brokers improve their recommendation on a particular stock  to believe that there is a solid reason logic behind it  In fact  a rating upgrade generally leads to stock price appreciation  Similarly  the price of a stock may plummet following a rating downgrade Estimates can move north for a number of reasons   favorable earnings performance  a bullish guidance  product launch or any favorable macro scenario  To take care of the earnings performance  we have designed a screen based on improving analyst recommendation and upward estimate revisions over the last four weeks Revenue Performance is ImportantWhile we have talked about the bottom line in detail  the top line  revenue portion  cannot be ignored  Actually  according to many market watchers a revenue beat is more creditable for a company than a mere earnings outperformance  especially in an environment of revenue weakness due to macroeconomic headwinds like a strong dollar or lackluster demand for travel  which will hurt travel focused companies  To address top line concerns  we have included in our screen the price sales ratio  which serves as a strong complementary valuation metric Screening Criteria   Up  Down Rating   Total  4 weeks   Top  75  This gives the list of top 75 companies that have

meeting this criteria are in bottom 10  of our universe of over 7 700 stocks with respect to this ratio Price greater than 5  A stock trading below  5 will not likely create significant interest for

25376,246891,DDS,Dillard s  DDS  Stock Soars On Report Of Imminent  Infinity Squeeze ,opinion,"Shares of Dillard s   NYSE DDS   soared more than 8  in morning trading Tuesday after a new report suggested that the stock appears to be heading for an  infinity squeeze  akin to Volkswagen s   OTC VLKAY   legendary short squeeze in 2008 
According to Richard Pearson  LON PSON  of   a combination of alarmingly high short interest and a lack of shares available for purchase could lead to a short squeeze of epic proportions on DDS 
 It seems that this  double whammy  of rising short against falling float had escaped the attention of short sellers who should have been paying attention   Pearson wrote 
 The third leg of this  triple whammy  is this  Of the 12 88 million share float  as much as 6 million shares are in the hands of index funds  including Blackrock  NYSE BLK   Vanguard and others  who are typically unable to sell in meaningful size  even when the share price rises sharply  
Pearson points to a series of relatively unnoticed share buybacks by Dillard s as the cause for the reduced float  Citing Bloomberg figures  he notes that this has caused short interest to rise to 69 9  of float  and his thesis suggests that short sellers will be hard pressed to cover given the limited supply of available shares 
Hypothetically  this would mean that existing holders could hold out for significantly higher prices as shorts look to close their positions 
It is also worth noting that Dillard s short interest ratio also known as days to cover is above eight days   In other words  it would take short sellers roughly eight days to close out of all of their positions assuming normal volume levels  Not exactly an enviable position  and something that could create a dreaded  short squeeze  in the process  
A typical short squeeze happens when a positive development suggests that a turnaround is on the horizon for a heavily shorted stock  If a stock starts to rise rapidly  shorts will want out of their positions  and if enough shorts buy back the stock  its price moves even higher 
For more information on how short squeezes work  check out this recent episode of the  podcast  hosted by Zacks ETF Strategist Eric Dutram 

In his report  Pearson compares the current situation with Dillard s to that of Volkswagen  DE VOWG p  in October 2008  In what would become one of the most incredible short squeezes of all time  Volkswagen s stock skyrocketed nearly 400  in a matter of days  briefly making the German automaker the most valuable company in the world 
How did this happen  Well  earlier that year  Porsche which owned about 31  of VW publicly stated that it did not intend to increase its stake  The German state of Lower Saxony owned about 20  of VW at the time  and Porsche presumably thought it would be too costly or difficult to acquire the other shares on the market 
However  in late October  Porsche revealed that it actually did up its stake to about 74  of shares outstanding  With about 13  of the company on loan to short sellers  the market had a big math problem  and shorts incurred billions of dollars in losses 
In the case of Dillard s  Pearson is arguing that the company s own share buybacks have created a situation that is akin to Porsche s surprising decision to buy up all of Volkswagen s available shares 
Pearson s full report is interesting  and I would encourage readers to check it out if they are interested in hearing more about his theory  There are several elements of the Dillard s situation that are characteristically different than the Volkswagen situation  but if Pearson s math is correct  he could be on to something

25377,246892,DDS,Macy s  Gap  Dillard s Help Lift Struggling Retail Sector,opinion,"Shares of some of the world s biggest retail companies including Macy s  Walmart  and Target jumped on Tuesday  marking a rare day of positive trading for this struggling sector 
Indeed  the retail space was up nearly across the board on Tuesday  Shares of the SPDR S P Retail  MX XRT  ETF  were up 2 44   while the Direxion Daily Retail Bull 3x Shares ETF  skyrocketed 7 41  
The Amplify Online Retail ETF   VanEck Vectors Retail ETF   V RTH    and PowerShares Dynamic Retail Portfolio ETF   V PMR   were all up marginally 
Tuesday s retail ETF gains can be attributed to gains from some retail giants  most of which have seen their shares dip in the last year amid a shifting shopping climate 
Wal Mart   NYSE WMT    Target   NYSE TGT    and Kohl s   NYSE KSS   all jumped over 2  on Tuesday  Nordstrom  NYSE JWN  rose 2 96   and Macy s   NYSE M   climbed 3 72   The Gap   NYSE GPS    up 4 01   was one of Tuesday s biggest retail movers 
Also among the day s top movers was Dillard s   NYSE DDS    a department store chain which gained more than 7  on Tuesday after a report surfaced that suggested the stock appears to be heading for an  infinity squeeze  similar to Volkswagen s now legendary 2008 short squeeze  read more    
Still  despite today s upward movement  talk of Amazon s   NASDAQ AMZN   apparent takeover of the entire retail world aren t likely to stop just yet 
It is true that the industry has been shaken and most likely altered forever by Jeff Bezos  behemoth  The online retail giant dove headfirst into almost every sector imaginable  and has transformed retail into a more on demand style world  where everything from books to snacks can be delivered to users in a few hours 
But one retail player s upward movement on Tuesday could be a sign of hope for the sector that many have all but written off  Barnes   Noble   NYSE BKS   posted a monster day  up over 15   on the back of news that  
At first glance that might seem like another sign that retail is struggling  but the firm is convinced that brick and mortar still has a place in the retail world  Barnes   Noble s activist investors have faith that brick and mortar isn t dead it just needs to be revamped 
And today s retail movement might signal that some share this glimmer of hope

25430,246945,DDS,Walmart Vs  Target  Who Performed Better During Q1 Earnings ,opinion,"Q1 earnings season is almost over  and earnings growth reached  investors have seen in five years  One sector  however  continues to disappoint  Retail  But this shouldn t come as a surprise  The same problems that affected the sector a year ago are still causing growing pains  as retailers continue to grapple with the rise of e commerce  declining sales  and changing consumer preferences 
This season  department stores took a nasty beating  After Macy s   NYSE M    Kohl s   NYSE KSS    and Dillard s   NYSE DDS   reported disappointing earnings    and almost every major apparel retailer suffered as a result  The same domino effect occurred when Dick s Sporting Goods   NYSE DKS   reported its earnings  sporting goods peers and sports retailers alike  negative investor sentiment   
There were some bright spots in Retail s earnings  Home Depot   NYSE HD   crushed analyst expectations once again  retaining a four year long trend of bearing earnings estimates  Beauty giant Ulta   NASDAQ ULTA   hasn t reported its results yet  and the  2  Buy  ranked company has consistently beaten estimates in the past four quarters 
Big box favorites Walmart   NYSE WMT   and Target   NYSE TGT   had surprisingly good quarters as well  with shares of both companies rising as a result  Who performed better in Q1  And who is better positioned in the long term  Let s break down Walmart s and Target s results to find out 
Walmart
Still America s largest brick and mortar retailer  Walmart reported better than expected earnings of  1 00 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 96 cents  Total revenues came in at  117 5 billion  falling just short of our consensus estimate but increasing 1 4  year over year 
U S  same store sales rose 1 4   beating analyst estimates and marking the 11th consecutive period of positive sales in the Walmart s home market  comp traffic improved 1 5   though average ticket declined 0 1  in Q1  The impact of rising consumer spending was seen in improved traffic during the quarter 
Operating income declined 0 7  to  5 24 billion  though this was due to Walmart s continued investments in e commerce initiatives as it takes on Amazon com   NASDAQ AMZN    Speaking of online  Walmart noted that its e commerce business saw gross merchandise volume soar 69   a sign that last year s  3 3 billion acquisition of Jet com may finally be paying off  Walmart now boasts 50 million items on its website  up from 35 million in the last quarter 
Target
While not the country s biggest retailer  Target may be one of Americans  most preferred  The company reported adjusted earnings of  1 21 per share  comfortably surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 89 cents  Net revenues came in at  16 02 billion  also beating our consensus estimate but decreasing 1 1  year over year 
Net income rose to  681 million  while Target said that its same store sales fell 1 3   a much narrower decline than the 3 7  analysts were forecasting  The company attributes this to a decline in customer visits and shoppers picking up fewer items on average  sales in its struggling food and beverage business were also down 
Target continues to expand its online presence  and Q1 was no exception  comparable digital channel sales grew 22  and contributed 0 8 percentage points to overall same store sales growth  Target is trying to replicate the kind of shopping experience customers know and love in its stores on its website  We all know these memes about walking into a Target and when getting to the check out  not knowing how you just spent so much money  Target s management is looking to mimic that kind of  impulse purchasing power  in its online store 
Who did it better 
While Target beat analyst expectations across the board  giving investors renewed hope that its turnaround efforts might be starting to take effect  the company s CEO  Brad Cornell  knows Target can perform better   We re not doing any high fives in the room here today   he told analysts and investors on the company s earnings call   Our first quarter performance is not what we expect to deliver over time  
But Target is taking big steps to improve short  and long term growth  The company is planning on rolling out 12 original brands over the next two years in hopes of getting more customers back in its stores  the first  called Cloud Island  will debut later in May and features home d cor  bedding  and bath items 
Target also plans on expanding its smaller format stores that populate larger metropolitan areas  Target COO John Mulligan said that for the company s 10 most  mature small format stores  we are seeing double digit comp increases on average so far this year  
The clear winner in this particular match up  however  is Walmart  Most strikingly  of course  is the retailer s insane online growth  Not only is it giving Amazon a run for its money through its website sales  but Walmart has also been boosting its online acquisition portfolio  scooping up Moosejaw  Modcloth  Shoebuy  and potentially Bonobos  in addition to Jet com 
At the same time  Walmart is taking steps to improve its many brick and mortar stores  implementing cleaner aisles and faster checkouts  for example  The company is also doubling down on pricing in its grocery division  making sure its prices are best in comparison to rivals like Kroger  NYSE KR  and Aldi 
Both giants have  this year  and each of these companies  earnings report is a sign that the Retail sector has some life left in it  Walmart  especially  is impressive  and while its online expansion hasn t come cheap its expenses grew faster that its sales in Q1 the retail giant is a consistently great example of a company taking on Amazon and winning

25432,246947,DDS,Macy s Slumps On Margin Woes  3 Retailers That Followed Suit,opinion,The stock market runs on sentiment and any unforeseen event in a particular sector has a rippling effect on others with a clear reflection on major indices that bear the brunt  The case is more or less the same for specific sectors that often see good or bad performance by one player influencing the performance of others  Yesterday  the major indices   Dow Jones Industrial Average  Nasdaq and S P 500 shed 47 81  20 63  and 6 77 points  respectively  A host of reasons may have influenced the entire trading session  But for now we are concentrating on one stock  Macy s  Inc    NYSE M   that kept investors on tenterhooks Macy s Flop ShowShares of Macy s nosedived 8 2  yesterday and even hit a 52 week low of  21 86   before recovering by just 4 cents   after this department store retailer warned investors that its margins may continue to feel the pinch  Management now envisions fiscal 2017 gross margin to contract 60 80 basis points  while for the second quarter it expects the same to shrivel by 100 basis points from the year ago period A glimpse of Macy s share price movement reveals that it has plunged 49 2  in the past six months compared with the Zacks categorized  industry s decline of 46   In contrast  the Zacks categorized  sector has advanced 10 7  What s Giving it a Hard Time A challenging retail landscape  soft store traffic and stiff competition from online retailers  particularly Amazon com  Inc    NASDAQ AMZN    have been hurting Macy s performance  This is quite visible from its first quarter fiscal 2017 results  wherein sales and earnings per share declined 7 5  and 40  year over year  respectively  While net sales decreased 7 4   3 9   4 2  and 4  in the first  second  third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2016  respectively  earnings per share declined 28 6   15 6   69 6  and 3 3  during the respective quarters Additionally  management at its first quarter conference call had stated that it expects total sales to decline in the band of 3 2 4 3  and expects comps on an owned plus licensed basis to decrease in the range of 2 3  during fiscal 2017  This Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company also projected adjusted earnings in the range of  2 90  3 15 per share compared with  3 11 posted in fiscal 2016 Macy s Plan of ActionMacy s has announced a slew of measures revolving around stores closures  cost containment  real estate strategy and investment in omni channel capabilities to enhance sales  profitability and cash flows  Additionally  management is developing its e commerce business  Macy s Backstage off price business and expanding Bluemercury and online order fulfillment centers Management is realigning operations and focusing on curtailing costs  It informed that these measures are likely to result in annual savings of about  550 million  and would allow the company to invest an additional  250 million in enhancing digital business  store related growth initiatives  Bluemercury  Macy s Backstage and China Domino EffectHad the impact of Macy s gross margin warning remained confined to the stock alone  it would have been less of a concern  Instead  investors pressed the panic button that took a toll on other retail stocks Shares of Kohl s Corporation   NYSE KSS    which operates department stores  dropped 5 8  yesterday  Last month  this Zacks Rank  3 company came up with first quarter fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings of 39 cents a share that surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 28 cents J  C  Penney Company  Inc    NYSE JCP   also felt the heat as its shares tumbled 4 1   The operator of department stores had posted better than expected first quarter fiscal 2017 results last month  This Zacks Rank  3 company delivered quarterly earnings of 6 cents that were far better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 22 cents Shares of Dillard s  Inc    NYSE DDS    which operates as fashion apparel  cosmetics  and home furnishing retailer  declined 3 4   This Zacks Rank  3 company reported first quarter fiscal 2017 results last month  wherein earnings of  2 12 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 98 You can see  Were Investors too Hasty Macy s cautionary outlook about gross margin rung an alarm for other department store retailers and even did not spare the broader retail sector  We note that gross margin in the first quarter had contracted 100 basis points to 38 1   and management expects the deterioration to continue  albeit at an equivalent rate  Nevertheless  Macy s kept its comps and earnings per share projection intact  and investors should have acknowledged the same before punishing the stocks 3 Stocks to Ride a 588  Revenue ExplosionAt Zacks  we re mostly focused on short term profit cycles  but the hottest of all technology mega trends is starting to take hold   By last year  it was already generating  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  47 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce   the world s first trillionaires    but that should still leave plenty of money for those who make the right trades

who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Dillard s  Inc    NYSE DDS   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Dillard has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 11 01  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 20 32  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Dillard s current PE ratio above its midpoint over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified Retail   Regional Department Stores industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 29 73  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Dillard has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 12 76  so it is fair to say that the stock price might appreciate in near future P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Dillard has a P S ratio of about 0 27  This is far lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 14 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  DDS is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Dillard currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  A   putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Dillard a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Dillard might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  B  and a Momentum score of  F   This gives DDS a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  B    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been pretty discouraging  The current quarter has seen one estimate going higher in the past sixty days compared to two lower  while the full year estimate has seen one upward and three downward movements in the same time period This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate has declined by 50  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched lower by 2 3   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Dillard s  Inc  Price and Consensus   This negative trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  despite strong value metrics and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near termBottom LineDillard is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  a strong industry rank  Top 43  out of more than 250 industries  further strengthens its growth potential So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pickZacks  2017 IPO Watch ListBefore looking into the stocks mentioned above  you may want to get a head start

25477,246992,DDS,Stock Market News For May 12  2017,opinion,Benchmarks finished in the red on Thursday dragged down by retail stocks which suffered after Macy reported weaker than expected quarterly results  Meanwhile  weak earnings performance by Snap subdued investors  confidence which ultimately had an adverse impact on the Nasdaq For a look at the issues currently facing the markets  make sure to read today s  article The Dow Jones Industrial Average  DJI  declined 0 1  to close at 20 919 42  The S P 500 fell 0 2  to close at 2 394 44  The tech laden Nasdaq Composite Index declined 0 2  to close at 6 115 96  A total of around 6 7 billion shares were traded on Thursday  in line with the last 20 session average  Decliners outnumbered advancing stocks on the NYSE by a 1 58 to 1 ratio  Macy s Shares DropShares of Macy s  Inc    NYSE M   tanked 17  and dragged down the consumer discretionary sector  following the release of the company s weaker than expected first quarter 2017 earnings results  Macy s succumbed to a negative earnings surprise of 31 4  in the first quarter of fiscal 2017  Total sales also fell short of the estimate for the second quarter in row  Further  the company s top and bottom lines continued to decline year over year Macy s reported first quarter adjusted earnings of  0 24 a share that missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 35 and declined substantially from  0 40 reported in the year ago period  The company generated revenues of  5 338 million that fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  5 469 million  and declined 7 5  year over year In fact in the past six months  Macy s shares have declined roughly 29 4  compared with the Zacks categorized industry that plunged 29 8   Analysts pointed out that the overall industry is grappling with waning mall traffic and increased online competition  Macy s reaffirmed its fiscal 2017 outlook  and continues to expect total sales to decline in the range of 3 2  to 4 3     Meanwhile  Kohl s Corporation   NYSE KSS   reported first quarter 2017 results with earnings beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate  However  revenues missed the same  The company reported revenues of  3 843 billion  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 864 billion  Also  it declined 3 2  from the prior year quarter due to a challenging sales environment and lower comparable store sales  However  the company s adjusted earnings of  0 39 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 28  You can see  Lower spending on apparel and accessories and a general slowdown in consumer spending are hurting sales at department stores  Kohl s and its competitors have struggling in an intensely competitive market from online retailers  Shares of the company declined 7 8  Weak performances from Macy s and Kohl s Corporation had a negative impact on investors  sentiment  which ultimately had an adverse impact on the broader market Snap Dragged Down the NasdaqShares of Snap Inc   NYSE SNAP   tanked 21 5  following the release of its first earnings report as a public company  Investors remained concerned over the company s long term prospects as the first quarter 2017 results clearly depict a slowdown in user base and revenue growth rate For the quarter  Snap reported loss per share of  2 31  much wider than the year ago quarter s loss of just  0 14  The year over year disappointing comparison was mainly due to stock compensation expenses related to its recently concluded IPO  which inflated the overall costs and expenses The company posted revenues of  149 6 million  registering a whopping 286  year over year jump  However  on a sequential basis  revenues were down 10   which  according to the company  may be due to seasonal impact on advertising  which comprises the bulk of its revenues Notably  the company added only 5 million active daily users in fourth quarter 2016  as well as last quarter  which happens to be the lowest since third quarter 2014  User growth holds the key in attracting advertisers  which is the primary source of revenues for Snap  A slowdown in user base growth rate may look unattractive to advertisers Stocks that made

25478,246993,DDS,Retail Stock Roundup  ORLY  BBBY  BBY  FNL  KATE  M  PIR  WSM  SSI  DECK,opinion,"Being an equity bear has been brutal for  oh  nearly eight years now  With the S P 500 up about 250  since bottoming in March 2009  equities have been  on the whole  raging higher  with some sectors in particular benefiting tremendously from the Trumpgasm  One area  though  seems to be recognizing a bitterly cold chill of reality  and that is retail 
Not everything retail is weak  of course  Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  has had an astonishing run  and we ll see if it holds together when they report next week   and some stocks such as AutoZone Inc  NYSE AZO  and O Reilly Automotive Inc  NASDAQ ORLY  have cranked out multi hundred percent gains for years now  But many retail companies  particularly those having to do with clothing  have been getting whacked  Take  for instance  Abercrombie   Fitch Company  NYSE ANF   which I ve picked on endlessly  it is actually lower than it was at the greatest depths of the financial crisis  For how many stocks could you make that statement 

Bed Bath   Beyond  NASDAQ BBBY  has a quite well formed head and shoulders pattern  whose neckline is shown with a red horizontal below  that suggests much lower prices to come 

Be careful not to confuse this with a very similar symbol  however   Best Buy Co Inc  NYSE BBY    which  competition from Amazon be damned  is defying gravity and broke above resistance this year 

Let s get back to the bearish charts  though  Shoe retailer The Finish Line Inc  NASDAQ FINL  has been trending lower for months  and the analog is going beautifully 

Another storefront at your local luxury mall is Kate Spade   Co  NYSE KATE   It found strength off and on recently due to buyout chatter  they are desperately trying to sell themselves   but the pattern is bearish  and just so you are clear  just because a company is for sale doesn t mean there will be any buyers  Just ask Twitter 

Speaking of analogs  take a look at Macy s Inc  NYSE M   Even though the stock has lost over half its value  if history is any guide  there are doomed as doomed can be  this is more impressive if you say it in an  voice  

Hold on there    it s another analog  and from another company I pick on a lot  Pier 1 Imports Inc  NYSE PIR   purveyor of scented candles  throw pillows  and monkeys carved from coconuts  This is another fine example of how just because a stock has already suffered a momentous collapse  about 65  so far  doesn t mean it isn t just going to keep collapsing  Firm support exists at  0 00 

Overpriced seller of kitchenware  Williams Sonoma Inc  NYSE WSM   is setting itself up for a big fall  It has found support for years in the mid 40s  but don t count on that surviving the year intact 

I will say  however  that some retailers are so far gone  the opportunity has already passed by  Stage Stores Inc  NYSE SSI  is a good example of a ship that s already sailed 

On the other hand  Deckers Outdoor Corporation  NYSE DECK   makers of the UGG shoe line  among others  has plenty of juice left to squeeze 

Dillards   NYSE DDS  is another stock which has lost about 60  of its value already but doesn t look anywhere close to being done falling 

What got me thinking about all this was my best performing short position  CBL   Associates Properties Inc  NYSE CBL   I wasn t sure what they did  but it turns out they are a big player in retail real estate     hence their stock is also in a terrific analog and appears to be screwed and tattooed 

If anyone is looking for rumblings to signal the kind of break in 2006 2007 that preceded the financial crisis  look no further than the charts above ",2017-01-29,Tim Knight,https://www.investing.com/analysis/retail-roundup-200173902,200173902

25480,246995,DDS,Amazon Has Patented On Demand Clothing  Here s Why,opinion,"Most of us are generally familiar with the concept of just in time inventory  but ecommerce giant Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN   is now set to take that concept to a whole new level  At least as far as apparel fashion is concerned 
This Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company has won a patent for on demand clothing that it applied for back in 2015 
Patent Details
Two of the inventors  Aaron Barnet and Nancy Liang are co founders of the 3 D printing startup Mixee Labs that the company bought back in Feb 2015  So 3D printing will likely play a role 
The patent is essentially for an entire system of manufacturing apparel from the point of collecting orders by a  computing device   deciding on the most efficient method of production based on geography  fabric type  assembly process or other criteria  printing the fabric  cutting and so forth 
The patent reads   Once various textile products are printed  cut and assembled according to the orders  they can be processed through a quality check  photographed for placement in an electronic commerce system  shipped to customers and or stored in a materials handling facility for order fulfillment  By aggregating orders from various geographic locations and coordinating apparel assembly processes on a large scale  the embodiments provide new ways to increase efficiency in apparel manufacturing  
It s also careful to mention that the technology won t be limited to clothing alone but can be applied to fabric products  accessories  e g   scarves  gloves  hats  bags  belts  etc    footwear  bedding  curtains  towels  etc   in a wide variety of materials including  but not limited to paper  plastic  leather  rubber and other materials 

What Could Amazon Be Up To 
It s exciting to think that we could choose our print  cut and make of clothing and then have somebody deliver our choice to our doorstep  But that is likely not Amazon s intention because it won t help drive efficiency or lower cost  and would most definitely be a very cumbersome project 
On the other hand  consider that Amazon already deals with a large number of third party sellers that use its Fulfilled by Amazon  FBA  service  Amazon also said that active sellers in FBA grew 70  year over year in 2016 and fulfilled units  both FBA and otherwise  grew 40   That means Amazon is stocking a steadily increasing amount of inventory at its warehouses to help it quickly handle both deliveries and returns  If it can collaborate with sellers to make the process more efficient  it could save costs while also increasing customer satisfaction 
The other possibility  a strong one  is that Amazon would like to further expand its own fabric categories from the eight it currently has and take its in house brands to new fast growing geographies 
Conclusion
What exactly Amazon intends to do with this technology is of course an open question right now  But a couple of years back  John Blackledge of Cowen   Co expected the company to become the largest clothing retailer by 2017 end  overtaking Macy s   NYSE M   and also leaving other retailers like JC Penney s   NYSE JCP    Kohl s   NYSE KSS    Dillard s   NYSE DDS   and Epic Stores   SG EPSC   in the dust  Amazon doesn t break out these sales but patents like this one indicate that its plans are deep  So after books and electronics  apparel could really be the next big thing for the ecommerce giant

25514,247029,DDS,Why Neiman Marcus Is Shelving Its IPO Plans,opinion,"In news which should surprise no one  luxury clothing retailer Neiman Marcus announced that it would be withdrawing its plans for an IPO for now  In a transmission sent to the SEC  Neiman Marcus stated that it  has determined that it is not in its best interests to proceed with the initial public offering contemplated by the Registration Statement at this time   Neiman Marcus did request that the fees it paid for filing with the SEC  be credited for future use   which indicates that it intends to go public at some point 
Neiman Marcus initially filed to go public back in 2015  but put those plans on hold because the IPO market was shaky in late 2015 and 2016  Does Neiman Marcus s decision to withdraw indicate that it believes the IPO market will be even worse in 2017 
Not really  Neiman Marcus s withdrawal says more about its own struggles than it does by the IPO market  which should do well in 2017  These struggles are a further indication of how clothing retailers are struggling to deal with the rise in online shopping and poor holiday sales  Neiman Marcus will need to adapt its business to online shopping and become more profitable if it intends to go public in the future 
Neiman s Struggles
Neiman s decision was undoubtedly prompted by reports of poor 2016 holiday sales  According to the   Neiman saw a 3 3 percent decrease in sales over the 2016 fourth quarter compared to the same period last year  Revenue over 2016 also decreased by a similar percentage  falling from  5 1 billion in 2015 to  4 95 billion in 2016  This was accompanied by drops in same store sales and net income  culminating in a  400 million net loss in 2016 
This decline in sales has largely resulted because of the growing popularity of buying clothes online  Customers can now often order clothes  try them on to see if they fit  and then send them back  Online holiday shopping has become much easier than braving the hordes of Black Friday shoppers 
Even if customers do not choose to order clothes online  they can now easily compare prices between differing upscale retailers  As  notes  Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  now offers barcode scanners which lets customers scan an item in a clothing store and see if a competitor carries that item for a smaller price  And as Amazon looks into expanding into the luxury clothing segment  traditional retailers like Neiman are being challenged from a pricing perspective 
Neiman is trying to adjust to these changed circumstances by offering more exclusive wares and limiting distribution of its products  But this company is a retailer which is not offering anything innovative  is seeing a decline in sales  has   and was not profitable in 2016  It is hardly surprising that it decided not to go public  especially as investors will be able to pick and choose their investments in what is expected to be a good 2017 IPO market 
Changes in the Clothing and Retail Industry
The factors which have caused Neiman to struggle and withdraw its IPO have hit the clothing retail industry in general  Macy s Inc  NYSE M  and Kohl s Corporation  NYSE KSS  recently reported poor holiday sales in 2016  and the former plans to cut 10 000 jobs and close 100 stores  Both of their stocks have naturally fallen as a result  and other clothing and retail brands like Ralph Lauren  NYSE RL   Dillards Inc  NYSE DDS   and Target Corporation  NYSE TGT  saw their stock prices fall as investors grow concerned about the future of retail 
While traditional retailers like Macy s and Neiman suffered  Amazon benefited from the rise in holiday shopping  The growth of Amazon has in turn affected how consumers shopped in December  as more are waiting until the last minute before just ordering something from Amazon  While customers shopped early in the past to make sure that they could get just what they wanted to give on Christmas  now they are secure in that Amazon will have what they want 
Good news for IPOs  bad news for Retail
Neiman Marcus s decision to not go public should not affect investors interested in IPOs in general  and 2017 should be a much better IPO market than the disaster that was last year 
However  Neiman Marcus s struggles  along with poor holiday shopping numbers for clothing retailers in general  are a sign that the retail industry is in serious trouble as it comes to grips with the effect of online shopping  Investors should stay away from companies like Macy s and Kohl s for now  and instead look at companies which can offer the best online shopping experience like Amazon 
The retail industry is in a transitional phase and transitions are often painful for old  established businesses  But those companies which can figure out how to improve their online services and integrate their online and offline stores will be in a better place afterwards ",2017-01-07,Alex Newman,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-neiman-marcus-is-plling-its-ipo-plans-200171729,200171729

25584,247099,DDS,Here s How Shopping Trends Have Helped Retail Stocks Lately ,opinion,"Despite a sluggish start to the year  retail stocks have  more the most part  bounced back thanks to a relatively strong earnings season  While some companies failed to keep up  department stores like Macy s   NYSE M    JCPenney   NYSE JCP    Dillard s   NYSE DDS    and Kohl s   NYSE KSS    as well as specialty retailers like Foot Locker   NYSE FL    Urban Outfitters   NASDAQ URBN    and Tilly s   NYSE TLYS   posted encouraging results by cashing in on the latest shopping trends 
What Shoppers Want
Throughout the retail landscape  we are seeing shoppers respond well to revamped e commerce and freshly polished physical stores  The retail companies that have performed well this earnings season were able to hone in on one  if not both  of these areas this quarter 
Let s take Macy s as an example  This staple of American shopping malls posted earnings of 54 cents per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 40 cents per share  The company also beat revenue expectations  posting sales of  5 866 billion versus our consensus estimate of  5 749 billion  So what did Macy s CEO Terry J  Lundgren credit for the success  Well  among other things  Lundgren pointed to several in store improvement 
  Our new sales driving initiatives  include additional investments in store staffing and visual presentation  the rollout of our enhanced fine jewelry departments  athletic active apparel intensification  home store improvements and Last Act clearance strategy   he said 
On a smaller scale  retailers like Foot Locker were able to post strong results after by ensuring that stores were stocked with the latest trends in fashion  After an earnings and revenue double beat  Foot Locker CEO Richard Johnson pointed to the quality of the company s shoes and apparel 
  We share an understanding  with our key vendors  which enables us to partner with them to deliver the trend right  premium footwear and apparel assortments our customers seek  which in turn has led to consistently outstanding financial results such as we announced today   Johnson said 
This earnings season proved that shoppers are willing to spend money  so long as it is at the right place  Throughout the quarter  we ve seen that the better that companies were able to listen to customers  follow trends  and improve in store and online offerings  the better the company performed compared to others who fell behind 
 For the past few years  we have worked to lift our brands through merchandise leadership and innovation  strengthen our customer focus and invest in technology   said American Eagle CEO Jay Schottenstein after his company posted earnings and revenue which both beat the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate 
Tilly s  a current Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  was also able to post a double beat  turning a surprise profit on the back of 1  comps growth  which included its e commerce business 
And while these companies primarily operate in shopping malls  other big retailers saw success in the same areas  Walmart   NYSE WMT    for example  has invested several billion dollars into the improvement of its e commerce business over the past several years  and this quarter the company saw U S  same store sales gain 1 6   which was backed by a positive impact from e commerce sales 
Bottom Line
After the first quarter  the retail sector was looking like it could be one of the worst performers of 2016  However  a range of positive Q2 reports and impressive company strategies have helped the sector recover  The Regional Department Stores business falls into the Top 8  of the Zacks Industry Rank right now  and the Apparel and Shoes category falls into the Top 33  
These two categories are seeing strong Zacks Ranks because they are comprised of companies that have cashed in on the latest trends in fashion and shopper behavior  Even in the Supermarket industry  which falls in the Bottom 7  of the Zacks Industry Rank  some positive signs were shown by companies that have invested in what customers want  such as Walmart s e commerce initiatives

25586,247101,DDS,4 Things To Watch When Macy s Reports Earnings On Thursday,opinion,"Macy s  Inc   NYSE M  is a multiple channel retailer operating stores  websites and mobile applications under various brands including Macy s  Bloomingdale s and bluemercury  There are 728 Macy s department stores in the US  Puerto Rico and Guam  54 Bloomingdale s stores which includes a growing number of branded outlets  as well as 100 bluemercury locations  The company is expected to release its Q3 2016 results on Thursday  November 10  before the market opens 

1  Earnings and revenue
Macy s is expected to report  0 41 of earnings per share on  5 6 billion of revenue  Macy s is on a six quarter negative growth streak for both revenue and EPS  It is expected to continue the trend this quarter  since  5 6 billion in revenue would represent a decline of a little under 4  YoY 

2  Ongoing Issues
As mentioned  weak sales are the biggest issue plaguing traditional retailers today  More and more Americans are shopping online  no longer bothering to visit physical stores  Macy s is not alone in this regard  other national retailers from Nordstrom  NYSE JWN  to Kohl s  NYSE KSS  are seeing falling sales as well  The ongoing question remains   By how much will sales decline    Last quarter  Macy s surprised investors with a slower than expected decline  and shares shot up from  34 to  40 as a result  an almost 20  jump  However  skepticism about longer term growth prevails  and the company has already given back half of those gains 

3  Adapting To A New Shopping Reality
Customers are shopping differently  and Macy s will have to change itself in order to thrive  Initial steps are already being taken in order to increase profitability and adapt  The company is working to increase and improve its online retail offering  as more and more customers are moving to digital platforms in order to shop  Macy s also plans to close 100 underperforming stores in early 2017  or about 13  of its total portfolio of 728 
Much was said by analysts and the financial media about Macy s low operating margin last quarter  which was a record low at 1 9   as compared to its usual margins of between 6 8   The recent  frighteningly low margin number however  was almost entirely a result of a  250 million impairment charge on closing underperforming stores  Closing stores could pay out for Macy s in two ways  the company can sell or lease these real estate assets while closing underperformers will allow better use of company capital 
Macy s is also developing a few retail initiatives include the opening of an  off price  business  with six pilot store in New York City  as well as changing the pricing approach to clearance merchandise by offering bigger pricing discounts while eliminating coupons and additional rebates or straight up cash discounts  The company is also betting on the beauty sector via its 2015 acquisition of Bluemercury  a beauty products retailer with over 80 freestanding stores plus a shop within many Macy s locations  with yet more locations expected to open in the next six months 

4  Valuation
All of the above  plus the fact that Macy s is undergoing a transition  would suggest that the company should be selling for a discount  since there s still uncertainty surrounding the retail market  and of course Macy s revenue and EPS continue to decline  Nevertheless  though its P E ratio  at 15  seems low  the market hasn t been discounting Macy s shares  Macy s historical P E ratios  at under 14 for 5  and 10 year medians  indicate that the retailer is actually  more expensive than it has been on average  despite its regressive numbers  Its price to book ratio  at 2 8  is more than twice the P B of fellow retailers Kohl s and Dillard s  NYSE DDS  
Conclusion
Macy s is trying to turn things around with its renewed focus on store performance and beauty products  Bricks and mortar retailers have indeed become too big to successfully compete with their online competitors  The moves initiated by the company will probably cause short term pain  but should ensure the business stays profitable in the long run  Still  we don t believe Macy s is a good enough value  Its price  within the larger historical context  just doesn t properly represent the risks now faced by the company 
Stay on the sidelines until Macy s  P E ratio reaches 10  as it did in January and May of this year  Barring new threats to Macy s existence or an additional growth driver  this would be our recommended sweet spot ",2016-11-09,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/4-things-to-watch-when-macy's-reports-earnings-on-thursday-200163391,200163391

25626,247141,DDS,4 Retail Stocks To Avoid Now Post Dismal Earnings,opinion,With the first quarter earnings season now effectively behind us  the retail sector is the only one still hogging the limelight  as a few stocks are lined up to report their financials  The conclusion derived from recent reports of retailers is that this sector s performance has been disappointing to an extent  with a variety of traditional brick and mortar operators reporting lower than expected results  in spite of already low estimates The initial assumptions that the improved household buying power  as a result of energy savings  would reflect in the retail sector s results  failed to translate much into reality  This was due to the shift in spending trends to online shopping  along with the competitive retail environment  For more details on earnings of this sector and others  please read our    report With respect to the retail stocks  Q1 scorecard  we now have results from 94 6  of the sector s total market capitalization in the S P 500  wherein total earnings grew 2 4  from the year ago period and revenues increased 5 4   While 68 4  companies beat earnings estimates  50  have surpassed revenue expectations Notably  a sizeable chunk of these companies delivered better than expected results  probably because estimates for this quarter were already reduced to easy to beat levels  owing to the global macroeconomic concerns  The decent looking picture  however  is also a reflection of strong results at Amazon com  Inc    NASDAQ AMZN    Once we exclude Amazon from the retail sector results  the comparisons start looking unfavorable Thus  as we gear up to enter another earnings season  it is time again to reshuffle your portfolio  and get rid of stocks that may hurt your returns  Here we have highlighted four Retail Wholesale stocks that posted a negative earnings surprise in the last concluded quarter  These stocks are also witnessing downward revisions in estimates and carry a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   Falling estimates clearly indicate that analysts remained skeptical about these stocks  future performance 4 Retail Stocks to Avoid NowBeware of Kohl s Corporation   NYSE KSS   that delivered lower than expected first quarter fiscal 2016 results  The company s quarterly earnings of 31 cents per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 13 9  and also plunged a significant 50  from the prior year quarter  Further  net sales of  3 972 billion lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  4 124 billion and fell 3 7  This operator of department stores has underperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 2 4  over the trailing four quarters  Following the dismal performance  the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 91 and  4 11 for fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017 has dropped 21 cents and 29 cents  respectively  over the past 30 days Don t let your portfolio fall prey to Dillard s Inc    NYSE DDS    The company s first quarter fiscal 2016 earnings of  2 17 per share lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 57 and plunged 18 4  on a year over year basis  Dillard s total revenue  including service charges and other income  of  1 538 8 million slipped 4 6  from the year ago quarter This fashion apparel  cosmetics  and home furnishing retailer has underperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 8 8  over the trailing four quarters  Following the miserable performance  the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  5 79 and  5 64 for fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017 has declined  1 20 and  1 81  respectively  over the past 30 days Another stock that you should forget for now is Citi Trends  Inc    NASDAQ CTRN    The company s first quarter fiscal 2016 adjusted earnings of 61 cents per share trailed both the Zacks Consensus Estimate and the year ago figure of 74 cents by 17 6   Further  sales dipped 0 6  year over year to  193 7 million and fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  197 million This value priced retailer of urban fashion apparel and accessories has underperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 5 7  over the trailing four quarters  Following the drab results  the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 92 cents and  1 29 for fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017 has decreased 27 cents and 2 cents  respectively  over the past 30 days Last but not the least is Nordstrom Inc    NYSE JWN    which does not deserve a place in your list of stocks  The company continued its dismal run as it reported first quarter fiscal 2016 results  wherein both top and bottom lines lagged estimates for the third straight quarter  Nordstrom s quarterly earnings of 26 cents per share came in way below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 45 cents and slumped 60 6  from the prior year quarter figure of 66 cents  Total revenue rose 2 5  to  3 249 million but fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 293 million Following a disappointing quarter  Nordstrom now expects net sales to increase nearly 2 5  4 5  in fiscal 2016 compared with 3 5 5 5  growth guided earlier  Management now envisions fiscal 2016 earnings in the range of  2 50  2 70 per share  down from  3 10  3 35 projected earlier This fashion specialty retailer has underperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 15 7  over the trailing four quarters  Following the poor show  the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 55 and  2 91 for fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017 has tumbled 63 cents and 60 cents  respectively  over the past 30 days Bottom LineIn our school days  we had read an idiom   A stitch in time saves nine   meaning that timely action may prevent serious loss later on  So  you can apply the same principle to your portfolio  Exiting the underperforming stock at the right time helps maximize your portfolio s return  For the time being  you can shift your focus to better ranked retail stocks Investors can confidently end their search at stocks with a better Zacks Rank status of either  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy   which encompasses its strong fundamentals  promises price movement and highlights analysts  constructive view on the same via positive estimate revisions ,2016-05-25,Zacks Investment

25678,247193,DDS,Kohl s  KSS  Q2 Earnings Beat  Outlook Cut On Weak Comps,opinion,"Retailer Kohl s Corporation   NYSE KSS   delivered better than expected second quarter of fiscal 2016 results  where both earnings and revenues exceeded the consensus mark 
Kohl s reported earnings of  1 22 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 04 by 17 3   Earnings also increased 14  from the prior year quarter driven by higher gross margin and better expense management  The performance of juniors and young men s categories were also encouraging 
Sales and Margins
Net sales of  4 182 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  4 158 billion by a marginal 0 6   Sales however declined 2  from the prior year quarter due to a challenging sales environment 
Comps declined 1 8  in the second quarter  narrower than the preceding quarter s decline of 3 9   Comps had increased 0 1  in the prior year period  This signals that the company s strategic initiative  Greatness Agenda  is failing to deliver results  The initiative  which began in the first quarter of 2014  was designed to increase transactions per store and sales  Though the plan has helped the company to deliver positive comps in all the four quarters of fiscal 2015  the quarterly growth rates moderated gradually  thus posing a concern  Moreover  comps declined in the first two quarters of fiscal 2016  
We note that Kohl s is struggling since the past many quarters to boost its sluggish top line  Lower spending on apparel and accessories and a general slowdown in consumer spending are hurting sales at department stores 
Kohl s Corporation remains cautious about its fiscal 2016 results and plans to close 18 stores  due to retail uncertainty as well as careful spending by US consumers 
Gross margin expanded 59 basis points  bps  to 39 5   This was driven by the company s inventory management initiatives  which have helped it to achieve a strong increase in gross margin with ending inventory per store down significantly from last year  Operating margin also plunged 220 bps to 7 2  KOHLS CORP Price and Consensus   Other Financial Details
As of Jul 30  2016  Kohl s held  700 million of cash and cash equivalents compared with  423 million as of Apr 30  2016  The company ended the quarter with long term debt of  2 79 billion  flat sequentially 
On Aug 9  2016  Kohl s board declared a quarterly cash dividend of 50 cents per share  which will be paid on Sep 21  2016 to shareholders of record at the close of business on Sep 7  2016 
Kohl s ended the quarter with 1 150 Kohl s stores  12 FILA Outlet stores  and three Off Aisle clearance centers in 49 states  compared with 1 164 Kohl s stores at the same time last year 
Outlook Slashed                                                                              
The company has slashed its earnings guidance due to sluggish comps and a difficult sales scenario  The company now expects its adjusted fiscal 2016 earnings in the range of  3 80 to  4 00  compared with the prior guidance of  4 05 to  4 25 
During the fourth quarter 2015 conference call  Kohl s had stated that it will also close 18 underperforming stores in fiscal 2016  which are expected to generate annual SG A savings of approximately  45 million and annual depreciation savings of approximately  10 million 
It expects sales in a range of  0 5   to 0 5   driven by comparable sales of 0  to 1 0  
The company plans to repurchase shares worth  600 million at an average price of  50 per share

25704,247219,DDS,Summer Doldrums Set Up Potential For Air Pocket Drop,opinion,The trading environment for US equities has become eerily quiet as we wind down the second quarter earnings season  It s normal to expect light trading during the summer as institutional traders take vacations and retail capital flows remain quiet  But last week s action took  illiquidity  to a whole new level  For the week  the Dow put in its smallest weekly range since 2007  and trading volumes are at 5 year lows  This during a time when the global macro risks continue to rise  setting up potential for an unexpected air pocket in the near term price action  Narrow trading ranges have the tendency to induce complacency  as traders get comfortable with the muted price action  and risk models expand allowable exposure levels  At the same time  lower volume decreases the amount of liquidity available to traders   which can be a big problem if capital needs to be moved quickly  The complacency and lack of liquidity is especially concerning when considering the numerous potential catalysts that could easily ignite a selloff  In Europe  politicians continue to fight crisis with words  but have been unable to come up with any credible plans to solve the debt issues  or to re ignite economic growth  European equity markets have rebounded from oversold levels  squeezing shorts and sucking in new optimistic buyers  But without any true solution to the crisis  the price action looks very much like an unsustainable relief rally In China  disappointing export data highlights the degree to which the world s largest  growth  economy relies on the developed world to maintain expansion levels  For the month of July  exports rose only 1  year over year  with exports to the euro zone down 16   New bank lending also hit a 10 month low even as policies were loosened to make credit more readily available Here in the US  the second quarter earnings season has been a fundamental disaster  with revenue figures coming in below expectations and corporations lowering guidance broadly  The consumer spending picture continues to weaken for both budget conscious and affluent retailers  And while headline employment numbers show improvement  the details still point to weakness  as underemployment is high coupled with a low labor participation rate The current bull market appears very vulnerable as prices grind higher on extremely low volume  The broad indices have traded up to key resistance areas  without breaking out   and the majority of sectors are now in overbought territory  We re entering the week with some broad bearish exposure already on the books  and looking to add sector and individual equity positions on a case by case basis  Of course we continue to respect the recent grind higher price action  But considering the low volume  the lack of compelling fundamental data  and the relative complacency  bearish trades popping up on our radar offer compelling reward to risk scenarios    Below are a few of the areas we are focusing on this week More Evidence Of Consumer Weakness Over the past week  two major earnings reports shed more light on the fragile state of the US retail environment  On Thursday  Kohl s Corp  KSS   as depressed expectations set a low hurdle for the current quarter  But more importantly  the company cut their full year outlook  and CEO Kevin Mansell stated that they would have to cut prices to help move inventory off shelves  During the conference call  Mansell noted that their customers are under pressure  and that the company would have to accept lower profit margins in order to keep revenues stable  On Friday  J C  Penny  JCP    on revenue that was 23  lower than last year  Consumers are not reacting well to the department store s new policy of not offering discounts  opting for an  every day low price  format   Ironically  the stock rallied 6  on the news  The J C  Penny example illustrates two important issues for trading this environment  US Consumers are price conscious  Retailers are being forced to compete based on price  and promotions are necessary to attract sales  This makes it difficult for investors to justify premium growth multiples for retail stocks Oversold stocks are vulnerable to short squeezes  In the case of JCP  the stock had already lost more than 50  of its value from earlier this year  Oversold stocks can be extremely vulnerable to  short the rumor  cover on the news  squeezes At this point  the pattern for KSS looks particularly interesting given the CEO s cautious statements and the failed breakout   reversal last week    Traders should keep a close eye on Dillard s Inc   DDS  and Nordstrom  Inc   JWN  as additional industry tells  Dillards broke to a new high last week  but volume was much lower than the stock experienced during its last breakout  exhaustion gap    Nordstrom on the other hand is advancing steadily right into a key resistance area  Weakness for either of these retailers could have a profound effect on sentiment for department store investors  as the entire group relies on robust consumer spending for growth  Transports Fail To Confirm Market Strength   While the blue chip indices have been grinding higher on declining volume  the Dow Jones Transportation Index   TRAN  has been trading in a giant wedge pattern  A sustained series of lower highs raises a red flag for Dow Theory practitioners  The action in the transports more closely reflects the global economic picture  and at least on the retail side  a slowdown in transportation meshes with retailers and wholesalers reporting high inventory levels and slow turnover  More specifically  North American trucking stocks have been looking vulnerable as lower volumes lead to compressed profit margins  J B  Hunt Transport Services  JBHT  is one component that looks attractive from the short side  after a failed breakout early this summer  and a disappointing earnings announcement last month  On June 17  the company missed earnings and revenue projections  sending the stock sharply lower  The miss would have been worse if not for falling oil prices through much of the second quarter  With oil prices moving materially higher since the start of the month  and global trade showing signs of topping out  it s easy to see why the stock hasn t made back lost ground   even with the broad market providing a tailwind  J B  Hunt currently trades with a growth stock multiple as expectations for a slow but steady economic recovery in the US have boosted confidence  But now that sentiment is shifting  JBHT could drop significantly and still carry a reasonable valuation based optimistic forward estimates  A relatively high debt to equity level adds more risk should the shipping industry begin to deteriorate   not a major issue  but one that could raise concerns a bit farther down the road  no pun intended   Small Caps  The Risk Barometer The weak price action in small caps has been an interesting dynamic when compared to light volume advances of the major blue chip indices  Small caps can offer great insight into investors  risk appetite   especially during times of uncertainty  When institutional investors are behind the ball and need extra fire power to catch up with their benchmarks  small cap equities can offer the needed beta to outperform  On the other hand  when these same managers are more focused on protecting capital  they typically underweight high beta small cap stocks  and their massive sell orders can sometimes spark sharp price breaks as distribution forces play havoc on illiquid stocks within the group  Growth expectations also come into play as small cap mutual funds and indices typically gravitate towards growth companies that do well in an expanding economy  In a much more uncertain environment where economic growth is hard to find  it becomes more difficult to justify paying a growth premium for small capitalization stocks   and so the overall price valuation for this asset class can fluctuate greatly depending on conditions  At this point  we have taken a moderate bearish position in the Russell 2000 Index as documented in the   Once the index breaks down  we can determine whether to add more size to the position  and which vehicles make the most sense for maximizing profits while managing our risk carefully   Given the low volume levels and narrow recent price action  it makes sense to pay extra attention to liquidity in trading positions  In particular  the action in the first few minutes of trading has become turbulent with algo trading systems squaring off against position traders in a shallow environment  In some cases  specifically for individual equities with less liquidity   it makes sense to give risk points a little more room  while ratcheting down the position size a bit to keep the overall portfolio risk within normal bounds  Volatility is notoriously cyclical  so if history is any guide  the current summer doldrums period could quickly morph into a much more dramatic environment  Disclosure  This content is general info only  not to be taken as

Ashland Inc  NYSE ASH 

Ashland  moved higher off of the October low and consolidated around 118  After that it made another run higher and has been consolidating since in an ascending triangle  The RSI has held bullish and the MACD is about to cross up for a buy signal

Up Next  Bonus Idea
The Best
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad  picture reviewed Friday which  Heading into Quarter end and a holiday shortened week the Equity markets look short term vulnerable in their long term uptrends 
Elsewhere look for Gold to try higher in its short term uptrend but with trepidation while Crude Oil consolidates back in a channel  The US Dollar Index may continue to consolidate in its uptrend with a bias higher while US Treasuries are biased lower as they consolidate  The Shanghai Composite looks better to the upside in its consolidation and Emerging Markets are biased to the downside in their broad consolidation 
Volatility looks to remain subdued keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETF s SPDR S P 500  ARCA SPY   iShares Russell 2000 Index  ARCA IWM  and PowerShares QQQ  NASDAQ QQQ   Their charts show a mixed bag with consolidation in the uptrends ion the longer timescale  with the IWM the strongest  while on the shorter timeframe the IWM and QQQ may reverse higher with the SPY still looking vulnerable  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well
