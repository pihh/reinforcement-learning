125230,346745,AMKR,5 Value Stocks With Enticing EV EBITDA Ratios To Own Now,opinion,Investors generally have a fixation on the price to earnings  P E  multiple while seeking stocks that are trading at attractive prices  A widely favored approach by value investors is to chase stocks that have a low P E ratio  But even this straightforward  broadly used valuation metric suffers a few  is a Better Approach  Here s WhyAlthough P E enjoys great popularity among value investors  a more complicated metric called EV EBITDA is sometimes viewed as a better alternative  EV EBITDA  also referred to as the enterprise multiple  gives the true picture of a company s valuation and earning potential  Additionally  it has a more comprehensive approach to valuation   EV EBITDA is essentially the enterprise value  EV  of a stock divided by its earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  EBITDA   EV is the sum of a company s market capitalization  its debt and preferred stock minus cash and cash equivalents  In a nutshell  it is the total value of a company The other element of the multiple  EBITDA  gives a clearer picture of a company s profitability as it removes the impact of non cash expenses like depreciation and amortization that depress net earnings  It is also often used as a proxy for cash flows Usually  the lower the EV EBITDA ratio  the more attractive it is  A low EV EBITDA ratio could signal that a stock is potentially undervalued    EV EBITDA takes into account the debt on a company s balance sheet that P E ratio does not  Given this reason  EV EBITDA is usually used to value possible acquisition targets  Stocks with a low EV EBITDA multiple could be seen as potential takeover candidates Moreover  P E can t be used to value a loss making firm  A firm s earnings are also subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation  On the other hand  EV EBITDA is difficult to manipulate and can also be used to value companies that are making loss but are  is also a useful yardstick in assessing the value of firms that are highly leveraged and have a high degree of depreciation  It can also be used to compare companies with different levels of debt However  EV EBITDA has its limitations too  It varies across industries and is generally not appropriate while comparing stocks in different industries given their diverse capital spending requirements Hence  instead of solely relying on EV EBITDA  you can club it with the other key ratios such as price to book  P B   P E and price to sales  P S  to achieve the desired outcome  Screening CriteriaHere are the parameters to screen for value stocks EV EBITDA 12 Months Most Recent less than X Industry Median  A lower EV EBITDA ratio represents a cheaper valuation P E using  F1  less than X Industry Median  This metric screens stocks that are trading at a discount to their peers P B less than X Industry Median  A lower P B compared with the industry average implies that the stock is undervalued P S less than X Industry Median  The lower the P S ratio the more attractive the stock is as investors will have to pay a smaller price for the same amount of sales generated by the company Estimated One Year EPS Growth F 1  F 0  greater than or equal to X Industry Median  This parameter will help in screening stocks that have growth rates higher than the industry median  This is a meaningful indicator as decent earnings growth always adds to investor optimism Average 20 day Volume greater than or equal to 100 000  The addition of this metric ensures that shares can be traded easily Current Price greater than or equal to  5  This parameter will help in screening stocks that are trading at a minimum price of  5 or higher Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  No screening is complete without the Zacks Rank  which has proven its worth since inception  It is a fundamental truth that stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  have always managed to beat adversities and outperform the market  of less than or equal to B  Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 offer the best

125267,346782,AMKR,Mid Caps Rally In 2019  5 Picks That Still Have Momentum,opinion,Wall Street started 2019 with a lot of vigor  quickly erasing the loss it suffered in 2018  The momentum is continuing barring some short term fluctuations  The U S  economy is in good shape with a robust labor market  higher consumer spending and better than expected corporate profits  The U S  GDP in the first three quarters of 2019 also surpassed expectations despite the fact that the economy is growing for the historically longest span of 11th years Positive development on the U S  China trade war front and a 75 basis point cut in the benchmark interest rate in three tranches by the Fed also boosted investors  sentiment  Consequently  the major stock indexes      the Dow  the S P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite      have gained 20 1   24 5  and 28 7   respectively  year to date  Notably  aside from these three large cap centric indexes  the S P 400 Mid cap Index  SP400  has also rallied 20 7  year to date Expectation of a Partial Trade DealOn Nov 15  White House Economic Advisor Larry Kudlow said that the United States and China were close to a deal  Per Kudlow  the current negotiations are   very constructive   Moreover  on Nov 16  Chinese Ministry of Commerce also confirmed that vice premier Liu He had a telephonic discussion with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and U S  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer about a phase one trade deal  The two sides agreed to remain in close contact to find out an amicable solution This was preceded by President Donald Trump s speech at the Economic Club of New York on Nov 12  wherein a U S  China trade deal was suggested  could happen soon   Trump added that a phase one agreement is  close  However  on Nov 13  The Wall Street Journal reported that the deadlock in the trade related negotiation prevails  regarding the withdrawal of U S  tariffs on Chinese goods and China s earlier commitment to purchase  50 billion agricultural products from the United States  The Chinese administration has also been resisting requests from the White House to curb the forceful transfer of intellectual properties as well as enforcement mechanisms Why Mid Cap Stocks Investment in mid cap stocks is often recognized as a good portfolio diversification strategy  These stocks combine attractive attributes of both small and large cap stocks  If the trade deal breaks down  mid cap stocks will be less susceptible to losses than their large cap counterparts owing to less international exposure However  if the trade deal finally sees the light of the day  these stocks will gain higher than small caps due to established management teams  a broad distribution network  brand recognition and ready access to capital markets Our Top PicksWe have been able to narrow down our search to five mid cap stocks  which have skyrocketed in 2019 and still hold potential  All five stocks are currently priced below  15  making

125268,346783,AMKR,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  Navient  Amkor Technology  Frontline  Newmark And Vector Group,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   November 19  2019   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  Navient Corp    NASDAQ NAVI    Amkor Technology Inc    NASDAQ AMKR    Frontline Ltd    NYSE FRO    Newmark Group Inc    NASDAQ NMRK   and Vector Group Ltd    NYSE VGR   Here are highlights from Monday s Analyst Blog  Mid Caps Rally in 2019  5 Picks that Still Have MomentumWall Street started 2019 with a lot of vigor  quickly erasing the loss it suffered in 2018  The momentum is continuing barring some short term fluctuations  The U S  economy is in good shape with a robust labor market  higher consumer spending and better than expected corporate profits  The U S  GDP in the first three quarters of 2019 also surpassed expectations despite the fact that the economy is growing for the historically longest span of 11th years Positive development on the U S  China trade war front and a 75 basis point cut in the benchmark interest rate in three tranches by the Fed also boosted investors  sentiment  Consequently  the major stock indexes      the Dow  the S P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite      have gained 20 1   24 5  and 28 7   respectively  year to date  Notably  aside from these three large cap centric indexes  the S P 400 Mid cap Index  SP400  has also rallied 20 7  year to date Expectation of a Partial Trade DealOn Nov 15  White House Economic Advisor Larry Kudlow said that the United States and China were close to a deal  Per Kudlow  the current negotiations are   very constructive   Moreover  on Nov 16  Chinese Ministry of Commerce also confirmed that vice premier Liu He had a telephonic discussion with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and U S  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer about a phase one trade deal  The two sides agreed to remain in close contact to find out an amicable solution This was preceded by President Donald Trump s speech at the Economic Club of New York on Nov 12  wherein a U S  China trade deal was suggested  could happen soon   Trump added that a phase one agreement is  close  However  on Nov 13  The Wall Street Journal reported that the deadlock in the trade related negotiation prevails  regarding the withdrawal of U S  tariffs on Chinese goods and China s earlier commitment to purchase  50 billion agricultural products from the United States  The Chinese administration has also been resisting requests from the White House to curb the forceful transfer of intellectual properties as well as enforcement mechanisms Why Mid Cap Stocks Investment in mid cap stocks is often recognized as a good portfolio diversification strategy  These stocks combine attractive attributes of both small and large cap stocks  If the trade deal breaks down  mid cap stocks will be less susceptible to losses than their large cap counterparts owing to less international exposure However  if the trade deal finally sees the light of the day  these stocks will gain higher than small caps due to established management teams  a broad distribution network  brand recognition and ready access to capital markets Our Top PicksWe have been able to narrow down our search to five mid cap stocks  which have skyrocketed in 2019 and still hold potential  All five stocks are currently priced below  15  making

125338,346853,AMKR,5 Value Stocks With Alluring EV EBITDA Ratios To Own Now,opinion,The price to earnings  P E  ratio is widely considered by investors as a yardstick for evaluating the fair market value of a stock  Many value investors prefer to take the P E route in their pursuit for stocks that are trading at a bargain  But even this straightforward  easy to calculate multiple has a few pitfalls Is EV EBITDA a Better Substitute to P E While P E enjoys great popularity  a less used metric called EV EBITDA gains an upper hand as it offers a clearer picture of a company s valuation and earnings potential  EV EBITDA  also known as the enterprise multiple  has a more complete approach to valuation as it determines a firm s total value  P E  on the other hand  considers only its equity  is the enterprise value  EV  of a stock divided by its earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  EBITDA   EV is the sum of a company s market capitalization  its debt and preferred stock minus cash and cash equivalents  In a nutshell  it is the entire value of a company The other constituent of the ratio  EBITDA is a true reflection of a company s profitability as it strips out non cash expenses like depreciation and amortization that dilute net earnings  It is also often used as a proxy for cash flows Usually  the lower the EV EBITDA ratio  the more enticing it is  A low EV EBITDA ratio could signal that a stock is potentially undervalued   However  unlike P E ratio  EV EBITDA takes into account the debt on a company s balance sheet  For this reason  EV EBITDA is usually used to value possible acquisition targets  Stocks with a low EV EBITDA multiple could be seen as potential takeover candidates Another drawback of P E is that it can t be used to value a loss making company  A company s earnings are also subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation  On the other hand  EV EBITDA is difficult to manipulate and can also be used to value companies that are making loss but are  is also a useful tool in measuring the value of firms that are highly leveraged and have a high degree of depreciation  Moreover  the ratio allows the comparison of companies with different debt levels Then again  EV EBITDA has its flaws too  It varies across industries  a high growth industry normally has higher multiple and vice versa  and is typically not appropriate while comparing stocks in different industries given their diverse capital expenditure requirements As such  instead of just banking on EV EBITDA  you can combine it with the other major ratios such as price to book  P B   P E and price to sales  P S  to screen true value stocks Screening CriteriaHere are the parameters to screen for value stocks EV EBITDA 12 Months Most Recent less than X Industry Median  A lower EV EBITDA ratio represents a cheaper valuation P E using  F1  less than X Industry Median  This metric screens stocks that are trading at a discount to their peers P B less than X Industry Median  A lower P B compared with the industry average implies that the stock is undervalued P S less than X Industry Median  The lower the P S ratio the more attractive the stock is as investors will have to pay a smaller price for the same amount of sales generated by the company Estimated One Year EPS Growth F 1  F 0  greater than or equal to X Industry Median  This parameter will help in screening stocks that have growth rates higher than the industry median  This is a meaningful indicator as decent earnings growth always adds to investor optimism Average 20 day Volume greater than or equal to 100 000  The addition of this metric ensures that shares can be traded easily Current Price greater than or equal to  5  This parameter will help in screening stocks that are trading at a minimum price of  5 or higher Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  No screening is complete without the Zacks Rank  which has proven its worth since inception  It is a fundamental truth that stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  have always managed to beat adversities and outperform the market  of less than or equal to B  Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 offer the best upside potential Here are five of the 13 stocks that passed the screen Tech Data Corporation   NASDAQ TECD

125339,346854,AMKR,Zacks com Featured Highlights Include  Tech Data  Graphic Packaging  Newell  Amkor And Colfax,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   January 16  2019   Stocks in this week s article are Tech Data Corp    NASDAQ TECD    Graphic Packaging Holding Co    NYSE GPK    Newell Brands Inc    NASDAQ NWL    Amkor Technology  Inc    NASDAQ AMKR   and Colfax Corp    NYSE CFX   5 Value Stocks with Alluring EV EBITDA Ratios to Own NowThe price to earnings  P E  ratio is widely considered by investors as a yardstick for evaluating the fair market value of a stock  Many value investors prefer to take the P E route in their pursuit for stocks that are trading at a bargain  But even this straightforward  easy to calculate multiple has a few pitfalls Is EV EBITDA a Better Substitute to P E While P E enjoys great popularity  a less used metric called EV EBITDA gains an upper hand as it offers a clearer picture of a company s valuation and earnings potential  EV EBITDA  also known as the enterprise multiple  has a more complete approach to valuation as it determines a firm s total value  P E  on the other hand  considers only its equity  is the enterprise value  EV  of a stock divided by its earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  EBITDA   EV is the sum of a company s market capitalization  its debt and preferred stock minus cash and cash equivalents  In a nutshell  it is the entire value of a company The other constituent of the ratio  EBITDA is a true reflection of a company s profitability as it strips out non cash expenses like depreciation and amortization that dilute net earnings  It is also often used as a proxy for cash flows Usually  the lower the EV EBITDA ratio  the more enticing it is  A low EV EBITDA ratio could signal that a stock is potentially undervalued   However  unlike P E ratio  EV EBITDA takes into account the debt on a company s balance sheet  For this reason  EV EBITDA is usually used to value possible acquisition targets  Stocks with a low EV EBITDA multiple could be seen as potential takeover candidates Another drawback of P E is that it can t be used to value a loss making company  A company s earnings are also subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation  On the other hand  EV EBITDA is difficult to manipulate and can also be used to value companies that are making loss but are  is also a useful tool in measuring the value of firms that are highly leveraged and have a high degree of depreciation  Moreover  the ratio allows the comparison of companies with different debt levels Then again  EV EBITDA has its flaws too  It varies across industries  a high growth industry normally has higher multiple and vice versa  and is typically not appropriate while comparing stocks in different industries given their diverse capital expenditure requirements As such  instead of just banking on EV EBITDA  you can combine it with the other major ratios such as price to book  P B   P E and price to sales  P S  to screen true value stocks For the rest of this Screen of the Week article please visit Zacks com at  Disclosure  Officers  directors and or employees of Zacks Investment

125365,346880,AMKR,Amkor Technology  Is AMKR A Good Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Amkor Technology  Inc    NASDAQ AMKR   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Amkor Technology has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 14 7  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 7  While Amkor Technology s current PE level puts it above its midpoint of 11 6 over the past five years  the current level stands significantly lower than the highs for the stock  suggesting that it could be a solid entry point Further  the stock s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Computer   Technology sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 22 6  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Amkor Technology has a P S ratio of about 0 7  This is much lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 4 right now  Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Amkor Technology currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Amkor Technology a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  for Amkor Technology is just 3 6  a level that is far lower than the industry average of 15 6  The Clearly  AMKR is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Amkor Technology might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of B and a Momentum Score of D  This gives AMKR a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been slightly discouraging as both the current quarter and full year estimates have seen one downward revision each in the past 60 days  compared with no upward revisions in the same time frame This has had a negative impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has tumbled 20 8  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched lower by 3 8   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Amkor Technology  Inc  Price and Consensus    Given these bearish trends  the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  which indicates why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineAmkor Technology is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Despite having a Zacks Rank  3  the stock belongs to an industry which is ranked among the Top 44  of more than 250 industries  which indicates that broader factors are favorable for the company  Further  over the past two years  the industry has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below  So  value investors might want to wait for estimates to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply  one company stands out as the  1 stock to buy according to Zacks research It s not the one you think ,2017-11-12,Zacks Investment

125422,346937,AMKR,Despite Earnings Beat  Ambarella  AMBA  Stock Tumbles On Weak Guidance,opinion,"Shares of semiconductor maker Ambarella Inc    NASDAQ AMBA   fell nearly 10 5  in morning trading today after the company released its third quarter earnings report on Thursday  Although it did beat on both the top and bottom lines  Ambarella disappointed investors with its sluggish guidance 
For the third quarter  AMBA posted earnings of 84 cents per share  which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 68 cents per share handily  The company saw revenue figures of  100 5 million  which also beat our consensus estimate of  96 million  Total revenue was up 7 8  year over year 
Looking ahead to Q4  Ambarella expects revenue to be in the range of  84 million to  87 million  This comes in below our current consensus estimate of  88 43 million  The company noted that limited sales visibility and potentially high chip inventory levels were the reason for its caution 
It s also important to note that Ambarella still brings in about 30  of its revenue from GoPro   NASDAQ GPRO    Most investors will already be aware of the struggles faced by that company  but in case you didn t know  shares of GPRO are nearly 45  as demand for its action cameras continues to slip 
For now  Ambarella remains a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   and its relatively weak guidance is unlikely to spark much upward estimate revision activity  What was once one of the market s hottest stocks has become volatile and risky  and that may take AMBA out of play for many investors 
Nevertheless  the Electronics   Semiconductors business remains in the top 13  of the Zacks Industry Rank  which means that some of Ambarella s peers may still be solid picks  Investors should check out Amkor Technology   NASDAQ AMKR    Applied Optoelectronics   NASDAQ AAOI    Cirrus Logic   NASDAQ CRUS    NVE Corp   NASDAQ NVEC    and On Track Innovations   NASDAQ OTIV    All of these stocks currently hold a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy

AMBA Guidance Disappoints
For the third quarter  AMBA posted earnings of 84 cents per share  which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 68 cents per share handily  The company saw revenue figures of  100 5 million  which also beat our consensus estimate of  96 million  Total revenue was up 7 8  year over year

Other Semiconductors to Pick
Luckily for investors interested in semiconductors  the  Electronics   Semiconductors  business that AMBA falls into is still home to several strong stocks and currently sits in the top 13  of the Zacks Industry Rank 
One stock to look at would be Applied Optoelectronics   NASDAQ AAOI    This semiconductor maker is currently a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  thanks to its impressive earnings related metrics  Its current quarter Zacks Consensus Estimate has gained 17 cents over the last 30 days  and our current figures indicate that the company could post EPS growth of 131 58  on revenue growth of 45 77  this quarter 
Investors should also check out Amkor Technology   NASDAQ AMKR    Thanks to its  A  grades for Value and Growth  Amkor has earned an overall VGM grade of  A   Additionally  the company has seen its current quarter and next quarter Zacks Consensus Estimates gain four cents and seven cents  respectively  over the past 60 days 
Finally  another solid semiconductor pick right now could be Cirrus Logic   NASDAQ CRUS    This company has seen massive estimate revision over the past 60 days  with its current quarter Zacks Consensus Estimate gaining 42 cents in that period  Also  we expect Cirrus to impressive growth this quarter  our current consensus estimates would represent EPS growth of 118 57  on revenue growth of 42 43  
Bottom Line
Although Ambarella was once one of the hottest stocks in the semiconductor industry  it may be a bit too volatile and risky for some investors right now  Nevertheless  plenty of solid semiconductor stocks still exist  and interested investors should definitely check these three out

125426,346941,AMKR,5 Bargain Stocks With Strikingly Low EV EBITDA Ratios,opinion,Investors typically have a fixation for the price to earnings  P E  strategy in their quest for stocks that are trading at bargain prices  Without doubt  P E is the most popular metric for working out the fair market value of a stock  However  even this widely used valuation multiple is not devoid of shortcomings What Makes EV EBITDA a Better Alternative The popularity of P E stems from its simplicity  However  a more complicated and less used metric called EV EBITDA is often viewed as a better alternative as it offers a clearer picture of a company s valuation and earnings potential  EV EBITDA has a more complete approach to valuation as it determines a firm s total value  In contrast  P E just considers a firm s equity portion Also referred to as the enterprise multiple  EV EBITDA is the enterprise value  EV  of a stock divided by its earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  EBITDA   EV is the sum of a company s market capitalization  its debt and preferred stock minus cash and cash equivalents  Essentially  it is the full value of a company The other constituent  EBITDA  gives a better understanding of a company s profitability as it eliminates the impact of non cash expenses like depreciation and amortization that dilute net earnings  It is also often used as a proxy for cash flows Just like P E  the lower the EV EBITDA ratio  the more attractive it is  A low EV EBITDA ratio could signal that a stock is potentially  takes debt on a company s balance sheet into account that P E does not  Due to this reason  EV EBITDA is typically used to value possible acquisition targets  as it shows the amount of debt the acquirer has to assume  Companies with a low EV EBITDA multiple could be seen as attractive takeover candidates Another key drawback of P E is that it can t be used to value a loss making firm  A company s earnings are also subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation  In comparison  EV EBITDA is less amenable to manipulation and can also be used to value firms that have negative net earnings but are positive on the EBITDA  is also a useful tool in measuring the value of companies that are highly leveraged and have a high degree of depreciation  Moreover  the ratio allows the comparison of companies with different debt levels However  EV EBITDA is also not without its downsides and alone can t conclusively determine a stock s inherent potential and future performance  The multiple varies across industries  a high growth industry generally has higher multiple  and is usually not appropriate while comparing stocks in different industries given their diverse capital requirements Thus  instead of solely relying on EV EBITDA  you can combine it with the other key ratios such as price to book  P B   P E and price to sales  P S  to achieve the desired outcome  Screening CriteriaHere are the parameters to screen for bargain stocks EV EBITDA 12 Months Most Recent less than X Industry Median  A lower EV EBITDA ratio represents a cheaper valuation P E using  F1  less than X Industry Median  This metric screens stocks that are trading at a discount to their peers P B less than X Industry Median  A lower P B compared with the industry average implies that the stock is undervalued P S less than X Industry Median  The lower the P S ratio the more attractive the stock is as investors will have to pay a smaller price for the same amount of sales generated by the company Estimated One Year EPS Growth F 1  F 0  greater than or equal to X Industry Median  This parameter will help in screening stocks that have growth rates higher than the industry median  This is a meaningful indicator as decent earnings growth always adds to investor optimism Average 20 day Volume greater than or equal to 100 000  The addition of this metric ensures that shares can be traded easily Current Price greater than or equal to  5  This parameter will help in screening stocks that are trading at a minimum price of  5 or higher Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  No screening is complete without the Zacks Rank  which has proven its worth since inception  It is a fundamental truth that stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  have always managed to beat adversities and outperform the market  of less than or equal to B  Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of  A  or  B  when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 offer the best upside potential Here are five of the 12 stocks that passed the

AMKR Technical Analysis

AMKR opened trading yesterday at  10 08  which was up from the previous day s trading close of  9 97  Shares closed trading yesterday at  10 44 and spiked down after market to  9 29  equivalent to a 11  decrease from the closing price  Taking a look at the daily chart we can see that the last time AMKR traded below these levels we have to go back to October 31  2016 when it traded at  9 27 
Taking a closer look at the daily chart we can see that before the spike down AMKR had already been in an overall downward trend dating back to November 21st  2016 when it traded at  12 32  AMKR has a float of 109 27 million shares and traded 2 53 times the normal daily trading volume on Monday  For trading purposes  I would like to see AMKR open trading on Tuesday below  9 70 and if it does I would be looking to take a short position at the bell  My stop loss would be  0 20 from my entry position fearing anything more than that and the stock would start to fill in the gap down

125450,346965,AMKR,Top 5 Stocks With Impressive Relative Price Strength,opinion,Earnings growth and valuation multiples are indeed important for investors to determine a stock s ability to offer considerable returns  But these are also essential in determining whether a stock s price performance is better than its peers or the industry average If the stock s performance is lacking that of the

125472,346987,AMKR,7 High Flying Stocks With Strong Upside Potential,opinion,It is hard to ignore stocks that scale 52 week highs or hit the lows as such movements are tracked on a daily basis  Now  the question that looms large is the importance of such news for investors Betting on a stock near its 52 week high has its own share of risks as there is a possibility of it scaling higher or going downhill without any warning  At best  52 week investments can be best described as a touch and go strategy which can definitely lead to handsome rewards  but only in conjunction with a particular set of parameters While market gurus may be divided in their opinion regarding the 52 week high investment technique  many academicians believe that undervalued 52 week high stocks are lucrative  bets An Insight into 52 Week High StocksStocks nearing 52 week high often instill the presumptive  adjustment and anchoring bias  principle in the minds of investors  This principle works on the belief that investors use the 52 week high price as a reference point and value stocks against this anchor Many a times such stocks are prevented from scaling higher despite robust potential  due to the psychological bias of investors who fear that the stocks are overvalued and a price crash is impending A few of the stocks remain undervalued due to prolonged under reaction on part of investors despite bullish growth drivers  Meanwhile  news pertaining to robust sales  surging profit levels  bullish earnings prospects and strategic acquisitions can drive the stock higher However  when a string of positive developments start dominating the market  investors find their under reaction unwarranted and the renewed interest might drive stocks beyond the 52 week high bar  Wall Street s fast paced trading makes it imperative for investors to step in before the market gets a whiff of it Also  recent academic research reveals that if a stock s current price is near its 52 week high  there are high chances it will outperform peers in the subsequent period   According to researchers George and Hwang  holding 52 week high stocks for six months has resulted in an average monthly gain of 0 45  between 1963 and 2001  Encouragingly  this is twice the gain that can be garnered from similar momentum based strategies Setting the Right FiltersOur time tested screening technique has been deployed to find 52 week high stocks that hold tremendous potential compared to their respective industries  The added parameters are strong earnings growth expectations  sturdy value metrics and positive price momentum These stocks are relatively undervalued compared to their peers  in terms of earnings as well as sales  which make us believe that they will continue their rally for quite some time Current Price 52 Week High     80This simply is the ratio between the current price and the highest price at which the stock has traded in the past 52 weeks  A value greater than 0 8 implies that the stock is trading within 20  of its 52 week high range and is likely to touch the 52 week high mark soon   Change Price   4 Weeks   0It ensures that the stock price has moved north over the past four weeks   Change Price   12 Weeks   0This metric guarantees a continued upward price momentum for the stock over the past three months as well Price Sales    XIndMedLower the ratio  the better P E

125473,346988,AMKR,5 Stocks With Amazingly Low EV EBITDA Ratios To Buy Now,opinion,Many investors tend to get fixated on the price to earnings  P E  strategy while seeking stocks that are trading at attractive prices  Without doubt  P E is the most popular multiple used by investors for working out the fair market value of a stock  But even this widely used valuation metric is not devoid of limitations Why EV EBITDA is a Better Approach While P E is the most popular valuation metric  a more complicated multiple called EV EBITDA works even better  Often considered a better alternative to P E  it gives the true picture of a company s valuation and its earning potential and has a more complete approach to valuation  While P E just considers a firm s equity portion  EV EBITDA determines its total value Also known as the enterprise multiple  EV EBITDA is essentially the enterprise value  EV  of a stock divided by its earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  EBITDA   The first constituent of the ratio  EV  is a firm s market capitalization plus the market value of its debt and preferred equity minus cash The other constituent  EBITDA  gives a clearer picture of a company s profitability as it removes the impact of non cash expenses like depreciation and amortization that depress net earnings  It is also often used as a proxy for cash flows Typically  the lower the EV EBITDA ratio  the more appealing it is  A low EV EBITDA ratio could signal that a stock is undervalued Unlike the P E ratio  EV EBITDA takes debt on a company s balance sheet into account  Due to this reason  it is typically used to value potential acquisition targets  The ratio shows the amount of debt that the acquirer has to bear  Stocks flaunting a low EV EBITDA multiple could be seen as attractive takeover candidates Another key downside of P E is that it can t be used to value a loss making entity  Moreover  a company s earnings are also subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation  In contrast  EV EBITDA is harder to manipulate and can also be used to value companies that have negative net earnings but are positive on the EBITDA  is also a useful tool in measuring the value of companies that are highly leveraged and have a high degree of depreciation  It also allows the comparison of companies with different debt levels However  EV EBITDA is also not without its shortcomings and it alone can t conclusively determine a stock s inherent potential and its future performance  The multiple varies across industries  a high growth industry typically has higher multiple  and is generally not appropriate for comparing stocks in different industries due to their diverse capital requirements Thus  instead of solely banking on EV EBITDA  you can club it with other key ratios in your stock investment toolkit such as price to book  P B   P E and price to sales  P S  to uncover bargain stocks Screening CriteriaHere are the parameters to screen for value stocks EV EBITDA 12 Months Most Recent less than X Industry Median  A lower EV EBITDA ratio represents a cheaper valuation P E using  F1  less than X Industry Median  This metric screens stocks that are trading at a discount to their peers P B less than X Industry Median  A lower P B compared with the industry average implies that the stock is undervalued P S less than X Industry Median  The lower the P S ratio the more attractive the stock is as investors will have to pay a smaller price for the same amount of sales generated by the company Estimated One Year EPS Growth F 1  F 0  greater than or equal to X Industry Median  This parameter will help in screening stocks that have growth rates higher than the industry median  This is a meaningful indicator as decent earnings growth always adds to investor optimism Average 20 day Volume greater than or equal to 100 000  The addition of this metric ensures that shares can be traded easily Current Price greater than or equal to  5  This parameter will help in screening stocks that are trading at a minimum price of  5 or higher Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  No screening is complete without the

125474,346989,AMKR,7 Stocks Near 52 Week Highs Worth Betting On ,opinion,"Over the past few decades  the investment vehicles and strategies available to investors have increased drastically  Sometimes the wide number of choices can baffle seasoned investors  let alone new ones who are planning to enter the uncharted world of jam packed trades with the hope of making some fast bucks  Each strategy comes with its own share of risks and benefits and requires investors to exercise reasonable caution before it can be pursued The task of singling out one particular strategy can be quite daunting  Thanks to our investment screens  investors can now save on time and make prudent choices to create a solid portfolio  In this screening article  we discuss a particular approach which advises investors to bet on stocks that have scaled to 52 week highs This particular strategy is designed on the philosophy of  buy high and sell higher  that challenges the old school doctrine of  buy low and sell high   Though skeptics may raise a brow on the mettle of this 52 week high investment strategy  we believe that this time tested strategy  when clubbed with the right set of parameters  will help rack up sizable gains An Insight into 52 Week High StocksStocks nearing 52 week high often instill the presumptive  adjustment and anchoring bias  principle in the minds of investors  This principle works on the belief that investors use the 52 week high price as a reference point and value stocks against this anchor Many a times such stocks are prevented from scaling higher despite robust potential  due to the psychological bias of investors who fear that the stocks are overvalued and a price crash is impending A few of the stocks remain undervalued due to prolonged under reaction on part of investors  despite bullish growth drivers  Meanwhile  news pertaining to robust sales  surging profit levels  bullish earnings prospects and strategic acquisitions can drive the stock higher However  when a string of positive developments start dominating the market  investors find their under reaction unwarranted and the renewed interest might drive stocks beyond the 52 week high bar  Wall Street s fast paced trading makes it imperative for investors to step in before the market gets a whiff of it Also  recent academic research reveals that if a stock s current price is near its 52 week high  there are high chances it will outperform peers in the subsequent period   According to researchers George and Hwang  holding 52 week high stocks for six months has resulted in an average monthly gain of 0 45  between 1963 and 2001  Encouragingly  this is twice the gain that can be garnered from similar momentum based strategies Setting the Right FiltersOur diligent screening technique has been deployed to find 52 week high stocks that hold tremendous potential compared to their respective industries  The added parameters are strong earnings growth expectations  sturdy value metrics and positive price momentum These stocks are relatively undervalued compared to their peers  in terms of earnings as well as sales  which make us believe that they will continue their rally for quite some time Current Price 52 Week High     80This simply is the ratio between the current price and the highest price at which the stock has traded in the past 52 weeks  A value greater than 0 8 implies that the stock is trading within 20  of its 52 week high range and is likely to touch the 52 week high mark soon   Change Price   4 Weeks   0It ensures that the stock price has moved north over the past four weeks   Change Price   12 Weeks   0This metric guarantees a continued upward price momentum for the stock over the past three months as well Price Sales    XIndMedLower the ratio  the better P E using F 1  Estimate    XIndMedThis metric measures the amount an investor puts into a company to obtain one dollar of earnings  It narrows down the list of stocks to those that are undervalued compared to their peers One Year EPS Growth F 1  F 0     XIndMedThis metric helps choose stocks that have higher growth rates than the industry median  This is a meaningful indicator as decent earnings growth adds to investor optimism Zacks Rank   1No screening is complete without our proven Zacks Rank  which has proved its worth since inception  It is a

125503,347018,AMKR,7 High Flying Stocks With More Room To Run,opinion,It is true that relying on stock screeners can be a potent technique to make most of the market trends and compound returns  However  there is no one single rule or a crystal ball that can help one pick winners in the finance universe A particular strategy advises investors to gamble on stocks that have scaled to 52 week highs  While very few may deem it to be rational to invest in a stock which is going up  the trick is to discover soaring stocks that are still undervalued with strong upside potential   This is where our screener comes into play as it helps you to set the correct parameters with the 52 week high criteria Why Bet on Stocks at 52 Week Highs Stocks nearing 52 week high often instill the presumptive  adjustment and anchoring bias  principle in the minds of investors  This principle works on the belief that investors use the 52 week high price as a reference point and value stocks against this anchor  They fear that the stocks are overvalued and a price crash is impending  Thus  their psychological bias prevents them from adding positions on such stocks In such a situation  these stocks are prevented from scaling higher despite robust potential  due to the psychological reservations of investors It takes thorough understanding to tell diamonds from ordinary pebbles  and a few of the stocks remain undervalued due to prolonged under reaction on the part of investors  despite bullish growth drivers  News pertaining to robust sales  surging profit levels  bullish earnings prospects and strategic acquisitions can drive the stock higher However  when a string of positive developments start dominating the market  investors find their under reaction unwarranted as the renewed interest might push stocks beyond the 52 week high bar  Thus  the trick is to get into the betting game before everyone else Setting the Right FiltersMake no mistake  52 week high stocks have their own share of pitfalls  which might prove perilous  Relying on ad hoc strategies and following price movements blindly carry great risk Using our reliable screening technique  we have singled out 52 week highs which still have strong prospects relative to their respective industries  Positive momentum in the stock price blended with strong earnings growth expectations and great value metrics  we believe these stocks will continue their uptrend for quite some time We have also made sure these stocks are relatively undervalued compared to their peers  in terms of earnings as well as sales Current Price 52 Week High     80This simply is the ratio between the current price and the highest price at which the stock has traded in the past 52 weeks  A value greater than 0 8 implies that the stock is trading within 20  of its 52 week high range and is likely to touch the 52 week mark soon   Change Price   4 Weeks   0It ensures that the price of the stock has moved north over the past four weeks   Change Price   12 Weeks   0This metric guarantees a continued upward price momentum for the stock over the past three months as well Price Sales    XIndMedLower the ratio  the better for investors as they have to pay lesser price for the same amount of sales P E using F 1  Estimate    XIndMedThis metric measures the amount an investor puts into a company to obtain one dollar of

125523,347038,AMKR,5 Stocks With Strikingly Low EV EBITDA Ratios To Buy Now,opinion,Price to earnings  P E  is by far the most popular metric used by investors to work out the fair value of a stock  Many prefer to take the P E route in their pursuit of a portfolio of stocks with attractive prices  In fact  the idea of chasing stocks with a low P E is ingrained in the minds of many value investors  However  even this easy to compute  widely used metric is not without its  is a Better Approach  Here s WhyNo doubt P E enjoys great popularity among value inventors  But a more complicated and less used metric called EV EBITDA is sometimes viewed as a better alternative as it offers a clearer picture of a firm s valuation and its earnings  is the enterprise value   EV   of a stock divided by its earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization   EBITDA    EV is the sum of a company s market capitalization  its debt and preferred stock minus cash and cash equivalents  Essentially  it is the entire value of a company EBITDA  the other component of the ratio  gives the true picture of a company s profitability as it removes the impact of non cash expenses like depreciation and amortization that depress net earnings  It is also often used as a proxy for cash flows Usually  the lower the EV EBITDA ratio  the more appealing it is  A low EV EBITDA ratio could imply that a stock is potentially undervalued and vice versa Also referred to as the enterprise multiple  EV EBITDA takes a more complete approach to valuation  It takes into account the debt on a company s balance sheet that P E ratio ignores  This is the reason why EV EBITDA is typically used to value potential acquisition targets  It shows the amount of debt the acquirer has to bear  Stocks boasting a low EV EBITDA multiple could be seen as attractive takeover candidates Another flaw of P E is that it can t be used to value a loss making firm  Moreover  a company s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation  On the contrary  EV EBITDA is less susceptible to manipulation and can also be used to value firms that have negative net earnings but are positive at the EBITDA  also determines the total value of a company while P E solely considers its equity portion  EV EBITDA is also a useful tool in measuring the value of companies with highly leveraged balance sheets and substantial depreciation and amortization expenses  It also can be used to compare companies with different levels of debt However  EV EBITDA is too not devoid of drawbacks  The ratio varies across industries  a high growth industry typically has higher multiple  and is usually not appropriate for comparing stocks in different industries due to their diverse capital expenditure requirements So  instead of solely banking on EV EBITDA  you can combine it with the other major ratios such as price to book  P B   P E and price to sales  P S  to achieve the desired outcome Screening CriteriaHere are the parameters to screen for value stocks EV EBITDA 12 Months Most Recent less than X Industry Median  A lower EV EBITDA ratio represents a cheaper valuation P E using  F1  less than X Industry Median  This metric screens stocks that are trading at a discount to their peers P B less than X Industry Median  A lower P B compared with the industry average implies that the stock is undervalued P S less than X Industry Median  The lower the P S ratio the more attractive the stock is as investors will have to pay a smaller price for the same amount of sales generated by the company Estimated One Year EPS Growth F 1  F 0  greater than or equal to X Industry Median  This parameter will help in screening stocks that have growth rates higher than the industry median  This is a meaningful indicator as decent earnings growth always adds to investor optimism Average 20 day Volume greater than or equal to 100 000  The addition of this metric ensures that shares can be traded easily Current Price greater than or equal to  5  This parameter will help in screening stocks that are trading at a minimum price of  5 or higher Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  No screening is complete without the Zacks Rank  which has proven its worth since inception  It is a fundamental truth that stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy  have always managed to

125544,347059,AMKR,HP Inc  HPQ  Stock Volatile In After Hours Trading  Here s Why,opinion,Shares of HP Inc    NYSE HPQ   became highly volatile in after hours trading session yesterday due to two major announcements  First  the company announced a raised outlook for third quarter fiscal 2016 earnings to reflect the recent spin off of its Marketing Optimization assets to Open Text Corporation   NASDAQ OTEX   The company now expects non GAAP earnings in the range of 43 cents to 46 cents per share  up from its previous expectations of 37 40 cents  On a GAAP basis  earnings are now expected to be 40 cents to 43 cents per share  compared to the prior guidance of 34 37 cents However  the company kept its fiscal 2016 earnings outlook unchanged  We remind investors that the previous guidance was provided only a month ago  along with it the company s second quarter fiscal 2016 earnings release Investors reacted positively to the news  pushing the world s leading PC manufacturer s shares up over 5  during after hours trading  as per the NASDAQ after hours trading data However  soon after the announcement of a raised guidance  the company disclosed plans of reducing global inventories of ink and toner with distributors  According to the company s Chief Financial Officer  CFO  Catherine Lesjak  this decision will result a revenue loss of about  450 million over two quarters This did not go down well with investors  which was reflected by an approximate 3  fall in the company s shares  which offset the gain from the previous announcement HP INC Price   Since its split from Hewlett Packard Company last November  HP has been striving to stabilize declining sales and eroding profits through a series of restructuring initiatives  The company has been witnessing a secular decline in demand for PC and printers due to the ongoing shift toward tablets and smartphones   a space where it is yet to gain foothold Therefore  HP is now focusing on product innovations to give a boost to its revenues and is cutting jobs as part of its restructuring plan to lower costs  Post the split from the parent company  HP announced its decision to accelerate the restructuring plan by reducing its total headcount by 3 000 by the end of fiscal 2016 and by expediting streamlining processes Its streamlining efforts include the spin off of its non core assets  In sync with this strategy  the company recently divested a portfolio of assets  comprising content management software tools and Customer Communications Management  to Open Text in order to better focus on its PC and printing businesses Although the company s ongoing restructuring initiatives look promising  the recent decision to reduce global printer inventories at its distributors makes us a little cautious  We believe that this decision could lead to the company losing its market share in the space  as low availability of HP s products will surely make customers opt for its rival companies  products Currently  HP carries Zacks Rank  3  Hold   A couple of better ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Amkor Technology Inc    NASDAQ AMKR   and Facebook Inc    NASDAQ FB    both sporting a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  ,2016-06-21,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/hp-inc-(hpq)-stock-volatile-in-after-hours-trading:-here's-why-200137565,200137565

125553,347068,AMKR,What s In Store For Amkor Technology  AMKR  In Q2 Earnings ,opinion,"Amkor Technology  Inc    NASDAQ AMKR   is expected to report second quarter 2016 results on Jul 25  Last quarter  the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 100  
Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement AMKOR TECH INC Price and EPS Surprise   Factors to Consider
Amkor s first quarter results were in line with management expectations driven by positive cash flows resulting from reduction in capital and operational budgets 
During 2015  Amkor made noticeable progress in some of its key areas   The company s System in Package  SiP  business grew significantly fetching revenues of  725 million  Automotive sales were up 10   Furthermore  Greater China revenues grew 20  
In December last year  Amkor completed the acquisition of J Devices Corporation to strengthen its foothold in the automotive market  The acquisition made Amkor the world s largest OSAT provider for automotive ICs  Management said that the acquisition would add  800 million to the company s revenue this year 
While end market demand is expected to remain stable with particular strength in China where the company is picking up market share  earthquakes in Japan have disrupted operations at Amkor s Kumamoto factory  Repair work was expected to take 11 weeks  so results will also be affected this quarter 
The company expects second quarter revenues in the range of  875 million  Operating expenses are expected to remain at around  100 million  Interest expenses are expected to be around  22 million a quarter for the rest of the year 
The Japan earthquake will have a  35 million impact on revenue   20 million in additional cost related to repairs and damaged inventory and an 11 cent impact on second quarter EPS  But management also expects insurance proceeds of  25 million in the second half when it will be set off 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Amkor will beat on earnings this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at   8 cents  Hence  the difference is 0 00  
Zacks Rank  Amkor carries a Zacks Rank  2  which increases the predictive power of ESP  But the company s 0 00  ESP makes surprise prediction difficult 
We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
Stocks to Consider
Here are some companies which you may consider  as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter

125586,347101,AMKR,Infineon  IFNNY  Q2 Earnings Top  Stock Down On View Cut,opinion,"Semiconductor maker Infineon Technologies AG   OTC IFNNY   reported adjusted earnings per share   EPS   of  0 18  20 cents  in second quarter fiscal 2016 which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 18 cents by 11 1   Also  adjusted earnings were up 38 5  on a year over year basis 
Despite healthy profits and earnings  investors were miffed with the slashed guidance for full year 2016 revenues  This resulted in a 5 1  drop in share prices to  14 00 on Tuesday 
Meanwhile  the bottom line improvement came on the back of a decline in operating expenses  namely research   development and selling   administrative  and decent top line growth 
Inside the Headlines
Though revenues jumped 8 6  year over year to  1 611 million   1 776 8 million  in the quarter  it missed the consensus mark of  1816 million by 2 1    Decent performances by all the segments  especially the Automotive segment  drove the top line during the quarter  Surging demand for semiconductors in automotive and power markets has boosted sales for the company over the past few quarters 
Automotive   ATV   revenues increased 12 4  year over year to  670 million   738 9 million   Stringent environmental standards continue to trigger demand for electric and hybrid vehicles worldwide  thereby boosting growth at this segment  Meanwhile  sales in the quarter primarily benefitted from above average vehicle sales in all of Infineon s key markets   Europe  North America and China 
Industrial Power Control   IPC   revenues increased 10  year over year to  265 million   292 3 million  on higher demand for home applications based on renewable energy 
Power Management and Multi market   PMM   revenues increased 6 9  to  496 million   547 0 million   Stellar sales from cellular network infrastructure along with increased installation of charging stations in China  for AC DC conversion  proved conducive to the quarterly sales 
Revenues at the Chip Card and Security   CSS   segment dipped 1 1  to  180 million   198 5 million   While factors like rising demand of payment  government ID and security applications acted as a tailwind  seasonal factors offset sales in the authentication business  thereby causing the decline 
At the end of second quarter fiscal 2016  Infineon recorded operating income of  174 million compared with  232 million in the year ago quarter  Also  operating margin declined 480 basis points on a year over year basis 
Liquidity
Infineon s cash and cash equivalents were  606 million   688 1 million  of Mar 31  2016  down from  651 million as on Dec 31  2015  As of Mar 31  2016  the company s long term debt totaled  928 million   1 053 8 million   down from  1 779 million as on Dec 31  2015 
For the three months ended Mar 31  2016  the company had net cash from continuing operations of  195 million   221 4 million   up from  135 million as of Mar 31  2015 
Outlook
Infineon provided the third quarter fiscal 2016 guidance wherein revenues are expected to increase 2  with a possible deviation of plus or minus 2   whereas the segmental margin is predicted at 16   the mid point of the forecasted revenue range  
However  weakening of the U S  dollar has compelled the company to slash its full year fiscal 2016 outlook  much to the disappointment of the investors  Concurrent with the present macroeconomic scenario  revenues are expected to increase about 12   with a possible deviation of plus or minus 2   instead of the previous guidance of 13    Also  segmental margin is projected to grow in the range of 15  16  at the mid point of the forecasted revenue range 
Taking the weakening dollar into account  both outlooks are now based on an assumed exchange rate of US 1 15  initially assumed to be  1 10  for the second half of fiscal 2016 
For fiscal 2016  Infineon expects its PMM segment to perform the best  scoring higher than the group average  Based on the recent uptick in the automotive business  the company now expects its ATV segment to equal the group s average  initially expected to lag the group s average   While the IPC segment s performance is expected to be in line with the group  CSS is expected to perform lower than the group average 
Our Take
Infineon is experiencing steady growth  thanks to its business strategy which is aimed at providing efficient and reliable yet economical products  in order to address key global challenges such as mobility  energy efficiency and security  The company s strong foothold in the automotive and power markets is one of its major strengths  Going forward  we expect the company s focus on key strategic areas including demographic trends  demand for resources and connectivity   digitalization to help it capitalize on key market trends and beat competitors  Furthermore  growing demand for energy efficient products stemming from stringent government regulations also opens up tremendous scope for future growth 
Infineon currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Better ranked stocks in the industry include Amkor Technology  Inc    NASDAQ AMKR    AXT Inc    NASDAQ AXTI   and Silicon Motion Technology Corp    NASDAQ SIMO    All the three stocks sport a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy
