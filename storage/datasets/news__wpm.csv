100572,322087,WPM,Wheaton Precious Metals  WPM  To Post Q1 Earnings  What s Up ,opinion,Wheaton Precious Metals Corp    NYSE WPM   is set to release first quarter 2019 results on May 8  after the bell The stock has lost 2 1  in the past year compared with the  s 2  decline Some Factors at PlayIn February 2019  the company released full year 2019 guidance The company expects to produce roughly 365 000 ounces of gold  24 5 million ounces of silver and 22 000 ounces of palladium in 2019 Gold production in 2019 is likely to be lower than last year due to lower grades at Salobo  This is mainly because of mine sequencing  which is most pronounced in the first quarter of 2019  However  this is expected to be partly offset by higher attributable gold production from the San Dimas mine Also  the company expects palladium production to increase this year  In fourth quarter 2018 earnings call  management stated that recent acquisitions are expected to support gold and palladium production in the Stillwater mines Notably  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first quarter total revenues is currently pegged at  203 million  indicating a rise of roughly 2  from the year ago reported figure What the Zacks Model SaysOur proven model does not conclusively show that Wheaton Precious Metals is likely to beat estimates in the to be reported quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for an earnings beat  But that is not the case here  as you will see below Earnings ESP  Wheaton Precious Metals has an Earnings ESP of  4 00   The Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are currently pegged at 12 cents and 13 cents  respectively  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Zacks Rank  Wheaton Precious Metals currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  which when combined with a negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult   Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions Stocks Poised to Beat EstimatesHere are some companies worth considering in the same space as per our model  these have the right mix of elements to beat estimates this time around Intrepid Potash  Inc   NYSE IPI   has an Earnings ESP of  25 00  and carries a Zacks Rank  2  You can see  Bunge Limited   NYSE BG   has an Earnings ESP of  5 00  and carries a Zacks Rank  3 Covia Holdings Corporation   NYSE CVIA   has an Earnings ESP of  17 34  and Zacks Rank  3 Will you retire a millionaire One out of every six people retires a multimillionaire  Get smart tips you can do today to become one of them in a new Special Report   7 Things You Can Do Now to Retire a Multimillionaire  ,2019-05-05,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/wheaton-precious-metals-wpm-to-post-q1-earnings-whats-up-200417483,200417483
100573,322088,WPM,3 Mining Stocks For Investors Seeking Gold Exposure,opinion,"As the U S  China trade spat drags on  so too could the stock market volatility that has accompanied it so far this month  The S P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average both fell 2 4 percent on May 13   their worst days since January  The longer trade negotiations remain ongoing  the longer the geopolitical and economic risks remain 
One potential hedge against volatility and market risk is having an allocation to gold  which has historically moved in the opposite direction of equities  I often recommend having a 10 percent portfolio weighting in the yellow metal   with 5 percent in physical gold and the other 5 percent in gold mining equities  mutual funds and ETFs 
Gold mining stocks have been down so far this year  but I believe this represents a buying opportunity  The NYSE ARCA Gold Miners index  which tracks a diversified blend of small   mid  and large cap miners  is down 9 22 percent for the 12 months ended May 13 
To get additional insight on miners  I spoke with our portfolio manager and gold expert Ralph Aldis  Ralph has over 30 years  experience in the gold space  and together we manage two mutual funds focused on the yellow metal  Some of Ralph s top gold mining stocks as of late are Wheaton Precious Metals  Wesdome Gold Mines and K92 Mining 
Wesdome Gold Mines Ltd 
One miner that we really like is Canadian based Wesdome Gold Mines  TO WDO   Ralph describes the company as having  delivered both operating and drilling results very consistently  and being disciplined when it comes to raising money 
The company just reported strong first quarter results  including revenue of CA 32 5 million   a 24 percent increase from a year earlier  Plus  its gold production increased 6 percent from a year earlier to 19 010 ounces  Wesdome operates two gold mining operations in Ontario and Quebec and trades on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol WDO 
As you can see in the chart below  the company has seen massive growth in the last 12 months with a total return nearly exceeding 100 percent  We believe it s a good candidate for a takeover by a larger miner due to its strong drilling results  competent management team and safe jurisdiction in Canada   
K92 Mining Inc 
Perhaps a less well known name  K92 Mining  V KNT  is based in Vancouver and operates solely in Papua New Guinea  Ralph sums up why he likes the company   I think K92 is another one that has a great deposit  high grade  The CEO spends time at the mine site  It s off on the other side of the world  but he goes and spends a week there every month working  so it s very much a hands on management style  
Strong management is an important factor for us when looking at companies  It s one of our  5 Ms  for picking gold mining stocks  market capitalization  management  money  minerals and mine life cycle 
K92 has broken out so far in 2019 and could have further to go after reporting strong first quarter results  The company reported 19 125 gold ounces produced from its Kainantu mine in Papua New Guinea  
Wheaton Precious Metals Corp  
Although not technically mining stocks  royalty and streaming companies are a way to gain exposure to miners  These companies own streams on the production of precious metals  in exchange for helping finance the projects and providing upfront capital  One of our favorites is Wheaton Precious Metals Corp  NYSE WPM  
In 2018 Wheaton faced a tax dispute with the Canada Revenue Agency  CRA  over income generated by foreign owned subsidiaries  The CRA claimed that the company owed back taxes and fines that could have been as high as  1 billion  Fortunately  an agreement was reached  and although Wheaton will face higher taxes  the company can now focus attention on operations and put the issue behind it 
Ralph is in close contact with much of senior management   In fact  Chief Financial Officer Gary Brown was at our office in San Antonio a few weeks ago and explained to our team that the tax issue has been resolved  but that investors still haven t woken up to the good news  That s why we believe right now could be a good time to pick up this name before word spreads  
Wheaton trades in both New York and Toronto  making it easier for investors to buy  The company focuses on silver   in addition to gold  copper and other metals   and currently has streaming agreements for 19 operating mines and nine development stage projects  We like to look at the price to book ratio  and based on that  Wheaton looks undervalued relative to some of its royalty and streaming peers  including Franco Nevada Corp  and Royal Gold Inc  
A consolidation bug hit senior miners late last year and early this year  When Barrick Gold  NYSE GOLD  bought Randgold Resources  LON RRS   then Newmont  NYSE NEM  merged with Goldcorp  NYSE NEM   many analysts suspected there would be a selloff of assets and a flood of acquisitions and deals in the small  and mid cap producer space 
As Ralph puts it   I do think a wave of consolidation is going to come because we know a lot of the seniors are going to try to spin assets off  That could create a lot of interesting opportunities for smaller mining companies   ",2019-05-15,Frank Holmes,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-mining-stocks-for-investors-seeking-gold-exposure-200421739,200421739
100574,322089,WPM,Wheaton Precious Metals  Poised For Higher Silver Prices,opinion,"Last week  China let its currency  the RMB  drop to the lowest value since 2008  The currency is now trading at just over 7 yuan to the U S  dollar  This prompted the U S  Treasury Department to quickly accuse China as a currency manipulator  NPR cautions that this event may lead to  an unusual kind of currency war  one in which the U S  would intervene to counteract the effects of China s weakened currency or both countries would even take steps to increase the value of the other s currency relative to their own   The advantage of having a cheaper currency is to become more competitive with one s exports and grow the economy faster  But the problem is that a devalued currency could increase internal inflation within a country  and make it more expensive to buy products and services from other countries 
One way investors can protect themselves against the effects of higher inflation is by acquiring and holding hard assets  Traditionally real estate and commodities have been favored in times of high inflation  Gold and silver are among the most common types of hard commodities pursued by people who want to hedge against inflation  But how do you decide which metal is the better one to buy 
One way to determine whether gold or silver is undervalued is by looking at the gold to silver ratio  The premise is that there is a certain amount of gold and silver in the world that hasn t really changed over the course of humanity  So if gold and silver are both mined with their rarity in mind  then the ratio of usable gold and silver in the world should stay relatively consistent  This means if the gold to silver ratio becomes too high relative to the historical average  then silver must be undervalued relative to gold  This is the current state of the markets  Over the past 20 years or so the average ratio had been about 60  This meant for every 1 ounce of gold  investors can trade it in for 60 ounces of silver  But in more recent years gold has been outperforming silver so that the ratio had risen to over 90  But as the graph below indicates  the ratio appears to have reached a peak last month  This may represent a reflection point  which is a positive sign for silver going forward 




One way to invest in Silver is to buy stocks in silver streaming companies  These businesses typically have contracts with existing mining companies to buy their silver at a fixed cost  and resell it for a profit in the open market  One of the largest silver streaming company is Wheaton Precious Metals Corp  NYSE WPM   Wheaton originally only streamed silver  but over the last couple of years  it has also been streaming gold  Wheaton s revenue is roughly evenly split between silver and gold sales  It currently has entered into 23 agreements with 17 operating partners  including vale  Newmont Goldcorp and  Glencore   LON GLEN   About 70  of silver production comes as a by product from base metal and gold mines  This characteristic  along with the Company s bullish sentiment for long term silver prices  was the basis for creating Vancouver based Silver Wheaton in 2004 
Last week the company released it s 2nd quarter financials for 2019  The report says Wheaton  generated over  100 million in operating cash flow and had attributable gold production of over 100 000 ounces  Through the first half of 2019  Wheaton is on track for record annual gold production and reconfirms 2019 gold equivalent production guidance   Gerard Ferguson CEO   Portfolio Manager at Jemekk Capital Management is bullish on WPM  He thinks the company is  diversifed by geography and assets  They ve settled their CRA problems well  A low risk play on precious metals that trades at a discount to its peers   Ferguson has a price target that is 7  higher than the stock s price today  If the price of gold or silver continue to rise as they have this year so far  then companies like WPM will surely have a great return in 2019 ",2019-08-13,Modest Money,https://www.investing.com/analysis/wheaton-precious-metals-poised-for-higher-silver-prices-200454457,200454457
100575,322090,WPM,These Niche Gold Stocks Are The Best Way to Invest In Gold,opinion,"For your sake  I hope you already have some gold in your portfolio 

Gold is on an amazing run  It s up over 21  since last August 

Meanwhile  the S P 500 is up a mere 0 7   as you can see in the chart below 

Source  Mauldin Economics


While gold has done very well in general  I ve found one niche group of gold stocks that is hands down the winner in this run 
I ll tell you about it in a moment  Before that  let s look at why gold is performing so well 
When Stocks Zig Gold Zags
When stock market risk goes up like it has in the past 12 months investors flock to safe investments like gold  That s one of the reasons gold is doing so well 
The same thing happened shortly before the global financial crisis  Gold rose a whopping 83  between January 2005 and October 2007 when the stock market peaked  That s more than triple the S P 500 s 26  return during that period 
I m sure you remember what happened next 
The S P 500 plunged over 55  from October 2007 to March 2009  Investors were terrified  And a lot of them flooded into gold 
In fact  gold gained over 25  during the global financial crisis 

Source  Mauldin Economics


The same scenario played out when the dot com bubble burst  The S P 500 lost over 46  from August 2000 to May 2003 as investors fled the first generation of internet based companies  Meanwhile  gold gained over 43  during that period 
Today  we re on the cusp of a similar situation 
The S P 500 has increased nearly 200  over the last 10 years  That makes this the longest bull market in US history 
Of course  nothing goes up forever  My research indicates that stocks will peak in mid 2020  But we don t need to pinpoint the exact date here 
The important thing to know is that eventually  stocks will fall  And when that happens  gold will surge  So it s good to own some gold right now 
But it s even better to own a special type of gold stock that will surge even higher 
Gold Mining s  Silent Partner 
Gold royalty companies are the best gold related investment to own right now 
Here s how the royalty business model works 
Building and operating a gold mine is very expensive  Sometimes a miner is sitting on a promising deposit but doesn t have enough money to get the gold out of the ground  This is fairly common 
That s where royalty companies come in 
A royalty company makes an up front payment to a mining company  In return  it receives a fixed percentage of the mine s production  typically for as long as the mine is active 
With the royalty model  the gold miner does all of the heavy lifting  like digging up and selling the gold  The royalty company doesn t do any of that  It simply provides cash to miners to help them run their businesses 
Then  when the miner sells the gold it digs up  the royalty company receives a royalty payment 
Here s the best part  When gold prices rise  the royalty payments rise as well  When that happens  the royalty company makes more money and so do its shareholders 
Meanwhile  if the mine produces more gold  or the life of the mine is extended  the royalty company benefits  too  This is all without investing any additional money 
Even better  besides the unlimited upside  royalty companies also have very limited downside 
The royalty company isn t on the hook for any of the variable risks and costs that come with running a mine 
Mining is full of challenges that miners can t always predict or control  Things like environmental activism  political risks  union pushback  and new safety regulations  But royalty companies don t cover any of the costs associated with that stuff 
In short  royalty companies get the best of both worlds  They make a lot of money when a miner does well  But there s a cap on how much they can lose when a miner runs into roadblocks 
Royalty Companies Are Having a Fantastic Year
You already know that gold is having a great year 

But gold royalty companies are doing even better  Since last August  my top three royalty companies   Franco Nevada Corp    TSX FNV   Sandstorm Gold Ltd   NYSE SAND   Wheaton Precious Metals Corp   NYSE WPM   are up an average of 36 5  
You can see this in the chart below

These three companies also have an average dividend of 1 3  modest  but still safe and reliable income 
The Top Gold Royalty Stocks to Own Now
I m looking for the safest and most reliable dividend paying stocks  And right now  my top gold royalty companies I just mentioned are still offering compelling value 
Let me give you a quick rundown on each 
The first company is Franco Nevada Corp   FNV  
Franco Nevada is the largest gold royalty company  The Canadian based firm was also the first royalty company  and it has a solid track record 
The second company is Sandstorm Gold Ltd   SAND  
Sandstorm Gold is another Canadian royalty company  Its huge portfolio includes 185 royalties  This protects the company from any negative fallout if anything goes wrong with one of its miners 
But the best of the bunch is Wheaton Precious Metals Corp   WPM  
Wheaton is unique  It has a large portfolio of both gold and silver royalties  This gives investors more exposure to the broader precious metals market

That s impressive  But royalty companies are still a good bet today 
With trade wars brewing  the global economy slowing  and the stock market near all time highs  it s time to add gold and gold stocks to your portfolio 
Gold royalty companies should be at the top of that list ",2019-08-30,Robert Ross,https://www.investing.com/analysis/these-niche-gold-stocks-are-the-best-way-to-invest-in-gold-200460190,200460190
100576,322091,WPM,The Inverted Yield Curve Is A Good Sign For Stocks,opinion,"August 14 was the worst day of the year for stocks 

The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 800 points in a single day 
The stock market plunged because of a serious economic warning sign called a yield curve inversion 
A yield curve inversion is a canary in the coal mine for the economy  It s happened before every recession in the last 50 years 
However  there s no reason to panic 
An inverted yield curve does not mean a recession is imminent  In fact  the last five times the yield curve inverted  stocks actually rose for the next 12 18 months 
Why This Inversion Spooked Investors So Much
When investors talk about the yield curve  they re talking about the difference between long term Treasury yields and short term Treasury yields 
Normally  investors demand higher yields for longer term bonds  So the yield curve normally slopes upward like this 




But sometimes  things aren t so normal 
When one of the long term Treasuries yields less than one of the short term Treasuries  it s called a yield curve inversion 

For example  that might mean the yield on 10 year Treasuries is less than the yield on 3 month Treasuries  like it was back in March 

Or it might mean the yield on 10 year Treasuries is less than the yield on 2 year Treasuries 
That s what happened on August 14  The 10 year yield was 1 59   and the 2 year yield was 1 60   So  the difference was  0 01    Whenever this number is negative  you ve got a yield curve inversion  
The last time this part of the yield curve inverted was in December 2005 two years before the financial crisis 
So it s pretty rare  That s why the August 14 inversion spooked investors so much and US stocks suffered their worst day of the year 
A Recession Is Coming  but Not Tomorrow
There s no way around it  The August 14 inversion means investors expect the economy to slow soon 
Remember  the yield curve has inverted before every recession over the past 50 years 
You can see the inversion shortly before the last three recessions in the next chart   Yield curve inversions are circled in red  and recessions are highlighted in grey  




But here s the thing  Those recessions weren t immediate  They happened 12 months later  on average 
In other words  we re probably headed for a recession  but not tomorrow 
The same logic applies to the stock market 
Stocks Could Continue to Climb Until September 2020

The recent yield curve inversion is a positive sign for stocks  at least for now  That s because the S P 500 rose significantly after the last three inversions 
You can see this in the table below 




In the 12 months after the last three inversions  the S P 500 returned an average of 18 7   Those are major gains equal to the return on the S P 500 since June 2017 
If the pattern holds  stocks should continue to rise until about September 2020 
This Isn t the Time for More Risk
History says the stock market should perform well for the next 12 months  But 12 months can go by quickly 
At this point  buying risky stocks is like picking up pennies in front of a steamroller  You might make solid gains at first  then get squashed and lose a big chunk of money 
Most investors take on too much risk anyway  even in normal market conditions  But with the stock market near all time highs and the recent yield curve inversion  this is truer than ever 
That s why  if you buy anything  you want to buy safe and reliable dividend paying stocks 

That means gold royalty companies like Wheaton Precious Metals  NYSE WPM  
Investors buy gold when stock market risk rises  So when stocks eventually do hit the skids  gold and gold linked companies like Wheaton will benefit 
We saw this at the end of last year  When the S P 500 fell 15  from September to December  Wheaton Precious Metals rose 23  

It also means companies like Walmart  NYSE WMT  
The company has a growing stronghold in the surging e commerce market  and its stock is safe  Case in point  when the S P 500 fell 20  at the end of 2018  Walmart s share price actually increased 
That s exactly the type of company you want to own right now 

Last on my list is CME Group  NASDAQ CME  
CME operates the largest futures exchange in the world  Investors buy futures contracts to bet on whether the price of something will rise or fall  When stock prices go up and down a lot  CME sells even more contracts 
In other words  the company actually benefits from a more volatile stock market 
If history is any guide  stocks should continue to climb for the next 12 months or so  Still  whether it comes 6  12  or 24 months from now  you want to prepare your portfolio for a pullback now 
That means steering clear of risky  overpriced stocks and adding safe and reliable dividend payers like the three I just mentioned ",2019-09-03,Robert Ross,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-inverted-yield-curve-is-a-good-sign-for-stocks-200461028,200461028

Cobalt Prices
Cobalt prices are notorious for being both high and incredibly finicky given the relative scarcity of supply  not to mention the fact that the majority of the world s cobalt is mined in the Democratic Republic of the Congo  which has been plagued by political instability  violence and concerns regarding supply chain ethics  
With that in mind  it might be news to some that the cobalt price has drawn back from record highs of late 
According to one Bloomberg report  that is good news for those looking for an in to the market and  subsequently  a chance ride the electric vehicle  EV  demand boom 
Per the report  cobalt sulfate has dropped more than 20  since April 
As China continues its efforts to battle rampant pollution in the country  so  too  continues the EV demand apace  According to the report  the country already is responsible for more than half of global EV sales 
Vale Inks Deal With Canadian Firms To Sell Cobalt

100607,322122,WPM,Mixed Results At Major Gold Companies,opinion,"Wheaton Precious Metals  NYSE WPM  continues to diversify away from silver with two new streams  a gold and palladium stream on the Stillwater Mine  a long life mine in the U S   and a cobalt stream on Voisey s Bay nickel mine  Both streams are front loaded  Wheaton will receive 4 5  of the palladium reducing on hurdles to 2 25  and 42  of the cobalt  expected to commence in 2021 after a mine expansion  down to 21  over time  The first has a 6 1  IRR  and second 11   before tax   reasonably high in the current streaming environment 
However  Wheaton already with a less than sterling balance sheet  funded both  500 million and  390 million respectively from its credit facility  adding to its debt 
Wheaton is undervalued relative to the other large royalty and streaming companies  The ongoing dispute with Canadian tax authorities is largely priced in  though a completely unfavorable outcome would hurt the stock  particularly given that the amount in dispute has not been reserved  We are holding Wheaton 
Not Yet Achieving Goals
Goldcorp  NYSE GG  saw a weak quarter  with lower gold production and higher than estimated costs  The company has advised the third quarter will also be soft  while forecasting a strong fourth quarter  The company s grand 20 20 20 goal  for 20  higher production  higher reserves  and lower costs  was restated  but the company does not appear to be making great strides towards the goals  Execution is the key  Two major new mines have been experiencing more difficult ramp up periods than expected that s Cerro Negro and  l onore though both are improving  and these two mines give the company potential to go some way toward their production and cost goals 
The balance sheet  with  2 4 billion of net debt  is not as strong as many of its peers  though its valuation is below its peers  We are holding  but not energetically buying more  However  the current price down over two dollars from mid June is overdone  and probably a good price for a trade here 
Good Quarters At Yamana And Osisko 
Yamana Gold  NYSE AUY  had a good quarter  with better than expected production and lower costs  A new mine  Cerro Moro  just announced commercial production so will contribute in the second half  which should be another good period for Yamana 
Net debt is a reasonable  1 58 billion  with liquidity of almost  900 million  most of which is a credit facility  not cash   It is valued below peers  We are holding for the time being  but given that Yamana has disappointed us time and time again  we are not buying 
Stock Slammed By Mine Delay 
Osisko Gold Royalties  TO OR  reported good results  particularly a record production quarter at Canadian Malartic  its cornerstone asset  The bad news was the announcement of a blockade at Lydian s Amulsar project in Armenia  which pushes back production to the middle of next year  at the earliest   This was to have been Osisko s next major cash flowing asset  and the news drove Osisko s share price down sharply ahead of its own results 
The balance sheet remains strong  Though cash is down to  189 million  after new investments of  108 million in the quarter  and two of which carry future payment commitments   debt is also down after a  52 million repayment to  450 million  Osisko also has a large portfolio of junior companies valued around  450 million  and it is expected that Pretium will buy back its royalty  giving Osisko US 119 million before year end  so the balance sheet remains  and will remain  strong

According to the agreement  income generated through Wheaton s foreign subsidiaries will not be subject to Canadian taxes  The company  however  will need to mark up the cost of service provided to foreign subsidiaries  from 20 percent to 30 percent 
 The settlement removes uncertainty with the use of our business model going forward and puts the tax issue behind us so that we can continue to focus on what we do best  building and managing our high quality portfolio both organically and by accretive acquisitions   commented Randy Smallwood  Wheaton president and CEO 
 We expect the stock to react positively to the news given the tax dispute was an overhang   Credit Suisse  SIX CSGN  analysts shared in a note to investors today  Indeed  Wheaton stock was trading up as much as 12 4 percent in New York following the news  hitting a four month high of  19 63 a share I want to congratulate everyone at Wheaton  particularly Randy for his resilience and strong leadership  He s always offered invaluable insights to our team and investors  I encourage interested registered investment advisors  RIAs  to check out the July 2018 webcast I did with Randy  where we discussed our seven top reasons to invest in gold  You can listen to the replay by clicking here 
Monetary and Fiscal Risks Boost Gold s Investment Case
The investment case for gold and other precious metals got a boost last week in light of news that might concern some equity investors  The European Central Bank  ECB  announced that it would be drawing quantitative easing  QE  measures to a close by halting its 2 6 trillion euro bond purchasing program  begun four years ago as a means to provide liquidity to the eurozone economy after the financial crisis  Interest rates  however  will be kept at historically low levels for the time being 
The ECB  then  will become the next big central bank  after the Federal Reserve  to end QE and normalize monetary policy  Although it s steadily been tapering its own purchases of bonds  the Bank of Japan  BOJ  is still committed to providing liquidity at this point  Assets in the Japanese bank now stand north of 553 6 trillion yen   4 86 trillion  which  amazingly  is more than 100 percent of the country s entire gross domestic product  GDP   Holdings  in fact  are larger than the combined economies of India  Turkey  Argentina  Indonesia and South Africa 
In the past  I ve discussed the economic and financial risks when central banks begin to unwind their balance sheets  The Fed has reduced its assets six times separate occasions before now  and all but one of those times ended in recession  according to research firm MKM Partners 
 Business cycles don t just end accidentally   MKM Chief Economist Mike Darda said in 2017   They are killed by the Fed  
We can now add the ECB and  at some point  the BOJ to this list  The three top central banks control approximately  14 trillion in assets  a mind boggling sum  and it s unclear at this point what the ramifications might be once these assets are allowed to roll over 
The Widest November Budget Deficit on Record
In addition  the Treasury Department revealed last week that the U S  posted its widest budget deficit in the nation s history for the month of November  as spending was double the amount of revenue the government brought in  The budget shortfall  then  came in at a record  205 billion  almost 50 percent over the spending gap from a year ago 
This follows news that U S  government debt is on pace to expand this year at its fastest pace since 2012  Total public debt has jumped by  1 36 trillion  or 6 6 percent  since the start of 2018  making it the biggest expansion in percentage terms since the last year of President Barack Obama s first term  Bloomberg reports 
As of last Monday  the national debt stood at just under  22 trillion  and by as soon as 2022  it could top  25 trillion  according to estimates 
As I shared with you in November  the government could very well be in a  debt spiral  right now  in the words of Black Swan author Nassim Taleb  This means it must borrow to repay its creditors  And with rates on the rise  servicing all this debt will continue to get more and more expensive 
It s for this reason  among others  that I recommend a 10 percent weighting in gold  with 5 percent in bullion and gold jewelry  the other 5 percent in high quality gold stocks  mutual funds and ETFs

100644,322159,WPM,Silver Miners  Q4 16 Fundamentals,opinion,"The silver miners  stocks have had a roller coaster ride of a year so far  They surged  plunged  and then started surging again last week on a less hawkish than expected Fed  Such big volatility has spawned similar outsized swings in sentiment  distorting investors  perceptions of major silver miners  But their recently reported fourth quarter operating and financial results reveal the true underlying fundamental realities 
Four times a year publicly traded companies release treasure troves of valuable information in the form of quarterly reports  Required by securities regulators  these quarterly results are exceedingly important for investors and speculators  They offer a clear snapshot of what s really going on fundamentally  in individual silver miners and this small sector as a whole  There s no silver stock data I look forward to more 
Normally quarterlies are due 45 calendar days after quarter ends  in the form of 10 Qs required by the SEC for American companies  But after the final quarter of fiscal years  which are calendar years for most silver miners  that deadline extends out up to 90 days depending on company size  The 10 K annual reports required once a year are bigger  more complex  and require fully audited numbers unlike 10 Qs 
So it takes companies more time to prepare full year financials and then get them audited by CPAs right in the heart of their busy season  As a silver stock trader this additional Q4 delay is irritating  since the data is getting stale by Q1 s end  But as a CPA and former Big Six auditor of mining companies  I have some understanding of just how much work goes into an SEC mandated 10 K annual report  It s enormous 
This extended Q4 reporting window naturally delays the analysis of Q4 results  While I can start digging into the first three quarters  results 5 or 6 weeks after those interim quarter ends  I have to wait longer for the fiscal year quarter ends  Thankfully the majority of silver miners have reported by 9 or 10 weeks  so we don t quite have to wait until early Q2 to analyze Q4 results  The silver miners  Q4 16 proved fairly strong 
Silver mining is a tough business both geologically and economically  Primary silver deposits  those with enough silver to generate over half their revenues when mined  are quite rare  Most of the world s silver ore formed alongside base metals or gold  and their value usually well outweighs silver s  Thus around 2 3rds of all the silver mined worldwide is actually a byproduct of base metals and gold mining 
As scarce as silver heavy deposits supporting primary silver mines are  primary silver miners are even rarer  Since silver is so much less valuable than gold  most silver miners need multiple mines in order to generate sufficient cash flows  These often include non primary silver ones  usually gold  More and more traditional elite silver miners are aggressively bolstering their gold production  often at silver s expense 
So the universe of major silver miners is pretty small  and their purity is shrinking  The definitive list of these companies to analyze comes from the most popular silver stock investment vehicle  the Global X Silver Miners ETF  NYSE SIL   This week its net assets are running 5 4x greater than its next largest competitor s  so SIL really dominates this space  With ETF investing now the norm  SIL is a boon for its component miners 
While there aren t many silver miners to pick from  major ETF inclusion shows silver stocks have been vetted by elite analysts  Due to fund flows into top sector ETFs  being included in SIL is one of the important considerations for   When the vast pools of fund capital seek silver stock exposure  their SIL inflows force it to buy shares in its underlying companies bidding their prices higher 
This week as the major silver miners finish reporting their Q4 16 results  SIL includes 24  silver miners   This term is used rather loosely  as SIL includes plenty of companies which simply can t be described as primary silver miners  Most generate well under half their revenues from silver  which greatly limits their stock prices  leverage to silver rallies  Nevertheless  SIL is the leading silver stock ETF and benchmark we have 
The higher the percentage of sales any miner derives from silver  naturally the greater its exposure to silver price moves  If a company only earns 20   30   or even 40  of its revenues from silver  it s not a primary silver miner and its stock price won t be very responsive to silver itself  But as silver miners are increasingly actively diversifying into gold  there aren t enough big primary silver miners left to build an ETF alone 
Every quarter I dig into the latest results from the major silver miners of SIL to get a better understanding of how they and this industry are faring fundamentally  I feed a bunch of data into a spreadsheet  some of which made it into the table below  It includes key data for the top 17 SIL component companies  an arbitrary number that fits in this table  That is a commanding sample at 95 6  of SIL s total weighting 
While most of these top 17 SIL components have reported on Q4 16  not all have  Some of these major silver miners trade in Mexico and the UK  and only report half year results  And plenty of companies lump their Q4 results into full year 2016 numbers  If not explicitly broken out  most of the fourth quarter results can t simply be inferred  So if a field is left blank in this table  that data wasn t available this week if ever 
The first couple columns show each SIL component s symbol and weighting as of Wednesday  A bare majority of these silver stocks trade in the U S   with the others in Mexico  the UK  and Canada  So if you can t find a symbol here  it s a listing from a company s primary foreign stock exchange  That s followed by each company s Q4 16 silver production in ounces  along with its absolute percentage change from Q3 16 
Quarter on quarter changes offer a more granular read on companies  ongoing operating and financial performance trends than year over year comparisons  QoQ changes are also included for the key data in this table s right half of cash costs per ounce of silver mined  all in sustaining costs per ounce  and operating cash flows generated  Together costs and cash flows reveal the financial health of silver miners 
The Q4 16 silver production is followed by that same quarter s gold production  Almost every major silver miner in SIL also produces significant if not large amounts of gold  While gold stabilizes and augments the silver miners  cash flows  it also retards their stocks  sensitivity to silver itself  Naturally investors and speculators buy silver stocks and their ETFs because they want leveraged exposure to silver s price  not gold s 
So a final column reveals how pure the elite SIL silver miners are  This is mostly calculated by taking a company s Q4 silver production  multiplying it by the average silver price in Q4  and dividing that by the company s total quarterly sales  If miners didn t report Q4 revenues  I approximated them by adding the silver sales to gold sales based on their quarterly production and the metals  average fourth quarter prices 
This exercise of examining the quarterly results of the elite silver miners as represented by SIL s top 17 holdings is always illuminating  It offers many important fundamental insights into the individual stocks and this sector as a whole  These Q4 16 results collectively prove the major silver miners were in no fundamental peril last quarter  despite silver and SIL plunging 16 9  and 27 8  in that post election Trumphoria 

While unfortunately the silver miners as a whole are kind of lazy in breaking out their Q4 results from full year or half year ones  they do report quarterly production  Together these elite miners produced 76 3m ounces of silver last quarter  almost dead flat from Q3 16 s 76 2m  But on average most of these top SIL components saw shrinking silver production  which was collectively offset by big growth in a handful 
The reasons for lower silver production vary by company of course  ranging all the way from temporary lower ore grades to depleting mines  But this wasn t a symptom of a slower mining tempo in general  as these same top silver miners  Q4 gold production rocketed 11 4  higher absolutely from Q3 s levels  That bests the 10 9  QoQ production gains in   which are in the gold business 
The silver miners are collectively deciding to diversify into gold due to its superior economics compared to silver  No silver stock investor likes to hear this  but it s the hard reality today  Consider hypothetical mid sized silver and gold miners  which might produce 10m ounces and 300k ounces annually  What would those cash flows actually look like at last quarter s average silver and gold prices of  17 12 and  1218 
This silver miner would generate  171m in yearly sales  but the gold miner s  365m more than doubles that  Silver mining is often as capital intensive as gold mining  requiring similar expenses for planning  permitting  and building mines and mills to process the ore  Similar heavy machinery is necessary to dig and haul the ore  along with similar staffing levels  So silver s lower cash flows make silver mining harder 
Silver mining profits do skyrocket when silver soars occasionally in one of its massive bull markets  But during silver s long intervening drifts at relatively low price levels  the silver miners often can t generate sufficient cash flows to finance expansions  So the top silver miners are increasingly looking to gold  a trend that isn t likely to reverse given the relative economics of silver and gold  Primary silver miners are getting rarer 
The silver streaming giant Silver Wheaton  NYSE SLW   SIL s third largest component this week  has long been the pure silver powerhouse of this sector  A year ago   it derived 75 9  of its revenues from silver which was the best by far in SIL  By Q4 16  this had dropped to a mere 50 4   Mighty SLW is actually on the verge of becoming a primary gold play  This is intentional as SLW itself declared in its Q4 results this week 

Since 2013  our company has seen a marked increase in gold production  and in the second half of 2016  revenue was evenly split between silver and gold  In order to better align our corporate identity with underlying operations while maintaining a link to our past and the innovation that the  Wheaton  name has become synonymous with  we have recommended changing our name to Wheaton Precious Metals 

Technically a company isn t a primary silver miner unless it derives over half its revenues from silver  In Q4 16  the average sales percentage from silver of these top SIL components was just 40 6   That is right on trend over the past year  with Q4 15  Q1 16  Q2 16  and Q3 16 weighing in at 47 5   44 9   45 3   and 42 8   At this pace and 40 6  today  the top silver miners are soon heading well under 40  
While I understand this  as a long time silver stock investor it saddens me primary silver miners have apparently become a dying breed  When silver starts powering higher in one of its massive uplegs and well outperforms gold again  this industry s silver percentage will rise  But unless silver not only shoots way ahead but stays there while gold lags  it s hard to see major silver mining purity significantly reverse 
In Q4 16  only 5 of the top 17 SIL components qualified as the primary silver miners that SIL investors are undoubtedly looking to own when buying this  Silver Miners ETF   In today s current Q1 17 it will likely slip to 4 as the soon to be renamed SLW slides below 50  of its sales derived from silver  I ve been critical of SIL s managers in the past on silver mining purity  but they can t fight the rising gold trend 
Moving on  once again SIL plunged a brutal 27 8  last quarter on silver s own sharp 16 9  plunge  This serious silver weakness was driven by the post election Trumphoria stock market rally slaughtering any interest in prudent portfolio diversification with gold  That led to a sharp mass exodus from gold  and silver mirrored and amplified gold s moves as always  Silver s average price fell 12 4  QoQ in Q4 
That scared silver stock investors  leading to sustained selling fueling extremely bearish sentiment by late December  As always during a major selloff they assumed the silver miners  plunge was righteous and fundamentally justified  instead of purely sentimental and thus irrational  But it really was the latter as the top 17 SIL silver miners  recently reported Q4 results proved  They were never in fundamental danger 
There are two major ways to measure silver mining costs  classic cash costs per ounce and the superior all in sustaining costs per ounce  Both are useful  Cash costs are the acid test of silver miner survivability in lower price environments  showing the worst case silver levels necessary to keep the mines running  All in sustaining costs reveal where silver needs to trade to maintain current operations indefinitely 
Cash costs naturally encompass all cash expenses necessary to produce each silver ounce  including all direct production costs  mine level administration  smelting  refining  transport  regulatory  royalty  and tax expenses  In Q4 16  these top SIL component silver miners that reported cash costs averaged just  5 28 per ounce  That s a major 6 2  sequential improvement from Q3  and less than a third of current silver levels 
But cash costs are understated due to an outlying anomaly  This week Silvercorp Metals  OTC SVMLF  is the 17th largest SIL component  making it into this table  A quarter ago it was 18th  and thus not included  SVM mines base metals heavy silver deposits with huge lead and zinc byproducts  These are sold and credited to silver mining costs  lowering the cash costs to negative  5 48 per ounce  That really distorts the overall picture 
Ex SVM  these silver miners  cash costs soared 21 1  QoQ from  5 63 in Q3 to  6 82 in Q4  While that remains far below prevailing silver prices proving these elite silver miners were in no fundamental peril  it illustrates the economic challenges of silver mining  With most of the major silver miners producing less silver in Q4  their high fixed costs of mining were spread across fewer ounces driving up per ounce costs 
Way more important than cash costs are the far superior all in sustaining costs  They were introduced by the World Gold Council in June 2013 to give investors a much better understanding of what it really costs to maintain a silver mine as an ongoing concern  AISC include all direct cash costs  but then add on everything else that is necessary to maintain and replenish operations at current silver production levels 
These additional expenses include exploration for new silver to mine to replace depleting deposits  mine development and construction expenses  remediation  and mine reclamation  They also include the corporate level administration expenses necessary to oversee silver mines  All in sustaining costs are the most important silver mining cost metric by far for investors  revealing miners  true operating profitability 
In Q4 16 the top SIL components reported average AISC of  10 56 per ounce  up 4 3  QoQ   But again this is heavily skewed by SVM edging into SIL s top 17 components  Its anomalous  1 87 per ounce AISC from its freak silver deposits really dragged down the average  Ex SVM again  these silver miners  average AISC surged 18 6  QoQ to  12 01  Lower quarterly production was the key cause 
SIL s top two components are giant Mexican mining conglomerates that produce vast amounts of silver but don t report all in sustaining costs quarterly  Together the quarterly silver production of Industrias Penoles  OTC IPOAF  and Fresnillo  LON FRES  soared 11 5  or 3 0m ounces QoQ  Meanwhile the next 15 biggest SIL stocks saw silver production plunge 5 7  or 2 9m ounces QoQ  That really forced their per ounce costs higher 
Nevertheless  silver mining is still quite profitable even at Q4 s lackluster silver prices averaging  17 12  At that  10 56 average AISC  that implies hefty profit margins of  6 56 per ounce or 38   CEOs in most industries would sell their souls for margins like that  Even at those adjusted  12 01 AISC  silver mining profit margins of  5 11 are still excellent  The sharp silver stock selloff in Q4 wasn t fundamentally justified 
These AISC levels suggest the top silver miners  profits will remain rock solid in the current almost over Q1 17  Silver has averaged  17 37 so far this quarter  1 5  better than Q4  So if AISC remain stable  Q1 s silver mining profit margins are likely to be a little better than Q4 s  The silver miners have forecast stable AISC for full year 2017  with 8 of SIL s top 17 averaging  11 07  Ex SVM  that rises to an adjusted  11 87 
The top silver miners  operating cash flows fared reasonably well in Q4 considering silver s sharp drop  They were boosted by gold performing better relatively  Its average price only fell 8 8  QoQ compared to silver s 12 4  drop  This combined with higher gold and lower silver production led to  537m in OCF generation by the top SIL miners reporting them for Q4  Compared to Q3 s  1577m  that seems miserable 
But it s misleading due to Q4 reporting limitations  Our sample size in Q4 16 was 9 of SIL s top 17 stocks compared to 14 of 17 in Q3  And SIL s top component Industrias Penoles reported  899m of operating cash flows in Q3 but didn t break out Q4 from full year results  If the same other 8 silver miners reporting in Q4 are compared with their own Q3 operating cash flows  Q4 s  509m was only down 14 3  from Q3 s  594m 
So all things considered  the silver miners fared really well operationally considering silver s big plunge last quarter  Though their mining costs jumped due to lower silver production  they remained relatively low even compared to low prevailing silver prices  And higher gold production fed stronger operating cash flows than the sharply lower silver prices alone implied were coming  The elite silver miners are doing fine 
But they remain really undervalued after their extreme Q4 selloff  Silver s mean reversion higher out of that crazy post election Trumphoria anomaly is already well underway  Back in Q3 16 before that  silver averaged  19 55 which was 14  higher than Q4 s levels  If silver merely returns to there  silver mining profits will surge 37  higher  The battered silver stocks are very attractive with their big upside leverage to silver 
Once undervalued silver starts seriously powering higher with gold again  capital will flood back into the silver stocks catapulting their prices far higher  The silver miners  operating profitability greatly improves during silver bulls  so their huge silver stock upside is totally justified fundamentally  The anomalous post election silver stock plunge and its aftermath is a fantastic buy low opportunity on irrational bearish psychology 
While investors and speculators alike can certainly play the silver miners  ongoing mean reversion bull with this leading SIL ETF  individual silver stocks with superior fundamentals will enjoy the best gains by far  Their upside will trounce the ETFs   which are burdened by companies that don t generate much of their sales from silver  A handpicked portfolio of purer elite silver miners will generate far greater wealth creation 
At Zeal we ve literally spent tens of thousands of hours researching individual silver stocks and markets  so we can better decide what to trade and when  As of the end of Q4  this has resulted in 906 stock trades recommended in real time to our newsletter subscribers since 2001  Fighting the crowd to buy low and sell high is very profitable  as all these trades averaged stellar annualized realized gains of  22 0  
The key to this success is staying informed and being contrarian  meaning buying low when others are scared  So we aggressively added new trades in early March s selloff ahead of the Fed 
The bottom line is the major silver miners fared just fine operationally in Q4 16  Despite all the emotional silver stock dumping on sharply lower silver prices  this industry s underlying fundamentals stayed quite strong  Costs remained way under prevailing silver prices even at lows  feeding big profit margins  And the silver miners growing their gold production mitigated the hit to operating cash flows from falling silver 
With silver stock sentiment remaining so excessively bearish  this sector is primed to soar as silver itself continues mean reverting higher out of its post election anomaly  The silver miners  profits leverage to rising silver prices remains excellent  And after fleeing silver stocks last quarter  investors and speculators will have to do big buying to reestablish silver mining positions  These capital inflows will fuel big gains ",2017-03-26,Adam Hamilton,https://www.investing.com/analysis/silver-miners’-q4’16-fundamentals-200180117,200180117

100648,322163,WPM,Wheaton Precious Metals Still Shining  ,opinion,"Despite a second quarter in which ounces produced but not yet delivered to Wheaton Precious Metals Corp  NYSE WPM  increased  earnings from operations were just US 2 8m  or 3 2   below our earlier published estimate of US 85 7m  In addition  management formally changed its dividend policy  from 20  of average cash generated by operating activities to 30   which thus allowed it to declare a relatively generous third quarter dividend of 10c share compared with our prior expectation of 6c 
Silver sales exceeded gold sales for the first time since Q316  in the ratio 54 46   Finally  WPM also announced that it had entered into an  early deposit  agreement whereby it will advance US 65m to Desert Star in return for the right to purchase 100  of the silver and gold production from Kutcho in British Columbia at 20  of the spot price of the metals over the life of the mine 

San Dimas reaction excessive
Notwithstanding solid quarterly results  WPM s shares fell C 2 11 in the three trading days following the announcement of its results  which we attribute to the tribulations of Primero  which operates the San Dimas project and over which WPM has a streaming agreement  San Dimas will account for c 8 5  of WPM s silver equivalent production in FY17 and approximately 17 5  of EPS 
We value WPM s San Dimas stream at US 959 9m  or US 2 17 per WPM share  on the basis of its long term precious metals price assumptions or US 684 2m  or US 1 55 share  on the basis of the current spot price of silver  Including the share price declines after WPM s Q316 results in November  the stock market thus appears to be discounting the loss of substantially all the San Dimas stream to WPM despite the latter having security over the asset  which seems excessive

100680,322195,WPM,One More Drop In Miners Would Be A Buy,opinion,"Metals and miners can t seem to get enough traction for a bounce and may be setting up to break lower sooner than I expected  If prices drop this coming week  I ll be watching for signs of a bottom and reversal  One more drop should complete the intermediate term decline  and a new up cycle will likely begin 
The miners are potentially making small bear flags  best seen in the Silver Wheaton  NYSE SLW  chart  below  Prices dropping below the lower trendlines will trigger a quick move lower 
 SLW  
Silver Wheaton is the best example of a small bear flag that looks ready to break lower  A break lower could drop prices to around the  21 00  20 50 level

Conversely  silver and gold miner SLW missed on earnings and has plunged beneath its up sloping 200 day EMA  22 47  and has down spiked into key multi month support lodged between 22 00 and 18 00  which must contain any additional weakness to preserve its bull trend

100683,322198,WPM,A Decision On Golden Arrow s Chinchillas Project Could Be Near,opinion,"Gecko Research gives its take on the U S  Presidential Election and precious metals  and discusses the latest movements at Golden Arrow s Chinchillas JV project in Argentina 
The Election and Precious Metals We have received numerous emails with questions on what we think of the U S  elections  Donald Trump  etc   and what impact the outcome might have on gold and macro economics in general  We are not a political letter and we are far away from being experts in the political area so we won t go down that road too much  That said  although gold is priced in U S  dollar  the price of gold is affected from what s happening in the rest of the world as well  not just the U S 
It was interesting to see base metals soar after Trump won  most likely due to the possible infrastructure improvements now facing the U S  with Trump in charge  As for the precious metals  they were likely driven up by the Asian markets immediately after the election results were final  Shortly thereafter  the gold market had a nasty reversal which was likely fueled by a combination of things like a stronger dollar  market stops being triggered and perhaps even margin calls 
Trump might raise rates early on  the bond market is way ahead of him there  but we think he can only do so much  The more he raises the rates  the more expenditures and government deficits he has to deal with  especially since Trump has proclaimed a lot of spending rather than saving  This will only circle around to more monetary easing which makes us believe that no matter how you slice and dice this  gold will continue to do well  Add some inflation  expectations  into the mix and a perfect precious metals storm is brewing 
We can probably all agree that both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump will not make it to the history books as two of the greatest candidates ever to run for President  When it comes to Trump s personal appearance during his campaign  he has been really  out there  and pushing limits on all fronts  Our own feeling is that he will act totally different when in office  we think he will tone down his strong ways and act more in a way that is expected of a U S  President  Therefore we wouldn t be at all surprised if 6 12 months from now  Trump will have greater support and be more likeable 
Gold And SilverAfter a roller coaster week  gold closed on Friday at  1 227 60  a drop of   110 from Wednesday s top  On a weekly basis gold dropped  76  or 5 9   Silver dropped 5 7  to close the week at  17 36  The gold to silver ratio now stands at 70 7 
While gold and silver tanked almost 6   VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners  NYSE GDXJ  lost 15  last week closing at  34 24  If we would see  32 5 or thereabouts  we would step in to buy a large sized position as a trade 
As we have been predicting lower prices for both metals and miners in the short term  we could never have imagined this week s action  These strong moves always have an impact in the short to medium term and we expect some consolidation in the weeks to come  We don t think we will see a lot more downside and we would be very surprised if the  1 200 level is breached in a significant way 
Although this downturn came much faster and harder than we could foresee  this is very likely going to be the last window of opportunity we have been looking for  No matter if we are right or wrong  it s in times like this that investors should look over their portfolio and make necessary adjustments  One should get rid of underperformers and bad junior miners that for whatever reason hasn t delivered as expected  Instead one should add companies of high quality because when the market turns in a big way  those are the companies that will outperform 
We had a few long term orders in the market and besides adding some Golden Arrow Resources Corporation  V GRG    GAC FSE  GARWF OTCQB  shares on Friday  see below   we also bought a bunch of Silver Wheaton Corp  NYSE SLW   SLW TSX  at C 24 50  Silver Wheaton was a  C 40 stock only three months ago and this purchase is a buy and hold for us 
Silver Standard Resources and the Chinchillas Project Last Tuesday Silver Standard Resources Inc  NASDAQ SSRI   SSO TSX  released its Q3 results and the company hosted a conference call the day after  linked to   In the call the joint venture with Golden Arrow and the Chinchillas project were mentioned on several occasions  To make things easier  a kind Golden Arrow shareholder created this  where all the segments are edited together 
Silver Standard s current operation  the Pirquitas silver mine  is performing very well  showing both higher production and lower cut off  which results in lower cash costs  Bottom line  it s a world class silver mine  The mining will end soon but the stockpiled ore will keep the milling going throughout 2017 
Silver Standard stated that a final decision on the Chinchillas project will come around New Years  possibly shortly after  our personal guess Jan Feb   A lot of technical work is being done with great results and both EIA and mining permits have been applied for 
A long term stink bid order got filled on Friday and we bought Golden Arrow shares at  0 66 as a trading position

100685,322200,WPM,Secret Santa s Inflation Hedges For 2017,opinion,"I have something I can give you for the holidays as well  Not peace on Earth but perhaps peace of mind heading into the New Year   a way to help insure some future prosperity with a few inflation fighting stock picks that can brighten up your portfolio  which also can be used to help balance your home s budget against unexpected cost increases 
This isn t an options seminar or one about risk or leverage   these are just a few practical ideas you can use to hedge against inflation as it may affect your everyday life using basic industry ETFs and some simple hedging strategies to give you an opportunity to stay ahead of the markets if they keep going higher 

As you can see from the chart above  we haven t actually had much inflation since last year so our hedges were unnecessary but because we practice our strategy of  Being the House   NOT the Gambler   we were able to do well on  regardless 
We used the SPDR S P Homebuilders  NYSE XHB   selling 20 2018  28 puts for  2 25   4 500  and buying 20 Jan  28 33 bull call spreads for  3 50   7 000  for net  2 500 and XHB has climbed to goal and the January spread is at net  5   10 000  while the short puts are down to  1 02   2 040  for net  7 960 on the spread  a gain of  5 460  218   

The energy ETF  XLE  NYSE XLE   was our hedge against fuel inflation and the idea was for each car we owned to hedge against gas going up  1  Gasoline is only  2 26 from  2 02 last year  a bit over 10  increase but your XLE play was buying 3 Jan  60 65 bull call spreads for  2 35   705  and selling 2 2018  40 puts for  2 50   500  for net  205 and the bull call spread is now  4 90   1 470  and the short puts are 0 33   66  for net  1 404  up  1 199  584   

Food costs went down in 2016 and our PowerShares DB Agriculture  NYSE DBA  hedge was our worst performer  Our trade idea was buying 8 Jan  20 23 bull call spreads for  1 15  920  and selling 4 2018  20 puts for  1 25   500  for a net cost of  420  DBA is under  20 and the bull call spread has dropped to 0 15   120  and the short puts are still  1 10   440  which is net   320   176   

Our final hedge was our 2016 Trade of the Year on the United States Natural Gas  NYSE UNG  and our heating bills sure did shoot up in 2016 but  fortunately  our trade idea was to buy 10 Jan  5 9 bull call spreads for  2   2 000  and sell 10 2018  7 puts for  1 60   1 600  for net  400 and UNG is just over our goal and the bull call spread is now  3 60   3 600  and the short puts are 0 55   550  for a net profit of  3 050  762   

I m sorry to disappoint those of you who hoped that last trade would make less than 100   which would have triggered our promise to discount your Membership renewal by 50    we really put our money where our mouth is on that one  Hopefully you enjoyed your holiday trading gifts that netted a combined profit of  8 969 against a cash outlay of  3 525 for a 12 month net gain of 254   As I said at the time 

Now  if you are thinking  after going over these ideas and seeing how a few of our old trades worked out   Well  that s too easy  there s a very good chance of making 100  on that trade   Well  that s kind of my point  Don t you think you should learn how to trade like that  This is the whole point to using options and hedging in a balanced portfolio 


Idea  1   General Inflation Hedging with Gold
The Dollar has been on a huge run in 2016 and gold has gotten crushed but I don t like playing gold directly  not when a best of breed miner like Barrick Gold Corporation  NYSE ABX  is on sale for  14 55  That s just a  17Bn market cap for ABX  who has 100M ounces of proven gold reserves in the ground  worth  113 5Bn at  1 135 per ounce  Now  the real value of the gold is the marginal cost of removing it from the ground and ABX has their costs pegged around  950  so  185 profit x 100M is still  18 5Bn  which makes ABX reasonable   even at these prices 
We can promise to buy ABX for just  13  by selling 10 2019  13 puts for  2 63   2 630  and our upside bet can be 20 2018  12   4 10  17   1 95  bull call spreads net  2 15   4 300  for a cost of  1 670 on the  10 000 spread 
So you are putting up  1 670 in cash and the margin requirement on the sale will be roughly  1 350 in an ordinary margin account  What have we accomplished  Well  if ABX goes up  your  1 670 becomes  10 000  gaining  8 330  498  gain on cash  as a very nice general inflation hedge  So nice  in fact  this trade is in the running for our 2017 Trade of the Year 

On the risk side  We certainly don t expect ABX to go to zero but let s say it falls to  10  1 3   Well  you are obligated to own 1 000 shares at  13   13 000  and you would have lost  3 per share  so  3 000 is your risk there but I would put it to you that  if gold goes so far down that ABX loses 1 3 of it s value   then your bullish stock picks should be doing exceptionally well   as clearly no one is worried enough to have a bit of gold on the side 
That s what hedging is  it gives you a cushion that can prevent things from getting away from you  For example  you can hedge this hedge by buying 10 2019  10 puts for 0 73   730  and you cap your downside at  10  the  3 000 loss  but you raise your outlay to  2 400 and lower your reward potential to a still respectable  7 600  316     just an example of a way to control the downside and you can trigger a cover like that only if ABX fails to hold  for example  13  You can actually work these swings to your advantage by adjusting the trade as the stock moves through a channel but  for the sake of simplicity   we re just discussing passive risk management examples  The idea is to reduce your risk of waiting   that lets you sit back and make an intelligent  well timed decision without worrying that the market is getting away from you  Unlike CDs or Bonds  there is no penalty for an early withdrawal from a hedge  other than the bid ask spread you may pay if you do it very quickly 

Idea  2   Hedging for Fuel Inflation
As noted above  Gasoline RBOB prices have moved up 10  at the pump and we re back near where we were last Christmas  If you are the average family  you buy about 1 500 gallons of gas per year   3 500  and spend another  1 500 heating your home  That s  5 000 a year spent on energy 
XLE had a good run already so I looked for refiners that might be interesting and Sunoco  SUN  caught my eye  They are a reliable refiner that pays a wonderful 12  dividend so let s look at a stock play on this one to take advantage  
We can assume any increase in fuel prices over the year will push them higher and SUN generally holds  20  now  26  so let s have SUN pay for our gasoline consumption with the following trade 
Buy 1 000 shares of SUN for  26 98   26 980 
Sell 10 June 25 calls for  3 30   3 300 
Sell 10 June  22 50 puts for  1 60   1 600 
That s a net outlay of  22 080 and  if SUN is over  25 in June  we can roll the short calls to longer months  they only go to June at the moment  but  meanwhile  we ve dropped our net to  22 08 and  at  25  7  lower than we are now   we make  2 920 in 3 months PLUS the Feb and May dividends of  826 each for another  1 652 for an anticipated return of  26 652 and a potential 6 month profit of  4 572  20 7   on a fairly conservative stock play and THAT is how you get Sunoco to pay for your energy bills 
Idea  3   Hedging for Food Inflation
If you think you spend a lot on fuel  maybe you haven t been to the grocery store lately  I knew food inflation was getting out of hand when the A P s fruit and vegetable prices started catching up with Whole Foods Market Inc  NASDAQ WFM  last year but things have since calmed down  The middle men are getting crushed in between with A P  GAP  bankrupt and WFM and Super Value Co Ltd  T 3094  down for the year 
Despite being our only loser last year  DBA is still the way to go  They were at  20 48 last Christmas and now  19 75 and  don t forget  this is about hedging against inflation   if we don t have inflation  then we saved money on the food side  
If you spend  10 000 a year on groceries you can risk being assigned 400 shares for  8 000 and sell 4 of the 2019  20 puts for  1 45 each   580   That money can be used to buy 8 of the 2018  18   2 65  21  0 85  bull call spreads for  1 80   1 440  and that s net  860 out of pocket  one month s shopping  and the upside  if DBA simply hits  21  up 5   is  2 400 less the  860 laid out is  1 540  so a 15  hedge against food inflation and your risk is owning 400 shares of DBA at  20   8 000  as a long term hedge   only if food prices continue to go lower 

The 2019 put sale  if DBA should go to  16  down 20    would cost you  1 600   less than you will probably save on food  Remember  these are not magic beans that pay off no matter what the market does   these are hedges against inflation and  if there is no inflation  then you will save LESS than you otherwise would have but  again   there are dozens of ways to make owning DBA long term a successful part of your portfolio  Instead of randomly investing your retirement savings   trade ideas like these are ways to put some of the money to work for you   in ways that can help you manage your bills NOW   as part of your daily life 

Anyway  what s the trade  VERY simple on Silver Wheaton Corp  NYSE SLW   
As you can see from the chart  SLW is nice and low in the channel and we can go lower still by selling 10 of the 2019  15 puts for  3   3 000  and buying 10 of the 2018  15   6 50  20   2 55  bull call spreads at net  3 95   3 950  so a net outlay of  950 on the potential  5 000 spread has an upside of  4 050 if all goes well 
To make 100  on the cash  0 95   the net price of that spread has to be  1 90 or greater   that s the  bet   Obviously  if the spread is over  17  the  15 puts would expire worthless and will not be an issue and  at  17  the spread returns  2 000 for each  950 invested  10 contracts    anything above that will be a bonus  Remember  if it fails to return at least 100  and you have signed up for an Annual Membership in the next 7 days   you will get a free year in 2018 
I very much hope all these trades work out well  ESPECIALLY the last one  I also hope you go back and read our prior hedging ideas and think about how much money you can make with simple  long term investments like these   rather than messing around trying to guess the next hot stock  Trades like this are the bread and butter of our portfolios ",2016-12-26,Philip Davis,https://www.investing.com/analysis/secret-santa’s-inflation-hedges-for-2017-200170784,200170784

100687,322202,WPM,A Natural Gas Opportunity  Years In The Making,opinion,"Last week I was in beautiful Argentina with a diverse team of investors and mining executives  including my good friend Frank Giustra  Ian Telfer  founder of Silver Wheaton  NYSE SLW  and current Chairman of the Board of Goldcorp  NYSE GG   which has sizeable investments in Argentina  and Serafino Iacono  Chairman of the Board of Pacific Exploration and Production  TO PEN   formerly Pacific Rubiales   which is active throughout South America  Together we toured various natural gas and crude oil mining projects in Tierra del Fuego  Mendoza and Santa Cruz  where we had the opportunity to speak with Governor Alicia Kirchner  elder sister to former Argentinian president N stor Kirchner 
One of the highlights of the trip was meeting with current president Mauricio Macri in Buenos Aires  Macri  as you might know  was elected in late 2015 on his credentials as a businessman and former mayor of Buenos Aires  His administration ends more than a decade of socialist rule by Kirchner and his wife Cristina Fern ndez  who was indicted this past December on corruption charges 
Even with Macri at the helm  corruption remains a problem in Argentina  The South American country currently ranks 95th in Transparency International s 
But economic conditions are improving  After contracting 1 percent in 2016  country GDP is expected to grow as much as 2 8 percent this year 
Macri s mission to make Argentina great again has already led him to abolish currency controls  return to world credit markets  attract foreign investors and set in motion a plan to reduce the fiscal deficit  After that  he hopes to get around to tax reform  In the meantime  there s the energy sector 
A Plan to End Natural Gas Imports by 2022
Since 2008  Argentina has been a net importer of hydrocarbons  mainly natural gas  which represents more than half of the country s energy matrix  Prices are low right now  so the economic impact is not detrimental  Should prices begin to rise substantially  however  it could destroy the economy  As such  my friends and colleagues were invited to help develop the fields and prevent further overreliance on imports  The government  in fact  wants to end them altogether by 2022 

Production declined mainly because of underinvestment during the two Kirchner administrations  Stringent regulations forced companies to sell product in the domestic market at a discount to international prices  Capital dried up to reinvest in the fields  and the natural decline of well production drove the overall output down  Making matters worse  companies lacked access to capital markets due to the Argentina sovereign debt default in 2001 
As I said  the country is fabulously rich in hydrocarbons such as natural gas and petroleum  It s estimated to have the world s third largest natural gas reserves and  according to the independent research Wilson Center  it  could possibly be the country with the most promising shale prospects outside of the United States   Its most promising formation is Vaca Muerta   Dead Cow    located in the Neuqu n basin  which has been compared to Texas  prolific Eagle Ford play in terms of depth and thickness 
YPF  NYSE YPF   the government s oil company  has already done exceptional exploration work  so there are numerous areas ready to be developed  This is the opportunity for us 
Having seen the projects firsthand and spoken to policymakers  I m confident Macri can help open up Argentina s energy sector and streamline production  Upon taking office  one of the president s first acts was to slash the previous administration s energy subsidies  which cost the government more than  51 billion over the past 13 years  Electricity bills in Buenos Aires rose a reported 500 percent as a result  but the move allowed the government to save a much needed  4 billion in 2016 alone 

Policy Change in the U S  Has Also Had Amazing Consequences
As for the U S  energy sector  crude exports have never been stronger  After Congress lifted the U S  oil export ban in December 2015  exporters didn t hesitate to turn on the spigots  Now  for the second week as of February 17  the U S  sent more than 1 million barrels of crude onto world markets  filling the gap created by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries  OPEC  in December when it agreed to trim production 

Producers are also ramping up activity  In the week ended February 17  companies pumped more than 9 million barrels a day for the first time since April 2016  The recent weekly record of 9 6 million barrels a day  set in July 2015  could be tested if producers continue their upward trend 

Even with increased output  prices continue to creep up  From its low of just over  30 a barrel last February  Brent crude has climbed 88 percent

100707,322222,WPM,Silver Miners Will Outperform Silver Price In The Forthcoming Bull Run,opinion,"Despite the expectations of a rate hike by the Fed in December of 2016  silver has remained close to its highs  as shown in the chart below   After a stellar run  the white metal is consolidating near its highs  while anticipating its next imminent breakout 
Along with investing in the white metal directly  investors should also use this consolidation in silver to look at the silver miners  which offer excellent returns during silver bull runs 

Supply And Demand For Silver
 Industrial demand is set to increase  driven by rising incomes and growing penetration of technology in populous  developing nations  as well as new uses are being found for silver s anti bacterial and reflective properties in everything from hospital paints to Band Aids to windows   reports Bloomberg  who expects the industrial demand to surge within the next few years 
India and China will need approximately a billion smartphones and tablets by 2020  Demand for silver is expected to remain buoyant and demand will remain ahead of supply 
Over the next ten or twenty years  more and more people are going to be using these devices  however  silver is a very limited commodity   There s just not a lot of it around  according to Keith Neumeyer  CEO of First Majestic Silver Corp 
It is this that most likely led a major Japanese electronics player to First Majestic in attempts to secure its future silver supply  which is a sign of a tightening supply 
 For an electronics manufacturer to come directly to us tells me something is changing in the market  I think we ll see three digit silver   said  to Bloomberg 
The Solar industry is booming  as well  Solar power is taking over conventional power sources  and that is good news for silver as the solar industry is likely to consume more than 13  of the total silver demand in 2016  Similarly  ethylene oxide producers will also consume  more silver as compared to the previous year 
 Silver demand had a phenomenal 2015 with retail investment and jewelry fabrication both reaching all time highs   wrote  of US Global Investors in a post in early July 2016 
On the other hand  silver mine production is expected to drop for the first time since 2002 as mining production dips 5  during the current year 
Why Invest In Silver Miners Along With Silver 
After having established that silver prices are likely to increase further  due to supply shortage and increased demand  let s review the best possible mode of investment in silver so as to maximize our profits 
During silver bull markets  the silver miners are favored by investors because their prices increase much more than the price of the white metal  As the cost of production remains the same  the miners gain huge profits when silver prices move up 
Hence  traders prefer the silver miners  once the next Elliott Wave count is confirmed  This is the reason for the sharp 170  run up in the stock prices of Silver Wheaton Corp  NYSE SLW   a blue chip silver streaming company 

For every  1 increase in silver prices  the silver miner has increased by more than  3  which indicates that the silver miners are a better trade than the underlying metal 
However  when silver corrects  the silver miners tend to underperform  The silver miners behave as the leveraged plays of silver  which are rising and falling far more than the underlying white metal 
The Global X Silver Miners  NYSE SIL  offers an excellent opportunity to investors to enjoy the advantages of the silver miners with reduced risk  compared to owning single mining stocks  The ETF has seen a whopping rally from its lows of below  15 to the current price of  51 59 

Even after the phenomenal rise  the ETF is still well below its 2011 high of  94   as shown in the chart below 

Traders can keep an eye on SIL to accumulate on dips 
Conclusion
Silver has put a bottom in place and will continue to move even higher  in the coming months and years  In order to benefit from this rise  traders should keep an eye on the silver miners  which act as leveraged plays for the underlying  white metal   With silver booming  silver miners  prices will continue to skyrocket higher ",2016-08-18,Chris Vermeulen,https://www.investing.com/analysis/silver-miners-will-outperform-silver-price-in-the-forthcoming-bull-run!-200148617,200148617
100708,322223,WPM,Did You Miss The Boat On Silver ,opinion,"It s been two months since Brexit temporarily shocked global markets 
Major indexes around the world have since recovered  with even London s FTSE 100 Index well above pre Brexit levels 
For commodities  the reaction was a mixed bag  But most recovered from any initial stumbles 
On the other hand  some of the strongest performing commodities this year grew even stronger 
Silver gets the crown for biggest Brexit winner  The price of silver gained nearly 13  in the week following the U K  referendum results  And producers  like Silver Wheaton  NYSE SLW   churned out even better performances   

Silver Wheaton shares quickly jumped 13 6  in the wake of Brexit  Since then  they ve climbed more than 35   At the same time  the iShares Silver Trust  NYSE SLV  has gained 32   And miners First Majestic  NYSE AG  and Pan American Silver  NASDAQ PAAS  are up an average of 10   doubling the performance of the Dow 
So far in 2016  silver has been the best performing metal  gaining more than 36   That also makes it the best performing commodity  outperforming both sugar and gold 
Historically  silver has been a  Buy  when the gold silver ratio hits 80  when it takes 80 ounces of silver to buy one ounce of gold  
Back in March  this ratio hit 80 57 

Now  we can see from the chart that every time the gold silver ratio hits this 80 level  it bounces lower  That occurs when silver s price outperforms gold s  As long as this is the case  the ratio will continue to decrease until it drops below 50 
From July 2011 to March of this year  the gold silver ratio tromped steadily higher  from 40 into the low 80s  But it has started to walk back down and currently sits at 70 4  That s thanks to silver s outperformance of gold 

This is exactly the trend that you want to see as a resource investor  The price of gold has gained 26 5   or roughly  282 per ounce this year  At the same time  the price of silver has gone up 36   or  5 18 per ounce 
I m not going to tell you that silver is going to rise to  100 per ounce or that gold is going to go to something ridiculous  But as a trend trader following a clearly defined pattern  I will tell you the move in silver is far from over 
For the gold silver ratio to return to its historic sell level of 50  and for the price of gold to stay at its current level  silver would need to rise to  26 76 per ounce 
That s a 36 9  increase from current prices 
So  even if you didn t believe us in March when we  the gold silver ratio signaled a buying opportunity    silver was  15 89 per ounce then   you still have an opportunity for gains 
The historic three month average gain for silver following a gold silver ratio peak is 19 29   Since March 21  the price of silver has gone up 20     right in line with that average 
The historic average gain in silver six months after a gold silver ratio peak is 49 3   So even over the next few months  there s plenty of upside 
It gives us a price target of somewhere around  23 75 by October

100709,322224,WPM,These Precious Metal Stocks Continue To Feel Pressure,opinion,"Barrick Gold Corporation  NYSE ABX    Timmins Gold Corp   NYSE TGD    First Majestic Silver Corp  NYSE AG    Silver Wheaton Corp   NYSE SLW 
Barrick Gold  Timmins Gold  First Majestic Silver  and Silver Wheaton have all seen better days in the market  While these stocks all saw strong growth in the beginning of the year  as we move forward  we re seeing more and more downward movement  What happened to the bull run  Are the declines here to stay  Today  I ll do my best to answer these questions 
What Happened To The ABX  TGD  AG  and SLW Bull Run 
When we look at Barrick Gold  Timmins Gold  First Majestic Silver  and Silver Wheaton  it becomes clear that they all have one thing in common  Each of these companies is heavily focused on precious metals  Whether it be gold or silver  these companies focus on mining  processing  and selling precious metals  Therefore  they are all at the mercy of market spot prices 
In the beginning of the year  ABX  TGD  AG  and SLW all saw gains  and for good reason  Precious metals were headed upward in value  meaning that these companies made more money  The gains in the values of precious metals came as global economic concerns continue to grow stronger  With the Chinese market crash  Brexit  Japanese economic concerns and slowing growth in the United States  investors were clamoring for safe havens  Demand for precious metals climbed leading to gains in price  However  more recently  things have started to change 
Economic Conditions Improve As Fed Eyes Rate Hike
As mentioned above  ABX  TGD  AG  and SLW all had a strong first half in 2016  thanks to economic concerns  However  at this point  economic concerns seem to be fading  The Bank of England recently dropped a massive stimulus bomb in an attempt to improve economic conditions  Japan and China seem to be well on their way to a recovery and investors are expecting to see further stimulus out of Europe  So  on a global scale  economic conditions are improving  leading to declines in precious metals  However  that s not the whole story 
Another factor that s leading to declines in Barrrick Gold  Timmins Gold  First Majestic Silver and Silver Wheaton is the United States Federal Reserve  Throughout the year  the Fed has been waiting on the right time to increase interest rates  In the first half  issues like job growth  consumer spending  home sales have hindered these plans  However  at the moment  economic conditions in the United States are improving  As a result  we re starting to see expectations of a rate hike 
At the end of the day  a higher interest rate out of the Fed would likely hurt the entire precious metals market  After all  gold and silver are both priced using the USD  If the Fed raises its interest rate  it would essentially raise the value of the USD  Which would lead to declines in demand for gold and silver  ultimately causing the prices to fall  As a result  we d likely watch as ABX  TGD  AG and SLW all took a dive 
Is A Higher Interest Rate Coming
While I do believe that a higher Federal Funds rate is coming down the line at some point  I don t expect for it to happen in September  While recent economic reports have been positive overall  there is one report that I believe will lead to a delay  That report is the inflation report  In July  consumer prices rose by only 0 1   That s a very low number  which probably means the Fed will miss its 2  annual inflation target  As a result  I don t think we re quite ready for a rate hike  With that said  further economic growth around the world is still likely to add pressure to ABX  TGD  AG and SLW  So  while I don t think a rate hike is coming  I do believe that it s going to get worse for these stocks before it gets better 
What Do You Think 
Where do you think ABX  TGD  AG and SLW are headed ",2016-08-31,Joshua Rodriguez,https://www.investing.com/analysis/these-precious-metal-stocks-continue-to-feel-pressure-200151126,200151126
100710,322225,WPM,Silver Miners  Enjoying An Epic Year,opinion,"The silver miners  stocks have enjoyed an epic year  skyrocketing higher with silver s new bull market  At best since mid January alone  some of these elite stocks had actually septupled  Naturally such extreme gains beg the question of whether they can possibly be fundamentally justified  The recently released second quarter financial and operational results of the top silver miners offer much insight on this 
Back in mid December leading into the Fed s first rate hike in 9 5 years  silver was pounded to a dismal 6 4 year secular low  Sentiment was overwhelmingly bearish  the breeding ground of major bottomings  Indeed silver soon started climbing with its primary driver gold heading into 2016  As usual silver got off to a slow start  with traders skeptical until gold rallied far enough and long enough to entice them back 
In Q1 16 silver really lagged gold  with a weak 11 7  advance to gold s 16 1   Once silver bulls get underway in earnest  silver tends to amplify gold s upside by 2x to 3x  And that already started happening in Q2 16  which saw silver surge 21 4  higher on a mere 7 4  gold rally  This acceleration is what ignited silver stocks  Was their buying fueled purely by greed  or did it have real fundamental underpinnings 
This crucial question for investors couldn t be addressed until mid August  when silver miners  Q2 16 results were fully released  Publicly traded companies in the US are required by the Securities and Exchange Commission to report their earnings four times per year  The deadline for filing is 45 days after quarter ends  I first looked at gold miners  Q2 results  then gold juniors   and now it s silver miners  turn 
Silver mining is a tough business geologically and economically  Primary silver deposits  those with enough silver to generate over half their revenues when mined  are quite rare  Most of the world s silver ore formed alongside base metals or gold  and their value usually well outweighs silver s  According to the venerable Silver Institute  only 30  of 2015 s global mined supply came from primary silver mines 
Well over 2 3rds of the 886 7m ounces mined last year was simply a byproduct of base metals and gold mining  And as scarce as silver heavy deposits supporting primary silver mines are  primary silver miners are even rarer  Since silver is so much less valuable than gold  most silver miners need multiple mines  And these often include non primary silver ones  usually gold  to bolster the lower silver mining cash flows 
So the universe of major silver miners is pretty small  The definitive list of these companies to analyze comes from the most popular silver stock investment vehicle  the Global X Silver Miners  NYSE SIL   SIL dominates the silver stock ETF space  with net assets running 5 0x its next largest competitor s  Since ETF investing is becoming the new norm  inclusion in SIL is a major boon for silver mining companies 
While there aren t a ton of silver miners to pick from  major ETF inclusion shows silver stocks have been vetted by elite analysts  It also ensures the fund capital flowing into leading silver stock ETFs benefits their components  The ETF managers shunt excess differential buying pressure on their shares directly into the underlying component silver miners held by these ETFs  bidding their individual silver stocks higher 
As of the middle of this week  SIL included 21 major  silver miners   This term is used somewhat loosely  as SIL includes the massive silver streamer Silver Wheaton Corp  NYSE SLW  that doesn t actually mine  Mexico s giant mining conglomerate Industrias Penoles for which silver is just a minor byproduct  gold miner Alamos Gold which doesn t mine any silver  and MAG Silver which doesn t have its silver mine in production yet 
Nevertheless SIL is what we ve got  so I dug into the Q2 16 10 Q reports released by this ETF s top 17 components  That number was chosen because that many stocks fit neatly into this table below  But with these top 17 SIL components commanding fully 97 2  of SIL s total weighting  they are really all that matters  I collected a bunch of key data from each  and fed it into a spreadsheet for sector wide analysis 
This table starts with market level information including each SIL component s stock symbol  exchange traded on  current weighting in SIL  and market capitalization  After that is a critical metric for investors looking for purer silver mining exposure  the percentage of each company s quarterly sales that actually came from silver mining  Silver stock investors generally want silver exposure  not gold or base metals 
The formula for this silver percentage approximation is simple  Each company s Q2 16 silver production is multiplied by that quarter s average silver price  and the result divided by total quarterly revenue  This number isn t perfect  it can be skewed  Sometimes silver miners sell more or less silver in a quarter than they produced  due to the timing of actual sales  Byproducts and hedging can also pull this number around 
The true primary silver miners that derived over half their Q2 16 revenues from silver have percentages highlighted in blue  That column is followed by cash costs per ounce of silver mined  all in sustaining costs per ounce  and AISC guidance for full year 2016  Next comes quarter end cash balances and the cash flows generated from operations in Q2 16  Finally last quarter s silver and gold production is noted 
Provocatively there isn t a single major silver miner today that doesn t generate a large portion of its total sales from gold mining  That s both as a byproduct in silver mines and in separate primary gold mines the silver miners also own  Pure silver miners don t exist  Depending on your view  they are either all augmented by gold or adulterated with it  That helped silver miners  fundamentals improve dramatically in Q2 16 

When I last did this top SIL component analysis using Q1 16 data several months ago  7 stocks qualified as primary silver miners with over half their quarterly sales from silver  All of the top 17 SIL components that provided enough data to compute their silver percentages averaged out to 44 9   I figured that as silver s gains started outpacing gold s  these key numbers would rise  But they were essentially flat in Q2 16 
Only 6 of the top 17 SIL components generated 50   of their revenues from silver last quarter  and the average only rose modestly to 45 3   This may sound rather odd considering silver s average price rose 12 7  sequentially from Q1 to Q2  compared to just 6 3  for gold s  That didn t translate into a higher overall silver percentage because these silver miners collectively increased their gold output quarter on quarter 
Overall silver production of these top miners impressively rose 4 6  in Q2 compared to Q1  to 77 852k ounces  But their collective gold production growth even exceeded that  up 6 1  quarter on quarter to 1273k  Silver miners  outpacing gold mining growth was driven by their active diversification into gold  The cash flows from silver mining are rarely spectacular  since silver s price is always low relative to gold s 
And that perpetual disparity of cash flows between silver and gold mining ballooned to gaping extremes in the recent dark years  As silver languished near major secular lows  silver miners sought to augment their cash flows by buying gold mines  Naturally this process takes time  as it isn t easy to find a suitable acquisition target  prepare and execute the purchase  and integrate the new mine into current operations 
This trend is far from over  as gold mining s far higher cash flows really reduce the operational risks of silver mining  Tahoe Resources Inc  NYSE TAHO  is a prime example  Spun off by Goldcorp Inc  NYSE GG  as a totally pure silver miner operating one of the world s largest silver mines  Tahoe bought the gold miner Lake Shore Gold and is now overwhelmingly a primary gold producer in terms of revenue  Silver purity is fading among its miners 
Since some of these elite silver miners use gold as a byproduct credit  its sales directly reduce the costs of mining silver  This is evident in silver miners  costs last quarter  which fell considerably  Cash costs are the classic way to measure silver mining costs  They include all direct production costs of mining silver  mine level administration  smelting  refining  transport  regulatory  royalty  and tax expenses 
Cash costs are the acid test measure of silver miner survivability  revealing the silver levels needed to keep the doors open and pay the bills  Incredibly in Q2 16  they averaged just  5 32 per ounce  This was not only far below silver s  16 79 average price  but a whopping 11 2  lower than Q1 s cash costs  This is almost exclusively due to higher byproduct credits  primarily gold but also base metals in some cases 
Far more important are the elite silver miners  all in sustaining costs  This vastly superior measure was introduced in June 2013 by the World Gold Council  In addition to all direct cash costs  AISC also add on everything necessary to maintain and replenish operations at current silver production levels  This includes exploration for new silver to mine  mine development and construction  remediation  and reclamation 
All in sustaining costs also include the critical corporate level administration that oversees silver mining operations  In Q2 16  the top 17 SIL silver miners reporting AISC had average levels of just  10 05 per ounce  That s 2 2  better than Q1 s average  but far more importantly way below that  16 79 average silver price in Q2  That implies the silver mining industry s operating margins have soared to  6 74 per ounce 
That s a staggering 46  jump sequentially in Q2 alone  a massive increase  This stock market leading surge in operating profitability helps explain why silver stocks were bid sharply higher in Q2  Profits ultimately drive stock price levels  and silver mining profits were exploding as silver s new bull started to accelerate  The sole reason investors own silver stocks is for their great profits leverage relative to silver 
Silver mining costs are essentially fixed in the mine planning stages  That s when mining engineers decide which ore bodies to extract  how to dig to them  and how to process that ore to recover the silver  The vast majority of these costs of moving and processing rock are fixed  they don t change much no matter what silver s price does  This ensures silver mining profits soar far faster than silver s own gains 
At AISC near  10 per ounce  silver miners earned about  7 in Q2 16  Yet so far in Q3  silver s average price has powered up another 17  to  19 69  Thus silver mining operating profits are likely now up near  10 per ounce  another 43  gain  The higher silver runs  the greater the profits growth the silver miners will enjoy  And silver remains relatively low  with its young bull market still having lots of room to soar 
Back in 2012 for example before the Fed s wildly unprecedented open ended third quantitative easing campaign started grossly distorting the markets  silver averaged  31 19  While that s only another 58  higher from Q3 16 s average price  such silver gains would fuel a gargantuan 219  jump in operating profits from Q3 levels  The underlying fundamentals of mining silver definitely support big stock price gains 
These rapidly improving silver mining fundamentals are readily evident in silver miners  operating cash flows and cash balances  Cash flows from operations are the best proxy of current profitability  as the trailing twelve month price to earnings ratios of silver miners are now extremely distorted by huge non cash writedowns  These accounting construct losses flared in late 2015 thanks to silver s deep secular lows 
One of the core tenets of accounting is conservatism  which demands companies anticipate possible future losses but not gains  So Q4 15 s low silver prices had to be assumed to persist indefinitely  slashing the economic value of silver mines and deposits  These were written down  with resulting non cash losses flushed through income statements  Until these writedowns roll off trailing P Es  they will mask real profits 
Quarterly cash flows generated from operations are the purest measure of actual profitability  avoiding all the short term accounting fictions inherent in the GAAP earnings that feed P E ratios  And in Q2 16  these elite top SIL components  operating cash flows skyrocketed a mind boggling 135  quarter on quarterto  1449m  This is truly all the fundamental justification silver stocks need for their massive Q2 gains 
These radically higher operating profits naturally fed growing cash hoards among the top silver miners  Their total cash on hand at quarter end soared 69 6  sequentiallybetween Q1 and Q2 to  3537m  This proves that there was far more than greedy sentiment underlying silver stocks  epic gains so far this year  This young new silver bull has already vastly improved the economics of extracting this precious metal 
Unfortunately most investors don t yet understand what s going on in the silver mining realm  Not many even pay attention to contrarian investments like silver stocks  And many of those who do are scared of the silver miners  super high or nonexistent trailing twelve month P E ratios  They don t realize that once last year s big non cash writedowns roll off the latest 4 quarters  silver mining P E ratios are going to collapse 
By the time trailing P Es reflect true ongoing operating profitability in future quarters  the silver stocks will have surged much higher than today s levels  Digging deep into quarterly reports is necessary to really understand what s going on in an industry  as trailing valuation metrics mask major reversals in fortune for up to a year  Silver miners  immense growth in operating profitability remains hidden to all but a few 
Another thing investors must consider is where the silver stocks came from  Since gold drives silver  the silver stocks follow the gold stocks  Back in mid January  the leading gold stock index slumped to a truly fundamentally absurd 13 5 year secular low  As I warned that very week  it was ludicrous for gold stocks to be trading as if gold was near  305 when it was actually way up at  1087  Silver stocks were sucked in 
Precious metals sentiment was so overwhelmingly bearish that silver stocks were trading as if they were on the verge of bankruptcy  That was a silly assertion even then  as their cash costs and even all in sustaining costs were well below even silver s deep secular lows  Silver stocks had to mean revert much higher out of such unsustainable extremes  and that s exactly what has happened so far in 2016 
So when silver stocks  enormous year to date gains are considered  it s critical to realize they emerged out of some of the most extreme silver stock lows ever witnessed  This year s mighty rallies were born in epic fear  not mounting greed leading into a topping after a long bull  Since a huge mean reversion higher out of such extremes was inevitable  silver miners  fundamental justification is just icing on the cake 
Silver miners  latest quarterly results recently released for Q2 prove that they are not only fundamentally strong today  but rapidly strengthening  This entire industry that was left for dead in late 2015 is going to see some of the best operating profits growth by far in all the stock markets in 2016  helping to justify the epic gains in silver stock prices this year  They are rooted in real profits growth  not ethereal sentiment 
As silver stock prices continue to rise in coming quarters  fueled by soaring earnings driven by higher silver prices  great gains are still to be won  While SIL is fine  the largest gains will be witnessed in individual silver stocks with superior fundamentals  Investors need to look for the elite miners with the best combination of percentage of revenues from silver  operating margins  and coming silver production expansions 
And man  what an incredible gift this past month s sharp silver stock correction is  Many of the world s best silver stocks were pummeled 20  to 30  lower since their latest bull highs in early August  They are now on sale at deep discounts  wonderful buying opportunities  If you liked silver stocks a month ago when everyone else did  you should love them today at far superior entry prices  Talk about a great boon 
The bottom line is the major silver miners just reported an amazing Q2 16  with silver s young new bull fueling radically higher operating earnings  The great inherent leverage of silver mining profits to silver prices was the fundamental justification underlying silver stocks  epic gains so far this year  And with silver s bull only just starting  the best gains in silver mining profitability and thus stock prices are yet to come 
Unfortunately most investors don t yet realize what s going on fundamentally  They see silver miners  extreme or non existent price to earnings ratios and assume this industry is really struggling  But once last year s massive non cash write downs of silver mining assets roll off the books  the silver miners  big operating profitability will be reflected in conventional valuations  Smart investors will be fully deployed long before ",2016-09-04,Adam Hamilton,https://www.investing.com/analysis/silver-miners’-q2’16-fundamentals-200151704,200151704

Meanwhile  most junior resource investors choose companies with more traditional  explore develop produce  models  There is little doubt that this model can work and that it can generate fortunes for early investors  However it is also a model that is high risk since it requires a lot of time and capital to develop 
There are cases where long term investors made little to no money  or they lost money  despite the fact that the project in question is a success  A great example of this is Romarco Minerals  The Haile project is a high quality multimillion ounce deposit  but due to the amount of time and capital it took to prove this out  Romarco Minerals had more than a billion shares outstanding  While most very early shareholders made money  it was not enough to justify the wait given the high risk of investing in junior resource companies  Most shareholders who bought during the last upcycle  2009 11  or subsequent to that lost money despite the derisking that was taking place    and despite the takeover by Oceanagold Corp   TO OGC   a multi mine regional producer  Southeast Asia Oceania  with global aspirations  One can always point to company specific issues  as well as cases in which companies have gotten into production quickly and without blowing out the share structure  e g   Tahoe Resources  NYSE TAHO   however there is no denying the risks and difficulties of following this model 
Time To Rethink Conventional Approach
The above listed three companies  among several others  operate under the assumption that these risks merit a proactive rethinking of the explore develop produce model  with the goal of reducing the amount of time and or capital it takes to get into business 
The explore develop produce model cannot be eliminated  but there are plenty of models that work within it or alongside it  Two are worth mentioning 
Narrow The Focus Of The Business
The first is to narrow the scope of the business  The full extent of the value chain starts with rocks in the ground and ends with a marketable product  By working on adding value through just one piece of the value chain  companies reduce the complexity of their businesses and their capital costs  A great example of a success story here is Dynacor Gold Mines  TO DNG   which is a toll miller  It doesn t mine  rather it buys ore from local artisanal miners and processes it  The company has done very well  having generated profits in every year of the precious metals bear market and having grown its business  Dynacor has no debt  a tight share structure and rapid growth potential  We cannot simply attribute Dynacor s success to its model    after all  Inca One Gold  V IO  is struggling with a similar approach    but we must attribute at least some of the company s success to the aforementioned benefits of focusing on a smaller than normal piece of the value add chain 
 Startup Picks
There are two start ups that I like that employ a somewhat similar model  More important  their management teams developed models geared toward mitigating timeline and capital risks  Great Lakes Graphite is buying graphite that it will process at its Matheson  Ontario  micronization facility  Micronized graphite is a saleable product or it can be further processed into material that is used in  among other things  lithium ion batteries  The company is selling graphite even while other non producing companies got a 2  year head start  The one thing these competitors have in common is that they are all looking to build mines and participate in a larger piece of the value add chain  from ore in the ground to processed graphite ready for industry  The capex estimates for these projects are consistently above  25 million  usually above  100 million  and sometimes even above  250 million quite a large fraction of the value of the entire graphite market 
Medallion Resources is looking to purchase monazite sand a rare earth phosphate mineral that is concentrated as a byproduct during heavy mineral sands mining operations  Heavy mineral sands are beach sands that are mined and processed for the production of titanium  zirconium and hafnium  among other things  This monazite material is treated as tailings  though it contains a much higher percentage of rare earths than any rare earth mine or proposed mine  It has also been processed for its rare earths and thorium in the past  meaning the processes are known and the operating risk is mitigated 
Invest Passively In Projects
The second approach is to invest passively in projects  Usually this means holding a royalty or a stream  though it can also be a free carried interest in a project  Royalty and streaming companies come with several advantages  and the performance of the major players  stocks over the long run speaks to this  But what makes the model    as opposed to the asset qualities    attractive from a derisking simplification standpoint is the fact that streaming companies don t have to put up any capital once they ve acquired the royalty stream  except when it is specified and agreed to by the royalty streaming company  usually to help finance a project expansion  e g   Silver Wheaton s  NYSE SLW  Salobo stream    Royalty and streaming companies benefit from all of the capital expenditures by its mining partners for as long as there is production or some other form of development  The mining companies do the development work and assume the risk of cost uncertainty  while the royalty streaming partner has no capital costs and fixed  low no operating costs 
Get In Early
Companies that have been successful in developing non conventional resource businesses have seen tremendous investor enthusiasm  We ve discussed Dynacor and the major royalty companies  all of which have generated outsized long term returns and appear on resource investors  radars 
But when such companies are early stage the market tends to overlook them  Investors in early stage companies want something familiar  and for junior resource investors this means the explore develop produce model  If they are looking at an early stage junior then what is familiar is generally a deposit or a geological anomaly that indicates that there is a heightened probability of finding a deposit  A toll processor such as Dynacor or a graphite processing and marketing company such as Great Lakes Graphite cannot show this to the market  both companies actually have exploration projects  though the development of these projects is peripheral to their respective business plans   In addition to the fact that these non conventional companies actively work to mitigate certain risk factors  this heightened potential for investors to overlook such stories can create market disparities worth exploiting 
The Bottom Line
While resource investors are drawn to companies that work within a standard explore develop produce model  there are excellent opportunities in companies that don t utilize this model  Companies develop new models  for the most part  to combat the capital and timeline risks that come with the standard model  There are various approaches  of which we think two are worth your consideration  The first is to purchase material  rather than mine it  for further processing and marketing  The second is to invest passively in projects being developed via the conventional explore develop produce model  such as through a royalty  stream  or  rarer  via a free carried interest  These are certainly not risk free approaches  but they do address the aforementioned capital and or timeline risks  indicating that such businesses are inherently less risky  at least from a general standpoint  An added risk is that the advantages that are apparent to us are not readily recognized by or marketable to investors  but this is a double edged sword as it means there are hidden gems waiting to be found by those willing to step outside of the box and look for them ",2016-09-23,The Gold Report,https://www.investing.com/analysis/rethinking-resource-investing-200155260,200155260

100732,322247,WPM,First Majestic Silver Soars,opinion,"First Majestic Silver  NYSE AG  has been one of the world s best performing stocks in 2016  nearly quintupling at best in recent months  This outstanding Canadian silver miner runs extensive operations in Mexico  and is one of this metal s purest producers  Despite its blistering run this year  First Majestic remains incredibly well positioned to greatly leverage silver s mean reversion higher  Investors should take a look 
First Majestic Silver s amazing fundamentals won me over as a fan years ago  and I definitely have a dog in this fight  As silver was grinding along near major secular lows late last year  we recommended a new long term investment in First Majestic at  3 20 in our monthly newsletter  Then in mid January as silver stocks languished  we added another new First Majestic trade at  2 51 in our weekly newsletter 
First Majestic Silver trades on the NYSE under the awesome symbol AG  That is of course the chemical symbol for silver on the periodic table of elements  deriving from the ancient Latin word for silver argentum  Founded in 2002 by its current CEO Keith Neumeyer  First Majestic has steadily grown into one of the world s elite powerhouse silver miners  And that s no mean feat  silver mining is a tough industry 
The geology and economics of silver mining are very challenging  making major primary silver producers a rare breed  The great majority of the world s known silver deposits were formed mixed in with gold or base metals  And the revenues derived from mining these other metals usually dwarf those from silver  relegating it to mere byproduct status  Indeed most of the world s silver production is simply a byproduct 
The venerable Silver Institute gathers the best global fundamental data available on silver  Its highly anticipated report on silver supply and demand in 2015 was just released in early May  Last year  a staggering 70  of world silver mine supply came as a byproduct from mining other metals  Less than a third of the 886 7m ounces of silver mined last year came from primary silver mines  let alone primary silver miners 
Most of those primary silver mines are owned by companies that aren t primary silver miners  Though they sometimes have  silver  in their names  the majority of their revenues are usually from gold  Out of the top 17 elite silver miners in the flagship SIL Global X Silver Miners ETF  NYSE SIL   only 7 generated over half of their Q1 16 sales from silver  And First Majestic Silver enjoyed a commanding lead on that desirable list 
Fully 69 5  of its revenues in this year s first quarter came from silver  which crowned it the purest major silver miner in the world during that slice of time  This well exceeded the silver percentages of even Silver Wheaton  NYSE SLW  and Pan American Silver  NASDAQ PAAS   granting First Majestic Silver exceptional leverage to silver prices  And it is widely respected and owned by professional investors  as evidenced by its broad major ETF inclusion 
First Majestic is not only one of the top components of that dominant SIL silver miners ETF  but is also included in the flagship GDX VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF  NYSE GDX  and VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners  NYSE GDXJ   Inclusion by the managers of these elite top ETFs is the gold standard for silver miners  gold miners  and junior gold miners respectively  So First Majestic has been heavily vetted by the best 
This company operates fully six silver mines in Mexico  Santa Elena  La Parrilla   grill    Del Toro   bull    La Encantada   enchanted    San Martin  and La Guitarra   guitar    Mexico is a fantastic place to explore for and mine for silver  It s not only geopolitically stable  but it is close to the US and Canada and easy and relatively cheap to operate in  And Mexico has been a global silver powerhouse for centuries 
Mexico was the world s top silver producing country in 2015  responsible for over 1 5th of global mined supply  And this is nothing new  Ever since the Spanish colonials swarmed Mexico s shores in the 16th century  silver production has been massive  It s believed that fully one third of all the silver ever mined in the history of the world came from Mexico  It s long been the epicenter of global silver mining 
Ask any hardened prospector where the best place to explore for silver is  and he ll reply where it has already been found  Miners have spent centuries scouring Mexico s rugged hills for silver  and have left extensive past workings  But since their technology was radically inferior to modern mining s  they literally just scraped the surface  They mined the most obvious veins  but left most of the silver behind 
Fascinatingly  there have been multiple silver miners who have actually included old tailings piles in their mining plans  The waste rock discarded by miners of centuries past often still has very high grades of silver by current standards  Mexico is the best place in the world to mine silver  so it has been First Majestic s sole target  Many economies of scale and efficiency result from focusing in a single country 
First Majestic s excellent portfolio of Mexican silver mines all have very fascinating histories  but it s their collective economics that make this company so attractive to investors  They produced 11 1m ounces of pure silver in 2015  along with enough byproduct gold  lead  and zinc to boost silver equivalent production to 16 1m ounces  While some diversified miners produce far more silver  this is major for a primary miner 
But even more important than First Majestic s excellent production profile is its low costs  Last year was a rough one for silver  where it averaged just  15 68 per ounce  And it slumped to a major 6 4 year secular low in mid December leading into the Fed s first rate hike in 9 5 years  The resulting silver sentiment wasteland was so brutal that investors grew concerned about the very viability of primary silver miners 
Just as the true mettle of sailors only becomes evident in the fiercest storms  2015 severely tested silver miners  managers  And First Majestic passed through that maelstrom unscathed  Last year it was able to mine silver at cast costs of just  7 87 per ounce  That s the acid test measure of how low of silver prices a silver miner can temporarily bear  Mid December s  13 69 secular low never posed a threat at all 
Far more realistic are all in sustaining costs  which include all expenses necessary to both maintain and replenish operations at current production levels  That runs the gamut from exploring for new deposits to replace depleting ones  developing and building mines  and reclaiming old exhausted ones  Last year First Majestic reported AISC of just  13 43 per ounce  This was well below silver s low average levels 
And if First Majestic could earn healthy 14  operating margins even at last year s dismal silver prices  its profits are going to skyrocket as silver recovers and inevitably mean reverts higher in its new bull market  Silver miners enjoy strong profits leverage to rising silver prices because their mining costs are largely fixed  They are mostly determined up front in the planning stages before mines are even constructed 
Geologists and mining engineers have to target specific ore bodies for extraction  figure out the lowest cost way to dig to them  and determine the process to recover the most silver from that ore  These costs persist no matter what silver is doing  they don t rise proportionally with silver prices  Thus growth in mining profits greatly amplifies silver s gains  which is what makes silver stocks so alluring for investors 
In early 2016 First Majestic provided guidance for this year s operating results  It expects to produce at midpoints of 12 7m ounces of pure silver and 18 8m ounces in silver equivalent terms including its byproduct metals  Those are excellent 14  and 17  year over year production gains  First Majestic isn t just an elite primary silver miner  but a growing one  This company has always focused on expanding 
But even more exciting than First Majestic s projected production growth in 2016 is this year s guidance on costs  This company expects to mine its silver at all in sustaining costs at a midpoint of just  12 83 per ounce  That s 4 5  lower than 2015 s results  even though the silver price will almost certainly prove to average far higher this year  So First Majestic s operating margins are set to soar dramatically 
Silver averaged  14 90 in Q1 16  barely off Q4 15 s secular trough average of  14 77  As I explained in an essay in late April  new silver bull markets often get off to a slow start due to the way gold dominates silver psychology  Speculators and investors don t return to silver until after gold has already rallied far enough for long enough to convince them a sustainable new upleg is underway  So silver lags gold 
But once silver excitement inevitably starts building  silver s gains soon surpass those of its primary driver gold  So far in Q2  silver has averaged a much higher  16 55  First Majestic s profits will leverage these gains  In Q1 16  this company produced 3 1m and 5 1m silver and silver equivalent ounces at incredible all in sustaining costs of just  8 97 per ounce due to higher byproduct production and gold prices 
When First Majestic projected 2016 way back in mid January  it used very conservative assumptions of silver and gold averaging just  14 and  1000 this year  So as Q1 s results revealed  this company s all in sustaining costs are likely to come in far under its projections in 2016  This will lead to exploding profits as silver continues mean reverting higher  This is readily evident across Q4 15 and Q1 16 results 
At Q4 15 s average silver price of  14 77 and First Majestic s AISC of  11 28  this company earned  3 49 per ounce of silver mined  That s pretty darned impressive for a major secular trough quarter in silver  But even though the average silver price only rose 0 9  to  14 90 in Q1 16  First Majestic s far lower AISC of  8 97 due to far higher gold byproduct credits made for a  5 93 profit  That s a staggering 70  higher 
There s no doubt silver and gold will continue mean reverting higher on balance out of last year s ugly central bank conjured extreme lows  That means higher selling prices and lower all in sustaining costs for First Majestic Silver  I don t know how high silver will go  but it averaged  19 05   23 80  and  31 19 in 2014  2013  and 2012  So these are all very conservative non overshoot mean reversion targets for silver 
Assuming First Majestic s AISC come in around  10 per ounce this year due to the higher gold prices  this yields huge per ounce profits potential of  9 05   13 80  and  21 19  Those are staggering 159   295   and 507  rocketings from Q4 15 s levels  The potential profits growth First Majestic is very likely to enjoy in this new silver bull is epic  And naturally that will lead to far higher prices for First Majestic s stock 
First Majestic Silver is one of the best performing stocks out of all the precious metals miners this year  Between mid January and its latest high in mid May  AG has skyrocketed an unbelievable 381 3  higher in just 3 9 months  Enjoying a near quintupling in a matter of months is very rare even in this volatile sector  After such a blistering catapult higher  investors are naturally wondering if it is too late to buy AG 
This next chart offers some crucial insights on that important question  It looks at First Majestic Silver s stock price in recent years along with key technical lines including its 50 day moving average  200dma  and 2 5 standard deviation Bollinger Bands  superimposed on the silver price  Considering the secular low extremes AG has just recovered from  a quintupling is merely a totally justified mean reversion rally 

Back in mid January  AG slumped to a brutal 6 3 year secular low  With silver not far off that 6 4 year secular low of its own  investors  sentiment was so exceedingly bearish that they continued to doubt the very survivability of the primary silver mining industry  In a rather amazing testament to how bad things were in precious metals stock land  AG s secular low was actually pretty mild compared to most of its peers  
That same day AG bottomed  the flagship HUI NYSE Arca Gold BUGS Index dropped to an extraordinary 13 5 year secular low of its own  As I pointed out that very week  such gold stock and silver stock levels were truly fundamentally absurd even with prevailing gold and silver prices  The very day of that bottom when everyone was panicking  I recommended buying AG along with 5 other elite gold and silver miners 
Remember that silver averaged  14 77 in Q4 15  and First Majestic still posted all in sustaining costs way under that at  11 28 per ounce  So it was quite literally ridiculous for AG to trade as if this company was going out of business on January 19th when silver slumped to  14 03  Along with its peers  stocks  First Majestic s should never have been that low  Such fear was radically too extreme to be sustainable 
So a massive mean reversion higher in AG s stock was inevitable  And that s indeed all that s happened with First Majestic s stock  While a quintuple in a matter of months sounds excessive without context  AG has only mean reverted back up to a mere 26 8 month high at best  This elite primary silver miner has simply regained already low early 2014 levels 
Now if First Majestic s stock had just quintupled to a major secular high late in a multi year bull when extreme greed abounded  such blow off gains would be a screaming sell signal  But seeing the same thing off major secular lows ludicrously defying First Majestic s fundamentals when everyone had left it for dead is a radically different scenario  Extreme gains off secular lows signal the births of major new bulls 
As you d expect with a primary silver miner  First Majestic s stock amplifies silver s moves because they directly affect its profitability  AG s gains and losses relative to silver s over every major swing in recent years are highlighted on this chart  as well as AG s leverage to silver prices and how long each swing took  Since silver mining stocks are far riskier than owning silver itself  they must leverage its gains to be worthwhile 
AG has seen 6 major uplegs in recent years  but the last two were too anomalous to be considered as representative of average potential  In early 2015 AG surged dramatically while silver stayed flat  and of course in early 2016 AG mean reverted out of those secular extremes  Excluding these latest episodes of extreme upside leverage  AG averaged a healthy 2 7x upside leverage to silver in its recent bear years 
That s pretty impressive considering the super bearish sentiment plaguing silver and its miners  stocks between 2013 to 2015 as the Fed wildly distorted the markets  Odds are AG s upside leverage to silver uplegs will improve with investors  sentiment becoming far more bullish  They will be looking for elite silver stocks to amplify silver s gains  leading them to deploy more capital in AG than in the recent dark years 
And with First Majestic s profitability already starting to explode with higher silver prices and higher gold byproduct prices lowering costs  this stock is destined to surge a heck of a lot higher on balance in the coming years  AG s all time high of  25 61 was seen in April 2011 as silver blasted towards  48 in a blow off popular mania peak not atypical for this super volatile metal  AG s potential going forward is far better 
During that peak Q2 11 quarter  First Majestic only produced 1 8m silver equivalent ounces at cash costs of  8 32  That was a couple years before June 2013 when the World Gold Council first introduced all in sustaining costs  so this superior metric was unavailable then  In Q1 16 First Majestic produced 5 1m silver equivalent ounces at  5 00 per ounce cash costs  183  higher and 40  lower than around AG s peak 
With vastly more production and much lower costs  AG stock should easily break through to major new all time highs in the coming years as these new silver and gold bulls mature  So although buying AG above  10 is nowhere near as fantastic as buying near  3  great upside remains in this amazing primary silver miner  First Majestic s incredible fundamentals point to massive profits growth in the coming years 
There s one more little thing I d like to share about First Majestic Silver that s really cool  It actually sells its own mined silver in custom minted First Majestic coins  ingots  and bars  I ve always advocated every investor have a core portfolio foundation of 5  to 20  in physical gold and silver in their own immediate possession before ever investing in stocks  It s wonderful to see First Majestic encourage physical investment 
The bottom line is First Majestic Silver is one of the world s greatest primary silver miners  It has built a fantastic portfolio of mining operations in Mexico  silver mining s epicenter for centuries  First Majestic concentrates on producing silver at low costs  which enabled it to easily weather the severe testing of last year s deep secular silver lows  It never faced any existential threat  despite what its low stock price implied 
First Majestic s operating profits are exploding this year as silver recovers and mean reverts higher  Its already low costs are plunging due to surging byproduct credits from higher gold prices  The near quintupling in First Majestic s stock in recent months is not only fundamentally justified  but it s likely only the beginning of a major new bull market likely to last for years  It s not too late for investors to get deployed ",2016-06-07,Adam Hamilton,https://www.investing.com/analysis/first-majestic-silver-soars-200134340,200134340
100733,322248,WPM,Are We Nearing The End Of The EU Experiment ,opinion,"If you re a serious investor and because you re reading this  I have to assume that you are gold is looking more and more like a crucial trade  Fewer than two weeks remain before United Kingdom voters decide on whether the country will continue to be a member of the European Union  EU  or become the first ever to leave it  The  Brexit   as it s come to be known  is arguably the most consequential political event of 2016 perhaps even more so than the U S  presidential election in November with far reaching implications 
Should the U K  leave  it will certainly underline the question many people have about the EU s viability  And remember  this is a group of countries that collectively has the world s second largest gross national product  GDP   followed by China 
But whatever happens   the European Union is not going to remain the same   as Aram put it during the webcast   The euro is still very unstable  and I think we could easily see an environment in which trade barriers will increase and currency wars will increase  Regrettably  we could have a weaker global economy  
With this as the threat   gold s role is one of wealth protection   Aram said 
Taking Precautions Against an Unknowable Future Even Europeans are beginning to lose confidence in the European experiment  The Pew Research Center recently polled nearly 10 500 Europeans from 10 separate EU countries on their favorability of the 28 member bloc  Nearly half of all respondents 47 percent held an unfavorable view 
Trust in the European Central Bank  ECB  continues to falter as well  In a blistering note titled  Deutsche Bank  called out the central bank for  threatening the European project as a whole for the sake of short term financial stability   The ECB s actions have  allowed politicians to sit on their hands with regard to growth enhancing reforms   The longer the bank persists with a negative interest rate policy  the more damage it will inflict upon Europe  Deutsche added  Meanwhile  Frankfurt based Commerzbank is considering stashing physical cash in pricey vaults instead of keeping it with the ECB  whose policies are cutting into bank profitability 
Speaking to the World Gold Council s Gold Investor newsletter this month   criticized the ECB s negative rate policy  saying   If you repeatedly bring down interest rates to try and persuade people to spend today rather than tomorrow  it works for a while  But they become increasingly resistant to being asked to spend their resources now rather than save for the future  
Like Aram and others  Governor King sees gold as a likely solution 
 There is clearly a need to take some precautions against an unknowable future   he said  which is the same argument for having health insurance 
Negative rate policies are having a huge effect on bond yields  as you can see below  Over  10 trillion worth of government debt across the globe carried a negative yield as of the end of April   In a tweet last week  legendary bond guru  called it  a supernova that will explode one day    In Switzerland  three quarters of all government bonds right now actually charge investors interest  Real harm is being done to retirees  who have had to pick up part time work at Walmart  NYSE WMT  or become Uber drivers to offset lost interest on their savings and pensions 
This is prompting investors to look elsewhere  including the U S  municipal bond market  which has attracted  632 billion in assets this year alone as of June 1  Of that amount  more than  22 billion has flowed into muni mutual funds  the best start to a year since 2009  Between that year and the end of 2015  the amount of U S  municipal debt held by foreign investors climbed 44 percent  validating its appeal as an investment with a history of little to no drama  even during times of economic turmoil and periods of rising and lowering interest rates 
 1 400 Gold this Summer 
Joining Aram in seeing the Brexit as further proof of impeding economic troubles is billionaire investor George Soros  After a hiatus of conducting any personal trading  the 85 year old is back in the game this time with some bearish investments  In the first quarter  he purchased a  264 million stake in Barrick Gold Corporation  NYSE ABX   the world s largest gold producer  and a million shares in precious metals streaming company Silver Wheaton Corp  NYSE SLW   It appears he s added to both positions  indicating a bet against the broader equity market 
Now  with a Federal Reserve rate hike looking more and more unlikely this month  gold is expected to resume its bull run  according to Australia and New Zealand Bank Group  ANZ  commodity strategist Daniel Hynes  This  along with a possible Brexit  could push the yellow metal to  1 400  a price we haven t seen in three years this month 
Paradigm Capital also sees the rally picking up where it left off in May  noting that gold s trajectory so far this year resembles the one it took in 2002  the first full year of the last bull market  which carried the metal to  1 900 in 2011   The resemblance is rather striking   Paradigm writes 
The investment dealer forecasts gold to reach nearly  1 400 by year end after a dip in October  It also maintains its position that this particular bull run will peak at  1 800 sometime during the next three to four years  Whether or not this turns out to be the case is beside the point  Savvy investors not to mention central banks and governments recognize gold s historical role in minimizing the impact of inflation  negative rates and currency depreciation  This is what I call the Fear Trade  and I always advocate up to a 10 percent weighting in gold that includes gold stocks as well as bullion  coins and jewelry 
Catching Up with Sectors and Industries Because we re near the halfway mark of 2016  I thought you d be interested to see what the top performing sectors and industries were for the year so far 
As for sectors  utilities is on top  delivering more than 15 percent so far  Jittery investors  worried about slow global growth and geopolitical threats  have moved into defensive stocks such as water and electricity providers and telecommunications companies  many of which offer steady dividends in a low yield world  Financials  as you might imagine  have been hurt by interest rate uncertainty 
Below I ve highlighted the 10 best performing industries for the year  and interestingly enough  metals and mining companies  particularly those involved in the gold space  lead all others  Spot gold is up 20 percent so far  but amazingly gold miners have doubled investors  money  Metals and mining companies have rallied more than 53 percent 
Many of the top performing companies this year had some of the biggest declines last year because of impaired balance sheets  To maintain their performance long term  they will need to show earnings

I want to see it get through the 11 70 2 zone  If it gaps up and runs on Thursday  it may very well start to run again  so I issued a new swing trade on it  I believe this one may be headed to 17 or 18  It has 3 days to cover short  It has a nice  overall technical picture  including OBV and volume 
Blucora  Inc   NASDAQ BCOR  is a swing trade that is working  after coming through the recent pullback very nicely  On Wednesday it was up 40 cents to 10 30  or 4   on 777 600 shares traded  It s approaching a multiple triple top area of resistance around 10 75  80  If it can get through that  I m looking for 12 3 4  maybe as high as 15  It has 4 75 days to cover 
Keryx Biopharmaceuticals Inc   NASDAQ KERX  is a swing trade that s going to work after a pop out  a pullback  and key resistance that was taken out on Wednesday  It popped 54 cents to 6 76  or 8 68   on 1 5 million shares  I want it to get through the recent highs near 7 00 to get up towards 8 00  Those are my two targets on this one  It has 15 12 days to cover 
Medivation  Inc   NASDAQ MDVN  is looking really well  For the first time in about 6 7 weeks it actually spiked up with a breakaway gap  and moved back above the moving averages  spiked and closed at the highs for the day on Wednesday  up 3 16 to 60 95  or 5 47   on 3 5 million shares  Technically  it needs to take out 62 87

100735,322250,WPM,4 Stocks To Watch  AMBA  CETX  SLW  TSRO,opinion,"It was a really nice snapback rally after the morning opening losses on Wednesday  and a good day for a lot of our stocks  particularly gold and silver  and some of the biotechs  Let s take a look at some of them 
Ambarella  Inc   NASDAQ AMBA  jumped 1 60 to 51 03  or 3 24   on 692 419 shares traded  The reason I put a swing trade on it on Wednesday is because it had multiple waves down  it built a base  broke out of the base  and formed a bull flag  It had a nice reversal day  For me  this could be the beginning of leg three  which could take it to mid 60s  It has a lot of room to run  Look for a potential move to the 59 60 61 area first  and then the mid 60s 
Cemtrex Inc   NASDAQ CETX  has been acting great  On Wednesday it had another surge of 22 cents to 3 93  or 5 9   on 295 814 shares traded  That was somewhat light volume  I think that if it gets over the 4 05 range in what looks like a big wedge  it could go vertical up towards 5 5 15  even as high as 5 50 
Silver Wheaton Corp   NYSE SLW  bounced 96 cents to 25 61  or 3 89   on 9 1 million shares on Wednesday  It may be five waves up  or three waves and it will pull back and complete the fourth wave  and then the fifth wave could potentially take it up to 28  It has very intriguing action 
Tesaro  Inc   NASDAQ TSRO  continues its winning ways  up 5 86 to 90 26  or 6 9   on 3 million shares on Wednesday  Ever since the big breakaway gap  it s trending  It looks like a 100 dollar stock short term

100736,322251,WPM,4 Stocks To Watch  AG  NEO  TWLO  VUZI,opinion,"It was a sloppy day on Wall Street on Wednesday  The markets were due for a pullback  The oscillators got to plus 166 on McClellon  and they did get a pullback  Towards the end of the day  the Nasdaq 100 was much worse than the S P 500  which I   m not clear whether that   s a negative divergence with the NDX not confirming the S P 500  or the S P 500 with a positive divergence  and leading to what could be a shallow retest  and then more upside  For now  let   s take a look at some stocks that are leading the way 
First Majestic Silver Corp  NYSE AG  is one of the best silver stocks out there in terms of percentage moves  for sure  having gone from the January low about 2 40  all the way up to Wednesday   s high over 17  It closed at 16 91  up 1 50  or 9 7   on 7 85 million shares  and looks like it just broke out again  I can see this extending into the mid 20 s at some point  I look for a midchannel target around 19  Very impressive stock 
NeoGenomics Inc  NASDAQ NEO  popped 20 cents to 9 36  or 2   on a million shares on Wednesday  I put a swing on it  The long term pattern is incredible in this market  and Wednesday it reached new  all time highs  I think we have a stock that is going to 10 1 2 and 12 1 2  It has 4 7 days to cover  which could help 
Twilio Inc  NYSE TWLO  is on fire  It gapped and ran 3 95 to 42 25  or 10 3   on 8 5 million shares on Wednesday  reaching a high of 42 75  It s coming out of a wedge  With the angle of ascent  we may see mid 50s in this stock  For now  look for 48 50 short term  and mid 50s intermediate term 
Vuzix Corp Cmn Stk  NASDAQ VUZI  had a great day on Wednesday  up 76 cents to 7 85  or 10 7   trading more than 1 7 million shares  That   s the biggest volume this stock has ever traded  It   s coming up to a resistance line  If it gets through here it should quickly get to 9 1 2 3 4  and then the secondary target is 12 1 2

100741,322256,WPM,Stock Picks For Silver s New Bull Market,opinion,"By the reckoning of market watchers  the silver bull has arrived  The Gold Report takes a look at what some of the experts predict for the silver price going forward and for companies poised to benefit from the upswing 
The Outlook Like gold  the price of silver has surged following Britain s vote to leave the European Union  with investors purchasing the  safe haven  metals to protect wealth in the event other markets falter  According to an article published on July 19 on INN Daily  the silver price has gone up more than 43  year to date   leap frogging ahead of gold post Brexit  
Southern Silver Exploration Corp   V SSV  will be a big winner 
Frank Holmes of U S  Global Investors  in a July 11 post  notes that silver tops his  Periodic Table of Commodity Returns  for the first half of 2016   Silver demand had a phenomenal 2015  with retail investment and jewelry fabrication both reaching all time highs   Holmes wrote  Add to that an increase in demand for silver for photovoltaics  and now Brexit  and the first half of the year has  has been highly constructive       Holmes notes that some experts believe the silver price will reach between  25 and  32 per ounce by year end  The metal currently trades for   19 90 ounce 
Though optimism is prevalent  investors can expect some volatility  Because silver is both  currency and commodity   used in a variety of industrial and other uses  its value is  more highly correlated with stocks  than the value of gold  INN Daily reports 
Great Panther Silver Limited  TO GPR  is focused on maintaining low operating costs across its existing asset base 
The potential for volatility is also reflected in the comments of technical analyst Clive Maund  who declared the silver bull market underway on July 11  While his optimism was clear  Maund did note that a correction could come into play   If you are a long term investor  you may simply decide to ride out any correction   the analyst wrote  But short term investors might want to  take some money off the table here if  they  are long the sector  taking advantage of the comparatively high prices now prevailing  
The Companies A number of companies are positioned to benefit as the silver bull continues  As expert David Kranzler explains in the Mining Stock Journal        mining stocks are a  derivative  of gold silver  meaning their intrinsic value as companies is derived from the price of gold silver  They are leveraged plays on the price of the metals  
As such  any silver company is positioned to benefit from a rise in silver price  Kranzler s case in point is Southern Silver Exploration  which he believes is  significantly undervalued relative to the size of its silver reserve  It will be a big winner   Southern Silver Exploration is a Canada based explorer with two major projects  one in New Mexico and the other in the Mexican state of Durango 
Golden Arrow Resources Corp  s  V GRG  Chinchillas may contain half a billion silver equivalent ounces 
Southern Silver has also captured the attention of Vicarage Capital  which noted in a June report that the company has  an experienced board of directors and strong management team with a good track record in project exploration  discovery and development  
In the wake of Great Panther Silver s Q2 16 production results  Heiko Ihle of Rodman   Renshaw released a report that outlined the reasons behind a target price increase to  2 25 share  among them a  fully stocked  treasury following a recent bought deal equity financing  stable production at San Ignacio and the company s focus on maintaining  low operating costs across its existing asset base while continuing to evaluate strategic external growth opportunities   Ihle noted that Rodman   Renshaw has not increased its  silver price deck from  17 50     any such changes should benefit companies with meaningful silver production such as Great Panther  
We view MAG Silver Corp  s  TO MAG  Juanicipio project as  without doubt  the best undeveloped silver asset globally 
Raymond James  NYSE RJF  resumed coverage of MAG Silver as of July 11   We view the Juanicipio project  MAG  44   as  without doubt  the best undeveloped silver asset globally  Our thesis for MAG is reinforced  quite simply  by the exploration upside offered at Juanicipio and elsewhere  Cinco de Mayo  and a lack of broader high quality silver focused investible opportunities   analyst Chris Thompson noted in the report   We see MAG trading at a developer discount to producers  and  primed  to rerate catalyzed by development progress and or exploration success   Raymond James also included MAG on its list of preferred silver equities in its July 21 Q2 16 Precious Metals Preview 
Raymond James also covers Endeavour Silver  TO EDR   a July 11 report by analyst Chris Thompson noted that Endeavour Silver delivered better than expected production results for Q2 16  surpassing Raymond James  estimates by 13   The stronger metal price environment is changing investment decisions  leading to increased capital spending   Capital spending across EDR s producing assets is budgeted to increase to  17 4 mln  from  11 3 mln  with a focus on development access to new ore sources   noted Thompson  adding   At Guanacevi  EDR has made a production decision to develop a new mine at the Santa Cruz Sur orebody for total capital budget of  8 4 mln over 3 years  
The stronger price environment also led Endeavour Silver  TO EDR  to reverse a planned production reduction   Given the improved metal price environment  management has elected to sustain production levels at 1 500 tpd and no longer ramp down to care and maintenance  at El Cubo  by year end   Thompson commented 
Another company positioned to benefit from an uptick in silver price is Golden Arrow Resources  V GRG   which recently released an updated resource estimate for its Chinchillas project in Argentina   The updated resource estimate now also contains a maiden measured resource estimate of 17 million silver equivalent ounces  bringing the total M I resources to 155 million  silver equivalent ounces    expert Thibaut Lepouttre noted in Caesars Report in June  Lepouttre expects Chinchillas may contain  half a billion silver equivalent ounces  
Credit Suisse  SIX CSGN  upgraded Silver Wheaton Corp   NYSE SLW  to Outperform 
Silver Wheaton is also levered to the silver price  In Raymond James  July 21 Q2 16 Precious Metals Preview report  the firm named Silver Wheaton a top pick both as a silver equity and a streamer  Credit Suisse upgraded Silver Wheaton at the end of June from Neutral to Outperform  Analyst Ralph Profit noted   While CRA tax risk likely continues as an overhang  SLW s business model still provides investors with a highly levered play on precious metals prices and SLW should still command a multiple in line with royalty valuations and a premium to precious metals miners based on its leverage to underlying prices  free cash flow  and strong balance sheet  ",2016-07-27,The Gold Report,https://www.investing.com/analysis/what-experts-predict-for-the-new-silver-bull-market-200144450,200144450

100769,322284,WPM,4 Stocks To Watch  CAB  CC  INO  MITK,opinion,"The market was weird on Thursday  It was up  they had a nice rally in the morning  they rolled over just after the lunch hour  and got slammed dunked right into the close  with a negative tick of 1526  indicating a weakness or thrust to the downside I think there may still be some downside to come  Although a minus 1526 reading may lead to some snapback  Tomorrow is going to be important  because if it ends up being sharply lower  there could be some negative results next week as well  Just play what you see  For now  let s go over some stocks that looked good on Thursday  starting with some gold stocks 
Cabela s Incorporated  NYSE CAB   a swing trade of ours  is still in play and acting better  up just 9 cents to 52 28  on 592 895  but it finished in the plus column  and the volume is steady  I still like the inverse head and shoulders  pop  and little flag  If Thursday s high at 53 71 gets taken out  the targets are 55  and then 59 
The Chemours Company  NYSE CC  has another little consolidation  and the recent pullback for one day held the 8 68 area  and has held it for five days  It was up 27 cents to 9 46  with a high of 9 92  or 3   on 2 8 million shares  The volume picked up as it moved up through the highs  It seems like it has more to go  The target is 12 1 2 
Inovio Pharmaceuticals  Inc   NASDAQ INO  just keeps pushing and pushing and pushing  For the last two weeks it s been up almost every day  It was up 25 cents to 11 18  or 2 29   on 2 1 million shares  with a high of 11 69  A swing target was on it a little bit higher  If it gets through that  and it accelerates  it can get up to 12 1 2 14  perhaps even 15  but be careful  With 6 32 days to cover  and having broken across the April 2015 highs  it may very well get up to 13 short term 
Mitek Systems  Inc   NASDAQ MITK  was up 1 06 to 7 31  or 17   on 2 8 million shares  The high was 18 cents higher at 7 49  This stock hasn t reached this level since 2013  and before that the high was 13  and change  So the target going forward is a retest of the 7 70 area  It may see that tomorrow  It may need some consolidation before it pushes up into the teens

100770,322285,WPM,Silver Miners Strong In Grim Q4,opinion,"The silver miners showed impressive fundamental strength during 2015 s grim fourth quarter  That was the worst silver suffered in many years  a perfect storm trough with major secular lows fueling extreme bearish sentiment  Traders feared this entire industry faced an existential threat  so they fled in terror from silver stocks  But silver miners  strong operational performances aced that severe trial with flying colors 
Q4 15 may seem like ancient history now  but it was exceedingly important for the entire precious metals realm  Gold slumped to a miserable 6 1 year secular low in mid December  on the day after the Fed hiked rates for the first time in 9 5 years  That was wildly irrational based on market history  which has proven gold thrives during Fed rate hike cycles with big average gains  Gold hadn t seen lower prices since Q4 09 
Since silver s overwhelmingly dominant driver is gold  the white metal followed the yellow metal lower  Just several days before gold s secular low in mid December  silver dropped to a dismal 6 4 year secular low of its own  Q4 15 s average silver price of  14 77 was the worst since Q3 09 s  14 72  Silver was perfectly fulfilling its traditional role of acting like a gold sentiment gauge  tracking its driver into the abyss 
With silver spiraling lower with gold and the vast majority of analysts predicting that trend to continue indefinitely  the silver miners were assumed to be fighting for their very survival  As dismal silver prices squeezed their operations  hyper bearish sentiment and the resulting super low stock prices made it almost impossible for them to raise capital  Q4 15 was one of the roughest quarters silver miners ever faced 
Thus it s important to understand how the silver miners actually fared operationally during their darkest quarter  Just as fierce storms prove the mettle of sailors  so do extreme market situations reveal the true health of companies  Was the silver mining industry on the verge of bankruptcy in Q4 15 as widely feared  Or were the silver miners stalwartly weathering that super storm without even taking on water 
I ve wondered about the silver miners ever since silver s deep secular lows in December  but couldn t investigate properly until they had fully reported their Q4 operational results  While quarterly results are normally due out 45 days after quarter ends  Q4 is an exception with a 90 day deadline  That s because Q4 results must be fully audited by CPA firms to feed into the massive and challenging to prepare 10 K reports 
With auditors universally swamped  many silver miners didn t get around to reporting their Q4s until late March  I carved out the time to start wading into their voluminous 10 Ks in mid April  prompted by a subscriber urging me to get on it  Even though Q1 16 reporting is now upon us  Q4 15 remains a very important baseline quarter to consider before analyzing Q1 results  It was an acid test for the silver miners 
Silver mining is a difficult sector to analyze  Pure silver deposits are fairly rare  with the vast majority of the world s silver production coming as a byproduct from base metals and gold mining  So primary silver mines are relatively scarce compared to all the mines that produce silver  And most companies billing themselves as silver miners produce gold in such quantities that they really aren t primary silver miners 
The logical way to classify miners  primary metal is by the percentages of revenues they derive from the metals they mine  If a majority of a miner s sales come from a single metal that isn t silver  then it really isn t a primary silver miner  Of course this definition is fluid with silver prices  The lower silver falls  the less weight silver sales have within overall revenues  And Q4 15 certainly hit an extreme on that front 
At that trough quarter s average silver and gold prices of  14 77 and  1105  the cash flows from silver mining lagged far behind gold mining  Compare a mid sized silver miner with a mid sized gold miner  which might produce 10m ounces and 300k ounces a year respectively  At Q4 15 s average prices  this silver miner only yields annual sales of  148m while the gold miner brings in a far higher  331m a year 
Most silver miners also produce gold  both because it is naturally found with their silver deposits and because its strong cash flows greatly improve the economics of silver mining  So any list that anyone constructs of  primary  silver miners at these low prevailing silver prices is going to include lots of gold  Silver miners have even diversified into gold in recent years by purchasing new gold dominated mines 
The least controversial roster of silver miners to analyze comes from the leading silver mining ETFs  The flagship one is the SIL Global X Silver Miners ETF  NYSE SIL   It contained 20 holdings in mid April  and had almost an order of magnitude more assets than its distant second place competitor the SLVP iShares MSCI Global Silver Miners ETF  NYSE SLVP   And all but 1 of SLVP s 10 component companies are also included in SIL 
This table looks at the operational fundamentals of SIL s top 17 holdings in that grim Q4 15  Together they comprise nearly 97  of SIL s weighting  Each company s symbol  exchange  weighting in SIL  and mid April market capitalization is noted  Unlike the leading gold stock ETFs  SIL really isn t market cap weighted  That s perfectly understandable  given its components  varying fractions of revenues from silver 
The next column shows the approximate percentage of each company s Q4 15 sales actually derived from silver  I had to compute this in several different ways depending on what each company reported  Some broke out actual Q4 silver production  gold production  and revenues individually  while some simply lumped it all in to full year 2015 results  In the latter case  those full year numbers were divided by 4 
With Q4 15 being the worst quarter for silver prices in over 6 years  the degree to which all these miners are primary silver miners was abnormally low at that trough  As silver continues rallying and naturally outpaces gold  these percentages should generally rise in future quarters  Nevertheless  all these main SIL components that truly qualified as primary silver miners with 50   of their sales from silver are highlighted 
The next columns are cash costs per ounce  all in sustaining costs per ounce  and AISC outlooks for 2016  These numbers weren t always available for silver since about a quarter of SIL s components consider themselves primary gold miners  The fact that SIL s managers chose to include them in their silver miner ETF emphasizes what a rare breed actual primary silver miners have become these days 
That s followed by each component s cash balance at the end of Q4 15  the operating cash flows that were generated in that trough quarter  and the actual silver and gold produced that quarter  Again if a company didn t break out its Q4 results from its full year 2015 s  I divided by 4 for an approximation  The variability in the way silver miners report results makes getting comparable numbers somewhat complicated 

Of these top 17 SIL components  just 6 were actually primary silver miners in Q4 as defined by earning over 50  of their revenues from silver  The purest silver plays were the mighty silver streamer Silver Wheaton  NYSE SLW   First Majestic Silver  NYSE AG   Fortuna Silver Mines  NYSE FSM   Endeavour Silver  NYSE EXK   and Pan American Silver  NASDAQ PAAS   But with an overall average of 47 5  silver sales even with Q4 s extreme silver lows  SIL s list is impressive 
Once again as silver prices recover  these percentages of revenues from silver should generally rise in future quarters  But that s not true universally  Some of these SIL silver miners are buying or merging with primary gold miners  which will further dilute silver s importance to their revenues and therefore their stock price s leverage to silver gains  Tahoe Resources  NYSE TAHO   SIL s largest component  is the prime example 
Tahoe was originally a spinoff from Goldcorp  NYSE GG  to create an amazing totally pure primary silver miner to develop its fantastic Escobal deposit in Guatemala  That was advanced into the world s third largest silver mine  But with Tahoe since buying Rio Alto Mining and its Peruvian La Arena gold mine just over a year ago  and Lake Shore Gold and its Canadian Timmins West mine a month ago  it s now a different company 
Tahoe s latest 2016 outlook projects midpoint gold production of 400k ounces in 2016  along with 19 5m ounces of silver  At  1250 and  17 prices  that yields projected revenues of  500m and  332m  While Tahoe s evolution into a primary gold producer makes it a much stronger company  it is definitely a lot less attractive for investors looking for silver centric exposure  True primary silver miners are becoming rarer 
Q4 15 s sub  15 average silver prices were believed at the time to be putting severe stress on silver mining s viability  But that was just the extremely bearish sentiment talking  as that quarter s operating results proved that was far from the fundamental truth  The silver miners in SIL reporting cash costs had an average of just  6 68 per ounce  Some of these numbers are silver only  some are after byproducts 
Cash costs are the acid test measure of silver mining survivability  They are the direct costs  excluding corporate level management  necessary to continue operating existing mines  Theoretically the silver miners could ve continued paying the bills in Q4 15 even if silver had catastrophically cratered into the  7s  So  15 silver wasn t even remotely close to being an existential threat  that misguided thesis was dead wrong 
Far more interesting were the all in sustaining costs the silver miners reported in that grim trough Q4  They are way more relevant since they include all costs necessary to sustain and replenish current silver production levels  This is critical since silver mines are constantly depleting  If companies can t find new mineable economic deposits to offset the exhaustion of existing ones  their businesses aren t durable 
AISC include all direct cash costs of mining silver  as well as corporate level administration that always should ve been included in misleading cash costs  They also include exploration for new silver to mine  mine development and construction expenses  remediation  and reclamation  All in sustaining costs are a far superior measure to cash costs  as they reveal the true costs for silver miners to continue as going concerns 
Amazingly the elite silver miners of SIL reported average Q4 15 all in sustaining costs of just  13 14 per ounce  Again since these silver miners report so differently  some of these numbers are silver only while some use gold as a byproduct credit  Nevertheless  that was well below Q4 s average silver price of  14 77  It was even considerably under silver s dismal 6 4 year secular low of  13 69 in mid December 
Such low AISC are simply stunning  shattering Q4 15 s myth that silver miners were on the ropes  Even in that grim trough quarter  silver miners earned an average of  1 63 per ounce even after all of the big costs they needed to maintain current production levels  That s actually a profit margin of 11   which certainly isn t high but is still better than plenty of other industries  Silver miners never faced an existential threat 
And if silver miners fared so well even in Q4 with all the cards stacked against them  their profits are going to explode as silver recovers  While silver lagged gold s recovery in Q1 and only averaged  14 90  it started to catch up in March as silver investors returned  Like gold  silver s price is overdue to mean revert dramatically higher as markets recover from the Fed s gross distortions running rampant in recent years 
In 2015  2014  2013  and 2012  silver averaged  15 68   19 05   23 80  and  31 19  Since the costs of mining silver are largely fixed during the mine planning stages when specific ore bodies are targeted and recovery methods defined  silver price increases generally flow right through to the bottom line  As silver mean reverts back to these recent year average levels  silver mining profits will literally explode 
At Q4 15 s  13 14 all in sustaining costs  silver mining profits would catapult to  2 54   5 91   10 66  and  18 05 per ounce at recent years  average silver prices in reverse order  Those represent enormous 56   263   554   and 1008  skyrocketings in operating profits for mere 6   29   61   and 111  gains in silver prices  Silver miners  upside profits leverage to silver price increases is mind boggling 
Since profits ultimately drive stock prices  this profits leverage is the main reason why investors in the beaten down silver stocks are going to earn great fortunes in the coming years as silver mean reverts higher with gold  Interestingly silver miners are still working hard to lower costs too  so their potential jumps in profits will be even larger  SIL components  average projection for silver AISC in 2016 is just  12 86 
Snapping back to that grim reality of Q4 15  these silver miners generally had plenty of cash on hand even emerging from that miserable trough quarter  Even better  they generated positive cash flows from operations in Q4 even with silver languishing near those major secular lows  And in many cases  these operating cash flows were relatively fairly large and contributed substantially to growing cash balances 
As long as any company can generate positive cash flows from operations  it can remain in business indefinitely  And with the exception of the one silver explorer in this table  MAG Silver  NYSE MVG  which doesn t have any producing mines yet  all these silver miners generated positive cash flows in Q4 15  This yet again proves that the extreme bearish sentiment plaguing silver miners late last year was totally unfounded 
The final couple columns in this table look at each company s quarterly silver and gold production  At Q4 15 s average prices of  14 77 and  1105  each ounce of gold produced was worth nearly 75 ounces of silver  Every single silver producer in SIL also mined gold  Although this dilutes their exposure to silver upside  it certainly makes these companies stronger and more resilient from a fundamental perspective 
Silver miners  Q4 15 results were very strong considering silver s deep secular lows  Contrary to what the epically low silver stock prices suggested  the silver mining industry was actually quite healthy even at sub  15 silver  Fundamentals always trump sentiment in the end  so investors should be flocking back to the still cheap silver miners  stocks before their extreme pricing anomalies of Q4 fully reverse 
Silver itself remains a coiled spring  ready to explode higher out of its recent deep lows  Silver fell far behind gold in recent years as the Fed s artificial stock market levitation sucked investment capital away from alternative investments led by gold  And history has shown that after silver falls behind gold  it tends to blast higher as both recover with gains soon surpassing and ultimately far exceeding those in gold 
Gold is silver s dominant primary driver  and back in late February silver fell to its lowest levels relative to gold seen since 2008 s first stock panic in a century  After that previous extreme low pricing anomaly  silver soon started soaring  Over the next 2 4 years  it would skyrocket an astounding 443  higher as silver mean reverted from deeply out of favor to overshoot into euphoric widespread popularity once again 
But in order to see utterly massive gains on the order of 10x in silver miners  profits and therefore stock prices  all we need to see is a mere double in silver again   30 silver is not particularly high in the grand scheme at all  Remember silver averaged  31 19 in 2012 before the Fed s unprecedented open ended QE3 campaign radically distorted the markets  And 2012 was a correction year far below silver s peak  48 levels 
So silver miners  upside from here remains vast  Investors can certainly deploy capital in this sector via the SIL and SLVP ETFs  which are due for outstanding gains in the coming years  But these leading silver stock ETFs are heavily diluted with gold exposure  So an expertly handpicked portfolio of the best silver miners with superior fundamentals and silver leverage will really outperform this sector s leading ETFs 
The bottom line is silver miners were fundamentally strong even in silver s grim trough Q4 15  Despite the metal s major secular lows fueling hyper bearish sentiment  the silver miners were still producing at all in sustaining costs well under prevailing silver prices  This naturally generated healthy operating cash flows  feeding growing treasuries  The silver miners never faced the widely feared existential threat 
But their stock prices plumbed deep secular lows  acting like these miners were on the verge of failure  Despite their mean reversions out of those anomalous extremes already being well underway  silver stocks still have far higher to run as silver recovers with gold  Silver miners  profits should soar by an order of magnitude in coming years  resulting in similar fundamentally righteous gains in their still low stock prices ",2016-05-01,Adam Hamilton,https://www.investing.com/analysis/silver-miners-strong-in-grim-q4-200126973,200126973

100826,322341,WPM,Silver Wheaton  Q115 Results And Q2 Q415 Preview ,opinion,"Q115 results and Q2 Q415 previewIn broad terms  Silver Wheaton s  NYSE SLW  Q115 results were characterised by strong performances at San Dimas  Barrick and Sudbury  while production at Salobo more than doubled  consistent with its ramp up and increased SLW interest   These more than made up for declines in output at Penasquito and Yauliyacu  such that silver equivalent production exceeded 10Moz for the first time ever  Silver and gold prices remained at lower levels  However  a decline in sales of US 9 9m cf Q414 was more than offset by a US 11 0m decline in costs

Last Friday the stock gapped below the bottom black dashed S R line and back tested it at the end of the day  So on the very short term time frame  ABX is testing overhead resistance at 6 50 

The long term weekly chart shows the massive H S top ABX built out  which reversed its bull market  turning the uptrend into a downtrend as shown by all the consolidation patterns  The close on Friday marked ABX s lowest closing price since the bear market started in 2011 which is a milestone in its own right  You can see how the blue bear flag on the daily chart above fits into the bear market downtrend 

The 20 year monthly chart  below  shows the massive inverse H S bottom ABX built out in the late 1990sthrough the early 2000s which led to its bull market run  That major low came in around  11 
What this chart so clearly shows is that ABX has now taken out 2008 s major low and now the other major low as well  at the bear market bottom in the late 1990s  Note how the recent blue bear flag formed right on that important bottom rail in the 1990 s  signalling that if it broke to the downside  new lows would quickly follow 
As you can see  ABX has been in free fall since the break below the bottom rail of the blue bear flag and the horizontal support and resistance line at  11  This move down could very well mark the capitulation move is underway 

Let s look at the 30 year monthly chart for ABX  below  which shows how important that late 1990s   early 2000s bottom is  I ve labeled is as the support and resistance line  The number one rule in Chartology is that once an important support line is broken to the downside  it then reverses its role and acts as resistance on any counter trend rally  That S R line is almost 25 years old which makes it very important 
There is one other piece of Chartology on this long term monthly chart  and that is the neckline extension rail that I took off of the 2000 inverse H S bottom and extended all the way out to the right hand side of the chart  The black arrows show how it has reversed its role several times  from resistance to support and back to resistance again 
The bearish setup here on this very long term chart shows how ABX formed the blue bearish rising wedge on top of the neckline extension rail and the red bearish rising flag formed just below it  which I ve shown in the past is a bearish situation  That neckline extension rail is the same concept that I ve been showing on the long term chart for gold where I extended the neckline  all the way out to the right hand side of the chart  made during the 2008 crash low  I find this chart a little scary  particularly once we broke below the all important 2000 low 

Newmont Mining Corporation  NYSE NEM  is another big cap PM stock that s not looking very healthy at the moment on the short term daily chart  After forming a six month bearish rising wedge  NEM broke to the downside  finding initial support at the August low  At this point it looks like it has broken down from a small red bearish rising wedge and is testing the previous August low again 

The weekly line chart for NEM  below  does a good job of showing you how support and resistance works  Initially  NEM bounced off its 2008 crash low  building out the blue bearish rising wedge  After cracking the 2008 crash low late last year  NEM put on a surprising rally that broke back above the 2008 crash low which looked like it may have legs to run higher 
As you can see though  it barley moved above the top of the blue bearish falling wedge where it put in a double top that reversed the little counter trend rally which I m sure trapped a lot of gold bugs looking for higher prices 
The initial low  made late last year  worked as resistance two weeks ago  as shown by the black arrow  At the close of trading last Friday  NEM made a new multi year low on a closing basis 

Next is a weekly bar chart for NEM which shows how it s interacting with the 2008 crash low  It formed a small double bottom on the 2008 trendline  which led to a small counter trend rally where it built out a small double top  This led to our most recent multi year low  Note the one last backtest to the horizontal 2008 crash low trendline at 19 00  That s how you take out an important trendline  You get a bounce  followed by the break  and then one last test from below to complete the breakout process 


The 20 year monthly chart  below  for NEM shows a possible interesting set up from the long term perspective  NEM built out a big H S top that marked the beginning of the 2008 crash  After finding the bottom  NEM rallied right back up again to form a second H S top  which matches the first one in height  On this monthly chart I labeled the most recent consolidation pattern as a Diamond  Note the big breakout bar that occurred once the bottom rail of the blue Diamond gave way  then the subtly backtest last month to the 2008 crash low  There really isn t much support until the big bottom in 2000 is reached

Let s look at one last royalty company that was everyone s favorite stock during the bull market years  Silver Wheaton  NYSE SLW   This daily chart shows the triangle consolidation pattern that broke down in June  This stock illustrates one of the reasons I bought the Kamikaze stocks last week  As the ARCA Gold Miners Index  GDM  and Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF  NYSE GDX  are showing a possible H S consolidation pattern  SLW formed a small blue bearish expanding rising wedge pattern that I m looking at as a possible halfway pattern between the breakout from the black triangle to where the next low comes in 

There are several different ways we can look at the long term charts for SLW  Below is a weekly chart which shows the defining black dashed support and resistance line it s bullish above and bearish below 

This next long term weekly chart shows a possible expanding falling wedge  which SLW tested the bottom rail of again last week  This looks like a promising pattern but I m seeing similar patterns where the price action is breaking below the bottom rail  At this point the bottom rail has held support  which we have to respect 

When I look at the long term  monthly line chart for SLW  below  I don t get a warm fuzzy feeling that the worst is over for this darling among PM stocks  It formed a rather ugly double top that reversed its bull market  It then formed a six point blue triangle consolidation pattern which broke out to the downside and had a strong backtest  The strong backtest started at the S R line which was holding support from the 2007 high  If there was ever a place to look for some reverse symmetry  this monthly chart shows how it may play out  red arrows 

Some readers may remember this long term weekly combo chart for the HUI Gold ratio  Several years ago I flagged the  13 low as a very important low for this ratio  It seemed like it would never get down there but it did  whereupon it formed a small H S consolidation pattern on that low that goes all the way back to the beginning of the bull market for the HUI 
One would assume this point just had to be as low as this ratio could possibly go  right  Gold stocks versus Gold had finally bottomed  a 15 year round trip was finally over  Now the PMs could finally go up again  right  Surprisingly  the ratio has now hit  10  with no bottom pattern in sight as yet  

This last chart compares gold to the Philadelphia Gold Silver Index  XAU  which has the longest history of all the PM stock indexes we follow  This 30 year ratio chart  below  shows gold is still outperforming the XAU which is unbelievable in its magnitude 
Whatever happened during the 2008 crash had a profound impact on this ratio  Up until then this chart was money in the bank  Whenever this ratio got up to the blue line you would buy the PM stocks  When it got down to the red line  you would sell 
I marked the failure back in 2008 with the green circle around the blue arrow  That s when everything changed for this ratio chart  The under performance of the stocks that make up the XAU is truly amazing  As you can see  even to this day the XAU is still underperforming gold  This chart doesn t tell us what the issue is with the PM stocks  it only indicates that something is very wrong  Maybe someday we ll know the answer to that question ",2015-09-08,David Tablish,https://www.investing.com/analysis/big-cap-pm-stocks…can-they-go-any-lower--264318,264318
100828,322343,WPM,Mining Giant Glencore To Sell Gold And Silver Output To Pay Down Debt,opinion,"In an ironic twist of fate  the mining conglomerate Glencore  LONDON GLEN  is seeking to pay down its massive debt by selling future gold and silver output  While this is only part of its solution to pay down a third of its  30 billion in debt  it s quite interesting that the company is selling forward production of two of the most despised monetary metals in the Mainstream Media 
According to the Bloomberg article   
The company is seeking more than  1 billion in a so called precious metals streaming deal linked to some of its mines in South America  according to two people familiar with the situation  who asked to not be identified because the talks with potential buyers are private  The transaction is part of Glencore s broader restructuring to reduce its  30 billion debt pile by about a third and bolster its finances to withstand a continuing slide in commodities 
  The company produced 35 million ounces of silver last year and 955 000 ounces of gold from mines in South America  Kazakhstan and Australia 
The company s negotiations in the streaming deal are likely to attract interest from the small group of companies  such as Silver Wheaton Corp  NYSE SLW    that specialize in the transactions  which give miners upfront payments in exchange for metal that s later sold  Other companies involved in those kind of sales include Franco Nevada Corporation  TO FNV  
What wasn t stated in the article was the selling of a percentage of Glencore s gold and silver production was in fact a  Forced hedging strategy   Thus  Glencore s massive debt burden has forced them to sell their future gold and silver at bargain basement prices 
We must remember  Silver Wheaton pays between  4  6 for silver and  400 for gold in its standard   Glencore may start off by selling 10  of its gold production  but this might not be enough  According to the Bloomberg article 
Glencore could raise  1 billion to  1 5 billion by selling 10 percent of its gold output through streaming deals  Macquarie Group Ltd  said in a report Tuesday  That means there s  substantial scope  to conclude more of the transactions  the bank said  JPMorgan Chase   Co  analysts wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday that it sees the company being able to raise more than  1 billion 
Aside from its South American mines  Glencore could also look to sell a gold and silver stream from its Kazzinc project in Kazakhstan  BMO s Sterck said  Glencore owns about a third of the Antamina copper operation in Peru  Teck Resources Ltd  NYSE TCK   which has a 22 5 percent stake in the mine  previously said it would consider selling silver streams to increasing liquidity 

The interesting part of the quote above we need to highlight is   JPMorgan Chase   Co  NYSE JPM   analysts wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday that it sees the company being able to raise more than  1 billion  

How nice of JP Morgan to write a note to clients that Glencore could raise more than  1 billion to pawn off its gold and silver production at below bargain basement prices  I wouldn t be surprised if analysts at JP Morgan Chase   Co  advised Glencore to sell even more of its gold and silver production forward 
Glencore being forced to sell a portion of its future gold and silver production to pay down debt is just another irony in a sea of ironies now taking place as Central Bank propped up highly leveraged stock markets are on the verge of another epic collapse 
The majority of investors are not prepared for whats coming  As I stated in my previous article  There were 713 survivors on the Titanic of the total 2 229 passengers and crew  Thus  32  survived the sinking of the Titanic  whereas only 1 2  of investors have gold and silver lifeboats ",2015-10-01,Steve St. Angelo,https://www.investing.com/analysis/mining-giant-glencore-to-sell-gold---silver-output-to-pay-down-debt-266719,266719
100829,322344,WPM,Silver Wheaton  Materially Cheap Relative To Peers ,opinion,"Tax and other mattersOn 24 September  the Canada Revenue Agency  CRA  issued notices of reassessment of tax to Silver Wheaton  N SLW   The notices were not unexpected and were consistent with its earlier  6 July notice  in which it advised that it was seeking C 273m  US 205m  US 0 50 share  in tax and transfer pricing penalties for 2005 10  However  the 24 Sept notices did also quantify interest and  other penalties  at C 81m  US 60m  US 0 15 share   so that the total that it is seeking is C 353m  US 265m  US 0 66 share   Compared to this amount  the US 3 98 decline in SLW s share price since 6 July  notwithstanding a weak interim precious metals price environment  appears excessive and leaves SLW materially cheap relative to both its peers and even the operating gold mining companies  despite being associated with materially less cost and operating risk 

Otherwise  business as normalSilver Wheaton s Q215 results were noteworthy for records in both the production and the sales of silver equivalent ounces   the latter exceeding 10Moz AgE for the first time  In addition  Constancia became a material contributor  We anticipate group AgE production in H215 will be 11 6  higher than H1  largely offsetting recent declines in precious metals prices  and resulting in financial outcomes in Q3 and Q4 that are consistent with Q1 and Q2  In addition  there is also potential for inventory drawdown in H2 versus H1 after the temporary factors that disrupted the delivery of product from both San Dimas and Constancia were successfully addressed  In the meantime  the company has proposed an up to 20 2m share buyback programme to accrete value to shareholders

100830,322345,WPM,Precious Metals Sector Starting To Produce Some Winners,opinion,"Everybody who s owned gold and silver mining shares through a couple of cycles has their favorite story of the stock that took off and ran away  There was Glamis Gold  which rose from  1 to  40 in the space of a few years before selling out to Goldcorp  N GG   And Silver Wheaton  N SLW   which soared from  3 45 in 2008 to over  40 in 2011  And many  many more 
That s how mining shares   which are  as the industry likes to say  leveraged plays on gold and silver   behave when the underlying metals start to rise  And you only need to find and ride a few such moonshots to justify a lifetime of obsessing over your investments 
Now  after a brutal and interminable bear market  a few of the better miners and streaming companies are starting to show signs of that famous upside potential  Three examples   Silver Wheaton  Franco Nevada  N FNV  and Seabridge Gold  N SA  

There s no way to know whether this is a head fake in an ongoing bear market or the start of another  and long overdue  epic rise   which we don t want to miss  Either way  when that next bull market does arrive its initial stage will look like these charts  so the current action at least bears watching ",2015-10-27,John Rubino,https://www.investing.com/analysis/precious-metals-starting-to-produce-some-winners-269342,269342
100855,322370,WPM,4 Stocks Worth Looking At  NVAX  SLW  SWHC  TASR,opinion,"Yesterday the stock market had a nice rally in the afternoon after the morning dip  and the indices managed to close near the plus column  but it wasn t a very good day technically  The advance decline and up down volume were not good  and so it remains to be seen if the market is tired and still undergoing distribution  The stocks we re going to look at here certainly don t look like that 
Novavax  Inc   NASDAQ NVAX  is a junior biotech vaccination stock that has been great  particularly in the last few days  After breaking out and pulling back  it has run sharply from 5 82 to 7 43 in the last three sessions  It s at a key resistance zone at the top of the channel  so it may get a little bit of a pullback consolidation should it blow through there  The mid range target is 8 1 2 coming up 
Silver Wheaton Corp   NYSE SLW   one of my favorite silver stocks  was up 47 cents to 23 78  or 2   on 5 9 million shares  It recently broke out  pulled back  and ran up again  There is some initial resistance at 25 3 4  Through that  and it could test the early 2014 high of just under 28 
Smith   Wesson Holding Corporation  NASDAQ SWHC  came out with a big earnings report on Tuesday  and the whole down channel was broken as was the base pattern that had developed  The stock surged 16 1 2   or 1 65  on 9 5 million shares  and reached 12 00  my day trade target  At this point  we ll have to see if it gets through 12 12 05  because if it does  it could fill this gap up towards 13 13 25 roughly 
TASER International Inc   NASDAQ TASR  looks awesome  This swing trades continues to give  On Tuesday  it was up 1 55 to 26 91  or 6   on 4 4 million shares  I love the way the 3 1 2 week flag broke out on Tuesday  with a thrust of 4 1 2 million shares  The next target is 32 short term  and then 35 intermediate term ",2015-01-21,Harry Boxer,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/4-stocks-worth-looking-at:-nvax,-slw,-swhc,-tasr-239164",239164
100856,322371,WPM,Heiko Ihle  Back To Precious Metals Equity Investing Basics,opinion,"Investing in mining equities can get rather complicated but Heiko Ihle  managing director at H C  Wainwright   Co   says precious metals equity investors need to focus on just three criteria  jurisdiction  management and asset viability  In this interview with   he explains his rationale and discusses several of his preferred gold and silver names 

The Gold Report  Do you have a price forecast for gold and silver for 2015 
Heiko Ihle  Our long term prices for Gold and Silver are  1 200 ounce   1 200 oz  and  17 50 oz  respectively  We recently lowered those prices from  1 300 oz and  20 oz given current market prices 
TGR  What are the essentials of your investment thesis for equities in the junior gold space 
HI  We pay a lot of attention to three important things  location  management teams and the viability of the asset or assets 
TGR  Have you made any modifications to that investment thesis for 2015 

HI  Not really  That investment premise hasn t really changed  Those are the important things to look for 
TGR  What are you specifically seeking when it comes to management 
HI  It s people that you can trust  people who have delivered on promises  Some people promise that things will happen within a year but they have been saying that for the past three years  That is frustrating as an analyst because it messes with our models and it s hard to put faith into someone who has frequently disappointed the market 
TGR  What about jurisdiction 
HI  Places like Canada  Mexico or the United States are much easier to do business in than more challenging areas  such as Venezuela or Bolivia  That s just the way it is  The permitting process in North America may be a little bit tougher and a little bit more drawn out  but the odds of nationalization or prohibitive tax policies are substantially smaller 
TGR  Tell us more about the viability of assets 
HI  Some assets are much tougher than others  whether it s because of punitive government policies or permitting risks or just getting something financed because no one wants to finance assets in certain locales  I ve definitely seen some projects that I would shy away from 
TGR  Is your investment thesis for silver equities basically the same 
HI  While gold and silver don t trade in lockstep with each other given that gold is driven more by investment demand and silver is driven more by industrial use  there is generally a strong price correlation between the two  Most of the projects that we look at are silver projects with a gold component or gold projects with a silver component  There is certainly some overlap 
TGR  Tell us about some silver equities you re following 
HI  I follow MAG Silver Corp   AMEX MVG    TO MAG   It s a good company with operations in Mexico  I ve known President and CEO George Paspalas for a couple of years  He previously ran Aurizon Mines  which was bought by Coeur Mining Inc  NYSE CDE  in a bidding war  MAG Silver owns 46  of the Juanicipio silver project in Mexico as part of a joint venture with Fresnillo Plc  FRES LSE   an experienced silver miner there  I plan to visit Juanicipio next month  It s a good asset  The grades are phenomenal  Overall  I think it ticks off all the boxes that we look for when we recommend a company 
TGR  MAG Silver spent  4 6 million   4 6M  in 2014 on Juanicipio but it s going to be at least two more years before Juanicipio reaches production  Will it be worth the wait 
HI  If MAG Silver still owns its share of Juanicipio by then  I believe it would be  There is a good chance that Fresnillo simply takes MAG Silver over before that ever happens 
Our price target for MAG Silver is currently  7 78 per share   7 78 share  given the lowered commodity price deck 
TGR  What are some other silver names you follow 

HI  I also follow Alexco Resource Corp   AMEX AXU   which has a silver mine in the Yukon  It s a slightly more challenging asset given its streaming agreement with Silver Wheaton Corp  NYSE SLW   which limited profitability when silver was near  15 oz  Alexco s agreement with Silver Wheaton was recently renegotiated and over the next couple of months  assuming that commodity prices cooperate  I believe that the company may restart production  That means silver being in the  17 20 oz range  At the current silver price  the company can make money with production instead of just trading tonnage for dollars and not really coming out ahead 
TGR  The recent preliminary economic assessment there outlined a small  400 ton per day operation with a six year mine life  Is that enough to get investors excited 
HI  It s certainly exciting but I would focus on the bigger picture that you re going to have with the Flame and Moth deposits at site  coupled with the fact that there is a functioning mill that is fully permitted 
TGR  Can it raise money based on that story 
HI  It probably could if it wanted to  but my recent conversations with management suggest that it is not eager to finance in the near term  Instead  Alexco management has talked about selling a minority stake in Alexco s environmental remediation business as a means to raise money 
TGR  How much do you think that s worth 
HI  We have  35M in our model for the environmental remediation business and other non core assets  My price target on Alexco is  1 40 share 
TGR  Any other silver equities you d like to share with us 
HI  I ll chat a little bit about Great Panther Silver Limited  AMEX GPL   It has two main assets in Mexico  Guanajuato and Topia  which I went to see late in 2014  Guanajuato is producing silver at decent cash costs  Topia is slightly more challenging  It s fairly far from civilization  but in a higher silver price environment it should become an attractive asset 
TGR  Great Panther cut production costs in the third quarter of 2014  is that enough to make money at silver current prices 
HI  I believe the company can make money at current prices  And given its strong net cash position  I don t really see the company raising a serious amount of money unless it decides to make an acquisition and I m in favor of Great Panther making a meaningful acquisition  That would help the company diversify 
TGR  How would it finance an acquisition given that it does not have much cash flow 
HI  As of Sept  30  2014  Great Panther had  20 4M cash  That is a decent net cash position and it could issue more shares  It could likely make a  30M acquisition if the target was right  My price target on Great Panther is currently  1 10 share 
TGR  Perhaps one more silver name before we move on to gold equities 

HI  Avino Silver   Gold Mines Ltd   AMEX ASM  is a silver producer  It just put out good production numbers for 2014 from its Avino mine  For the full year  Avino produced 969 524 oz silver  5 180 oz gold and 307 417 pounds copper for a total of 1 34 million ounces  1 34 Moz  silver equivalent  Avino set 2014 guidance at 1 26 Moz silver equivalent  It s always nice to put out reports for Buy rated companies that beat our estimates  I think 2015 will be another good year for Avino  The company is commissioning Circuit 3  which should increase capacity by 1 000 tons per day  and the grade should remain similar to the previously mined ore  In fact  Avino could still make money in a slightly lower silver price environment  which is impressive  My price target on Avino is  2 share 
TGR  What are some gold names under coverage 
HI  One we follow is Paramount Gold   Silver Corp  AMEX PZG   Coeur Mining recently made a bid for Paramount 
TGR  Do you expect that bid to succeed 
HI  I m fairly confident it will  The bid makes sense for Coeur because it needs the San Miguel silver property  which is next door to Coeur s Palmarejo mine in Mexico that Coeur paid  1 billion for in 2007  The  146M it is paying for Paramount is very reasonable in comparison  Under the deal  Paramount will spin out its non Mexican assets into a new publicly traded company and Coeur would own just 4 9  of the new firm 
For the longest time there was a good arbitrage opportunity that essentially still exists  Right now you re paying  5 98 share for Coeur  You get 0 2016 shares of Coeur for each share of Paramount so that equals  1 20 each  You re only paying  1 26 for Paramount  In other words you re getting the spinoff company  which will own the past producing  open pit Sleeper gold asset in Nevada and  10M cash  for free as long as the transaction closes under the current terms 
TGR  Do you see a rival bid emerging 
HI  I don t think that will happen  The main asset here is San Miguel  which is worth the most amount of money to Coeur Mining because it already has a mill next door 
TGR  Any other gold names 
HI  Another one that I follow is Comstock Mining Inc  AMEX LODE  with a price target of  2 50 share based on a price deck of  1 200 oz gold and  17 50 oz silver 
Our target is based on 2 200 tons grading 0 29 grams per ton  0 29 g t  gold from the Lucerne mine in Nevada at an average recovery of 65   That should amount to 41 000 ounces  41 Koz  gold  Add in some silver and the total is roughly 45 Koz gold equivalent from Lucerne in 2015 
There may be some production from Dayton late in the year but we haven t factored any Dayton production into our model  Dayton production should grow over the course of 2016 until it reaches full production  probably in 2017  All together that leads us to a net present value calculation of about  223M for the firm as a whole 
TGR  What are some other companies that you believe have compelling narratives in 2015 
HI  One is Polymet Mining Corp   AMEX PLM  It s a very viable project in northern Minnesota  an area that needs jobs  Governments at all levels want economic development in that region  PolyMet is a long term story  There was a mine there before and the facility was used for decades 
TGR  Do you believe this will become a mine again 
HI  In the long term this could very well become a mine again 
TGR  What s your target on that one 
HI  The price target on PolyMet is still  2 share  The price target didn t go down very much when we adjusted our price deck  essentially because there are a lot of commodities such as Copper and Nickel for which we didn t adjust our price deck 
TGR  Any others 
HI  There s also Wellgreen Platinum  OTC WGPLF  in the Yukon  In our opinion  this is an interesting project  The Wellgreen project is still in the early stages of development  It is a big ore body that s close to surface  All in all  we could probably see production of nickel  copper and platinum at Wellgreen by 2018 2019  It s still in the early stages but that s why we re only assigning a 0 4 net asset value  NAV  multiple to the company  If you take the NAV of the deposit at face value it would be about  4 50 share  I like the management team  I ve met with them a number of times  I like the story  I have a price target of  1 80 share on it 
TGR  Do you have any insight for investors who might be looking to adjust their portfolios in preparation for this year 
HI  I think gold  silver and even base metals equities have a place in everyone s portfolio  The world is moving away from cash so it s good to have hard assets in your portfolio  I wouldn t make hard assets my only investment  but people who are currently underexposed to hard assets should certainly take a look at metals equities

100887,322402,WPM,Life Changing Opportunity In Gold Stocks ,opinion,"As a follower and participant in the Gold bull market from 2002 until now I can say unequivocally that the two most bearish periods sentiment wise in the bull market so far are the fall of 2008  and right now   Therefore  by definition  the two most profitable times to buy gold stocks were in the fall of 2008  and right now   This simple concept is incredibly difficult for most people to understand and put into action 
The media will always lead you astray when it comes to these phenomenal buying opportunities   In early 2009 it was an incredible time to pick up just about any asset you could think of  real estate  stocks  commodities  etc   But the overwhelming mood on TV and the Internet back then was bearishness at that epic buying opportunity   My second favorite glaringly wrong example from the media was the end of 2012 when the media was petrified of the fiscal cliff   For a month straight in December 2012 that s all you heard on CNBC  how the fiscal cliff was going to be terrible for stocks in 2013   But it turns out 2013 was an awesome year for stocks  and the bears in the media were 100  wrong 
What do early 2009 and late 2012 have in common   Both were the ends of periods that were bad for the markets   In 2009 of course it was the end of the epic stock market meltdown  and in 2012 it was a two year period from 2011 2012 where stocks didn t make a lot of head way   Instead of being bullish at the bottom though the media extrapolated these negative periods out into the future and predicted more bearishness to come   The media is always focused on the short term and in sensationalizing whatever is happening right now   This puts way too much emphasis on the current state of the market and forgets the cyclical nature of the market over the long term   So at the turning point in long term cycles they are always going to be 100  wrong and look foolish 
You can t listen to the average money manager these days either because like the media they are controlled by the tyranny of the present   They are slaves to quarterly performance  beating benchmarks  and siphoning profits from their customers who will go away if they lose money in the markets   Therefore they can t be involved in getting in too early in a bear market and sustaining losses over a long period of time   That will ruin their business prospects for the future and they will avoid that whenever possible 
I personally believe what we saw at the end of October was the capitulation of professional money managers who had assets in gold and gold stocks   They finally threw in the towel at a key tax loss selling time of the year and decided to get out of gold and gold stocks   The evidence for this is the surge in volume across gold and gold stocks and massive losses over a short period of time   That usually only happens when the big money gets out all at once   But they are human like everyone else   And combined with the fact that their actions are way more affected by short term performance  it s not surprising that we see massive liquidations of positions at the bottom of a trend  even by the  pros  
Let s talk about the life changing opportunity that those that are tied to the present are completely oblivious  Gold stocks are now at the tail end of a 4 year bear market if you go by the XAU gold stock mining index   Four year bear markets are typically brutal in gold stocks and this is one of the most brutal yet   But we know from the chart below that due to the cyclical nature of markets in general and of the gold market in particular  that what we should expect next is a bull market   And if its a bull market in gold stocks it should offer big gains 

Even during the secular bear market in gold from 1980 2000  the gold market went through cyclical bull markets that offered big gains for gold stocks   The 1993 1996 bull market is shown above and offered more than a 100  gain even though the secular trend for gold at that time was down 
Now starting in 2001 gold had shifted into a secular bull market which caused the bull market in gold stocks that launched in 2001 to be spectacular   This bull leg offered more than a 5 bagger for the XAU and even bigger gains for individual gold stocks   Then we got the 2008 meltdown  which produced the next epic buy point for gold stocks and a 3 bagger bull market   It was incredibly painful to buy at the depths of that 2008 bear market   But not only was there a 3 fold gain in the XAU  some of the individual returns on specific mining stocks during that period dwarfed anything else in the entire stock market   Silver Wheaton Corp  NYSE SLW  and First Majestic Silver Corp  NYSE AG  are two stocks that come to mine that had 20 baggers from their 2008 lows 
I personally didn t believe we would get another opportunity like 2008 in this gold bull market but here it is  staring us right in the face   And I think the prospects for this next bull run are truly mind boggling if you think about all the money that is going to come flooding back into this sector when the secular bull resumes ",2014-11-20,Justin Smyth,https://www.investing.com/analysis/life-changing-opportunity-in-gold-stocks-233211,233211
100888,322403,WPM,This Silver Miner s 20  Rally May Still Be Going Higher,opinion,"I often get ask   What does an ideal Power of the Pattern set up look like   For us an ideal set up has these common features  Support channel lines come into play  along with a Fibonacci support resistance level and a bullish or bearish wedge pattern is near completion 
When it comes to ideal pattern set ups  it didn t come much better than what presented itself 20 days ago  We started sharing two years ago that Silver could reach the  15 level  which would present a good buy point  see post here  
After waiting over two years for Silver to near the price zone   15  that interested us  Silver Wheaton  NYSE SLW  created what looked like a nice set up that we couldn t pass ignore  as it was hitting channel and Fibonacci support at the same time  A bullish descending triangle was about to end at  1  above  with few investors bullish Silver at the time 
Members picked up SLW 20 days ago due to this set up and since then a nice then break out and a nice gain have taken place   SLW is up over 20  more than SPY  in the past 20 days  
Is it too late to get in on this trade  A very nice risk reward entry point did come into play on 11 6  One thing that does stick out is this  Sideways channel resistance comes into hand around the  27 level  which is still a large percentage above current prices 

Last week I shared the  Monthly Silver  chart above  discussing that a bullish wick could be forming at dual support and the 23  Fibonacci support level  The month is not over with at this time  Should Silver end the month higher than it closed last night  it would appear that a bullish wick on a monthly basis took place at key levels ",2014-11-25,Chris Kimble,https://www.investing.com/analysis/this-silver-miner's-20-rally-may-still-be-going-higher-233690,233690

100891,322406,WPM,Precious Metals Stocks  Bear Remains In Force,opinion,"The Psychology of a Triangle
One can only draw so many lines on a chart before becoming completely confused on what trendline is actually important  Many will just start connecting two top points and two bottom points and calling it a pattern  That s not how you find a chart pattern  A chart pattern shows the fight between the bulls and the bears  Let s use a triangle as an example of the fight between the bulls and the bears in an uptrend 
If the stock is in an uptrend the first reversal point will be when the initial top takes place  This can be on any time frame  Next you need to see the bears take control and drive prices lower creating the first reversal point starting at the top  At some point the bears will run out of gas and the bulls will come charging back  rallying the price back up to another high that is slightly lower than the first reversal point number one high  before they run out of strength to move the stock higher  Once the lower high is in place you can put a number 2 under the first low inside the triangle 
I always put a 3 with a question mark 3   at the second high within the triangle  until I can see the bears retaking control and start moving the price lower again  This time the bears couldn t drive the price below the previous low  at reversal point number two  before the bulls took control again  Once the bulls took control  I can then take the question mark off the third reversal point  second high within the triangle  At this point  we have the first reversal point at the first top  the second reversal point at the first bottom  the third reversal point at the second lower high and now we wait for the fourth reversal point to reach the trendline that connects the first and third reversal points  Once that trendline is reached we can now label the fourth reversal point as the second higher low  A breakout of the top rail will then signal the bulls are back in charge in the dominant trend once again  Three things I like to look for on a breakout are an increase in volume  a possible gap or a nice long bar that is bigger than anything around it 
What I described above shows you the fight between the bulls and the bears that was a give and take event  A proper chart pattern needs to show these individual battles moving between the top and bottom rails of whatever chart pattern is setting up  Many inexperienced chartists will just start connecting tops and bottoms on a chart with no idea of the psychology that is needed to identify a true pattern 
It s the individual swings between the top and bottom trendlines that you need to identity in order to have a true chart pattern  Again just connection two high points and two low points  at random  shows you nothing of importance 
I took the time to explain how to identity the psychological makeup of a chart pattern  because you re about to see a ton of them on the precious metals stocks to follow  Put simply  Chartology is the study of charts and the psychology behind the charts 
           
Before we look at the individual precious metals stocks  I would like to start out by look at the Philadelphia Gold Silver index  XAU  as a proxy for the rest of the PM stock indexes  This first chart  below  is a 2 hour line chart that shows the correction that has been in place since the PM stocks bottomed in early November 
Keeping in mind what we discussed above  the first chart pattern shows a blue four point triangle consolidation pattern  Note how the price action transverses between the top and bottom trendlines  That shows how the bulls and the bears each took a shot to dominate this short term trend 
As you can see  the bulls won the fight when they were able to break above the top rail of the triangle  As the triangle formed in the uptrend the first reversal point had to start at the first high just as I described on the tutorial above  Note the near vertical move off of the fourth reversal point in the blue triangle that accompanied the breakout of the top rail  The bulls were clearly in charge as they were able to rally the XAU all the way up to the first reversal point in the top blue triangle before they ran out of gas 
Reversal point number one is where the bulls ran out of gas and the bears took over for a while  As you can see  the triangle at the top of the chart shows the battle that ensued between the bulls and the bears with each side winning and loosing ground  The main thing to understand is the individual reversal points within the triangle  from top to bottom and then bottom to top 

Here s where it gets interesting  During a consolidation pattern you need to see an even number of reversal points  4  6  8 and so on  A reversal pattern will have an odd number of reversal points such as 3  5  7 or more  As you can see  the triangle at the top of the chart has 5 reversal points which makes it a reversal pattern that told us the bears were back in charge as the bulls were unable to take out the top rail 
Note that the 3rd reversal point doesn t show the price action reaching the top rail  That s because this is a line chart which just shows the closing price for this 2 hour time frame  I will post this exact same chart showing a bar chart which does show reversal point number 3 was indeed touched 
So now we have the five point triangle reversal pattern in place  at the top of the chart  which is reversing this small counter trend rally off the November low  The third chart pattern on this chart is still building out  and it s taking on the shape of a flat bottom triangle  It has formed below the blue 5 point triangle reversal pattern and is testing the bottom rail which will complete the 4th reversal point when or if it s touched 
Note in the downtrend  the first reversal point started at the first low  So on the very short term time frame the XAU is in a confirmed downtrend  A break of the bottom rail will set in motion the next move lower to the November low  This next chart is a bar chart which is the exact same chart as the line chart above  I ve left the trendlines in place  which I showed you on the line chart  so you can see the subtle difference between the two 

This next chart  below  is a daily line chart that shows the counter trend rally off of the November low  You can see how important that dashed mid line is as it reversed its role  to what had been resistance on the way up  but is now holding support on the way down 
There is not much support on this chart if the mid dashed line breaks to the downside until the November low is reached  Note the 50 DMA  has been holding resistance so far 

This next long term daily chart for the XAU puts everything in perspective  First notice the big four point blue falling wedge which is labeled with blue numbers and the smaller red triangle labeled with red numbers 
The main thing to grasp here is the big patterns are still in play regardless of all the reasons this counter trend rally is the beginning of a new bull market  Note the price action down at the bottom of the blue falling wedge at the breakout point  As you can see  the XAU got an initial pop when it hit the bottom blue rail that lasted several weeks 
Next came the breakout and our counter trend rally off of the November low which is backtesting the bottom rail of the falling wedge from below  You can see how critically important this backtest is  Note the RSI at the top of the chart which is just above 50 or so  Often  that signals a top within a downtrend  Also the MACD and histgram are now negative at the bottom of the chart 
If there was ever a place to start  the next impulse move down this is as good as any  One last note on this chart below  If you look at the fourth reversal point on the blue falling wedge  you can see a small top that formed  When the price action broke below that black dashed trendline  we were fully invested in the Kamikaze Stocks  That portfolio more than doubled when the November low was hit  However  just this small counter trend rally took away about 90  of those gains in a week or two 
I m just bringing this to your attention so you know how volatile these Kamikaze stocks  such as the Direxion Daily Junior Gold Miners Bear 3X ETF  NYSE JDST  and Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bear 2X ETF  NYSE DUST  are 

Now let s put the blue falling wedge in perspective by looking at the weekly chart  First notice the beautiful massive H S top that reversed the bull market  The neckline symmetry rail showed the high for the right shoulder 
When the XAU broke below the big neckline  you can see it had a quick backtest that told us the neckline was hot and the next impulse move down was gaining strength  We rode most of that big impulse move down when we went short in the first week of December of 2012 
On this chart you can also see the smaller H S top that formed just before the 2008 crash that virtually nobody else saw at the time  for which I took a lot of flack from the gold bugs  They wanted my head for blasphemy  The bottom line is  I look at the blue bearish falling wedge and see the breakout and now the backtest which looks like it s completing  We won t know until we can look back in hindsight  however it sure looks like this chart is getting ready for the next impulse move down 

The monthly line chart tells a story of its own  On a monthly closing basis it shows the XAU already breaking out of an expanding triangle and on its way lower  When using a line chart  note how clearly the inverse H S bottom that launched the bull market the 2008 H S top and the massive multi year H S top look  They stand out like sore thumbs 

The monthly bar chart for the XAU shows a bearish picture but from a different perspective  This monthly bar chart shows the XAU formed a blue triangle right on the bottom rail of the 5 point bearish rising wedge and then broke out  Note the three blue consolidation patterns that formed during the bull market years  That s what a bull market looks like 
Now compare the price action to the right side of the chart  That s what a bear market looks like  This chart shows you a good example of how hard it is to short a bull market and how hard it is to buy in a bear market  You have to nail the tops and bottoms perfectly in order to capture a profit  I m not saying it can be done but it s by a magnitude  much harder going against the main trend 
How many have made any real money shorting the stock markets or buying the PM stocks  over the last three years or so  and not giving it all back on the next impulse move 

As investors we always want to see things make sense to us when we invest in the markets  For instance  when the US dollar is falling  gold and commodities should be rising which is the case most of the time but not always  Recently a lot of things we thought should be happening are out of sync with conventional wisdom  so when we look at the following precious metals stocks which make up the PM stock indexes let s just focus on the chart patterns and what they re telling us right now  today 
We can complicate things to any extreme we desire by looking at so many things that one becomes so confused they don t know down from up anymore  Keeping it simple and understanding what the charts are saying takes away a lot of unnecessary noise from making a rational decision  As I ve said many times in the past  we re playing the toughest game on the planet to win and be successful  We re playing against the brightest minds and computers in this arena and they want to take every dime you have and don t care one bit if you go broke  It s eat or be eaten 
When looking at some of the longer term charts  notice the many massive H S tops and how a lot of PM stocks are testing or have already broken below their 2008 low  There are also some PM stocks that are backtesting below previous support which is turning into resistance now  BO means breakout and BT means backtest 
Let s start with one of the big cap PM stocks Barrick Gold Corporation  NYSE ABX   This weekly chart shows ABX backtesting the summer low and beginning to sell off 

This long term monthly chart shows the neckline extension rail where I ve extended the neckline from the bear market low in 2000  As you can see  it s still hot right up to last month when it backtested the neckline extension rail from the underside  blue arrows  Note how it s reversed its role from support to resistance  ABX is also trading way below its 2008 crash low and is testing its all time low  Repeat   All Time Low  

As ABX is one of the giants in the industry  let s look at one more monthly chart that shows the blue triangle that I m viewing as a  HP  halfway pattern to the downside  When this one broke down from the massive H S top  I told members to look for reverse symmetry to the downside as the 2008 rally was so strong it didn t leave behind much in the way of any consolidation patterns to help stop this bear market decline once it got started 

The weekly chart for Agnico Eagle Mines Limited  NYSE AEM  shows it recently broke out of the 6 point blue bearish rising flag and has attempted a backtest to the bottom rail  A break below the most recent low would suggest that the backtest is compete and the new impulse down is underway 

This long term monthly chart for AEM shows its entire history with our current red bear flag just hanging below the black dashed support and resistance line as the backtest  Note how similar the price action is to when AEM backtested the neckline of its H S top 

The weekly chart for Allied Nevada Gold Corp  AMEX ANV  shows the massive H S top that has led to the most recent low  If one was aware of that big H S top they would have saved themselves a lot of pain in this popular PM stock  Note the most recent blue expanding triangle consolidation pattern that has formed at the 2008 crash low  It completed a breakout and backtest before the bottom fell out  Try to be unemotional about this if you recently bought this stock thinking it could not possibly go any lower  Unfortunately it did 

The monthly chart for ANV shows you one of those bearish falling wedges that tend to show up in strong impulse moves on any time frame  It showed some very nice reverse symmetry to how it went up and how it came back down 

One thing I like about trading the PM stocks is that it s a small enough universe in which you get to know all the stocks almost on a personal level  I like to watch the ones that have a nice clean chart pattern  which helps in understanding how the PM stocks as a whole may move  This daily chart for ASA Gold and Precious Metals  NYSE ASA  shows it has been building out a beautiful rectangle consolidation for over a year and a half  I have shown this chart many times before the break in late October  The backtest to the bottom rail looks like a H S consolidation pattern pointing to new lows if the little neckline gives way 

I ve extended the left side of the chart out in time so you could see what a real impulse move down looks like  After putting in a triple H S top you can see a series of smaller red consolidation patterns that formed during the big impulse move down in 2013  Think of the big blue rectangle as a halfway pattern between the triple H S top to the next major low  If the backtest is finished then ASA is close to duplicating the last impulse move down as shown on the chart below 

This weekly chart for ASA is interesting because it shows the multi year expanding downtrend channel that broke below the bottom rail  The backtest is what set into motion the second reversal point in the blue rectangle  Note how the bottom black rail  of the expanding downtrend channel  reversed its role several times from support to resistance and most recently back to resistance where the bottom of the blue rectangle intersect as the backtest for both important trendlines  If ASA can trade above those two intersecting trendlines then the bulls will be back in charge  Until that happens the trend is down  That area shows a nice clean line in the sand 

As always the monthly chart puts everything into perspective  As you can see  ASA s bull market top ended with a double H S top reversal pattern with the blue rectangle  which I m viewing as a halfway pattern  from the breakout of the H S top 

I m going to show you one last stock that I know a lot of folks are interested in  Below is a weekly chart for Silver Wheaton Corp  NYSE SLW  that shows it s just breaking out of a blue triangle consolidation pattern and is now in backtest mode  This blue triangle sits inside a much bigger pattern  an expanding falling wedge 

This monthly chart for SLW shows its entire history  I ll let you decide if this looks like a place to back up the truck or get on the train before it leaves the station  
I hope these charts make it abundantly clear to you that the bear market is still in full force and buying the dips may still be hazardous to your health which many a gold bug will shortly find out  There are still a few big caps I haven t shown you in this report but these are the bulk of the big cap stocks that make up the PM stock indexes 
In my opinion  this is where the truth lies  It s not in the price of gold or the US dollar or any other fundamentals you want to throw at the gold stocks  The time is coming when things will change  but for now  the answer to the question  Are we there yet   is still No  ",2014-12-16,David Tablish,https://www.investing.com/analysis/precious-metals-stocks:-bear-remains-in-force-235902,235902
100913,322428,WPM,Sean Rakhimov  Upward Trend A Silver Investor s Friend,opinion,"An upward trend is afoot in the silver space  says Sean Rakhimov  editor of SilversStrategies com  Rakhimov believes that at  26 ounce the reversal of the downward trend in silver will be confirmed and silver investors should set their sights on the next resistance level  32 ounce  And if that threshold is breached  silver will test  50 ounce and more  In this interview with The Gold Report  Rakhimov talks about a few silver miners that are well positioned to ride this trend perhaps several multiples higher 
The Gold Report  The Washington D C  based Silver Institute reports that net silver demand has exceeded net silver supply each year since 2004  with a supply deficit of 113 million ounces  113 Moz  reported in 2013  Why hasn t that trend translated into dramatically higher silver prices 
Sean Rakhimov  First  I don t put much faith in these numbers  For instance  CPM Group has somewhat different numbers  Either way  silver supply and demand have been roughly in equilibrium  in my opinion  over the past decade or so  Second  silver manifests itself as a precious metal in times of crisis or uncertainty  When it s business as usual  silver acts more like a base metal and trades more on supply and demand numbers  Silver prices will respond during a crisis as its perception changes from an industrial to precious metal  That s when you will see more of what we saw in 2011 when in the space of about six months silver went up three times  Another period like that is coming 
TGR  In early June we started to see stronger precious metals prices and that has carried through  Is this a trend 
SR  It is the beginning of a trend  Precious metals characteristically start going up after a prolonged decline  yet early in the reversal they rarely inspire any confidence because the last dozen or so similar moves fizzled after a 10 20  move  This could be one of those  Silver is at  21 per ounce   21 oz  now  maybe next week it will test  18 oz again  It s anybody s guess but I believe that toward the end of the year we ll probably see higher numbers maybe substantially higher 
TGR  Is there a telltale sign that shows investors that this upturn is real 
SR  There isn t one that I use  It s more of a gut feeling 
TGR  The existing silver fix mechanism expires on Aug  14  2014  and methods to replace it are currently being reviewed by the London Bullion Market Authority  Is a new silver fix system likely to yield stronger silver prices 
SR  It s likely  This new replacement for the silver fix would  at least for the next year or two  have less tinkering with it than had historically been going on with the fix  On that basis  the price should become more volatile  On balance it s probably going to be positive for the silver price 
TGR  What are your thoughts on the silver space 
SR  In this semi stealthy firming up of silver instruments and investments  there is not much fanfare  Silver is certainly out of favor at the moment  which leads me to remember that it s always darkest before the dawn  And I believe that this is going to reverse itself in short order 
Lately I ve been thinking about some passages from the thinly disguised biography of Jesse Livermore  Reminiscences of a Stock Operator by Edwin Lef vre He wrote   There s a lot of early bulls in a bull market   I ve been an early bull in a bull market for precious metals going back to the early 2000s  Many people exit along the way but Livermore s idea was that investors have to stick with it for the entire cycle  That s what I ve been telling myself  Of course  convictions are tested along the way  such as during the last couple of years 
Silver is a little like water in that if you tell people you should invest in water  the first thing people do is look at you like something is wrong with you  Yet fresh drinkable water is a scarce resource  Silver is so familiar that it lulls people into this idea that it s not important  Unsophisticated people align it with gold  yet the fundamentals for the two metals could not be more different 
TGR  What makes silver special 
SR  If there is one adjective to describe silver  it s  indispensable   There are no adequate replacements  It is an extremely versatile metal  perhaps the most versatile in the periodic table  Silver can do a lot of good  too  For instance  it is being used more and more in medical implements that come in contact with the human body because silver kills bacteria in single cell organisms  Silver is also used in the food industry to preserve and process foods like meat and dairy products 
But long before silver was improving our health and food safety  it was the world s currency  The word for silver is synonymous with money in 52 languages 
TGR  In April 2011 silver almost reached  50 oz before undergoing a dramatic correction  Investors  knees would surely start to wobble if we saw those prices again  How would you play those kinds of price gains 
SR  It all depends on the character of the move  Investors have to look at the volume  speed and market sentiment in order to determine the direction at that point 
TGR  What does the next leg up in the silver price look like 
SR  My outlook for silver for the next two or three years is somewhere between  50 and  100 oz  It could be shorter  it could be longer  but that s not critical  I m going to stay with it for the cycle  it could be another 10 years to the end of the cycle  I do not expect this next leg to be final but I expect it to be a substantial run comparable to 2010 2011 when silver went from roughly  10 to  49 50 oz  The next move could go from about  20 to roughly  100 oz  but that will take time  Am I going to take money off the table along the way  Maybe in some stocks that got ahead of themselves or that are not responding to the price move  But I would not touch any of my physical silver 
TGR  What are the next three key resistance levels for silver 
SR  I think  26 oz will confirm that the trend has reversed  If we exceed  26 oz on good volume and strength  then we re off to the races  From there  the next resistance level would be  30 32 oz  If we reach beyond that level  it becomes  50 oz  And if we take  50 oz convincingly  then there s a good chance that this move is going to have some serious legs 
TGR  The Performance Report on SilverStrategies com monitors 27 silver equities  Since early June  26 of them are up  some more than 40   June is typically a soft month for precious metals equities  What s supporting those bids 
SR  One thing is a possible top in the mainstream market  Another is that precious metals are up roughly 15  in the last month or so and stocks usually have an exaggerated move versus the metal price  And most of these stocks are coming off depressed levels  There was something of a vacuum so stocks tend to jump even on low volumes  Most of the sellers who wanted to sell did  On the flip side  it doesn t take a lot of money to acquire a lot of stocks  Again  this behavior is typical for the beginning of a larger move 
TGR  What are some small cap silver names that you like in a rising silver price environment 
SR  I like companies that have demonstrated growth  like SilverCrest Mines Inc   AMEX SVLC  and Santacruz Silver Mining Ltd   TO SCZ  
TGR  What did you make of the Q1 14 results from Santacruz  Is the company poised to build on those 
SR  Santacruz has stated its production numbers from the current operation and it looks as if it s getting on track  Its production guidance indicates that  too  More important  the company has a lot of room to grow  It s two years old  It s already in production  Is it going to make it or not  Santacruz is almost over the hump 
TGR  The company lost  0 02 a share in Q1 14  Will it break even or maybe even make money in Q2 14 
SR  That s not how I think about it at this stage of development  Most junior mining companies do not make money until their fifth or even eighth year  And in this environment very few companies have been making money  Unless it s a larger company with established operations and better cost control  it s difficult for a startup to pin numbers to something and say   Okay  this is the benchmark   Santacruz is not there yet  Do I expect it to make money this year  Maybe it will break even  But does it have upside  Yes 
TGR  What about SilverCrest 
SR  SilverCrest is implementing a transition to underground mining at Santa Elena  which at full ramp up should nearly double production from the current level  So next year bottom line numbers should get a substantial bump despite the higher mining and processing costs from moving to underground mining and milling operation  That should result in better valuation due to rerating based on the larger operation or at the very least on greater earnings  Now if I am correct about improving metal prices going forward  the upside could be very rewarding  Plus SilverCrest will almost certainly be active in the merger and acquisition space on either side of the deal  It could be a juicy target for a larger company while it looks to add another mine sooner rather than later 
TGR  Others 
SR   Excellon Resources Inc   TO EXN  is another company I m watching  Excellon is a junior producer that has been around for a while and has a handle on its deposit s cost structure and grade 
TGR  How would you compare La Platosa in Durango state  Mexico  to other silver assets belonging to companies in this market cap range 
SR  It certainly is one of the higher grade assets  In recent quarters Excellon has been mining 600 800 grams per ton  600 800 g t  silver  whereas the average for Mexico would probably be closer to 200 g t  However  La Platosa has had other challenges such as underground water issues  which factors into its costs  Excellon is still chasing the meat of the deposit  it has the tiger by the tail but it is still looking for the tiger itself  Excellon believes it is moving in that direction  In a rising metal price environment  such as the one I expect next year  higher grade may yield some oversized returns due to greater leverage to rising silver price  The gains could be significant 
TGR  Others 
SR   Avino Silver   Gold Mines Ltd   AMEX ASM  is producing around 1  Moz silver equivalent a year  I have visited the operation and it looks good  The share price has reflected that  even in a poor environment for resource stocks  Avino recently acquired Bralorne Gold Mines Ltd  which owns a high grade gold project in Canada  It is a bit of a departure from producing silver in Mexico  Can the company translate its success in Mexico to Canada  Time will tell 
The other reason I like Avino is that it s bringing the past producing Avino silver mine back into production  That mine is in Mexico and is a stone s throw from its current operation  That should basically boost production to about 2 5 Moz annually 
TGR  What are some other silver equities with discoveries that could ultimately become company makers 
SR  The last discovery of that nature would be the Navidad deposit in Argentina that was discovered by IMA Exploration and ended up with Aquiline Resources  Pan American Silver Corp   NASDAQ PAAS  later bought Aquiline but mothballed Navidad due to the political situation in Argentina 
In this cycle the best performers have not been the companies that made good discoveries but rather companies that have properly managed their resources and finances  Those companies have done well  Silver Wheaton Corp   NYSE SLW  is on that list  First Majestic Silver Corp   NYSE AG   Endeavour Silver Corp   NYSE EXK   Fortuna Silver Mines Inc   NYSE FSM   and Great Panther Silver Ltd   AMEX GPL  are on it  too  Most of those companies acquired their flagship mines  They were not discovery stories  though as part of good management most assets were expanded and their respective mine lives were extended through drilling success 
TGR  Nonetheless there have been discoveries 
SR  Yes  The Chinchillas deposit in Argentina was discovered by the same group that found the Navidad deposit  a Grosso Group company called Golden Arrow Resources Corp   TO GRG   Another discovery is Global Minerals Ltd  s  TO CTG  Strieborn  deposit in Slovakia  The project has been around a long time but the entire resource is based on a vein that was not exploited in the previous precious metals cycle  Global recently made another high grade discovery  too  I mention a company like that because it s in the heart of Europe  If we continue along this trend of increased geopolitical uncertainty  some silver deposits will become far more attractive than others 
TGR  Let s go back to your list of the best performers in this cycle  Names like First Majestic  Endeavour  Fortuna and Great Panther 
SR  First Majestic is perhaps the best silver miner at this time  It is a classic mining story  It started with one mine  built it up and bought another one  And then built that up  Along the way the company made some discoveries or acquired other projects and built those up that model seems to work well in the mining space  That s been the path for many of the major gold producers  Ten years ago or so  Goldcorp Inc   NYSE GG  was a one mine company  But it bought other good assets and put them into production  Yamana Gold Inc   NYSE AUY  used the same model to achieve similar success  albeit on a smaller scale  In the silver space that company is First Majestic  I expect it to get even bigger and better  much like Yamana  Bigger production means your bottom line gets so much bigger so much faster in a rising metal price environment 
TGR  Is it a similar narrative for Endeavour  Fortuna and Great Panther 
SR  In a word  yes  All these companies acquired producing or past producing mines and revived improved enhanced them over time 
Endeavour Silver is another company that quietly built up its production profile toward 11 Moz of silver equivalent  albeit the latter part of growth came from gold  Still at that rate of production Endeavour should respond well to rising gold silver prices 
Fortuna Silver has also been making headway with respect to its production growth closing in on the 8 Moz of silver equivalent  Fortuna has benefited from drilling success at its Mexican operation where high grade intercepts allowed the company to ramp up both tonnes processed and ounces produced  which in turn reduces per ounce cost 
Interestingly  Fortuna is currently valued at a premium to Endeavour despite producing in round numbers 3 Moz of silver equivalent less annually  This likely has to do with excitement regarding continued impressive drill results in Mexico  as well as the fact that Fortuna s other producing mine is in Peru and therefore is not subject to increased royalty taxes enacted in Mexico in 2014 
Great Panther is one in the group that hasn t accomplished a major push to get to the next level in terms of scale  not for lack of trying  and needs to do so  The company had its share of challenges at both operating mines and was able to overcome them 
TGR  Perhaps one more silver name 
SR   Tahoe Resources Inc   NYSE TAHO  is a relatively new silver company with what could be the best deposit in the space the high grade Escobal deposit in Guatemala  Tahoe is one of the larger silver producers  targeting 20 Moz per annum  and is very similar to Goldcorp in its earlier days  In fact  the people running the company and its flagship project came from Goldcorp  Tahoe has been in production for about two quarters and it is already making money  As was the case with Santacruz  it is a bit premature to talk about benchmark numbers in terms of performance  yet all indications point to a very successful future  As long as geopolitics hold together  this is one of the better deals in the sector 
TGR  If silver rises in excess of  50 oz  many boats will float  How do investors sort out the pretenders 
SR  You look back and see which companies were profitable at sub  20 oz silver  If they are in the black  that s an indication of how they run their operations  In the short term it is not a given that the  best  company will be the best performer  But overall  that would be a good problem to have 
TGR  Parting thoughts 
SR  If silver were oil  people would have some definite ideas about why it is important  I don t think silver has that characteristic due to its recent history  That fools people into thinking that silver is not a good option  even when it is  Silver s stigma as gold s poor cousin may well morph into gold s  better  cousin over time due to its vastly superior industrial utility

100914,322429,WPM,4 Reasons To Invest In Silver Rather Than Gold,opinion,"With Wall Street and a number of institutional investors like Ray Dalio and billionaire George Soros placing big bets on a recovery in precious metals  now is likely the time for investors to take the plunge  But the key question remains  which precious metal should they choose 
Gold has remained a firm favourite among investors and Mr  Soros has made a massive US 120 million plunge on the world s largest gold producer Barrick Gold Corporation  NYSE ABX   However  my preference is to invest in Silver and not gold  Not only does it share similar characteristics to gold  including acting as an inflationary hedge  being a well of value in uncertain times and a safe haven asset  it possesses four unique characteristics which could propel its price skyward  
1  Silver s prevailing use is in industry
Unlike gold  which has its biggest use in investing  the prevailing use of silver is in a wide range of industrial applications  In 2013  54  of total silver demand came from industry  with it predominantly being used in industrial fabrication and electronics  There are signs of growing global economic activity  particularly with China s purchasing managers index  a key measure of industrial activity in the world s largest economy  hitting a six month high in June 2014 
Even more promising  the demand for silver being used in electronic  electrical and chemical applications is expected to grow  with a range of new technologies requiring the use of silver in their products  Key among them is the rapid growth in the production of photovoltaic solar panels  as silver is a key component of the manufacturing process  In China alone  the quantity of photovoltaic solar panels manufactured has doubled every year since 2003 and with this expected to continue  that industry alone will require around 15 million ounces of silver annually 
2  Silver is in shorter supply than gold
A key driver of silver prices is its rarity  and the amount of available silver is far lower than gold  even though it s 17 5 times more abundant in the Earth than gold  This is because over 90  of all silver ever produced has been consumed primarily in industrial applications 
Even more pressing is that mine production is currently incapable of keeping up with demand  placing greater pressure on scrap metal and recycling  In 2013  despite silver production from mining jumping a healthy 3 5  compared to 2012  it only produced enough silver to meet 76  of the total physical demand in that year  While mine production will continue to grow  this shortage will continue for the foreseeable future with the major silver miners having cut back on investing in the development of new projects after precious metal prices tanked 
The long lead times to bring new silver mines online will also act as a headwind for supply  because even with renewed investment from silver miners in developing new mines  it will take time for them to come online 
These factors  along with growing industrial demand  will certainly act as tailwinds to push the price of silver higher  They are also the reason silver prices are far more volatile than gold  with daily price movements typically being far larger than gold  which means investors must be willing to stomach far larger downdrafts 
3  Silver has failed to maintain its correlation with the price of gold
Silver has been hit far harder than gold since the wheels fell off the bull market at the end of 2012  when the Fed began tapering quantitative easing  While gold is down 31  from its bull market high of  1 873 70 per ounce  silver has plunged 58  from its bull market high of US 48 58 per ounce 
The gold to silver ratio  which measures how many ounces of silver are required to buy an ounce of gold  has continued to widen since then  Historically there has been a close correlation between the price of gold and silver  but since the end of the bull market  this close correlation has dropped away and is now well outside of the average ratio of 47 ounces of silver per ounce of gold 
We can see how far the ratio has widened when considering that at the height of the gold bull market it took 44 ounces of silver to buy one ounce of gold  and now the gap has grown to 63 ounces 
4  Silver miners have been hit far harder and are more attractively priced than gold miners
When precious metal prices collapsed at the end of 2012  the prices of precious metal miners plunged  with silver miners being among some of the worst affected  While the majority of gold miners have seen their share prices bounce back nicely since the start of this year on the back of the gold rally  the share prices of silver miners have lagged behind 
This sees a number of silver miners trading with some very attractive valuations in comparison to gold miners  Senior gold miner Goldcorp Inc  TO G trades with an enterprise value of 30 times EBITDA  whereas Pan American Silver Corp  NASDAQ PAAS  has an EV of 9 times EBITDA and First Majestic Silver Corp  TO FR  is 14 times 
While Soros and Dalio have placed big bets on precious metal streamer Silver Wheaton Corp  NYSE SLW  because of its low operating overheads and solid portfolio of precious metal streaming contracts  it is Pan American Silver that has caught my attention 
Pan American Silver is essentially a leveraged play on silver prices and it is one of the lowest cost operators in the industry with all in sustaining costs of  15 52 per ounce  It has also managed to increase production as Q1 2014 production was up 5  compared to the equivalent quarter in 2013  despite capital expenditures for mine development being slashed  This coupled with a low cost structure leaves it well positioned to take advantage of higher silver prices and boost its profitability 
For all of these reasons  along with many of Pan American s costs being fixed and silver already up 6  for the year to date I expect to see the company report some solid financial results for the remainder of the year ",2014-08-04,Commodity Trade Mantra,https://www.investing.com/analysis/4-reasons-to-invest-in-silver-rather-than-gold-221571,221571

100916,322431,WPM,Better Precious Metal Opportunity  The Silver Playbook,opinion,"Is Silver Ready For Liftoff 
As Janet Yellen s dollar continues its show of relative strength  precious metals have suffered  As of yesterday morning  Silver was teetering at  17 33 an ounce  Gold slowly to  1 211 80 an ounce and Platinum to over  1 258 an ounce 
Traditionally  precious metals perform with strength when global events shake equity and currency markets  In January 2000  the price of silver was  5 30 an ounce  At the close on February 14  2012  silver was at  33 60 an ounce  a healthy return over the 12 year cycle of 534 percent  a slightly greater return than either gold or platinum  In other words  if an investor had acquired  10 000 worth of silver in January  2000  and sold it on February 14  2012  the investor would have collected an impressive  53 400  All this while  stocks gained an average about 18 percent 
During these years  the US dollar was rocked by the housing crisis  other economic events and the toll of the prolonged wars in Iraq and Afghanistan  US debt was steadily escalating  The dollar was laboring  Today  equity markets are still adjusting to life without Bernanke  The world is facing another Middle East conflict that could last years  The US dollar is strengthening against other currencies but if the US takes on more debt  how long can the dollar maintain current levels 
Traditionally  gold has been the standard  flight to safety  as a precious metal but silver just might be the better opportunity  Demand for silver is strong and outweighs supply  As a super conductive metal  silver has a broad base of commercial and industrial uses  much broader than gold  Silver plays an important role in many commercial and technological applications and in electronics  Investors in silver enjoy the luxury of a precious but are fully aware that there is more commercial and industrial demand than as jewelry or bullion 
Yet  with the rising dollar  silver continues to fall in value  Some investors  including myself  feel that in this  17 00 range  silver is nearing the bottom and marks a solid play  There are a number of ways to purchase silver 
Commodity EFTs
Stocks and Mutual Funds
Futures and Options
Bullion
Certificates
If we expect the amount of US debt to rise and if the possibility of  a long term conflict lies ahead  we are building a strong case for diversification and we must consider our asset allocations  At the same time  we must acknowledge that precious metal strategies have changed as silver  platinum and palladium become more functional in manufacturing processes  These developments have seen gold  the standard flight to safety  lose some of its glitter 
Of today s precious metals  silver is the most attractive  In 2013  the US experienced a shortage of American Silver Eagles from the mint as well as shortages in the availability of junk silver  Indeed  many investors are actually holding their silver the way some investor hold gold 
Meanwhile   continues to rise  This increases the value of gold when and if the economy ever fully recovers from the recession  At that time  silver will be in greater demand than ever as more technology and electronic advances will rely on the super conducting metal for an even wider number of manufactured goods 
Today  approximately  1 billion of silver is used by industry annually  This does not include silver used in technology or as jewelry  Dentists and nanotechnology help to build a case for silver  even if there is not a global crisis ahead  To this equation  add the price of silver  which looks to be near its bottom  Investing in silver looks to have sustainable potential

ProShares UltraShort Silver  ARCA ZSL  is a pro active and aggressive ETF that has performed well over the last 52 weeks  With a 52 week low of 65 93 and a 52 week high of 111 81  ZSL has been the most successful silver ETF over the last year  As CapitalCube s ETF profile indicates   ProShares UltraShort Silver seeks daily investment results before fees and expenses that correspond to twice  200  the inverse  opposite  of the daily performance of silver bullion as measured by the U S  Dollar fixing price for delivery in London   ProShares UltraShort Silver has prospered with the recent downtrend in silver prices 
Interestingly  most silver ETFs are now  than at any time in history even as some analysts project price declines to around  15 00 
The decline is silver prices has served ZSL well  As other silver ETFs have struggled  ZSL is up 37 549 percent this year and gained a hefty 22 006 percent in the last month  ZSL is leveraged 2 to 1 against silver and with the tightening of the dollar against the yen and the euro  silver prices have slipped  making ZSL a winner  But  will the dollar stay strong 
iShares Silver Trust 
Investors who think not might prefer iShares Silver Trust  ARCA SLV   whose performance mirrors recent declines in silver prices  Down 20 688 percent this year and off 9 881 percent over the last 30 days  SLV represents an opportunity for those investors who think the dollar will weaken in the face of world events   As CapitalCube notes  the price of SLV shares is a direct representation of the value of silver held by the trust  which continues to acquire the precious metal 
Interestingly  when the US began its renewed bombing campaign in Syria on September 23rd  silver began to show signs of recovery from a prolonged  multi year slump  If you believe there is a correlation between US military action and silver prices  then SLV might be your silver investment 
Silver Wheaton Corporation
Following the same trajectory as SLV are mining shares like Silver Wheaton Corporation  NYSE SLW   Closing at 21 79 Monday  SLW is off 16 99 percent in the last 30 days  Over 52 weeks  shares have fluctuated between  20 and  30  One benefit of this issue is that Capital Cube shows a high quality dividend of 1 62 percent at the current share price 
SLW has other interesting trends  Current PE is well below peer median  54 39   Both gross and net margins are exemplary compared to peers 

The same is true for the company s operating and pre tax margins  SLW s ROE and ROA figures are also encouraging  The company is well positioned to profit with a rise in silver prices 
If owning shares of a silver mining company has more appeal than investing in a silver ETF  SLW runs a tight ship  With any silver investment  your bet is that the dollar will weaken and that the US is headed for a mid to long term conflict  If you are like me  you agree this seems to be where we are headed and silver is a commodity asset that we should own

100939,322454,WPM,A Picky Player s Guide To A Cautiously Optimistic Mining Market,opinion,"The price of gold may be enjoying a double digit increase so far this year and some equities may even have doubled their value  but Jeff Killeen of CIBC World Markets says it s not time to jump into metals with both feet  Be selective  he says  In this interview with The Gold Report  Killeen shares the higher quality names that have a prospect for development 
The Gold Report  The price of gold has increased 14  this year  Is that due to gold s safe haven status 
Jeff Killeen  The safe haven mentality is one element that s supporting the gold price  There is uncertainty in the market about the strength of the U S  economy  A number of economic indicators reported during the last two months have not met forecasts  The rebound may be slower than expected  Buyers are coming back to bullion 
Unrest in the Ukraine is also helping to support the gold price  however  to a lesser extent than U S  economic data  If weaker than expected indicators persist and severe weather in the U S results in soft data  such a scenario could be positive for gold in the near term 
Even before this rebound  there was very strong physical buying around the  1 200 per ounce   1 200 oz  level from Asia  The investment community believed that there was a base established and started putting money back into the space with much less risk of a downside move 
TGR  It s now six years since the economic crisis of 2008  Is it possible that a consensus could form that a traditional economic recovery is not going to occur  And if this consensus does form  would it be a big boost for gold 
JK  Certainly  However  I think that that consensus may take a little while to form because most of the U S  economic indicators started moving in the right direction in 2013  In the next three to six months the impact from severe weather last winter will obscure the data picture 
TGR  The mood at this year s Prospectors and Developers Association of Canada  PDAC  conference has been described as  cautious optimism   Would you agree 
JK  I d say the tone was divergent some senior management teams were feeling very cautious about commodity prices and general market appetite for mining equities  whereas a lot of the junior management teams had a much greater conviction that 2014 would be a strong year for the metals and equities 
TGR  If you look at the juniors and mid caps  a lot of these stocks have gone up 25   50  and even 100  this year  I would have thought you would ve seen a lot of smiling faces at PDAC as a result of that 
JK  Very true  but even a 100  uptick still leaves some share prices below where they may have been at better points in 2012  There is still that rearward looking view to where the stock prices have come from  and a lot of them are a long way from there 
TGR  As capital returns to the mining sector  would it be correct to say that it will return first to the producers  second to companies with late development assets and then  third and finally  to explorers 
JK  That succession sounds reasonable  however  new capital investment will certainly be selective  I would expect to see capital flowing into the space across the market cap spectrum  but those companies or projects that are marginal at the current gold price or require further appreciation in the price to generate acceptable returns are likely to find it difficult to attract any new investments in 2014 
TGR  How can smaller companies  specifically explorers  demonstrate that they are worthy of financing 
JK  The first question anyone should ask when looking at the explorer space concerns the management team  Pick a solid team  especially in a market where accessing capital can be difficult  Spending dollars wisely is important 
Beyond that  a project with strong grades can give a comfort level to the buy side that a project could be profitable in the future  considering it s very difficult to assess where gold prices might be four  five or seven years from now 
Other benefits geographic or logistic such as being in the right region for having a smooth permitting process and having good roadways  rail or power  can add value 
TGR  Which major gold producers do you like 
JK  We like Goldcorp Inc  NYSE GG  and Agnico Eagle Mines Limited  NYSE AEM  because they have high quality  high grade cornerstone assets that generate a large amount of cash flow  have strong balance sheets with a lot of cash and the potential to use that cash to help grow their businesses through mergers and acquisitions  They have strong management teams with good quality assets that will have secure cash flow even in a softer gold price environment  And that s where investors should be focusing 
TGR  What are your top picks in the gold sector 
JK  I cover some nonproducing explorers and some producing juniors and intermediates  In the junior nonproducer space  my top picks would be Continental Gold Ltd  CNL TO   Premier Gold Mines Limited  PG TO  and Pretium Resources Inc   PVG   All three have assets with higher grades  are sufficiently financed to complete all planned work for the next year or more in some cases  and will continue to generate meaningful news flow over the next year  which can add value to their assets and keep the investment community engaged 
Continental is expected to release an updated resource estimate for the Buritic  project in Colombia by the end of Q1 14  In addition to increasing resource confidence by upgrading Inferred ounces to the Measured and Indicated  M I  category  I anticipate there will be growth in total resources as well 
Pretium is expected to file an environmental assessment certificate with the British Columbia government within the next month  That will kick off the formal review process for the mine plan  The company will continue to work toward completion of its feasibility study for the Brucejack project in H2 14  In the meantime  the company will continue underground drilling within the Valley of the Kings and is expected to extract another 1 000 ton sample from the zone for processing 
Premier will continue to work at all three of its core projects  Drilling results from the Cove project in Nevada are looking particularly interesting  Several new mineralized zones have been recognized  both gold mineralization and polymetallic mineralization with gold  copper  lead and zinc  The Hardrock project will have infill drilling completed during the course of this year that will support moving the project from the preliminary economic assessment  PEA  phase to the feasibility stage  Its Red Lake joint venture project with Goldcorp should have drill results from the down dip area of the Wilmar zone within the next couple of months  The market is anxious to see what this drilling will yield as it is a relatively untested target 
TGR  What did you make of the PEA on Hardrock that was released in January 
JK  It was a quality piece of work  You could certainly tell the skill level that s been brought into this company in the last couple of years  including Ebe Scherkus coming on as chairman of the board from Agnico Eagle and bringing quite a few skilled members from the Agnico Eagle team over to Premier  Hardrock certainly looks compelling  It s near a highway  It s very close to power  It should get lots of local support  The projected returns are double digit  Arguably  some might want to see a few more percentage points on that internal rate of return  but ultimately  Premier will do a good job in proving some of those numbers over the course of transitioning to a feasibility stage 
TGR  Continental s Buritic  project in Colombia shows high grades in gold  Do you expect these grades to decrease as the resource grows larger 
JK  I expect grades will be similar to what we see today  Most of the drilling between the two principal zones Yaragu  and Veta Sur have had very similar numbers since the last resource estimate was produced  It is important to note that the M I categories within its 2012 resource estimate are substantially higher than the Inferred grade  As we see some of the Inferred ounces converted into those higher confidence categories  grades may even improve as drilling becomes denser within the zones  I m not building that expectation into my valuation  but it is a possibility 
It s also important to note that it s very small scale  but there is an active producing mine at the site  This mine has been operating and producing gold for more than 20 years with a head grade of roughly 20 grams per ton  20 g t  in recent times  There is a bit of real world proof that those high grades do exist at site 
TGR  What other gold companies have you rated Sector Outperformers 
JK  Among the producing companies that I cover  B2Gold Corporation  AMEX BTG  is my top pick and rated Sector Outperformer  The company has an attractive cost profile across its asset base  and all in costs are expected to decline in 2015 and capital spending at the Otjikoto mine in Namibia will wind down next year  This is a mine that s currently being constructed now  We expect all in costs to be sub  900 oz in 2015 and that the company will be positioned to generate significant free cash flow by next year  Otjikoto coming on line will contribute to a nearly 50  increase in gold output from 2013 to 2015 
That does not take into account the recently discovered Wolfshag zone  I would expect that once the company is able to incorporate the higher grade Wolfshag zone into the Otjikoto mine plan  we ll see further improvement in cost and gold output from that project 
Beyond the development of Otjikoto  B2Gold s management has shown improvements at each of the company s three projects currently in production  and we re expecting modest increases in output from each of the La Libertad  El Limon and Masbate mines this year  With B2Gold projected to exceed a half million ounces  0 5 Moz  gold by 2015  that certainly puts it into a fairly substantial production base 
The bottom line is that B2Gold is a company with attractive margins and significant near term growth that s all internally funded  That s a great combination for any producer to have 
TGR  There were concerns raised about B2Gold s acquisition of Volta Resources Inc  Do you think that s a good fit 
JK  It was an acquisition the market didn t expect  but I can understand why the company likes the asset  It liked the exploration and management team  Plus  it was a rather small acquisition  at roughly 3  of its market cap  for something that could be important in the longer term  I think it made sense 
TGR  Which other gold producers do you like 
JK  Primero Mining Corp  PPP   The company put out a revised resource and reserve estimate for San Dimas mine that showed increases in all categories for total ounces and grade  Its acquisition of Brigus Gold Corp  will help bring total production for the company into a new bracket  It remains one of the lower cost producers in the space 
TGR  Let s talk about some of the companies you ve rated Sector Performers 
JK  The names I cover that are Sector Performers include Alamos Gold Inc   AGI   Asanko Gold Inc  AMEX AKG   Argonaut Gold Inc   AR TO   Belo Sun Mining Corp   BSX TO   Oceanagold Corporation  OGC TO  and Orezone Gold Corporation  ORE TO   Each has its rating for different reasons  Some are simply calls on relative valuations  Some are based on project returns and so forth 
For Argonaut and OceanaGold  the rating is largely a valuation call relative to peers in the space  Argonaut is trading at roughly 13x our 2014 cash flow per share  CFPS   The stock trades at a sharp premium to most of the midtier peers in the group  The company has an attractive low cost profile  It is increasing production as the La Colorada mine comes into full stride in Mexico in 2014 
Orezone is operating an exploration program at Bombor  project in Burkina Faso  The company has completed scoping studies and is trying to move toward feasibility  The project return may be smaller than what many in the investment community would look for in a new developable asset  The company is looking at how it can reduce the upfront capital expenses  capex  and potentially reduce the operating costs for Bombor   as well as improve the metallurgy  How those elements come together toward the later part of this year certainly could change the way that we view that project 
TGR  Can you tell us about Alamos 
JK  Alamos  Mulatos mine in Mexico is still one of the lowest cost producers and better quality names in the space  But looking at it relative to peers  it is trading at a fairly steep premium  Alamos is trading at roughly 18x our 2014 estimated CFPS compared to 9x for the peer group 
However  I do see some upside  It has one of the strongest balance sheets of any company I cover  with more than  400 million   400M  in cash  There are very good development assets in Turkey  which are being held up by permitting issues  Until we get more clarity on that  it could be a headwind for the stock 
TGR  What can you say about Belo Sun 
JK  Belo Sun s Volta Grande project in Brazil looks like a great project with fairly simple geology  It s an open pittable  greenstone hosted gold deposit much like what you find in many places in Canada  The bigger concern has been the capex estimate of more than  700M  That was certainly a holdback for this stock  The company has explored how to reduce that upfront capex and has produced a PEA that effectively cuts the capex in half  It needs a little bit of help from the gold price or reduced costs to improve the overall economics 
TGR  What is interesting about Asanko 
JK  Asanko s merger with PMI Gold Corp  has been completed  It s a positive because it gives more optionality for development in Ghana  The merger puts two 5 Moz deposits within about 25 kilometers of each other under one company  Looking forward  Asanko will reassess PMI s Obotan deposit  I d like to see more details about how that will look before we can revise the valuation 
TGR  Are there other companies that you can talk about 
JK  Earlier this year Pilot Gold Inc   PLG TO  released two drill holes from its Mount Kinsley project in Nevada  they have very good grades and breadth  The headline hole that it reported was 6 9 g t over almost 42 meters  42m   This mineralization was within a new shale unit where very little or no drilling had been done by previous operators  and only one hole by Pilot had been drilled in late 2013  That could open up a new horizon at the Kinsley project for exploration that hadn t been identified before 
TGR  Which streaming royalty gold companies do you like 
JK  My go to answer would be Franco Nevada Corporation  FNV   It has a best in class portfolio and management team  It has lots of cash on its balance sheet to make acquisitions  It has cornerstone assets that will continue to generate free cash flow even if commodity prices drop significantly 
I also like Silver Wheaton Corp   NYSE SLW  because it is the best way to get exposure to the silver space  as silver producers are having difficulty securing positive cash flows and margins 
TGR  Any other companies 
JK  Allied Nevada Gold Corp  AMEX ANV  did a good job at turning around the heap leach operations at its Hycroft mine  but it does have a significant amount of debt  We find it difficult to see the Hycroft heap leach operations being able to generate enough cash flow to repay that debt at these commodity prices  It would need a fairly significant increase in the price of gold  on the order of  200 300 oz  to be able to generate enough cash flow 
It also has a lot of work ahead of it on its proposed mill sulfide recovery project  At this point  it seems that the test work is going well  but it s in the early stages 
TGR  Given the recent increase in the price of gold and the significant uptick in a lot of equities  do you think that investors are embracing the sea change 
JK  There is a belief within the investment community that we re finding a bottom for the commodities  We do know that equities underperformed to the down side of the gold and silver price  Even just to revalue based on current spot prices means that there is probably still some upside to be had in a lot of the equities  With that in mind  investors are feeling better  but not excited to the point where there s going to be broad scale investment across the mining space  It s going to be selective  It s going to be higher quality names or those that have a higher prospect for development  It s not going to be widespread just yet

100940,322455,WPM,Charles Oliver  Time Is The Trigger For Equities And Bullion,opinion,"Charles Oliver  lead portfolio manager with the Sprott Gold and Precious Minerals Fund  believes the only thing between investors and bigger investment returns on precious metals equities and bullion  especially silver  is time  In this interview with The Gold Report  Oliver discusses silver and gold demand drivers  as well as portfolio ideas that figure to get bigger with time as the trigger 
The Gold Report   Sell in May and go away  is a common investing axiom but does it have any validity 
Charles Oliver  I recently went through some research on seasonality in the gold price  March has been negative in the gold space in six of the last eight years  April has proven negative four out of the last eight years  and May and June have both been negative five of the last eight years  However  we see a fairly dramatic turnaround in July where six of the last eight years have been positive  In August  another six of the previous eight years have been positive  September has been positive five of the last eight years  The  sell in May  adage could actually represent a great buying opportunity on the pullback 
TGR  What are some investment themes you expect to dominate through the rest of the year 
CO  It really comes down to printing money  The U S  has reduced its money printing but it is still aggressively printing  Now we re hearing about the Europeans potentially getting into quantitative easing  The debasement of currencies is an ongoing theme 
The other key theme is the demand for physical gold  China has become the world s largest gold buyer  consuming about 40  of the world s mine production  India  which historically had been the world s largest gold consumer  has established some tariffs on gold imports  so there s been some pullback there 
It s noteworthy that over the last couple of decades the European central banks have been collectively selling gold  That stopped a couple of years ago  Some numbers from the Swiss Customs Authority show that Germany  France  Singapore  Thailand  even the United Kingdom  are fairly significant gold buyers  These are very positive events 
TGR  What about geopolitical events  Do you expect those to dramatically influence gold prices 
CO  Historically  wars and the risk of wars have been quite positive for the gold price yet recent events in the Ukraine haven t seen gold do anything  In fact  it s trading near the bottom end of its recent range  But should things escalate  I feel strongly that it will have a positive impact  I certainly hope that it doesn t come to that but the risk seems significant 
TGR  What is the investor pulse in the precious metals space 
CO  A year ago investors were selling a little  as they had been for some time  The selling had mostly stopped by the end of the 2013 and the people who didn t have long term conviction had left  In early 2014 I was a bit surprised to see U S  value investors streaming in because we had been through a period of net redemptions  When the Americans come into the market they can have quite a dramatic impact on prices  I ll call it sporadic because it has not been a consistent stream 
TGR  What happened to those bids 
CO  Generally speaking  American investors  portfolio managers and pension funds were saying at the end of 2013   We ve had some good returns in the general market but the market is looking somewhat expensive   They were looking for areas where there was good value  The gold price had been hammered over the last couple of years so they were starting to move some of their allocations into that space  We ve also seen some private equity buying assets and taking them private  And some Asian interests dipping their toes in the water  People are starting to wake up and show some interest but they are still waiting for some sort of trigger in order to say that this is the time to jump in 
TGR  Any idea what that could be 
CO  I ve spent a lot of time thinking about that question  I liken the 1974 to 1976 period to today  In 1974  the oil price was going up after the oil embargo and inflation was going up  too  It was peculiar because the gold price went from about  200 per ounce   200 oz  to  100 oz over the next couple of years  Then in 1976 gold suddenly went from  100 oz to about  800 oz  I have spent a lot of time trying to determine the trigger for that event  Sometimes it is just time  When I look back at 2013  I see a lot of positive fundamentals strong Chinese demand  huge amounts of money printing yet the gold price went down  Sometimes it s just the way the markets time themselves 
TGR  Do investors need to revise their price expectations for precious metals equities  There is zero froth in this market 
CO  I think that s a good way of putting it  I m continually trying to figure out where the market may go  Not too long ago I said that by the end of this decade gold should be approaching something like  5 000 oz  which would have a huge impact upon the markets and stock valuations  The market is valuing equities as if gold is going to stay at  1 200 1 300 oz forever  I believe that the market will be proven wrong over time 
TGR  Gold is trading at roughly 67 times silver  Does that make silver your preference 
CO  Yes  It was Eric Sprott who came up with the thesis and I fully embrace it  For over 1 000 years  the silver gold price relationship was close to 16 1  so that implies that if gold is  1 600 oz  the silver price would be  100 oz  The last time that happened was 1980 when the gold price was roughly  800 oz and the silver price was around  50 oz  Over the next couple of years  I expect to see that 67 1 ratio migrate toward 16 1 
TGR  Yet the trend is moving in the opposite direction 
CO  In the short term sometimes these things happen  About 25  of the weighting in the Sprott Gold and Precious Minerals Fund  SPR300 TSX  is in silver equities  which is probably among the highest in the peer group for precious metals funds 
TGR  What s your investment thesis for silver versus gold 
CO  About two thirds of mined silver is used in industry  whereas gold has virtually no industrial usage  Gold is considered a reserve currency whereas silver is not  About 150 years ago many countries had silver reserves backing their currencies  Today they don t but China has trillions of U S  dollars that it is converting into hard assets  The Chinese are buying a lot of gold but if they ever decide to be a silver buyer we would see a huge shift in the price of silver  Look at every mined commodity out there today copper  nickel  zinc  iron ore China accounts for 40 50  of global consumption 
TGR  Is it all about margin for precious metals equities 
CO  A lot of these companies are producing gold at  1 000 oz or silver at  18 oz  Should silver go up to  30 oz  that  2 oz margin suddenly becomes  12 oz a sixfold increase  Shifts in commodity prices could have huge impacts on the profitability of these companies 
TGR  Tell us about some of your top silver holdings 
CO  Among my top 10 silver holdings  I have Silver Wheaton Corp   NYSE SLW    Pan American Silver Corp   TO PAA   and Tahoe Resources Inc    NYSE TAHO    which operates one of the world s newest silver mines  I visited Tahoe s Escobal mine in Guatemala earlier this year to check out its ramp up period because that can be challenging  The company is doing a very good job of ramping up to nameplate capacity  Tahoe s Q1 14 results beat the expectations of most analysts and a number of them are revising their forecasts upward 
In the gold space I have companies such as Osisko Mining Corp   OSK   and IAMGOLD Corp   TO IMG   
TGR  I thought the Osisko story was finished 
CO  A byproduct of the Yamana Gold Inc   NYSE AUY   Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd    NYSE AEM   takeover bid for Osisko is a potential Osisko spinout company  For every Osisko share  investors would own one share of the spinco  It means roughly 15  of an Osisko share is represented by the value of the spinco and the other 85  consists of shares in Agnico Eagle  Yamana and cash  An Osisko shareholder today will end up owning a combination of all three companies  plus the cash component of the offer 
One thing that keeps me excited about the spinco is that it is going to have a 5  royalty on the Canadian Malartic gold mine  It would also have a 2  royalty on the Hammond Reef and Kirkland Lake assets  as well as a large land package in Mexico  The Osisko spinco would be Canada s newest royalty company and royalty companies often get a premium valuation 
TGR  Does the new company have a ticker 
CO  Osisko shareholders will have to vote to accept the Agnico Eagle and Yamana bid  I expect it will pass and the Osisko spinco should be trading sometime in June 
TGR  Osisko was targeted largely because it had a large low grade  low cost asset in a safe jurisdiction  Does that make companies like Detour Gold Corp   DGC   and Tahoe Resources takeover targets 
CO  Certainly both Detour and Tahoe would fit the model sizewise  Goldcorp Inc   NYSE GG   walked away from the Osisko bid and clearly it wants to continue to grow through mergers and acquisitions  What will Goldcorp do  I m not expecting the company to come out tomorrow and make an acquisition on either of these names  but I think it will certainly do the diligence work 
Goldcorp already owns 40  of Tahoe  which has a world class asset with world class operating statistics  Goldcorp is already in Guatemala  I m not sure if it wants to increase its weighting there 
In the case of Detour  yes  it s in Canada  and from that point of view  quite attractive  Detour is still in the ramp up stage and perhaps it has finally reached the point where it is producing and reducing its cash costs  But I think Detour is still a year behind Osisko on that front 
TGR  Detour just published Q1 14 results  It had an adjusted net loss of  0 20 share  while it produced roughly 107 000 oz gold  Your thoughts 
CO  I was impressed at what Detour was able to achieve because it was a tough winter  I had some concerns that the weather might have proven to be an impediment  but the company produced a significant amount of gold  I think the grade was 0 9 grams per ton  Some of that was from stockpiles to buffer the grade at the mill  There are always a few bumps in the road but Detour has done very well 
TGR  In early 2013 that stock was above  25 share  Now it s about  11 share  What s going to get it back above  say   15 share 
CO  A couple of things  As I said earlier  I believe the gold price is going higher  With higher gold prices come higher margins  And I think the market is still putting a discount on Detour as it s in the ramp up phase  As the company brings down cash and operating costs quarter by quarter and approaches Detour Lake s nameplate production capacity  the stock will get back to a higher valuation 
TGR  Do you have any more gold names for us 
CO  I ll mention some of my larger holdings of nonproducers  Dalradian Resources Inc   TO DNA   and Asanko Gold Inc   AMEX AKG   that form part of a diversified portfolio 
TGR  What is the Dalradian story over the next 18 months or so 
CO  The company will continue to derisk the Curraghinalt project in Northern Ireland  Dalradian will go underground and through further drilling convert a fair amount of the Inferred resources to the Measured and Indicated category  As the market gets confidence with those numbers  it will start to rerate the company  A lot of people were concerned about whether mining would occur in Northern Ireland  To address that  Dalradian is looking to make a concentrate instead of using cyanide  The company is doing things that will ultimately make it more attractive 
TGR  Why do you own Asanko 
CO  It used to be called Keegan Resources  The management of Asanko bought into the project for around  27 million  These are the people that ran LionOre Mining  which under a decade ago was the subject of a bidding war between Xstrata Plc  XTA LSE  and Norilsk Nickel Mining Co   GMKN RTS  NILSY NASDAQ  MNOD LSE   They re good people with good operational experience  Asanko merged the PMI Ventures assets with those that were in Keegan and now has two projects within about 10 kilometers of each other  which are expected to have synergies  The company also has a significant amount of cash 
TGR  The Sprott Gold and Precious Minerals Fund has held positions in Pretium Resources Inc   NYSE PVG    Guyana Goldfields Inc   TO GUY    Unigold Inc   TO UGD   and Kirkland Lake Gold Inc   TO KGI    Does it still have positions in those names 
CO  Pretium and Guyana are among my top holdings  Unigold  which you mentioned  is a small cap name in the Dominican Republic  Unfortunately it has been the victim of the small cap market where investors have turned their backs on these types of companies through no fault of management  I think Unigold has an interesting property with lots of opportunities and drill targets  and could potentially have a mineable resource one day 
TGR  Guyana Goldfields  flagship Aurora project has outlined 6 5 million ounces Measured and Indicated  yet the stock price is falling 
CO  The company is at the point where it is ordering equipment  getting its financing in place  and then it will start building and moving Aurora forward  Again  it s time and execution 
TGR  Pretium had a bumpy ride in 2013  Do you still have faith in management 
CO  Yes  I visited Brucejack in British Columbia last year  It s a  nuggety  project that s difficult to model  It takes a lot of drilling to get that necessary level of confidence  Last year the company processed a 10 000 ton bulk sample that produced around 6 000 ounces  6 Koz  or about 0 6 ounces per ton  In February  Pretium sent another 1 000 ton sample to the mill and it produced around 3 ounces gold per ton  The important thing to look at with this company is that there is lots of gold underground  the model still needs work to figure out how best to mine it  Pretium is proceeding with further studies on Brucejack  but I think it will be a mine  It s also a potential acquisition as it is a high grade deposit in Canada 
TGR  Kirkland Lake Gold forecasts roughly 126 Koz in production in 2014  Is that realistic 
CO  It will probably come close to that number  Kirkland Lake has a new CEO  George Ogilvie  and a fairly dramatic change in ideology  A couple of years ago the company was focused on mining everything in the mine  Ogilvie is focused on mining more profitable ounces 
TGR   I understand that Kirkland has been attempting to lower costs  Is that working 
CO  Kirkland Lake is not yet profitable  but it has instituted a new program to mine higher grades  It will focus on the high grade ore because that is where it will make a profit  This is the same strategy that Rob McEwen put into place at the Red Lake mine  I think Kirkland has huge potential but it ultimately comes down to strategy execution 
TGR  In March you said that gold would reach  5 000 oz within a few years  That seems optimistic 
CO  It s based on the historical relationship between the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the gold price  Over the last 100 years there have been three times when it has cost 1 to 2 ounces gold to buy the Dow  The last time was 1980 when the gold price was  800 oz and the Dow was 800 
People roll their eyes when you forecast big numbers  In 2004 or 2005  I said gold would reach  1 000 oz  When it reached  1 000 oz  I moved to  2 000 oz and we almost got there  With the willingness of the market to continue to print money  I believe that we are going to get that 2 or 3 to 1 relationship with the Dow  With the Dow at 16 000  I think  5 000 oz is achievable  It s not really that the gold price is increasing  it s that paper currencies are depreciating in value

100941,322456,WPM,Silver Wheaton  A Precious Alternative ,opinion,"A precious alternative
Silver Wheaton Corp  NYSE SLW  is the world s pre eminent silver streaming company with agreements covering 24 different mining projects  19 of which are in production and two of which are anticipated to be in production in the foreseeable future  Constancia in FY15 and Rosemont in FY18   While at first glance analogous to both miners and royalty companies  Silver Wheaton s streaming business plan is almost unique as a listed investment opportunity as it offers exposure to exploration success and production expansion without exposure to cost inflation  It also pays a dividend and has geared exposure to precious metals prices  In the meantime  it trades on a rating that is uniformly cheaper than its royalty company contemporaries and is often little different to those of major mining companies  despite having a materially lower risk profile 

Future growth driven by past investment
Since its creation and listing in 2004  Silver Wheaton has recorded a 39 4  compound increase in silver sales per year  an 81 4  pa increase in earnings  a 55 4  pa increase in basic EPS and a 58 7  pa increase in operating cash flows  While growth rates will inevitably moderate  we are still forecasting a further 44 8  increase in basic EPS to FY19  driven by a  conservative  23 7  increase in silver equivalent production as a result of US 3 6bn in investments made over the past two years  with additional upside potential provided by Barrick s Pascua Lama and Pan American s Loma de La Plata projects 
Valuation  Potential 80  capital upside
Assuming no new streaming arrangements  note  this is an unlikely contingency   an investment in Silver Wheaton offers investors a break even internal rate of return over the remaining life of its streams  In addition to its conventional streaming arrangements  however  SLW is in a perfect position to offer effective funding to the mining industry at a c 16  cost of capital  see page 7  compared to a cost of debt  if it is available  frequently in excess of 10  and a cost of equity frequently around 30   By contrast  we estimate SLW s cost of debt to be 2 4  and its cost of equity to be 5 0   creating a significant opportunity for SLW  Taking into account likely future streaming agreements  we conservatively forecast a Silver Wheaton share price of US 37 67  C 41 12  in FY19  which represents an internal rate of return to existing investors of 14 7  in US dollar terms over a five year period  In relative terms meanwhile  SLW trades on multiples that are consistently cheaper than its royalty  peers  and more akin to  or in some cases cheaper than   its operating contemporaries  despite being associated with less risk  see page 11

100957,322472,WPM,Daily Notes  Is The Inflation Trade Coming To An End ,opinion,Topic  Is the inflation trade coming to an end The price of Gold and Silver recently broke down  I automatically put forward an opinion that this is a signal of up and coming deflation  In my view  all the QE action around the world is failing to re inflate the overall business cycle  Copper prices are telling us that the Emerging World growth is slowing and that all is not well in China  The metal was one of the first risky assets to break down  more on that below   I believe that the Aussie Dollar and Junk Bonds could be next in line Topic  Gold vs Silver ratio spells trouble for equity earningsCertain readers will argue that equities are being  re inflated   especially in the US   JPN  and that the QE is working  I agree  for now   But I also believe that those gains will be given back  as earnings start disappointing in coming quarters  The break in Gold  Silver and now in Copper is highly deflationary  Barry Bannister thinks the risk is for earnings to disappoint  updated    Topic  US equities could finally be joining the global correctionIf we consider the chart above  which illustrates the performance of global equity regions since January 2009  we can observe that US has continued its rise and now holds the title of  best performer  for the investment cycle  The title was held by Emerging and Frontier Market equities in early 2011  as they went through a powerful recovery post 2009 lows  On the other hand  EU equities have continued to under perform since the March 09 lows  holding the title of the  worst performer   EU equities have mainly been dragged down by the PIIGS region  German DAX has performed superbly  In my opinion  it is never wise to chase gains and invest into  best performers   as one can be setting themselves up for a lot of disappointments  Best performers usually get their titles by rallying way ahead of fundamentals and discounting all the good news  with plenty of negative surprises waiting on the other side We can see what happened to GEM stocks post 2011  Moreover  Frontier Markets are now down 21  from their 2010 highs  bear market  and have recently broken below November 2012 lows  just like Copper  equivalent price on S P is 1343   US equities could finally succumb to weakness and join the global correction  Additionally  from the contrarian point of view  being the best performer   US could surprise on the downside  updated    Topic  Copper prices spell trouble for global growth Freeport McMoRan has followed the price of Copper on the downside  breaking out of its long term triangular consolidation  While it took awhile longer  it finally happened  Regular readings might remember my article from August 2012  which predicted an eventual breakdown of Copper prices  What does this mean  Copper prices tend to lead OECD leading indicators  so further economic slowdown might be at hand   especially in China  In August 2012  I stated that    In summary  one can conclude that Copper is now at decision point and its technical break in either direction could tell us more about the future direction of the global economic activity than any analyst on CNBC or Bloomberg  Therefore  make sure you keep your eyes on the price of Copper over the coming weeks and months  As for my own view   I m bearish and expect Copper to eventually break down before we bottom    Topic  Economic surprise index is breaking down Copper isn t the only financial macro indicator sending warning signals  Crude Oil is very close to breaking down out of its multi year triangle pattern  Furthermore  the chart above shows Citigroup s Economic Surprise Index has once again crossed below the 0 line  updated    Topic  Some interesting technical charts I am looking at   Gold has recently become oversold and equities overbought  Chart above shows S P 500 at a major resistance around 1 550 while Gold is testing its trend line with RSI at the lowest level since 1999 Ukarlewitz over at Fat Pitch blog believes that the S P 500 is in the process of topping  from the technical point of view  Observing the chart  assumption is made that an uptrend has finished and a topping process has started  We ve seen these before in February 2011  March 2012 and September 2012 Personally  I believe that with S P 500 at a major resistance  first technical chart above   supply could overwhelm demand for awhile  Therefore  a more meaningful correction  in form of a bear market  could be in the cards According to Bespoke s commodity grid  the overall sector is quite oversold at present  doesn t mean it cannot go down further   There is only one exception   Natural Gas  updated    Topic  Gold Miners have become extremely cheapI usually do not invest into commodity producers  While it is true that certain miners like Silver Wheaton outperform Silver by a lot during uptrends  they also tend to underperform by a lot during downtrends  Having said that Gold Miners have become extremely cheap right now  And I mean EXTREMELY cheap  I wasn t a believer in Gold Miners back in August 2011  just as certain bloggers were trying to convince the public that GDX at  50 is a great buy  These bloggers were claiming that euphoria phase was beginning Personally  I thought that Miners were definitely inexpensive in May 2012  as prices corrected quite strongly  They began to offer value and a bottom could have been close  However  it wasn t to be  as the sector recently crashed to much lower lows  Currently  with a ratio of Gold vs HUI above 5 2  I am finally warming up to the fact that Gold Miners could be a smart investment right here Maybe the price could go a little bit lower and bottom out  but contrarian investors are being offered a 60  discount  Those who do not believe in PMs bull market do not see value here  On the other hand  those who hold conviction that the bull is not dead yet  should start buying  Finally  BPI breadth is now at rock bottom oversold level of zero Topic  Gold Miners just as oversold as during the panic of 08 ,2013-04-21,Tiho

100986,322501,WPM,Jay Taylor  Where To Buy Gold In Difficult Times ,opinion,According to the calendar  it is still winter and gold markets still face some tough sledding  says Jay Taylor  host of the radio show  Turning Hard Times into Good Times   Big investors are leaving the market and small investors hesitate to reenter  But in this interview with The Gold Report  Taylor points to some spots where selective investors can find value and growth potential  The Gold Report  There seems to be a general malaise in resource investing  particularly in precious metals  What will it take to get investors back in the market  Jay Taylor  People buy gold in difficult times  and right now there is a sense that the economy is improving  The conventional wisdom says that the huge amounts of money Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke is pumping into the system will bring prosperity  To the extent that people are investing  they are choosing more traditional investments  People have been so badly burned that small investors have stayed out  They are gun shy  and for good reason  TGR  While the mainstream media is reporting an economic turnaround  the markets do not reflect that  at least from the individual investor perspective  JT  Absolutely  and that is because the middle class is having a tougher and tougher time of it  The hedge fund managers and the people playing with wealthy people s money can speculate in the stock market and the commodities markets  They have done quite well recently  but the average investor is being squeezed very hard  In large part  that is because the cost of living is higher relative to their salaries and people have lost huge amounts of money in the value of their homes  I do not buy the notion that we are on the mend  To the contrary  I think the policies being used will be lethal for our economy in the long term  Printing money and capitalizing the banks  redistributing wealth this is wiping out savings  investment and capital formation  In the last reporting period  the U S  was at negative gross domestic product  GDP   If you look at the real inflation numbers  I would think that few people believe their cost of living is rising only 1 7  a year  which is what the government is reporting  If the cost of living is actually going up more like 8 9   as economist  suggests  we are in real negative numbers once GDP is factored in  The misguided perception that things are getting better may make it difficult for gold and for silver  too  One of the reasons the precious metals mining sector is having a tough time may be that the hedge funds  having bought into gold shares and gold mining companies  are now finding other things to invest in  The investors who used to buy penny mining stocks are certainly not in the market now  TGR  Yet  people in Second  and Third World countries are demanding more products that require raw materials to build  so many of the base metals analysts I speak to are fairly bullish on the global economy  Perhaps other economies are actually growing in a true sense  JT  That is probably right  China is an interesting example  Despite having a planned economy  you can make the argument that China is really a capitalist society  Despite its official use of the word  Communism   there is a real lack of regulation there  One recent guest on my radio show noted it was easier to open 26 for profit schools in China than it would have been in the U S  You can make an argument that its lack of onerous regulations makes the Chinese more free than we are  China also is a nation where people save money  something Americans have forgotten how to do  In our Keynesian economy  we punish savers  we tax and take away their wealth  Mr  Bernanke s zero interest rate policy is robbing American savers and is taking away capital formation  China has capital formation  It does not have all these so called safety nets in place to take care of people  People save for themselves and their future  The U S  calls itself a capitalist country  but it is more of a collectivist society than China  You can make a good case that China and other underdeveloped countries are just getting started  Ultimately  that is bullish for gold and silver because people in those countries understand the real wealth of gold and silver  TGR  Central banks in other countries are accumulating gold  Private investors in China  Abu Dhabi and Dubai are also acquiring physical bullion  Perhaps this bullish market will stimulate the precious metals industry  JT  I think that is right  Sally  People in those countries recognize that if they put their savings into the local currency  it could be gone tomorrow  They understand that gold and silver are real wealth  Americans are not that smart  We have been told to trust our policymakers  and most Americans do  I think there is bullish case to be made longer term gold  although we are in for some tough sledding in the gold markets  TGR  Analysts and investors are clamoring for income in portfolios and are looking for dividend paying stocks  Even some junior mining companies are paying a dividend  Will more mining companies follow this trend to deter investors from leaving the sector in search of dividends  or will the industry continue putting money into capital expenses and mergers and acquisitions  as it has historically  JT  That is a tough call  The mining industry is so capital intensive  On the other hand  companies realize that they need to get their share prices up to a reasonable level  There is a real push and a pull  There is no question that companies that can provide a dividend will do much better in the market  For my newsletter  I am looking for companies that are cash flow positive  companies that do not have to raise capital  If a mining company has to raise capital to drill highly speculative holes in the ground  the market will not support that today  TGR  Of course  many of the companies that have sufficient cash are invisible to investors because they do not need or get the attention of investment banks and analysts  Can you tell us about any of these diamonds in the rough companies that are producing  have healthy treasuries and balance sheets and are able to reward their shareholders with increased production and share price profiles  JT  One is Dynacor Gold Mines Inc   DNG TSX   There are lots of small  family owned  high grade mining projects in Peru  too small to warrant building a mill  Dynacor provides that processing service  using environmentally accepted practices  The company has been able to get higher recoveries than other operations that were not working within environmental and other regulations  Basically  Dynacor can now select the grades it wants  as a result  its earnings are growing rapidly  It just got permitted to build a second mill  Within two years  I expect annual production will be near 100 000 ounces  100 Koz   It does not pay a dividend  but its earnings are growing nicely  Production at its processing plant in Peru is increasing and it also has an exploration project with blue sky potential  The property is in the middle of major copper gold pour free targets  Dynacor does not issue shares  it is growing organically  Its shares are selling at two or three times cash flow right now  TGR  And Dynacor does not have to get the gold out of the ground  JT  It does not  Other people bring the gold to Dynacor  The company does have its own non NI 43 101 resource of more than 600 Koz or 800 Koz in a high grade  underground vein system at a project called Tumipampa  It is a pour free skarn gold and silver target  in the middle of some major deposits  Dynacor has some very good surface showings  The company expects to mine Tumipampa itself  TGR  Dynacor has gone from  0 60 to  1 33 share in the last six months  Only a handful of mining companies could boast that  JT  Yes  and it did it in a horrible market environment  But my number one pick this year is a streaming company called Sandstorm Gold Ltd   SSL TSX   It takes the model Silver Wheaton Corp   SLW TSX  SLW NYSE  developed for silver and uses it for gold  In fact  Sandstorm was started by former Silver Wheaton mangers  In this model  Sandstorm provides capital to mining projects that it believes are economically viable  The investments tend to happen after the mining company has finished its full feasibility and permitting  in other words  when most of the risk is taken out  But Sandstorm also looks for major exploration upside  For example  management might work a deal for 15 20  of the life of mine production  linking the cost of production to when production starts or when the feasibility study is done  In effect  Sandstorm is entitled to buy gold at 20  of the gold production at  say   400 ounce   400 oz   With the gold price at  1 600 oz today  that is a darn good margin  In addition  Sandstorm does not have to put in any sustaining capital  It just keeps on buying that gold at  400 oz for the life of the mine  Sandstorm does its homework  focusing on projects with good economics  but also lots of exploration potential  The company has a number of projects coming on line  Some of its early projects are now increasing production  Sandstorm is extremely well managed and  for investors who do not want to study individual companies  it is similar to owning a mutual fund with a streaming model  TGR  In a way  it is better than a mutual fund because it gives investors a basket of companies that have been studied closely by management  more closely than any mutual fund manager would study any individual stock that he or she owns  This is an amazing business model  Are there other names you like  maybe even an explorer  JT  I am now much more selective on the explorers  but I have several on my list  I like Brazil Resources Inc   BRI TSX V  BRIZF OTCQX  a lot  One should always start by looking at management  and Chairman Amir Adnani is highly regarded  He did a remarkable job for Uranium Energy Corp   UEC   Brazil Resources has at least one very good  advanced stage property now  and has arranged financing with Brazilinvest Group  a financial concern that owns a lot of the company s shares  TGR  Amir has moved his companies forward  Brazil is a great mining address  although lesser known and understood  Do you see any issues there  JT  Politically  Brazil is one of the better jurisdictions these days and it has the geology  Columbus Gold Corp   CGT TSX V  is another explorer to keep an eye on  The company just increased the potential of its open pittable gold project in French Guyana to upward of 5 3 million ounces  5 3 Moz   French Guyana operates under the French legal system  and the top Columbus geologist is a French Canadian  so he speaks the language  Columbus has an alliance with a publicly listed French mining company  The French company likes to mine the surface saprolite  and Columbus has the skill set to do the hard rock stuff  I also like Golden Arrow Resources Corp   GRG TSX V   It has a lot of cash and an evolving silver project in Argentina that appears to have a high probability of substantial success  I thought I would never again be interested in South Africa until I saw Robert Friedland stepping into Ivanplats Ltd   IVP TSX   Ivanplats is a nickel and platinum group metals  PGM  gold project with extensive  high grade PGMs and gold in a structure with extensive strike length and impressive depth and width  The scope of the structure promises superb mining economics  Of course the downside is being in South Africa  However  Robert Friedland has lots of capital and very important political connections  Northern Freegold Resources Ltd   NFR TSX V  NFRGF OTCQX   up in the Yukon  has 6 3 Moz gold equivalent  about half of it in gold  Infrastructure can be problematic in the Yukon  but Freegold has road access rights to the property and a nearby power line  The stock is selling for around  0 10 share  TGR  I seem to remember some connection between Freegold and Western Copper and Gold Corp   WRN TSX  WRN NYSE MKT   JT  Yes  the two companies are the in same backyard  TGR  Who else is active in Canada  JT  Aurvista Gold Corp   AVA TSX V  has a promising greenfield project in Qu bec  Canada  The NI 43 101 numbers are around 3 Moz  It is open pittable  At first blush  the stripping ratio is relatively low  but the economics should be good  I do not know how much metallurgical work has been done  but there was a long lateral strike  Being in Qu bec is an advantage  given the laws and investment incentives there  Norvista Resources Corp  owns a big chunk of Aurvista shares and contributes strong connections through its presence on the board of directors  TGR  I would like to talk about your radio show  Turning Hard Times into Good Times   Is that name applicable today  JT  It is  The Dow Jones Industrial Average is close to new highs  The Wall Street bankers still have their penthouses on Fifth Avenue and their houses in the Hamptons  However  the middle class is still being hurt  On the show  we try to help people understand what is true  not necessarily what they want to hear  We invite interesting guests  This week  we had Peter Schiff and Mark Skousen  Jim Rogers and a theologian named Dr  Albert Schmidt will be on soon  I like to reach beyond the financial because the spiritual is part of how people approach life  Markets are driven by sociological trends  by philosophical and theological thinking  But the main focus is how to survive in tough times  how to make money by recognizing the reality rather than pretending things are good when they are not  TGR  I hear you saying that there are opportunities for thoughtful  selective investors  JT  Absolutely  The energy sector is the bright spot in the American economy right now  There are some extraordinary refinery stocks and energy sector plays  A company called Synodon Inc   SYD TSX V  has a new technology for pipeline leaks  Paul van Eeden is very much involved in it  and I am very excited by it  TGR  Are you excited about uranium  JT  I like uranium and believe we are close to a turning point there  Uranium Energy Corp  looks really good  Another is Blue Sky Uranium Corp   BSK TSX V   a penny stock  selling around  0 10 share  AREVA  AREVA EPA  is involved in financing its exploration in northern Argentina  The  2 million AREVA spent will go a long way in exploring Blue Sky s shallow holes  This could turn into a very large  low grade open pittable uranium deposit  TGR  Well  Jay  we may have not solved the problems of the universe  but thanks for your time and your insights  As he

100987,322502,WPM,Silver Wheaton Corp To Pay Quarterly Dividend ,opinion,Introduction Today Silver Wheaton Corporation  TSX  SLW   NYSE  SLW  declared its first quarterly cash dividend payment for 2013 of US  0 14 per common share  This dividend will be paid on April 2  2013  and will be distributed on or about April 12  2013  This is good news for shareholders in that it is the highest quarterly dividend to date by SLW  Randy Smallwood  President and Chief Executive Officer of  commented on the dividend payment as follows   2012 was another exceptional year for Silver Wheaton  anchored by a fourth quarter that saw record production  sales  revenue  net income  and cash flow for the company    With the addition of production from Hudbay s 777 mine midway through the year  plus growing production from Pe asquito  San Dimas and Zinkgruvan  2012 production exceeded our forecast by over one and a half million ounces    This translated into sales of over 27 million ounces  with the fourth quarter coming in at over nine million ounces  and full year cash flows of over  719 million  Given our dividend policy of paying out 20  of the trailing quarter s cash flow  Silver Wheaton s strong production growth profile directly translates into higher dividends  with  0 35per common share paid during 2012  almost double what was paid in 2011  and our strong fourth quarter resulted in our first dividend in 2013 being  0 14 per share   Fourth Quarter highlights as follows  We would draw your attention to the increase in cash costs which rose to  4 70 per silver equivalent ounce  compared to  4 06 per silver equivalent ounce in Q4 2011  With silver trading at  29 00 oz this increase is not a big deal  but should be watched especially with new acquisitions as they will tend to towards requiring a better return for their silver production    Record attributable silver equivalent production of 8 5 million ounces compared to 6 9 million ounces in Q4 2011 and 7 7 million ounces in Q3 2012  representing an increase of 22  and 10   respectively    Record silver equivalent sales of 9 1 million ounces compared to 6 0 million ounces in Q4 2011 and 5 1 million ounces in Q3 2012  representing an increase of 53  and 78   respectively    Record revenues of  287 2 million compared to  191 9 million in Q4 2011  representing a 50  increase    Record net earnings of  177 7 million   0 50 per share  compared to  144 7 million   0 41 per share  in Q4 2011  representing a 23  increase    Record operating cash flows of  254 0 million   0 72 per share1  compared to  163 7 million   0 46per share1  in Q4 2011  representing a 55  increase    Cash operating margin1 of  26 76 per silver equivalent ounce  compared to  28 06 in Q4 2011  representing a 5  decrease    Average cash costs1 rose to  4 70 per silver equivalent ounce  compared to  4 06 per silver equivalent ounce in Q4 2011  representing a 16  increase  driven primarily by higher costs associated with silver and gold from the Hudbay 777 mine   5 90 and  400 per ounce of silver and gold  respectively     Declared quarterly dividend of  0 14 per common share  representing 20  of the cash generated by operating activities during the three months ended December 31  2012  Background to Silver Wheaton Silver stream or silver purchase agreements allow Silver Wheaton to purchase  in exchange for an up front payment  the by product silver production of a mine that it does not own or operate  Since approximately 70  of all silver production occurs as a by product of base or precious metals production  there are numerous potential opportunities for further growth with this business model  Based upon its current agreements  forecast 2013 attributable production is approximately 33 5 million silver equivalent ounces  including 145 thousand ounces of gold  By 2017  annual attributable production is anticipated to increase significantly to approximately 53 million silver equivalent ounces  including 180 thousand ounces of gold  Other than its initial upfront payment  Silver Wheaton typically has no ongoing capital or exploration costs  and the company does not hedge its silver or gold production  Taking a quick look at the chart we can see that there is some support at the  30 00 level  however  progress depends on the price of silver and with the summer doldrums upon us  progress could be a tad lackluster Analyst opinions We can see from the above chart that none of these analysts are recommending this stock  For those who are contrarian by nature this could be an indication that the bottom has been reached and therefore a buying opportunity presents itself  Trading Ideas For a long idea in the precious metals space  we suggest accumulating this stock as and when you can  However the fortunes of SLW are predicated on the performance of silver prices heading to higher ground  In the short term we are entering into the summer season  which generally is a quiet time for both gold and silver  so this consolidation period may continue over the summer months  Patience may well be required  Financials Silver Wheaton Corporation has a market capitalization of  10 98B  an EPS of  1 55  a 52 week low of  22 94 and a high of  41 30  average volume of shares traded is around 4 00 5 00Mln  so the liquidity is good  with 354 29 million shares outstanding  Current stock price is  30 98  Revenue was  287 2 million in the fourth quarter of 2012  on silver equivalent sales of 9 1 million ounces  7 3 million ounces of silver and 33 000 ounces of gold   This represents a 50  increase from the  191 9 million of revenue generated in the fourth quarter of 2011  due primarily to a comparable increase in the number of ounces sold with relatively unchanged gold and silver prices  Silver Wheaton Corporation can be found on both the NYSE and the TSX under the symbol of SLW  Finally  with the Eurozone still wrestling with the financial aspects of some of its member states  notably Cyprus and the creation of money out of thin air  we expect both  and  prices to finish the year much higher than they are now  Disclosure  We do own this stock  Disclaimer   or  makes no

100989,322504,WPM,Arie Papernick  A New Mining Investment Landscape Explained,opinion,Life is difficult for junior resource companies  Not only are stocks and commodity prices moving sideways  but tax changes in Canada may signal less friendly treatment for exploration investment  But not all is grim  according to Arie Papernick  the head of equity capital markets at Secutor Capital Management Corp  in Toronto  In this interview with The Metals Report  Papernick says investors can still make money if they focus on companies that are producing or near production with an attractive capital structure and strong balance sheets  Royalty plays are another favorite  He reveals that the next big opportunity may be coming in the energy metals space   The Metals Report  Arie  the Canadian government recently introduced a new budget that contains changes to the tax code that are expected to affect mining companies with producing mines  John Gravelle  a mining expert for PricewaterhouseCoopers  recently called this legislation  a form of stealth resource nationalism   What s your view   Arie Papernick  The budget proposes reductions to some of the tax benefits that can be passed to flow through shareholders  The major impact is that some traditional pre production expenses  also called Canadian exploration expenses  CEE   which previously could be 100  written off in the year incurred  will be phased out over the next few years  Starting in 2018  only 30  of these expenses can be deducted on a declining basis as Canadian development expenses  CDE   This will potentially hurt resource companies  ability to raise capital through flow through shares as the flow through investor community generally insists on receiving only CEE deductions   The changes will also be troublesome for junior companies that are developing new mines  because they will have to start paying taxes much sooner if CEE can no longer be used to reduce taxable income on a 100  deduction basis   TMR  Do the budget changes suggest Canada is becoming a less viable place to start a mine   AP  Not at all  Of course  any time you mess around with tax benefits or the deduction rates on capital equipment  it affects cash flows and makes capital investment less attractive  But at the same time  Canada is a pretty safe jurisdiction  And flow through shares are a terrific way of raising capital that is unique to Canada  On the positive side  the budget extended the investment tax credit for flow through shares in respect of certain grassroots mining expenses  The combination of federal and provincial tax credits provides powerful incentives  It s unfortunate that Canada is proposing tweaks in this budget that may make flow through investment a bit less attractive   TMR  How would Arie Papernick fix what is happening  Could this be done by legislation   AP  I think maintaining the benefits of flow through investment for the Canadian resource market is key  If anything  the government should be going the other way  In certain areas that are more remote  there should be additional tax benefits for investing in these projects  Experts believe the proposed budget changes are trying to align the mining industry with the oil and gas industry  but there are significant differences between the two  and  if anything  the mining space needs more tax incentives to motivate investment   TMR  Funding for exploration is very difficult right now  What fallout do you see in the market if this dearth of financing persists   AP  I see a future with a lot fewer mining companies  We ll see more mergers and acquisitions  M A  as well as property acquisitions due to interest from Asian and South American companies  You re also going to see a lot of a junior exploration companies looking for opportunistic property acquisitions  I m getting a lot of calls from clients on that  Smaller companies that have good balance sheets are looking for opportunities  You re going to see a lot of combinations of smaller companies to create a new company with more assets  Combining companies is a good reason to restructure and make companies more attractive as investments  In the current market  the capital structure of many junior miners won t attract institutional investment capital and that has to be fixed   TMR  Recently we ve been seeing more royalty companies than we ve ever seen before especially in the junior side of the precious metals business  What s your view of royalty companies and which ones do you like   AP  At Secutor  I specialize in raising private placement financings  providing M A advice and structuring royalty strategies for issuers that conduct exploration in Canada  As an example  Gold Royalties Corp   GRO TSX V  is a terrific alternative investment vehicle to provide non dilutive  hard dollar financings for exploration companies  The company is mainly focusing on both producing and near production net smelter royalties  with full cycle exposure to exploration royalties on mainly Canadian projects   Franco Nevada Corp   FNV  is a partner  and that  in my opinion  speaks indirectly to the competencies of Gold Royalties  current management  I believe the company has also received capital from Callinan Royalties Corp   CAA TSX V   Gold Royalties has recently received its first payment from Metanor Resources Inc   MTO TSX V  on the Bachelor Lake royalty  The company is clearly carving out a niche for itself in this space   TMR  Gold Royalties has a portfolio of 10 royalties  Which ones stand out to you   AP  Right now  Bachelor Lake  which I think was Gold Royalties  first  is the standout because it s the only one producing  Eagle Zone  given its 6 million ounce resource  is also of interest  Gold Royalties has multiple royalties on Stillwater Mining Co  s  SWC  Bermuda platinum group metal property in Ontario  I ve spoken to management many times and Gold Royalties clearly has a healthy long term time horizon on the portfolio it s amassing   TMR  Are we going to see more of these types of companies come to market as this weak price environment for junior miners persists   AP  We ve seen a few and we ve seen a few new ones spin off  Most of the market is concentrated at the higher end  Sandstorm Gold Ltd   SSL TSX   Silver Wheaton Corp   SLW TSX  SLW NYSE   Gold Group and Franco Nevada are chasing larger producing streaming and royalty transactions  At the lower end  there aren t a lot of players with experience and a proven track record  This space isn t going to get very crowded  It takes a lot of skill to understand what you re buying   TMR  Which junior mining companies are you most familiar with   AP  I was recently involved in the financing of a junior mining company called NexGen Energy Ltd   which is a private uranium company that is planning to go public very shortly through a reverse takeover with a shell company called Clermont Capital Inc   XYZ P TSX V   NexGen s main property is called Radio  which is adjacent to the Rough Rider deposit that Rio Tinto Plc  RIO NYSE  RIO ASX  RIO LSE  RTPPF OTCPK  bought from Hathor Exploration for  600 million   600M   The huge success of Alpha Minerals Inc   AMW TSX V  and Fission Energy Corp   FIS TSX V  FSSIF OTCQX  at the Patterson Lake South project has attracted a lot of attention on another NexGen property called Rook 1  which is directly northeast of Patterson Lake South   The market is giving Patterson Lake South over a  150M valuation and there is a massive gravity low coincident with the conductor just as it crosses onto Nexgen s boundary  Actually  the main discovery hole is about 2 kilometers from the NexGen  Rook 1 border and NexGen is going to do some physical surveys and drilling later on this year  In addition  NexGen also acquired properties in the Athabasca basin from Mega Uranium   TMR  When is NexGen going public   AP  It s on the exchange s desk but my best estimate would probably be in the next couple of weeks   TMR  What junior precious metal miners are you familiar with   AP  We also follow St Andrew Goldfields Ltd   SAS TSX   The company posted net income of  26M in 2012 and gold production was about 95 000 ounces  95 Koz   St Andrew is focused on growth and producing free cash flow  It has a strong balance sheet and is well positioned to take advantage of the current market climate  St Andrew would be a potential acquirer of an attractive junior that has fallen in this current market  The company is targeting similar production at similar costs for 2013  and for 2014 is targeting gold production of 120 130 Koz  The increased production target will be made possible once its Taylor project comes on line  The company is waiting on results from the initial 15 000 ton bulk sample taken at Taylor  and then will take a second bulk sample at a deeper level to help mitigate risk   St Andrew also continues to be active in exploration and has been focusing on extending the mine lives of its three producing mines  Holt  Holloway and Hislop  It s also doing technical work on its Aquarius project to see how this fits into the future growth profile   TMR  Is St Andrew going to need to do any financings anytime soon   AP  St Andrew has a very strong balance sheet and it is cash flow positive  I don t see any need in the near term but I wouldn t feel comfortable speaking for management  There s always the potential that a company like St Andrew would want to take advantage of flow through shares for exploration work   TMR  Are there any other junior precious metals mining companies you like   AP  Another one we chatted about before is Metanor Resources  which is a new producer  Gold Royalties has a royalty on Metanor s Bachelor Lake property  which produced about 13 Koz from July 2012 to February 2013  It produced 3 Koz in February and its goal is to produce about 5 Koz month  targeting 50 60 Koz year   The mill is running at 96 97  recovery and the mining rate has increased over time  So the Bachelor Lake mine seems to be ramping up quite smoothly and Metanor continues to do exploration work  In January  the company announced some really good intercepts  one was about 30 grams per ton  30 g t  over 4 5 meters  4 5m   the other was 15 g t over 14m  So we like this one as well   TMR  How about one more   AP  Integra Gold Corp   ICG TSX V  is a non producer in the Val d Or area of Quebec  It is exploring its Lamaque property  which features high grade plugs with really good grade continuity  The company is working on an initial preliminary economic assessment  PEA  that it planned for release this year  so it is carrying out metallurgical testing and environmental studies in preparation for the report  Integra also has continued to hit high grade intersections including approximately 44 g t over 2 9m and 173 g t over 3m at its No  5 plug  which is a new exploration target that won t be included in the PEA  The company is planning to drill an additional 5 000m at this target after in fill drilling in the main zones has been completed   Integra s properties are right on the Cadillac Break  so it s surrounded by lots of mills that aren t being used or are incredibly underutilized   The company has been around for a long time and changed its name from Kalahari Resources Inc  about two years ago  It was re organized with new management  The company has been able to finance itself on a pretty regular basis and has strong key shareholder support   TMR  What commodities are you most bullish on right now   AP  The action seems to be focused on uranium  We re seeing a few successes in that space  namely Fission Energy and Alpha Minerals  Denison Mines Corp   DNN NYSE MKT  is also completing its acquisition of Fission  with Fission spinning out its Patterson Lake South assets into a new publicly traded company  So uranium exploration around the southwest of the Athabasca basin seems to be where the interest is building  There have also been a lot of acquisitions and land deals in the area and the price of uranium has been going in the right direction   TMR  What s your outlook for the junior mining equity space over the rest of the year   AP  It s still going to be tough  The main problem stems from a few years ago when the major miners overspent on acquisitions and subsequently wrote them off  In the past  the majors were always viewed as the exit strategy for the juniors  and so those exit dreams are being questioned  The other major reason for our weak market is basically flow of funds  Major indices are hitting all time highs  so a lot of portfolio managers are moving money out of the juniors and into large cap plays  They ve been able to chase returns on much bigger non resource names   For these reasons  the problems in the resource space are likely to continue for some time  Moreover  resource issuers are highly dependent on financings and the amount of money available is much less than the number of people looking for it  It s going to take some time and a couple of things will need to happen  A lot of experts believe there are too many public resource companies  A lot of them won t be able to continue  This will help the survivors get access to the limited available funds   We ve seen over the last few months numerous very small financings  sub  500 000  some even less than  100 000  You can t further exploration on that kind of a shoestring budget  As such  a lot of resource companies just won t make it  As I mentioned  there will be a lot of consolidation with a lot of juniors pairing together  people in similar jurisdictions trying to work together to increase their asset base in order to survive   TMR  Do you have one last piece of advice for investors in this space   AP  Companies need to have the ability to finance themselves  but if successful  they then need to be able to use the money as wisely as possible and continue to be active and create news  Many of the companies that have cash are so worried about the market that they tend to hoard the cash  Cutting back dramatically on their programs leads to less news  and when there is less news  there s no reason to buy the stock  That keeps the downward pressure on the share price  and that can put companies into a lousy position when eventually they will need to finance again  Operating a junior resource company is not easy  it is a constant battle  Most do not produce any revenue  so they are just spending  They constantly need sources of funding  and as soon as they get money  they are in a race to produce results to keep the share price attractive  so that further financings don t totally dilute existing investors  I don t envy the position of junior resource executive   TMR  Thank you for your insights  Arie   Arie Papernick runs the Equity Capital Market s team at Secutor Capital Management Corp  in Toronto  His team

101013,322528,WPM,Jordan Roy Byrne   Gold  Silver Will Soon Help Line Investors Pockets ,opinion,Even though the mining equity markets have been choppy and mostly sideways this year  Jordan Roy Byrne  CMT and editor of The Daily Gold Premium newsletter  has managed to produce some enviable returns in his model portfolio  In this exclusive interview with The Gold Report  he tells us why he s now turning his attention to silver  which he expects will provide some exciting returns for producers and investors  He talks about some of his favorite names and how companies with cash and cash flow will be able to scoop up some great property deals from less fortunate juniors  The Gold Report  A lot has happened on the global economic and geopolitical fronts since we spoke last Spring  What s your appraisal of the affects of these developments on the precious metals markets  Jordan Roy Byrne  I believe the geopolitics is overplayed  Certain geopolitical events can have a short term impact but by and large aren t a long term driving force for precious metals  As far as the economy itself  up until this spring  the markets were essentially pricing in a mild recession globally  Europe was in recession and the emerging world was slowing down considerably  The U S  situation is similar to Japan after its bust  We re in a flat lining mode  which I believe will continue for another five to seven years  I don t see any substantial economic growth  and at the same time I don t see any severe recessions on the horizon  To have a severe recession you need to have an expansion lasting for many years  The Great Recession of 2007 2008 cleansed the system  Granted  we re still not at the point where we can get back to consistent strong economic growth  It s going to take several more years to get to that point  At the beginning of the crisis  governments financed deficits with huge amounts of short term debt rather than with long term instruments  A significant amount of that debt is coming due in the next several years  That s why we re having open ended quantitative easing  QE  and why we will have permanent QE  given that the debt burden over the next couple of years is going to be substantially greater than it was in the last couple of years  The other point is that even though we have had a recovery  it has not been strong enough to bring down the debt burden  which has gotten worse and worse  That s why I believe we re in a new cyclical bull market for precious metals that started in May  I m looking for a little correction pullback in October  After that  the market could be in position to retest its highs sometime this winter  TGR  Historically  October can be a scary month in the markets and it is just ahead of the U S  election  Care to make any short term predictions for what will happen between now and the end of the year  JR B  I think the markets will do what they re going to do  They don t really respond to political events  Markets are forward looking and lead everything  I don t see something coming out of nowhere and most markets are performing fairly well  October is probably just going to be a pullback  and it s possible the S P 500 can have a significant pullback  I m more focused on precious metals  which have been following the seasonality to a T in the last couple of months  Typically  this seasonality calls for weakness in October  The market is ready for a correction anyway  and the typical October seasonality adds more credence to that argument  TGR  You just got back from the big Toronto investment conference  What was the general sentiment there  JR B  There was a good turnout at the show and I think people are more optimistic  The general sentiment has improved regarding the markets and precious metals specifically  Just speaking anecdotally  the average retail investor I spoke with was definitely interested in the precious metals story but still not ready to be fully onboard  I think that s a good thing from a contrarian point of view  TGR  You approach the markets from a technical standpoint  probably more so than most of the people we talk to at The Gold Report  What do you see from a technical standpoint on the precious metals at this point  JR B  I look at the charts  sentiment indicators and money flows  So  it s a much broader study then people think  Then you have to align that with the fundamental picture  However  the technicals always lead fundamentals  We saw that in the last couple of months when the markets completed a bottom and then started to move up a little bit in anticipation of the actual QE announcement  I like to look at everything  but technical analysis is definitely my bread and butter  Now  looking at gold  I had a short term target of  1 800 ounce  oz   which was predictable because there were previous peaks there  It s consolidating below  1 800 oz with probably another three or four weeks of weakness before it can make an attempt at breaking through again  Over the next two to three months  I have an upside target of  1 900 oz  retesting the old high  After that  I have a potential six to nine month target of  2 250 2 300 oz  Once this market breaks  1 800 oz  it only has a little resistance at  1 900 oz to deal with  I m a little less keen on silver right now  I had a short term target of  35 37 oz  Similar to how gold is pulling back at  1 800 oz  we see silver pulling back and consolidating around  35 oz  A good target for the next three months would probably be  40 42 oz  Assuming gold breaks  1 900 oz and  2 000 oz  that would indicate to me that silver is probably going to test  50 oz  So  those are the targets I m looking at In regard to the equities  Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF  GDX NYSEArca   the large cap unhedged gold stock producers  peaked just below  56  I had a target of  58  so it didn t quite go as high as I expected  Again  it s consolidating here and I expect that to continue for probably another three weeks or so  Looking at upside targets over the next three or four months  there s strong resistance at  64  Assuming gold breaks above  1 900 oz  the NYSE Arca Gold BUGS Index  HUI NYSEArca  and the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF should break to new all time highs  probably by the end of February  TGR  Do you think that when gold breaks through  2 000 oz  everybody is going to finally decide it s going higher and pile into it  JR B  I think that s fair to say and that in the next leg higher  people will start to get a lot more excited  I also should point out that the junior equities always start to catch fire when gold breaks to a new high  One reason I expect this is that the rebound we ve had in the last several months  both in the shares and in the metals  has come with very strong momentum  When a market is bottoming and then starts to build momentum  that indicates that the internals are very strong and that the rebound is going to be sustainable in the near term  In the last couple of months  the momentum these shares and the metals have achieved has been very strong  which bodes very well for continued movement higher  likely after October  TGR  Maybe we can talk a bit about the model portfolio you re running in your Daily Gold Premium newsletter  How s that performed since the beginning of the year  JR B  At this point  it is up 24  year to date  I use Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF  GDXJ NYSEArca  as my benchmark  which is essentially flat  So  we ve been fortunate to have done quite well so far this year  TGR  That s pretty good  considering the performance of a lot of stocks in the space  What are some of the specific gold names you particularly like at this point  JR B  We ve avoided juniors for the most part and were cautious on silver for a while  which has helped our performance relative to the rest of the sector  We ve also overweighted some of our favorite names  such as Argonaut Gold Inc   AR TSX   which is one we have really liked for some time  That stock has performed very  very well  It has exactly what I want to see in what I like to call a growth oriented producer  It reminds me of First Majestic Silver Corp   FR TSX  AG NYSE  FMV FSE  a couple of years ago  when I knew that it really had the capability and potential to grow itself into a major producer  So  I think Argonaut looks very similar to First Majestic  which I continue to be bullish on and continues to have a stellar pipeline of projects   and I expect it to have a similarly huge move  occurring more slowly over the next several years  It has two growing mines  probably the best management in the industry and is currently permitting a third project  If there are any delays in the permitting  that could cause the stock to fall a little bit and would provide a fantastic opportunity for people to add to their positions and for newer investors to get onboard  But  I definitely remain very optimistic on Argonaut over the next several years  Even though the stock has already advanced substantially  I think it still has significant room to move over the next 12 18 months  Next  I would mention Corvus Gold Inc   KOR TSX   which is an exploration company that has performed fantastically  Corvus has joint ventured its projects in Alaska and focused most of its resources on its North Bullfrog project in Nevada  Not only does North Bullfrog have substantial exploration potential  but also Corvus has already outlined a deposit there and put out a preliminary economic assessment  PEA   The PEA showed that the project would be extremely economic  even at lower gold prices  with payback at about two years  even on a  1 250 oz gold price  It also has fantastic exploration potential  Part of the deposit is on privately owned land  which means it can be permitted much faster and get into production much more quickly  Potential production is targeted for 2014  Corvus has tremendous management  which has done everything right to this point  Even though the stock is already up over 100  since we first recommended it  I still believe it has substantial potential from here  Any exploration success in the future  which is a possibility  would be a major catalyst for Corvus  shares  People should definitely keep an eye on these two companies  TGR  Back in the 1980s and 1990s  it seems that everybody and their uncle were in Nevada  Then companies decided to go south and everywhere else  Now it seems that I see more companies working on properties in Nevada again  Is that a trend you see  JR B  Definitely  I think it s a trend for several reasons  First of all  the higher prices are obviously making many formerly uneconomic deposits economic now  Also  Nevada is a safe and very easy place to do business  TGR  That s an area we re going to be seeing a lot more companies returning to and turning some of these low grade deals into profitable mines  JR B  You said it there  There are a lot of low grade deposits in Nevada that may be only marginally economic at  1 500 oz or  1 600 oz gold  which are becoming very economic at  2 000 oz  That s where the extreme upside is now  So  that s an example of why I think Nevada is benefiting and why you ll see more people going there  TGR  What else do you like in the gold area  JR B  I love the royalty companies  like Franco Nevada Corp   FNV TSX  FNV NYSE  and Sandstorm Gold Ltd   SSL TSX V   I would definitely look at both of those if we get the pullback in October  I think Primero Mining Corp   PPP NYSE  P TSX  is another one to take a look at  It s a very interesting story because it has a world class asset in Mexico  It s in the middle of a tax arbitration because it has a streaming deal with Silver Wheaton Corp   SLW TSX  SLW NYSE   Primero has to pay taxes as if it were selling the silver for  30 oz  even though it only gets  4 oz from Silver Wheaton  It has applied to the Mexican authorities for tax relief  and expects there s something like a 70  chance that it can get this overturned  When I first recommended Primero  the stock was well under  3 share  I felt that it was a no lose situation  and based on what I was looking at  I had a target of about  3 80 share considering a loss in the tax case  Now  assuming a victory in this tax case  the stock should be worth a minimum of  8 share  The fact that it has gone over  5 share tells me that the market is pricing in a victory  If it loses the tax case  the stock could fall a dollar or so  If it wins  it could shoot up a couple more bucks  Regardless of that  it has this world class asset  a great management team and over  100 million  M  in cash  which should allow it to make an acquisition of a producing project  So  Primero really has all the things you want to see in a company that can be a successful growth oriented producer and would be my top candidate to be the next Argonaut  TGR  Any others you want to mention or talk about in the gold arena  JR B  I recently visited a company called Northern Vertex Mining Corp   NEE TSX V  NHVCF OTCQX  that has a project in Arizona called the Moss project  This is run by the same people who founded Kootenay Silver Inc   KTN TSX V   which they have run extremely well in a tough market environment  Northern Vertex is focused on becoming a growth producer in the U S  through this Moss project  where it is earning in to achieve 70  ownership  I think the potential there is substantial because it already has a Measured and Indicated resource of nearly 1 million ounces  Moz  at an average grade that is close to 1 gram ton gold equivalent  with a little silver  If this can be run successfully as a heap leach operation  with that type of grade it is going to be substantially profitable  There also is the option to run the ore through a nearby mill  That would obviously reduce the capital expenditure considerably  The company also has a pretty large deposit in Idaho  I m less keen on that at the moment  I would say Northern Vertex is definitely a company to keep an eye on as a potential growth oriented producer  I believe this Moss project could really springboard it into a nice future  TGR  You said you weren t that hot on silver stocks  but there must be some you still like there  JR B  Up until recently I wasn t that hot on silver stocks  But  looking at where silver is now  we know that whenever gold goes up  silver goes up even more  So  actually I m looking for more silver plays like Huldra Silver Inc   HDA TSX V   which recently commissioned its Treasure Mountain mill in British Columbia  It s going to start spitting out ounces this month and should be in commercial operation by January  It s a very high grade producer and should be the second highest grade mine in the world  There are several things I like about Huldra  Number one  although the company has had to raise some money this year  the stock has held up very well  whereas a lot of silver stocks have completely fallen apart technically  The company has been able to successfully raise money and should produce about 2 Moz silver equivalent per year  which will result in a substantial amount of cash flow  It has about 17M options and warrants that would likely be exercised if the stock exceeds  2 share  The stock is now around  1 40 share  Assuming it goes over  2 share  these options and warrants will get exercised  generating something like  20M  In terms of mining  because its costs are very low and the grade is high  its profits are going to be substantial  Twelve months from now Huldra could have a minimum of  40 50M to work with  The Treasure Mountain historical resource estimate is 10 Moz silver  but its NI 43 101 estimate is much smaller than that  Huldra really needs to drill out this project and define a more substantial resource  which would give it a higher valuation  Then it could trade at 4 5 times cash flow  versus the current 1 2 times  Also of note is that prior to the most recent financing  Coeur d Alene Mines Corp   CDM TSX  CDE NYSE  owned 12  of the stock and Sprott also owns a big position  That shows that some institutions think there s huge potential for the resource  Up until earlier this year  only  5M had been spent on this property  Assuming silver goes above  40 oz and gets to  50 oz again  Huldra is one that I think is going to receive a large amount of interest and is going to be very profitable  I m very optimistic on it long term  TGR  On the other side of the coin  it s been a real struggle for a lot of junior companies that have had trouble financing in this market  Is there hope for them or are there going to be a lot of casualties or forced property abandonments due to lack to funding  regardless of gold and silver prices  JR B  I think the smart companies that are looking for acquisitions are going to do something similar to what Argonaut just did  It struck a deal with Bravada Gold Corp   BVA TSX V   which has a deposit Wind Mountain in northern Nevada with a PEA that looks very economic at current prices  Wind Mountain already has a Measured and Indicated resource of 570 000 oz gold and 14 7 Moz silver  Argonaut is putting a little bit of money into drilling some targets there  If it likes what it sees  it has the option to spend a little more money over the next couple of years doing more exploration  After that  it has the option to buy the project directly for  30 oz in the ground  Essentially  if Argonaut really likes what it sees it could end up acquiring another mine for roughly  40M  Right now it is only committed to spending  250 000 and then  7M over three years  A lot of these companies  with their stock prices below  0 10 share and not much cash  can t do anything and would be helped by a bigger company coming in  I would really be looking for the companies that are going to acquire these projects because they re going to be able to do so on the cheap and be able to add to their growth substantially and at a low cost  Argonaut has already made several great acquisitions  and looks as if it may be on the cusp of another one  By the way  Primero is also looking aggressively for acquisitions and Northern Vertex told me it is looking at similar types of deals  as Argonaut just did   For many of these smaller juniors  there s really not that much hope left  You have to play those situations through larger growth producer companies  like Argonaut  But  at the same time  a lot of the exploration companies and juniors typically catch fire when gold breaks out to a new high  What you want to see there is companies that are either totally cashed up  like Corvus  or companies that have the ability to raise some cash without destroying its share structure  It s a difficult situation for a lot of juniors and you really have to pick and choose very carefully  TGR  That sounds like a good summary of what people ought to be looking at now  Any other further thoughts on strategy at this point for investors in the metals markets  JR B  As I discussed in my presentation in Toronto  when investing in this sector you have to separate things into where you re going to get your growth and where you re basically speculating  You get consistent performance from the growth oriented producers and royalty companies  We have to realize that on the speculation side  a lot of these development plays and juniors are not real businesses  They re 18 24 month timeframe speculations where you re hoping they ll really do well  And  if something does and you make a nice amount of money  you have to get rid of it because you rarely see juniors  even in a fantastic market  trading over  5 share  You have to liquidate those and go back to the drawing board because they don t consistently make new highs over time  I heard an analyst on BNN say that 90  of these stocks will go right back down  He is exactly right  You could make a fantastic amount of money on these companies  but I like to focus first on the smaller growth oriented producers  which have the ability to grow for several years  After that  you go down the food chain and look at the juniors and developers that have potential  not just to double but to make three  four  five times your money  If you re looking at a junior and it doesn t have that potential  then why bother  You could just buy a royalty company or a mutual fund that has less risk but decent potential  TGR  That makes sense and I think is something all investors ought to consider  Thanks for

101014,322529,WPM,Mining Stocks Now Provide Bargain Trade Opportunities  Florian Siegfried,opinion,Many precious metals mining stocks are now trading at bargain prices but the old  buy and hold  strategy no longer applies in this fluid market environment  says Florian Siegfried  CEO of Precious Capital AG  In this exclusive interview with The Gold Report  Siegfried says investors need to do their homework and pick their entry and exit points carefully as he names some undervalued opportunities he expects to provide above average returns in the next market run up The Gold Report  This is the first time you are speaking with The Gold Report  Florian  so maybe you could give us a brief overview of Precious Capital AG and its investment focus  Florian Siegfried  Precious Capital is an independent  privately held fund management company in Zurich  Switzerland  with a team of financial and mining professionals  Our investment strategy is to identify undervalued future winners in the precious metals mining space  Often these are companies that are not yet the focus of the bigger institutional brokers  have good future expansion potential  have reasonable market capitalization and are driven by good management teams  We took over the company in December 2008  and since then the business has grown quite consistently and this year is performing very well for us  TGR  Can you give us your European perspective on the current global economic and financial situation and where things might be headed  FS  We are long term bulls on gold because we think that the debt crisis in Europe has been downplayed for too long and there is no solution to the problem  Eventually  we expect to see a credit deflation where most of these bankrupt governments in Europe are no longer able to repay their debt  which will translate into more stress in the banking sector  In our view  this will lead to a deflationary downward spiral  which cannot be manipulated any longer by printing money because eventually the insolvent banks will fail to lend  and then there is no possibility to lift asset prices anymore  When that happens  the investor community will have a huge preference for liquidity and unleveraged assets  We think gold is the most favorable asset class in a time of credit deleveraging  An investor in gold will make money in real terms as the credit bubble deflates  Investors who are long in euros or commodity based currencies will actually lose in purchasing power as credit deflation hits  This is our long term view and we think that there is no further room to manipulate asset markets  as they have been in the past  I think that we are at the triggering event here  TGR  How much air do you think can come out of this whole system  And how much can prices deflate overall  FS  That s a difficult question  One has to look at various asset classes  We would be rather bearish on base metals  such as iron ore  which has already declined quite dramatically since the beginning of the year  China has to rebalance its economy  which largely depends on capital investments and exports and this could become a real problem now  I wouldn t be surprised if in two or three years we would see prices off by 30  or so  Oil prices are still getting some support because of the geopolitical situation  but as China slows down  consumption is probably going to decline and we could see oil off 20  over the next few quarters  In the equity markets  I think earnings disappointment is going to be a major topic next year  Sooner or later  the market has to realize that if Europe is in a recession  China is slowing down and the U S  is not getting ahead of the curve  where would earnings growth come from  So  I would expect equity prices  overall  in a year s time could be lower  probably by 10 20   TGR  In reading through your Precious Capital fund materials  it was interesting to note the major credit crises over the last 300 years  starting with the South Sea Bubble in 1725 and then the British Credit Crisis of 1772 and then the panics of 1825 and 1873  followed by the market crash in 1929 that started the Depression  Then we had the bad recession in 1973  Now we have this global financial crisis that started in 2008  If the previous 300 year pattern holds  it would indicate another severe event around 2025 2030  Do you think the Federal Reserve and foreign central banks can keep things together and prevent a major collapse in 2025 2030  FS  These kinds of cycles have a common characteristic  In each  you have good times  with real or so called  prosperity   mostly driven by excessive use of leverage and debt  2008 was the same  with too much credit and debt  Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers failed to serve the debt because they were too highly leveraged  Then the whole system broke down because if one bank failed  many others would fail  I think we are still relatively early in this kind of cycle  The Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank have really acted ambitiously to solve the crisis and prevent the system from collapsing by just printing money to loan at 0  to the banking system  But  eventually  what is it going to change  In the long run nothing  because it s not just a liquidity crisis  It s also a solvency crisis  The only solution to too much leverage is less leverage  Only the market can bring that leverage to a level where it is actually sustainable  I believe the stimulus  TARPs and LTRO programs from all the central banks have only pushed the inevitable credit deflation cycle down the road  TGR  So how does all this influence your investment strategy  FS  We try to identify industries that actually make money in a deflationary environment  Lower commodity prices create margin pressure for most industries and they don t do as well as during times of inflation  The precious metals industry does well in a deflationary environment because the gold price goes up against the whole commodity complex while input costs such as crude oil or steel are probably stabilizing or will become less expensive than they were in years of higher inflation  Eventually  I think it is the market s desire for liquidity  which will cause gold prices to continue rising  So  the long term view is very bullish  but it s a very volatile market  and last year gold stocks really underperformed  This is mainly explained by a lack of liquidity and investor confidence  The whole precious metal sector has overpromised and under delivered and many M A transactions did actually destroy shareholder value  I guess investors have reset their expectations dramatically after all this frustration  However  this can provide opportunities and we try to use some of our technical indicators to trade these stocks while they are getting into an overbought or oversold condition  This past April and May  when the market was really capitulating  we were buyers in most of the stocks we like  Right now we think the market is a bit overpriced and we ve had a very good run in most of these gold mining shares  Now they could go into a little correction mode and probably lose another 10  or 15   So  we sold some of our positions at the end of September and are waiting for more favorable buying opportunities in the next few weeks  It s not a buy and hold strategy that we want to apply here  One can really trade swings if you can get the timing right  We are always invested in the sector  but sometimes we have 30  or 40  cash  TGR  How has your strategy paid off over the last couple of years  FS  Since we took over the fund in December 2008  we are up about 140  in U S  dollars and this year as of end of September we are up about 26   We have some winners in the fund that performed well based on the discoveries and the operational improvements they made  We were regularly buying when the markets dried up  which forced stock prices to go lower  There were actually no signals that would suggest a long term fundamental downturn  We see these corrections as tradable opportunities  I was calling brokers in May and it was unusual to see how defensive they were  saying to stay away from gold stocks until gold hits  2 000 ounce  oz   We got the feeling that was probably the bottom of the market  Timing is of the essence  Pick your stocks carefully  especially in the junior space  because most of these companies will never make money for their shareholders  That brings me to our selection strategy  The first thing we look at is management  The mining business is very challenging  with a lot of risks  The people with the right experience who have done it before will attract the money from the Street to bring a story to reality and attract institutional money in the future  The next thing we look for is geology  Can a good deposit become bigger and can this ever become a mine and what and how long will it take  In addition  a solid balance sheet with little leverage and good networking capital in the bank is key  so they don t have to tap the equity markets in these volatile times  We are largely positioned in the midtier mining space because the industry as a whole has started to change  Many of the large gold mining companies have grown too big and aren t flexible anymore  Their strategy was for growth in size  rather than profitability  As a result  many have failed to make money for shareholders  Now  the whole industry has started to focus on smaller projects with lower capital requirements  As a result  we think the market has shown a preference for companies that run easy mines  which can be expanded operationally and can be financed by the market without the risk of significant equity dilution  Many companies have good assets but don t have the critical mass to attract institutional money  We expect to see more mergers taking place between junior companies or midtier producers  It doesn t make sense to have two companies producing  let s say  150 000 oz  150 Koz  per year trading at a market cap of  500 million  M   It would be an enormous task for them to get into a league where they could attract institutional money  Growing to a  1 billion  B  market cap internally is probably going to be a tough task  With smart merger and acquisitions  M A   becoming a 200 300 Koz producer by combining two businesses can get it into the  1B market cap range more easily  We think that M A among junior producers is going to be a major topic in the next few quarters  TGR  So  let s talk about some specifics on companies you re currently invested in that you think look interesting  FS  One company we own that we think was undervalued at the beginning of the year is OceanaGold Corp   OGC TSX  OGC ASX   which is a 250 Koz producer in New Zealand  It has transitioned from a company that only operated there  to a more internationally based one  Its Didipio project in the Philippines is well advanced and should get into commercial production next year  We think OceanaGold is going to make a lot of money as cash costs drop and production increases  It had some cost issues over the last 12 months or so mainly due to the strong New Zealand dollar versus the U S  dollar  The Philippines operation has a lot of credit from copper  which will lead to ongoing cost improvements  The company has good management and its growth is pretty well financed right now with no need to tap the equity markets in the near future  The stock has had a good run  up about 68  this year  I would rather wait for a correction before buying it here  If management continues to execute its strategy it has the potential to grow to 400 500 Koz year of production over the next three to four years  TGR  How about some other ones that you like  FS  We have also been acquiring Endeavour Mining Corp   EDV TSX  EVR ASX   which is proposing a smart acquisition of Avion Gold Corp  Unlike many M A deals that have hardly created long term shareholder value because of management issues and lack of synergies among operations  both Endeavour and Avion are West African gold producers  Avion was running out of money in the second quarter and Endeavour took the challenge to pick up the whole company in a share deal  The combined entity would be a gold focused producer with four mines and combined annual production of about 300 Koz  Its reserve base would be close to 3 million ounces  Moz   with a resource base of about 10 Moz and a market cap of close to  1B  Compared to companies with similar production profiles and resource bases  we think Endeavour looks rather cheap  The political situation in Mali in West Africa is certainly holding the stock down to a certain degree  I think the management team will make this deal happen and create shareholder value in the long term  TGR  How about some other ones  FS  Another company we were just adding to our portfolio is Keegan Resources Inc   KGN TSX  KGN NYSE MKT   which is in a relatively safe jurisdiction in Ghana  West Africa  It had a sharp price decline from trading at a little over  9 share  down to around  2 38 share by the middle of May  Its Esaase project had the classic capital expenditure  capex  overruns  They underestimated the cost of the project  When financing requirements changed  the markets became very skeptical and the shares dropped  We feel the project economics are still favorable and that it can operate on a smaller scale than the planned 300 Koz year with a  500M capex budget  Management is in the process of recalculating a smaller plant with a much lower capex  about  150 200M  rather than  500M  After the recent rally  Keegan s market cap is now about  270M  with about  170M in the bank and 6 Moz resource in the ground  The company is almost trading at cash  which provides good market support  When the new project economics are published  it will probably show a 100 160 Moz year operation with a lower strip ratio and lower operating costs  The recoveries will be the same  say 92 93   Many of the long term shareholders and institutions went in at  7 9 share  With the stock trading around  3 97 share  we think it has some real catch up potential from here  PMI Gold s Obotan mine is about 10 kilometers southwest of Keegan s Esaase project and PMI just raised  100M to start construction of the mine  We originally invested in PMI Gold at  0 10 share back in October 2009  TGR  How about companies that are a little closer to home  Certainly the Yukon has had quite a bit of activity lately  What do you like there  FS  We think the Yukon is a great jurisdiction for mining  With devolution of resource management responsibilities in April 2003  the Yukon has its own policy for mining  which we regard as a major benefit for mining companies  The top part of the Yukon has great and underestimated potential from a geological standpoint  The main challenge is the remote locations where you have to bring in all your equipment by helicopter and the short drilling season  which goes from about April May until the snow comes in October  In the silver space there we like Alexco Resource Corp   AXR TSX  AXU NYSE MKT   which is producing silver from its Bellekeno mine in the historical Keno District  It is fully financed by Silver Wheaton Corp   SLW TSX  SLW NYSE  with a very tight share structure of about 65M shares outstanding  We think it has the potential to grow resources and production through internal cash flow and no debt  Nevertheless  the company suffered a 27  increase in cash costs in the first half of the year versus 2011 due to lower base metal credits and mining of lower grade material  These factors brought the price down quite significantly this year by  45   to about  3 80 share  What we like about Alexco is that the company is producing now and has many exploration and development projects in the same district  Most of the exploration and development money it s spending will add to future production  It will probably produce around 2 Moz silver this year  As new projects are added  it will become a two  or three mine operator in the next two to three years  all funded by internal cash flow  The Keno District has very rich silver grades  historically averaging 50 ounces ton or so  It s all underground  which is a big plus because the mine can operate year round with the concentrate being shipped out by road throughout the year  The management team has a good reputation and when we visited the mine in May of last year our impression was that the exploration and development team are all solid and experienced mining people  TGR  Any others you d like to mention up there  FS  Some of these Yukon stocks really fell out of favor over the last few months  One company we like  especially because the shares are also still trading at very depressed levels despite good news  is ATAC Resources Ltd   ATC TSX V   This is a pure exploration company with a large land package  All the gold discoveries it released this year point to a potentially huge system that could be described as a Carlin type gold discovery  We visited the project last year  The company has identified multiple targets on its so called Rackla Gold Belt  which is about 185 kilometers long  Every time the company releases results  we see that this system is potentially growing into something much bigger  The grades are phenomenal  like 10 24 grams ton  g t  over 46 meters  and not very deep  The stock is down to around  2 36 share  from  10 share in July 2011  The company is well financed and has a good management team  If one looks for value in exploration  I think ATAC is a good name to have at these low levels  TGR  What about companies in other parts of Canada  FS  We have St Andrew Goldfields Ltd   SAS TSX   which has had a choppy ride in the last few quarters and is now attractive from a valuation standpoint  Based on the progress the company has made since the beginning of the year  we see a turnaround with bottom line net profits and operating cash flows  Production is growing steadily toward 100 Koz this year and costs are coming down  However  a few weeks ago it announced an overstatement of its Inferred resources on its operating Holloway and Holt mines  which brought the share price down to about  0 46 share  We like the experienced team headed by Jacques Perron and the location in Ontario  which is one of the best places to be for mining  The projects are rather high grade underground operations  which is a positive factor because it makes for more stable operating margins when you have volatile gold prices  The company seems to be on track to achieve its production goal in 2012  but given the operational problems in 2011  the stock is still on a depressed level  The company is fully financed and both production and resources should grow in the next three to four years  Operationally and financially the story looks now much better than last year  The company also has a large land package for exploration and a tax pool of  190M on its balance sheet  which is more or less the market cap right now  The share price doesn t reflect underlying resources and the reserves in the ground  One shareholder who probably has a high degree of control in the company may contribute to the market underperformance  But  in a good gold market  a stock like St Andrew should probably trade at  0 80 1 00 share  to reflect the operational business  TGR  Let s turn to some projects and companies that have operations in the U S  What do you like there  FS  We have a development stage company in the fund called Romarco Minerals Inc   R TSX   which has the Haile project in South Carolina  This project has been delayed due to the completion of a full Environmental Impact Statement  EIS   The stock is therefore in a penalty box  but the project economics are very favorable  It will have low costs and gold grades of about 1 8 g t open pit  which is rather high  The stock is trading at about  1 share  I would say that Romarco could be a takeover target for a midtier producer or even a senior  based on the quality of the asset and the location  Once the EIS issue has been resolved  probably next year  then we think it will be a very attractive stock to own  The main risk is permitting and finance  should the company require to raise more equity  which would be dilutive with the current low share price  TGR  Maybe you can summarize what our readers ought to be doing in the coming months to take advantage of what you think lies ahead  FS  The key is to see the fundamentally positive development of the industry  Gold mining shares are trading at historically low valuations  e g   on a price to earnings ratio basis or compared to the price of bullion  I would stress  however  that these shares can be very volatile and people can get frustrated if they don t perform  They sell in a down market and then miss the opportunity to buy when the market rebounds  One has to be really disciplined  Never get married to a company  no matter how good it looks  When things move up and get overbought  always take profits and have cash on the sideline to buy into the dips  But  as long as we have these fundamental problems in the world with money printing and low economic growth  recessions and depressions  it will be very bullish for gold mining companies  In order to outperform the gold price  you can t just be long all the time and not trade these stocks  One really has to be more active and when the market is capitulating  you have to pick up your most attractive shares  Always do your own due diligence on these companies  Check out the management and how it does operationally  and look at past track records  Once you have identified the right companies that fit your portfolio  then just try to play the sector in a little bit more of a contrarian way  That s my advice  TGR  Thanks for talking with

101015,322530,WPM,Potential Miner Breakout,opinion,Primero Mining Corp   PPP  engages in the production of precious metals in Mexico  The company focuses on producing gold  It owns 100  interest in the San Dimas gold silver mine located in San Dimas district  on the border of Durango and Sinaloa states  The company was formerly known as Mala Noche Resources Corp  and changed its name to Primero Mining Corp  in August 2010  Primero Mining Corp  is based in Toronto  Canada  Here is the news that caused the spike    Reuters    Shares of Primero Mining Corp  P TO  rose more than 41 percent shortly after the market open on Friday after the junior gold miner said it had received a positive ruling from Mexican tax authorities on how it reports silver revenues   The ruling confirms that Primero can record silver revenue and taxes from its San Dimas gold mine in Durango state at the realized silver price rather than the spot price   It is an important distinction  as Primero has a stream deal whereby it sells silver by product produced at the mine to Silver Wheaton Corp  SLW TO  for just over  4 per ounce  That is well below the current spot price of  34 89 per ounce   Shares of the Toronto based miner rose 41 7 percent  7 51 on Friday morning on the Toronto Stock Exchange ,2012-11-04,Frank Zorrilla,https://www.investing.com/analysis/potential-miner-breakout-142166,142166
101016,322531,WPM,Why The Silver ETF Is A Win For Investors,opinion,Silver is no doubt tiny on the grand commodities scale  But its attractiveness  spearheaded by a 1000   bull to date gain to its latest high  has spawned a wide range of products for investors to partake in  And one of the most unique and powerful is the iShares Silver Trust ETF  SLV    This ETF s objective is quite simple  to mirror the price of silver  minus a small management fee of course   But while simple in its objective  two unique traits have allowed SLV to take the silver market by storm  First is SLV offers a bridge for stock market capital to track the price movements of a high flying commodity  which historically had only been an arena for the futures guys  And second is it uses this capital to buy the physical metal   SLV is asset backed by silver bullion  So not only is a share of SLV equivalent in value to an ounce of silver  it is backed by a physical ounce of silver that is sitting in a big vault somewhere   The mechanics of this ETF are of course a little more involved given its asset backed model  As opposed to other commodities ETFs ETNs that simply track a price via rolling futures contracts  SLV needs to manage a physical inventory  And managing a physical inventory to balance day to day demand supply differentials  while tracking a price  is tedious   In order to track the price of its underlying asset  SLV s demand supply needs to be equalized on a daily basis  And in order to counteract differential buying and selling pressure  SLV actively buys or sells bullion  This daily equalization is of course successful per SLV s rules  otherwise this ETF would decouple from the price of silver   On the buy side  by nature this ETF faces situations when there are more buyers than sellers  When this happens for regular stocks  it translates into a price that keeps rising until a balance is found  And in SLV s case this would be fine if its rise paced silver s  Perfectly pacing a commodity s price is impossible in a stock trading environment though  And quite often SLV is in the situation where differential buying pressure would quickly lead to an upside decoupling from silver if it was let be   SLV thus needs to counteract this upside decoupling by issuing new shares  in 50k share blocks   and then using the proceeds of these shares to buy silver bullion  The new shares serve to effectively absorb the excess demand  And at the end of the day this keeps SLV from rising at a faster pace than silver   On the sell side SLV can obviously see more sellers than buyers on any given day  But if differential selling pressure is not controlled  there would be a risk of decoupling from silver to the downside  In order to prevent this SLV has to buy back shares  again in blocks of 50k   And in order to raise the cash to buy back these shares  it needs to sell an equivalent amount of silver bullion  This process effectively absorbs an excess supply of SLV shares   And provocatively this ETF s market activity can have a material impact on silver s fundamentals  Since SLV s tracking mission shunts stock market capital directly into  and out of  the physical metal  it affects the real time supply and demand of the physical market  and thus silver s price  And since this ETF is very transparent with its daily activity  a simple chart can show us just how relevant SLV can be to the silver market  On the left axis is SLV s net asset value  This value  in billions of dollars  is calculated by simply multiplying SLV s daily holdings by the daily price of silver  And if SLV is indeed successful in its mission of tracking the price of silver  this red line should be a mirror image of what you d see on a silver chart  Slaved to the right axis  in blue  are SLV s holdings  in millions of ounces    To get a sharper picture of the most recent years  this chart only goes back to 2008  But it wasn t too long before this  in April 2006  when this ETF was born  And folks may recall its mixed reception at the time  While the majority of investors and silver bulls were excited for SLV s launch  there was opposition from industrial consumers  Though their fears were righteous for the most part  supply coming off the market and thus driving up prices   there was no stopping investors  craving for this exciting trading vehicle   And the immense interest in this ETF was apparent right off the bat  SLV s holdings rose five fold  to 100m ounces  within 4 months of its launch  And they even rose during a long silver consolidation that lasted well into 2007  From the beginning of this chart you can then see SLV s differential buying pressure continuing  and not really letting up until several years later   This huge growth period to SLV s 2011 peak was really quite spectacular  And perhaps the most spectacular part was a growth in the holdings amidst 2008 s infamous stock panic  This growth showed remarkable resiliency for this metal during a time when traders wanted nothing to do with anything that wasn t cash   Coming out of the panic and into the recovery period  SLV s holdings surged  And in two years from the beginning of 2008  SLV s silver booty doubled to 300m ounces  300m ounces is a lot of silver  How much  The average larger scale silver mine produces about a hundredth of this amount  over the course of a year  In fact  300m ounces is way more than the combined production of all the primary silver mines in the world over the course of a year   SLV s impact on silver s overall supply chain is actually quite substantial  In 2011 for example  the total silver supply was around 1 0b ounces from all sources  the highest ever   SLV s hoard represents 30   of an entire year s supply  And it ends up being about 5  of the world s silver supply over the last 6 5 years  since SLV s inception    I really doubt SLV s custodians could have imagined that its holdings would climb this high  this fast  And because of this  there is no doubt that SLV has made a material impact on the silver market s supply and demand fundamentals  I really don t believe silver prices would be where they are today if SLV hadn t taken so much of this metal off the market   This ETF can however be a double edged sword  Whereas SLV s shunting of stock market capital into silver no doubt gooses the silver price  shunting stock market capital out of silver can certainly have a negative effect on the price  And this is something we witnessed in the action that followed SLV s 366m ounce peak in April 2011   This peak of course corresponded with silver s wild parabolic ascent that climaxed at  48  just days after SLV s top  And SLV s differential selling pressure following this top led to an inventory draw of a whopping 61m ounces over a period of only about 2 months  Silver was down a gut wrenching 24  over this exact same period of time  and I have no doubt that SLV s bullion purge added fuel to the selling fire   Interestingly ever since that big draw that took SLV back down towards 300m ounces in June 2011  we ve seen a much different ETF  SLV s holdings have actually meandered within a relatively tight horizontal consolidation band for the better part of 1 5 years now  with the centerline average at about 313m ounces  While SLV has held strong over a spell where silver has trended down a bit  this lack of growth points to a muted interest in silver from stock investors   Ultimately I suspect that SLV s flat grinding consolidation is merely a holding pattern that will soon yield to a continuation of growth  For most stock investors  both retail and institutional  this ETF is the only way they ll ever own silver  And I fully expect silver s investment demand to continue to soar as more and more folks add this valuable component to their portfolios   One thing that will offer confidence to investors is SLV s valuation  which as an asset backed ETF it is pegged to the net asset value of its silver bullion holdings  SLV has made a lot of progress since it was born to the markets as a sub  300m concept  Its valuation had increased 10 fold by early 2008  and it has since grown to become one of the world s premier asset backed ETFs   Of particular interest on the valuation front was SLV s huge growth spurt from September 2010 to April 2011  Over this stretch SLV saw a 70m ounce bullion build coupled with a silver price rise of about 150   And this led to SLV s net asset value soaring by a staggering 233  before peaking with silver   While SLV s valuation has since come down  it s been relatively stable in the  10b range over the last year or so  And this  10b valuation takes SLV well out of the small cap realm to qualify it for investment capital that only targets mid cap and higher  SLV has become the wide reaching vehicle that the silver sector desperately needed   And speaking of vehicle  SLV s incredible growth has made it one of the largest silver related stocks out there  Of all the primary silver vehicles  only elite streaming company Silver Wheaton and global  1 silver miner Fresnillo PLC have larger market capitalizations   The vast majority of the world s biggest and best silver mining stocks actually have much lower valuations than SLV  And interestingly I m sure this fact irks a fringe group of folks who initially opposed SLV due to concerns that it would divert capital away from the mining stocks   In actuality most silver bulls completely disagree with this minority opposition  While SLV may indeed have drawn some capital away from the mining stocks  it probably isn t much  In reality  SLV isn t in competition with these stocks  They are completely different in what they offer investors   SLV and mining stocks are of course interrelated in that the miners won t thrive without a strong silver price  But in isolation SLV is a direct play on the price of silver  whereas the mining stocks are leveraged plays on the profits of the miners   SLV and mining stocks also sport vastly different risk profiles  SLV is inherently risky being pegged to a small market volatile commodity  But the mining stocks carry silver s innate risk and company level risk  When you add operational  geological  geopolitical  and other risks that mining companies bear  you ll find that mining stocks carry much higher risk   I really believe that the majority of investors who own SLV would not be invested in this sector at all if this ETF didn t exist  It s not a matter of SLV s shareholders choosing this ETF over mining stocks  It s SLV  or nothing silver related  Besides  it s a different class of traders who choose mining stocks   Those of us who traffic in the mining stock realm have a greater appetite for risk  of course with the hopes that there will be much greater rewards  These stocks offer huge positive leverage to silver  which over the course of silver s bull has led to legendary gains  Even in silver s latest upleg  the mining stocks easily outpaced SLV   If anything SLV has made things better for the miners  There s no denying SLV s big role in rising silver prices  And these higher prices allow the miners to generate higher margins  SLV is a win win for miners and investors   And not only do I not believe that SLV is cannibalizing mining stock capital  I don t believe it cannibalizes retail physical investment either  Prudent investors realize that SLV should never be used as a substitute for owning the metal in one s physical possession  which at Zeal we ve long recommended as a foundational component of one s portfolio   SLV is a neat vehicle that has added an entirely new component to silver investment and speculation   At Zeal we ve been huge silver proponents since this bull s beginnings  And we certainly endorse SLV to risk averse and new to silver investors  as well as traders playing the options markets  But when silver prices are going up  we definitely prefer the huge potential offered by the mining stocks   The bottom line is SLV has grown to become a force in the silver world  This unique ETF offers stock investors an unprecedented opportunity to trade  and effectively own  one of the most exciting commodities out there  And its popularity has made SLV a vast storehouse of wealth that has had a major impact on pricing   Though SLV hasn t actually taken much silver off the market over the last year and a half or so  there is no denying its impact since inception  And when silver starts to rock once again  SLV ought to see a healthy flow of stock market capital that will boost its holdings while accelerating silver s momentum  SLV is a great option for investors  and it offers a bridge to the more dynamic mining stocks ,2012-11-04,Scott

101017,322532,WPM,Silver Wheaton Reports Earnings Of  0 34 Per Share,opinion,Silver Wheaton Corporation  SLW   TSX  SLW  has announced that its Board of Directors has declared its fourth quarterly cash dividend payment for 2012 of US 0 07 per common share  The quarterly dividend will be paid to holders of record of its common shares as of the close of business on November 21  2012  and will be distributed on or about December 5  2012  It should be noted that this is down from the August dividend payment of  0 10 and will no doubt be disappointing for investors  The consensus estimate of  0 40 was missed by  0 06 as earnings were reported at  0 34 per share  which will not please the analysts and may result in some near term selling pressure  Third Quarter Highlights are as follows  Record attributable silver equivalent production of 7 7 million ounces compared to 6 1 million ounces in Q3 2011  representing an increase of 26  While production was at record levels  silver equivalent sales amounted to 5 1 million ounces due to the timing of deliveries  with the difference attributable to an increase of 2 0 million payable silver equivalent ounces being produced in the quarter that will be recognized in future sales Revenues were US 161 3 million compared to US 185 2 million in Q3 2011  representing a decrease of 13   attributable to a 14  decrease in silver prices from a year earlier with silver equivalent sales being consistent year over year at 5 1 million ounces Net earnings were US 119 7 million  US 0 34 per share  compared to US 135 0 million  US 0 38 per share  in Q3 2011  representing a decrease of 11  Operating cash flows were US 128 7 million  US 0 36 per share  compared to US 167 2 million  US 0 47 per share  in Q3 2011  representing a decrease of 23  Cash operating margin was US 27 20 per silver equivalent ounce  compared to US 32 11 in Q3 2011  representing a decrease of 15  Average cash costs rose slightly to US 4 16 per silver equivalent ounce  compared to US 4 12 in Q3 2011 As at September 30  2012  approximately 5 2 million payable silver equivalent ounces attributable to the Company have been produced at the various mines and will be recognized in future sales as they are delivered to the Company under the terms of their contracts  This represented an increase of 2 million payable silver equivalent ounces during the three months ended September 30  2012 At September 30  2012  the Company had approximately  555 million of cash on hand and  400 million of available credit under its revolving bank debt facility  This cash and available credit  together with strong operating cash flows  positions the Company well to execute on its growth strategy of acquiring additional accretive silver and precious metal stream interests Declared quarterly dividend of US 0 07 per common share  representing 20  of the cash generated by operating activities during the three months ended September 30  2012 On September 28  2012  the Company announced that it had closed the previously announced purchase from Hudbay Minerals Inc    Hudbay   of a precious metals stream from its currently producing flagship 777 mine   777    as well as a silver stream from their cornerstone development project  Constancia  Initial production covering the period August 1  2012  through September 30  2012  from 777 totaled 733 000 silver equivalent ounces  139 000 ounces of silver and 11 500 ounces of gold   Randy Smallwood  President and Chief Executive Officer of Silver Wheaton commented as follows  With the addition of production from Hudbay s 777 mine in the quarter  we produced a record 7 7 million silver equivalent ounces  putting us on track to reach our 2012 annual production forecast of 28 million ounces  Our diversified asset base once again achieved strong production  with notable contributions from Yauliyacu  Zinkgruvan  and Minto  While overall production was strong  payable silver equivalent ounces produced but not shipped during the quarter increased by 2 million ounces due to the timing of concentrate shipments  negatively affecting silver equivalent sales volume  This increase included the new precious metals contained in base metal concentrates produced at the 777 mine as the concentrate storage and transportation system was being filled with materials mined after August 1st  It is very important to remember that these ounces will inevitably be sold  it is simply a matter of timing    During the quarter we paid out over  630 million dollars  including our first payment to Hudbay and our last payment to Barrick  and yet  we finished the quarter with  550 million of cash on hand  With this cash  a fully undrawn revolving credit facility of  US400 million  and strong forecast annual operating cash flow  we remain very focussed  capable and excited about our potential to continue adding additional accretive ounces to our portfolio   Costs Average cash costs in the third quarter of 2012 were US 4 16 per silver equivalent ounce  compared with US 4 12 during the comparable period of 2011  This resulted in cash operating margins of US 27 20 per silver equivalent ounce  a 15  decrease compared to the third quarter of 2011  primarily a result of a 13  decrease in the realized price per silver equivalent ounce  Background to Silver Wheaton Silver stream or silver purchase agreements allow Silver Wheaton to purchase  in exchange for an up front payment  the by product silver production of a mine that it does not own or operate  Since approximately 70  of all silver production occurs as a by product of base or precious metals production  there are numerous potential opportunities for further growth with this business model  The operating costs that Silver Wheaton pays for future silver production are pre determined in the agreements  at approximately  4 per ounce  with a small inflationary adjustment  This amount offsets our partners  typical cost to produce an ounce of silver  Fixed costs reduce our shareholders  downside risk while at the same time providing the upside of leverage to increases in the price of silver  As well  other than the initial upfront cash payment  Silver Wheaton does not contribute to future capital expenditures or exploration costs invested by the mine  yet we benefit from the production and exploration growth that result from these expenditures  This business model often translates into significant value creation for Silver Wheaton shareholders  Financials Silver Wheaton Corporation has a market capitalization of  13 79Bln  an EPS of  1 60  a 52 week low of  22 94 and a high of  41 30  average volume of shares traded is between 4 00Mln and 5 00Mln  so the liquidity is good  with 353 87 million shares outstanding  Current stock price is  38 98  Chart Taking a quick peek at the chart below  we can see that the upswing of the 50dma  crossing the 200DMA  forming a golden crossover  has been positive for   in that the price of silver has fallen but the stock price has held its ground consolidating around the above the  38 00 level  Conclusion To conclude  the fortunes of SLW are of course predicated on silver prices where the volatility remains on steroids  Silver traded at  27 00 in August   35 00 in October and back down to  31 00 today  a white knuckle ride and definitely not one for the faint hearted  We also note that silver prices have returned to their 200dma of  31 00 which we see as a positive sign for silver with the expectation that silver will rally from here  On a seasonal basis this quarter is usually a good one for both silver and gold prices  so if silver can find the traction and rally back to say  40 00 oz  then SLW could be trading at  50 00 in the near future  As this stock forms the largest element of our silver stock holdings we are not looking to increase our exposure any further at the moment  as we are a tad reluctant to place more eggs in the same basket  Alternatively  we may look to increase our exposure via the selection of a few well thought out option plays  However  we do believe that SLW should be given full consideration when building a portfolio in the precious metals sector  especially if you are new to this tiny sector of the market  Our target price remains unchanged at  100 00 and we take heart in that this stock has come from a low of  23 00 in May to trade close to  40 00 recently  Disclosure  SLW is our largest single holding in the silver space  Disclaimer   or  makes no guarantee or warranty on the accuracy or

101021,322536,WPM,Jason Hamlin  Pent Up Potential For Precious Metals In 2013,opinion,Debt  not the fiscal cliff  is what concerns Jason Hamlin  publisher of the Gold Stock Bull newsletter  and if his prediction of a split in the EU comes to pass  it will bolster the case for gold equities  In this Gold Report interview Hamlin shares his preference for royalty streamers and prospect generators in the gold space and explains his attraction to graphite  TGR  Jason  you recently told your Gold Stock Bull readers that you had sold some equities  What were your reasons for selling  Jason Hamlin  At the time  we were nearly fully allocated and decided to move to a position of roughly 20  cash  Even though this is a high seasonal period for precious metals  we sold a couple of underperformers to take advantage of any potential year end selloff driven by concerns about the fiscal cliff and its impact on economic growth  There are also year end opportunities for tax loss selling and we want to have some dry powder for bargains that may materialize over the next few months in quality resource stocks  TGR  Do you believe investors should reduce risk and take a more conservative approach until we know what are the repercussions of the fiscal cliff  JH  I do not  It is sensible to always have some cash available for a selloff  but I do not view the fiscal cliff as some Armageddon type event like other analysts  I think the politicians will come to a resolution before things become too explosive  but we should never discount their ineptitude  For me  the true issue here is debt  not the fiscal cliff  Debt is the root cause of nearly all of our economic and social issues  As it is a mathematic impossibility to ever pay off all of the outstanding debt  neither tax increases nor austerity will solve the debt crisis  As all money is created out of debt and the interest owed back does not exist in the system  the only workable solution is liquidating or forgiving the debt  As controversial as that might sound  one only needs to look up the term  debt jubilee  to see how often it has been used throughout history to clear the slate and allow for a fresh start  So  without getting too detailed  the fiscal cliff in the U S   debt crisis in Europe  student loan crisis  home mortgage crisis and every other monetary crisis can be tied back to the fact that our monetary system at its root is unsustainable  TGR  Do you have a calculation that illustrates how difficult that would be  JH  One way to view that is to look at the percentage of the U S  budget now being put toward interest on the debt and how it has grown over time  As long as that percentage keeps increasing  it means less and less money is available to spend on legitimate needs and to direct toward growing and driving the economy  This expanding debt burden stifles any type of economic growth that might otherwise be possible  Until our leaders are honest about our debt predicament  balance the budget to stop the bleeding and face the necessity of massive debt forgiveness  my forecast is for continued slow economic growth with the potential for contraction in the near future  TGR  What are the threats to the average retail investor  especially in the precious metals space  JH  I believe that another banking crisis could be on the horizon  driven by the large amounts of toxic derivatives and potential revaluation of assets that could render many big banks insolvent  The same kind of threat we saw in the 2008 2009 crisis is still hiding under the surface  as it was only papered over to buy time  rather than addressing the core issues  This could lead to a sell off in all assets including gold and another rush to the perceived safety of dollars  However  I predict that the deteriorating faith in fiat currencies will translate into a very short dumping of true safe haven assets such as gold and even quicker rebound that we witnessed following the last financial crisis  Given this outlook  I think it is wise to hold through such corrections and keep cash available to take advantage of the panic selling that will occur if such a crisis materializes  TGR  While we are talking about the future  do you have any other predictions for 2013  JH  On a positive note  I think the world will survive the end of the Mayan calendar  Seriously  I think the euro will fall apart when one or more countries leave  The strong countries will only support the weaker  over indebted countries for so long before realizing that their sovereignty is more important than the European Union  I think dissolution is absolutely the right course to take  as the concept of the European Union was flawed from the start  TGR  But the European Central Bank  ECB  has vowed to do everything in its power to stabilize and keep the euro together  Can or should the ECB stave off disintegration at least until the end of 2013  JH  I think the ECB will try its best  as centralized banking has much to gain from the EU staying together  This attempt will surely involve more bailouts  stimulus and money printing  which will be bullish for precious metals  Ultimately  I think the attempts will fail and we could see a split of the euro as early as next year  The ECB has constraints that the U S  Federal Reserve  operating in just one country and with the world reserve currency  does not have  The ECB cannot employ the same bag of tricks as Ben Bernanke and the Fed  so I think it has fewer ways to kick the can down the road  This is why we are seeing the crisis escalate first in Europe  but it will eventually come to the shores of America as we witness a loss of faith in the U S  dollar as world reserve currency  TGR  That makes a nice transition into gold  Precious metal investor and Cranberry Capital CEO Paul van Eeden recently  that gold was overvalued  Do you agree  JH  Mr  van Eeden correctly pointed out that the problem in the U S  is not inflation  but debt  And I agree with him that the predictions for imminent hyperinflation are overblown  But that is where our agreement ends  I think his methodology for calculating money supply and gold s true value is flawed in that he incorporates worldwide gold supply  but compares it only to the U S  dollar  Demand is strong worldwide and gold has been making new highs in several currencies  not just the dollar  I also disagree with his notion that the Fed will be able to easily sell assets back into the market to control the inflation that is likely to occur  I m not sure there would be many buyers of such low yielding bonds in an inflationary environment  The Fed is already forced to buy over 50  of bonds the government auctions during the current environment of relatively low inflation  Mr  van Eeden has been calling gold overvalued for years now  I think he is a bright analyst and I enjoyed his commentary on gold earlier in this bull market  but he has now joined the ranks of a few other gold bears who have been consistently wrong about the gold price  They will eventually be correct about gold being overvalued  but I suspect it will be a number of years and a few thousand dollars higher before that happens  That being said  I could see some sell off in gold occurring as a knee jerk reaction by leveraged investors  but interest rates would have to rise substantially above the true rate of inflation for any serious or lasting impact  Such a move would sink the stock market  which is not something the politicians or central planners would allow  They would prefer to print more money  debase the currency and present the illusion of continued prosperity rather than take their medicine  I do not see interest rates rising any time soon  The only way to deal with a banking system that is so overleveraged and a government so burdened with debt is to allow the free market to reprice the debt to reprice housing and equities to their true free market value  However  that would cause the banking system and possibly the entire world economy to collapse  The alternative is to fire up the printing presses  inflate away the debt and hope that the bad loans will once again become solvent  If you study history  you are likely to forecast that the government will choose this option over a deflationary collapse  which will continue to push gold higher in dollar terms  More broadly speaking  if you take two forms of money valued relative to each other  demand being somewhat constant   the one that increases in quantity faster will lose value against the other  Growth in the gold supply is relatively flat  about 1 5  annual growth  The growth of the supply of almost all fiat currencies ranges from 8 10  on average  To me  that says that gold priced in dollars or any other currency being debased will go up in value relative to that currency  The other factor to consider is velocity of money  which has been low and has held inflation in check thus far  But in light of quantitative easing  QE  to infinity  which is essentially what QE3 is  recent improvements in housing and the stock market  and some proposed legislative changes to get banks lending  we might see this change in 2013  If velocity picks up  we could see inflationary forces start to take hold  If just a small amount of all of the new money created over the past five years were to begin flowing through the economy  the impact could be significant  TGR  You rely on technical charts for your advice to your readers  What do your technical charts tell you gold will do in 2013  JH  I just ran this exercise for my subscribers  and came up with a chart showing the minimum target price of gold at  2 200 an ounce  oz  and over  3 000 oz on the high end by the end of 2013  These prices represent gains in the 35 75  range from the current price  It is a much more aggressive annual return than I would usually forecast much higher than the average annual rate over the past 10 years However  precious metals have been consolidating for well over a year  The chart has an incredible amount of pent up upside potential for 2013  Plus  the gold price is now bouncing around the bottom line of its trend channel  A failure to push higher and break  2 200 oz by the end of 2013 would mean that gold has fallen out of its long term trend channel and signal the end of the bull market  I put the likelihood of that outcome at less than 5   Thus  I think the official  inflation adjusted high of  2 400 oz will be taken out within the next 12 months  TGR  Given that prediction  should investors be buying gold  gold equities or both  JH  I recently published an article on this topic and the answer is  It depends  From 2001 to 2005  gold was up roughly 92  and gold stocks up 648   In this period you would have seen seven times greater returns investing in gold stocks  From 2006 to today  the NYSE Arca Gold BUGS Index  HUI  of gold stocks advanced by about 39  while gold itself is up 232   That equals about a six times greater return for physical gold than mining shares  However  if you combine both periods and look at the entirety of the current bull market  gold stocks have been the better investment  From 2001 through Nov  12  2012  physical gold has appreciated by 537   However  gold stocks have gone up nearly twice the rate of gold for a gain of 936   This is the leverage that seasoned investors remember and it drives our decision to allocate a significant portion of our portfolio to mining stocks  That said  I believe it is best to own both bullion and mining shares  because they serve different purposes  Just from the start of August through mid November  the gold price advanced 8   Gold stocks were up 18   That is leverage of roughly 2 4 times  It is hard to say if that will continue  but it is a positive sign for investors in mining stocks  TGR  When you look at technical charts for precious metals equities  what do you look for  other than an upward trend  JH  I view technical analysis as just another data point for reference  not as a panacea for forecasting price movements  In markets that are as manipulated as ours  where large firms tilt the level playing field via high frequency trading and collocation  and banks use their leverage to push prices  I take technical analysis with a large grain of salt  That being said  I look for the usual trend channels  support and resistance indicators  volume levels  momentum indicators   Fibonacci  retracements  whether the stock is making lower lows or higher highs  I couple these insights with the timing of fundamental developments for miners  drill results  resource updates  upcoming preliminary economic assessments  PEAs  or feasibility studies to try to time our entry and exit points on trading positions  Our model portfolio also contains long term holds or core positions that we do not trade  TGR  What is your investment thesis for precious metals equities  JH  The equities are undervalued right now relative to bullion  A lot of that has to do with distrust of the stock market and of Wall Street in general  after all of the fraud and failures in the past years  But if the market holds up for a while longer and current trends continue  I think we will see mining stocks continue to outperform gold  TGR  Which precious metals equities are you telling your readers about  JH  I have been an early advocate of the streaming royalty model in the mining sector  Silver Wheaton Corp   SLW TSX  SLW NYSE  pioneered it and some of its management broke off to start up a similar company in Sandstorm Gold Ltd   SSL TSX V   I first bought Sandstorm at around  0 50 share  it now trades around  13 share and is up nearly 200  since our last purchase  Streaming companies make an advance payment to a company with a pre production stage mineral deposit in exchange for a negotiated percentage of the metal produced for the life of mine  This model gives companies diversification and risk mitigation because it has agreements with several different miners  There is unlimited upside potential in that the deal is usually for a percentage of the production mine life and limited downside risk if a miner sees its profit margins squeezed as the agreed purchase price is fixed  Streamers also enjoy an advantageous tax situation  with rates that are usually much lower than tax rates for mining companies  TGR  You put out a note on Sandstorm after its share price had taken a steep drop  which you attributed to comments made by a pundit in the U S  Tell us about that  JH  Two things were at play  First  the stock price got ahead of itself a little bit and was due to pull back  Second  CNBC s Jim Cramer made some comments that were interpreted negatively on his show  including  referring to Sandstorm Gold    They re good  but remember if gold prices go down to a certain price  then those miners won t be drilling  That is your worry there   He did not change from a bullish to a bearish call  but it was enough to ignite a sell off  TGR  The streaming royalty space has seen some consolidation in recent years  Is Sandstorm  given its suite of royalties  a favorable target for larger royalty companies  JH  I do not think so  Nolan Watson heads up Sandstorm and it seems to be his intention to continue running and growing the company for the long term  With all of the buzz around streaming companies at the moment  Sandstorm may be able to command a nice premium  but I don t believe it will sell  TGR  The stock is now trading at  12 30 share  If an investor does not have a position in Sandstorm  is this a good time to take one  JH  I had written that any pullback to  11 share or less would be a good opportunity to establish or add to a position  Funnily enough  it dipped to a  10 99 share low in the U S  I like Sandstorm as a long term play and think buying on any dip below  11 will prove a good move a year from now  TGR  What other companies are you telling your readers about  JH  Another business model with great merit is the prospect generator model  pioneered by Almaden Minerals Ltd   AMM TSX  AAU NYSE   It has some similarities to the royalty streaming model that has treated us so well  Because Almaden owns its own drill rigs  it can drill at a lower cost and has more flexibility with timing  Almaden unlocks value via discovering resources  selling them and usually acquiring a royalty in the process  The company itself is not in the business of production  Its management believes the greatest shareholder value is unlocked when finding the discovery  doing the drilling and passing the project off to a larger company for production  Almaden has 15 exploration royalties right now  a few of them nearing production  Lately Almaden has focused on the relatively unexplored region of eastern Mexico  where its Ixtaca project is located  Ixtaca has been returning impressive intercepts this year  most recently 134 meters  m  of 4 1 grams per ton  g t  gold  Almaden expects to issue its NI 43 101 resource on Ixtaca this December  Two years and more than 70 000m of drilling will go into that NI 43 101  including lots of long intercepts over high grade  If the drill results we have already seen are any indication  it could be an absolute game changer for the company  Producing companies have already shown a lot of interest in Ixtaca  so I think Almaden will be able to sell it rather easily and get an exceptional return on its investment  The best part of this project is that most of the property is still relatively unexplored  There are multiple blind targets and blue sky potential for Almaden  TGR  Those recent drill results averaged 4 1 g t  Is that the sweet spot Almaden has been looking for to make the deposit economic  JH  It was along the trend  but 50m northeast of the closest drill results that are going into the maiden resource  This shows the potential to significantly expand the current scope of the project  The grade was very convincing  TGR  What do you expect to happen once the NI 43 101 comes out  JH  I expect it will attract the attention of investors and that its market cap will increase substantially as a result  This maiden resource may convince larger companies to firm up their offers and move forward  But with the latest round of very strong drill results  it might be better for shareholders if Almaden continues expanding the resource prior to considering any bids  TGR  Would Almaden issue a dividend to shareholders or keep the money and reinvest it in other projects  JH  In order to maximize exploration efforts  Almaden does not pay out a dividend and I prefer this  When you can trust management to make deals that are accretive to shareholders  I would rather see the money used for more drilling on prospective projects  of which Almaden has a number in the pipeline  TGR  You also follow the graphite space  What is the latest news there  JH  Overall  graphite is attractive due to strong supply demand fundamentals  Prices have come back down from lofty levels last year  but have stabilized recently and remain elevated  This means that a number of graphite projects that might not have been economic in the past are economic today  Given that graphite is a key ingredient in so many established industries  from aviation to automotive  steel and plastic  I see prices holding up well  However  future demand growth is likely to come from the high purity  large flake graphite that is used in lithium ion batteries for electric cars and such  People talk about the big run up in lithium a while ago  but 10 times more graphite is used inside a lithium ion battery than lithium  There will be significant demand as we move toward electric vehicles and electric based power  The other exciting driver in investment demand for graphite is the potential of graphene  which is reportedly the thinnest and strongest material ever developed  Graphene is 200 times stronger than steel  several times tougher than a diamond and it conducts electricity and heat better than copper  It could even replace silicone in semiconductors  Also  graphene is nearly impossible to break  You could throw a graphene mobile phone display on the ground and it will not shatter like the glass on current phones  Researchers claim graphene is the most important substance to be created since plastic  Samsung Electronics Co  Ltd   005930 KSE  plans to launch a cell phone in mid 2013 that will have a bendable display made from graphene  Future versions could be a phone that rolls up on your wrist or that could be folded to fit into your pocket  There is a lot of potential for graphene in the expanding cell phone and green energy markets  The military has an interest as well  TGR  To date  graphene has been made only in labs using synthetic graphite to control for purity  Is there a graphite deposit in the world that will meet the need for very high purity  large flake graphite to manufacture graphene  JH  Yes  there are a few deposits  and companies are making progress in addressing the technical challenges to reach the purity needed to produce graphene  Focus Graphite Inc   FMS TSX V  has a high purity deposit  It just released its PEA in October at 32  pre tax internal rate of return  It has a 2 8 year payback and is fairly easy to finance with capital costs of just  154 million  Its very low  435 ton cost is driven by the high grades in the deposit  Management believes the company will be one of the highest grade  lowest cost producers in the world once it is up and running  This stock has a lot of potential  despite having been beaten down a little bit in the last six months  TGR  Does that make Focus a good entry point for investors looking for graphite exposure in their portfolios  JH  Yes  as long as they take a longer term view and are not looking to trade in and out quickly  It will take Focus time to get closer to production and to prove up the resource  Long term investors who can buy and hold will find a lot of potential there  I also like Energizer Resources Inc   EGZ TSX V  ENZR OTCBB   This company recently completed a drill program of more than 47 holes over 9 000m  It included the largest intersection of graphite ever reported  421m grading 6 18 carbon  including the valuable jumbo flake graphite at 93  purity  Plus  the mineralization is exposed at the surface  which means you can build a low cost open pit mine  In addition to possibly sitting on the world s largest graphite deposit  Energizer also has one of the world s largest vanadium deposits  Its PEA  expected by year end  could well be the catalyst to push Energizer s stock price higher  We are looking to buy on any dip below  0 30 share  TGR  The biggest concern is that the Green Giant project is in Madagascar  Not only is it a difficult place to permit a mine  there are also a lot of places where it would be hard to mine  Do you know what Energizer s strategy is for getting a permit and opening a mine  JH  Given the size and purity of the deposit and the potential revenue for the country  the government may allow some leniency regarding the permit  Energizer will be able to apply some environmental safeguard best practices  which should help with environmental concerns  I think the mine will get built  Thus far  indications are that Green Giant will be a very economic project  I think the company will find ways to work with the local community and the local government  TGR  Jason  thank you for your time and your insights  is the founder of  and publishes one of the most highly rated investment newsletters available  focused on strategies

101022,322537,WPM,Silver Seems Ready To Take Off   Are You Ready For The Flight  ,opinion,No sooner had the House received its 212 votes to pass the Debt Ceiling extension  silver and US stock markets began to rise while gold declined  The Commitment of Traders report shows Commercials have yet again reduced their Net Short position in silver  which is now close to the low of 2003  at the beginning of the Bull Market  Commercials are generally seen as the  smart money   so if they reduce their Net Short Position  they expect prices to rise  or at least not drop substantially during periodic corrections   The reason why Commercials are the  Smart Money   is that   unlike the millions of small investors who burn their hands by buying high and selling low   they tend to  buy  low  reduce short positions as price declines  and  sell  high  increase short positions as price rises   We are currently in a similar position  as there is resistance at  34  The 50 EMA is now at the same level as this red resistance line  and both the MACD and RSI look set to brake out above their red resistance lines  Combine that with the severely depressed sentiment in silver and the low Net Short Positions of Commercials  and we have the ideal cocktail for a nice rally in Silver Prices  As I wrote in an article on 28 Dec 2012  silver has till now always followed gold  a trend which will soon break  with going their own ways  The time to witness this amazing occurrence seems pretty close by  Debt Ceiling Bill passed is Silver   Stock Market BullishHouse Democrat Steny Hoyer of Maryland called the measure a  political gimmick  that puts off the debt limit issue for three months so House Republicans  can continue to roil the Congress  roil our people and roil our country  with fiscal uncertainty  The Treasury Department has said it expects to run out of emergency measures to prevent a breach of the current debt limit between mid February and early March  House Speaker John Boehner warned immediately after Wednesday s vote that Republicans would take the next opportunity   automatic budget cuts set for March   to demand  reforms  from Obama  The automatic cuts  which were temporarily set aside earlier this month in a fiscal deal between the White House and Congress  are  going to go into effect  unless Obama makes concessions  Boehner said  The Debt Ceiling extension has provided the markets with a huge relief and the illusion of the improviing US economy may be carried on for some more time  Though this relief is temporary in nature  there can be some more upside bouts in the Stock Markets  A survey showed China s manufacturing growing at the fastest pace in two years  which is bullish for base metals  While Global Markets are on a Risk On mode  money flows into riskier assets like equities  raw commodities  base metals  etc and away from gold  This also carries the perpetual risk of higher inflation  The need for a safe haven hedge against InflationGold has always been the sole safe haven option during times of crisis  with silver as a follower  as seen since the crisis of 2008  But now the scenario is way different   or the economy is rather projected to appear on a path to healthy recovery  There is a major diversion of funds into risk assets leaving little for safe haven hedging  Also  with rising taxes  there is even lesser left for

101045,322560,WPM,Will Expert David Morgan Call The Bottom On The Metals Market Again ,opinion,David Morgan  editor of The Morgan Report  expects gold to top  1 800 oz and silver to top  40 oz by the end of the year and both to take off from there  In this exclusive interview with The Gold Report  Morgan shares the logic behind his predictions and identifies several companies set to benefit from the end of the precious metal doldrums  The Gold Report  What s your current outlook on metals  the economy and the general market indexes  David Morgan  My outlook is bullish on the metals both short and long term  I think that the bottom is in for the mining equities as well as for the metals themselves  More and more people will realize that there s really no way out of this debt based monetary system  whether it is about the U S  reserve currency  the eurozone or anywhere else on the planet that uses a fiat currency  There s a problem here and it can t be resolved  We re going to see more pressures to the commodity sector in general  particularly the precious metals  TGR  In mid May you called the bottom in the mining shares and the bullion  What leads you to make such bold calls and maintain a high degree of accuracy  DM  I use my own indicators that come from a lot of experience  A couple of other things also keyed me  One was that the sentiment was so bad that it was screaming we are  at the bottom   Another was that there were a few days where the volume was very  very high and there was no real buying pressure  It was short covering  Short covering at a bottom is a good indicator that the smart money or the professional money is moving out of the market  In other words  they shorted for a very long time  They made their money  they re getting out and are covering their positions  All these factors led me to decide to stick my neck out  which is part of the job I do  and say that this looked like a bottom to me  My experience of over 30 years in this business tells me that it usually takes about three months to confirm a bottom  I m pretty convinced that I did get the bottom  now it s just wait and see another month or so if I m correct on the metals themselves  TGR  What prices are you predicting for silver and gold  DM  I m looking for silver to be above  35 oz and perhaps as high as  40 oz by the end of the year  I think we could see gold at about  1 800 oz by the end of the year  We still have four months ahead of us this year and with the fix that the global economy is in  a lot of people are going to come back into what they call the fear trade  and that will lift the metals  Once gold reaches a couple of upward resistance lines  you ll see a lot of momentum players come to the market as well for a quick trade  TGR  Last year you were predicting  75 oz silver  What s changed since then  DM  What s changed is the deflationary scare that I also talked about  It just happened to go a lot longer  I changed my mind partway through  That s one reason why you would subscribe to something like The Morgan Report  especially if you really want the most up to date thinking  Basically  we saw a big push from Quantitative Easing 2  where silver went from  26 oz to  48 oz  A lot of people thought it would keep going  I called that top at that time and thought that after it ebbed and flowed we might be able to build a base quicker than we have  Once I was able to determine that the base building would take a lot longer than I originally thought  I changed my view and said we re going to look at probably  35 40 oz by the end of the year  not  60 75 oz  Will we ever see  75 oz silver  Absolutely  I ve always predicted that we would see  100 oz silver as a minimum  I still think that s low but we haven t been there yet  So  you have to first get to  60 oz and  75 oz silver before you get to  100 oz  I m still looking for the top to be out probably three to four years from now  TGR  What do you see going forward into the new year  Any particular price targets for silver  gold and the white metals  DM  I ll be a little more conservative than I was at the beginning of this year  I think in 2013  we ll see silver above the nominal high of  48 oz  As for gold  for 2013 I believe we ll take out the  1 900  oz level that gold has already achieved  I m looking for new nominal highs in both metals in 2013  I think we ll get far beyond that but I don t want to put a number on it at this time  I ve wiped enough egg off of my face this year  TGR  Taking a macro view  what do you see in the general physical economy from a monetary point of view  DM  The physical economies are not doing that well in much of the world  A lot of misallocation of capital has taken place  China is a good example  it has tons of real estate that can t be rented  The prices are too high  Food stocks  generally speaking  are in some cases lower than they ve been for quite some time  Energy  food and water are crucial globally and there hasn t been enough capital movement into those essential elements  A lot of nation states are looking at what they have in the ground or are growing on the ground and are coveting their own natural resources In the book  Resource Wars   Michael Klare outlines the scenario of nation states going to war to either take resources that they need or defend resources that they already have  I m not predicting war but we already see increased competition for resources  On the financial side  the political class in every country is doing everything that they can to make this a fuzzy  mysterious problem that they ll blame on anybody but themselves  And  of course  they re the main culprits because they have so much control over the money supply  So  I see the physical economy dwindling  resource wars in our future and the political class pretending as if nothing s really wrong  Everything is going to be happy tomorrow but tomorrow never gets here  TGR  On to the mining side  Given the upheaval we ve seen in Argentina  Peru and most recently in Guatemala  what do you consider the most mining friendly countries  DM  Currently  I would say Canada  We just did a piece by David Smith in The Morgan Report about the overlooked silver mining ability of Canada and mines in general  The United States still is a good place  especially if you re a foreign investor  We have a lot of recommendations in Mexico  but I never want to have too much in any one geopolitical area  Some of the Scandinavian countries would be fine  In Africa  you have to pick and choose based on what part of Africa it is There are resources in Africa but they re being developed as brand new  We really don t know how well they ll work out because there s not much empirical evidence yet  South Africa is a mess and getting worse  I ve stayed away from South Africa during this bull market even though I was very heavily invested there during the first bull market in the 1970s to early 1980s  There are some exceptions  but the risk is very great  There is a report put out by the Fraser Institute that gives its take on the most politically stable countries for mining  I don t agree with it completely  but it s a good start  This is an art form and not something that is scientifically derived  Investors want to be careful about the geopolitical jurisdiction because no one can call them all perfectly Investors should not put all their eggs in one basket when you re in the resource sector  Either have some top tier companies  such as Silver Wheaton Corp   TSX SLW  NYSE SLW  or Pan American Silver Corp   TSX PAA  NASDAQ PAAS   that have assets all around the world or  if for investors picking their own stocks  use a service like ours to make sure that the investments are spread out geopolitically  TGR  SilverCrest Mines Inc   TSX V SVL  NYSE MKT SVLC  has pretty much said it is going ahead with the aggressive expansion program over the next year and a half or so and double its metals production  What are your thoughts on this  DM  I ve always liked SilverCrest  This is one that we ve had on the list for a long time  The market usually does what it s supposed to but not always in the timeframe one would like  SilverCrest is undervalued  I believe that it is going to be a good winner for anyone who is in the stock  Doubling a mine s production  even though it s a small one  is quite a difficult thing to do I ve met with the management in Vancouver several times over the last few years  We ve also had site visits  I like what SilverCrest is doing  I like the management  they re very serious and know what the margins are  They know where to narrow the costs so the margins will increase  TGR  Are there any more companies you like either in Mexico or in one of the other jurisdictions  DM  There are two companies that I would like to mention and almost have to mention them together because both have been good to me investment wise  First Majestic Silver Corp   TSX FR  NYSE AG  FSE FMV  is great  CEO Keith Neumeyer has done a heck of a job with the company  Its stock suffered to our benefit because he kept giving production targets that he missed  I suggested to him  and I don t know if he listened to me  that he underestimate production and when the company exceeds it  the market will pay attention  The market finally caught fire and it s been a good stock  I d also say Endeavour Silver Corp   TSX EDR  NYSE EXK  FSE EJD  has a great team  Some consider the company to be fairly promotional  but you ve got to promote your product and your company  Endeavour has basically done everything it has said it would  Both of these companies are in high growth states and I like that  So  even though they ve moved considerably from when they first were on the list at The Morgan Report  if you re a conservative investor and the stocks are undervalued now  which I believe both are  you can still buy these stocks  TGR  For the more conservative investor  are there any larger cap companies you like  DM  There are two that I want to talk about  Franco Nevada Corp   TSX FNV  NYSE FNV  is pretty conservative  It has compounded about 20  a year  It s run by some of the smartest people in the business and the company has a ton of cash  Franco Nevada knows how to inject cash into certain projects so it gets a royalty stream and upside on top of the royalty stream  It s now listed on the New York Stock Exchange  The other one that s been in the doldrums fairly recently and is coming out of them is Silver Wheaton  This company really knows what it is doing  It is buying streams of silver from companies all over the world  The contracts are fair to both sides in most cases  It s really hard to be a company that knows ahead of time what the costs are for the silver going in  what Silver Wheaton pays and what the cash flow is coming out  based on the current silver price  So  you can actually do your own modeling  Investors are buying silver in the ground pretty cheap with Silver Wheaton  I like that model a great deal  I think it has a lot of merit to the upside  TGR  Any companies in the U S  that you would like to mention  DM  Gold Standard Ventures Corp   TSX V GSV  OTCQX GDVXF  is one  it s in the Carlin Trend  The people who run it are very  very knowledgeable  It s a speculative situation a high risk high reward situation  TGR  Any catalysts that you see coming up  DM  Well  Gold Standard just put out some news and the market misunderstood it and the stock actually got punished for it  But on large projects  which this one has the potential to be  people don t really understand drill results  When you have a disseminated project or an open pit situation  it s a far different model than a high grade  hard rock  narrow vein mining situation  Grade is king  I almost always prefer hard rock mining  But  some of these bigger projects are so robust  and with the mining techniques that we have now  they can make a lot of money  So  it s right next to one of Newmont Mining Corp   NYSE NEM  mines  It could be a buyout  If you want a North American speculative play everything else I ve talked about is fairly conservative you could throw Gold Standard Ventures out there  The management is very savvy  CEO Jonathan Awde is young but he s smart and he knows whom to hire  His geologist is one old codger and he knows what he s doing  He s been in that area practically his whole life  One of the richest guys in Canada has got a big bet on this company  So  there are a lot of things going for it that I like  I m going to put a bet on this company  but  again  it is speculative  so I m not going to risk a lot  TGR  What is the best investing advice you have ever received  DM  It sounds trite because it s said and people don t do it  but cut your losses and let your winners run  TGR  It s hard to do  DM  But that s one of the best because if you re able to sell  you are doing the opposite of what most people do most people sell their winners and hold their losers  No  investors should cut their losers and let their winners run because if investors have one stock that s going to make 100 new highs over a 10 year timeframe  that s the one you want to keep all the way up  TGR  I think that s great advice  Thank you for taking the time to talk to us      is a widely

101046,322561,WPM,Gold Miner ETF Comes To Life  Early Stages Of A New Upleg ,opinion,As gold enters into a season of fundamental strength and what should be a powerful new upleg  there ought to be rekindled interest in gold stocks  In fact  if gold indeed rallies  the gold stock sector will likely see a much more powerful upleg than the metal considering how oversold it s been  And one of the first places investors will go when they are drawn to this sector is the venerable Gold Miners ETF  GDX    GDX was the first gold stock ETF when it was born in 2006  And with net assets of nearly  8 0b  today it is the largest of its kind  GDX s strong correlation history with gold has made it a popular destination for institutional investors and hedge funds  while also being a hot spot for the casual retail investor looking to hedge individual company risk  And of course GDX s primary allure is its ability to positively leverage the underlying metal  really the only reason to own any gold stock  While this leverage is fantastic over the course of a secular bull  it can be a double edged sword  Even in a secular bull there are periods of weakness  whether a short lived correction or an extended cyclical bear  And it is during these spells that leverage can work to the downside  To illustrate the two faces of leverage  take a look at this 12 month chart of GDX and gold  As anyone in the gold stock sector can attest to lately  oversold is an understatement  And GDX was certainly not immune to the carnage  But before we take a look at GDX  we must look to its primary driver  And gold was indeed party to a massive correction following its August 2011 all time high hear  1900   Following an early 2012 bump back up to nearly  1800  gold uncharacteristically spent the majority of late winter and early spring sliding lower  And by the time all was said and done  it fell nearly 19  to its mid May capitulation low   This obviously didn t bode well for gold stocks  and from its all time high in September 2011 GDX saw a 40 8  loss in only 8 months  This was negative leverage at its best  Gold stocks were the pariahs of the markets  and only sellers could be found  And to show how oversold they truly were  at its May low GDX was trading at 2006 levels  when gold averaged about  600   Thankfully GDX s May low matches perfectly with gold s own  and it appears as though a bottom has been carved  As you can see  gold has been gaining strength as we enter into its buying season  And after languishing in the summer doldrums  GDX has also come to life  With a 14  gain just in the last month or so it has not only responded to gold with positive leverage  it is hopefully forming the early stages of a glorious new upleg   If we do see a major rally in gold stocks  this ETF has the potential to attract a lot of capital as investors return  GDX is very important in giving this sector exposure  And it can be especially important to its component companies by attracting capital that may not have otherwise come their way  So as a research guy I put on my research hat to dig a little deeper than the charts  What are investors getting when they buy this ETF  Are they getting the best this sector has to offer   As an ETF  GDX seeks to replicate the performance of an underlying index  And Van Eck Global  GDX s administrator  chose the NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index  This index targets exposure to publicly traded companies involved primarily in the mining of gold  and consists of a diversified blend of stocks across the size spectrum  And after looking at its holdings  GDX indeed offers exposure to some of the biggest and best gold stocks this sector has to offer   As of this week GDX s holdings consist of 30 stocks  with the top 16 combining to hold 90   of its value  All of these stocks list in the US  with most sporting a dual listing in Canada  The majority of GDX s components are actual producers  25   with those that are not being either large juniors or royalty companies  And their operations are well diversified  scattered all over the world   But knowing an ETF s high level facts is not enough  If investors really want to take ownership in what they own  I believe they need to get intimate with the major holdings of their ETFs  If anything it will give them confidence in their investments  while also allowing them to learn more about the inner workings of an industry  And doing a little research may even expose some weaknesses  Let s find out a little bit about GDX s top 10 holdings  in order of largest to smallest by weighting   Barrick Gold  ABX   NYSE  15 4   How appropriate that GDX s largest holding is the world s largest gold producer  In 2012 Barrick Gold anticipates production of about 7 5m ounces  at total cash costs of around  560  Incredibly this tally accounts for nearly 9  of the world s total mined supply  a huge sum   On the operations front Barrick s portfolio consists of 26 operating mines  These mines and its other advanced exploration and development projects reside on 5 different continents and hold a massive reserve base of 140m ounces of gold  1 1b ounces of silver  and 13b pounds of copper   Barrick has seen incredible growth over the years as a result of savvy acquisitions and organic discoveries  Its production volumes  reserves  net earnings  and cash flow have all skyrocketed  And it doesn t plan on slowing down any time soon  Barrick s pipeline includes its massive Pueblo Viejo  Dominican Republic  and Pascua Lama  Argentina Chile  mines that are currently under construction  And by 2016 these mines will increase Barrick s total annual output to approximately 9m ounces   As the largest gold company Barrick naturally has the largest market capitalization in the sector  at around  37b  And with its 15   weighting GDX is actually one of Barrick s largest shareholders  owning over 3  of the company  Overall even though Barrick Gold is the leading senior gold miner  its size can be a knock against it  Unfortunately its large size can really throttle upside inertia  And judging by the recent sacking of its long time CEO  Barrick s lagging share performance has not gone unnoticed   Goldcorp  GG   NYSE  13 2   Goldcorp is one of the world s premier senior gold producers  Its 10 operating mines located in 5 different countries across the Americas are expected to produce about 2 4m ounces in 2012  And this gold  which is completely unhedged  is being produced at super low cash costs of about  320   Goldcorp has long been one of Zeal s favorite gold stocks  It has a long history of superior management  with strong roots that were cultivated by industry legend Robert McEwen  This company was also one of the first to be bullish on gold at the beginning of today s decade old secular bull   Goldcorp s growth trajectory is also unmatched considering its market cap was just  50m in the early 1990s  And it has no plans of sitting on its laurels as it looks to the future  GG s large reserve base of 65m ounces includes 8 development stage projects that are expected to nearly double production to 4 2m ounces by 2016  Its pipeline really is second to none  highlighted by its share of the Pueblo Viejo mine and its spectacular Cerro Negro project in Argentina  550k ounces annually at sub  300 cash costs    Newmont Mining  NEM   NYSE  9 9   Prior to Barrick Gold s acquisition of Placer Dome in 2006  it was Newmont Mining that had long held the world s  1 spot in the global producer rankings  Newmont has since been relegated to the  2 spot  But with 2012 production volume projected at 5 1m ounces  it has a strong hold of it   Operationally Newmont sports a diversified portfolio of projects that includes 30 operating mines on 5 different continents  It also has a strong pipeline of development projects that are expected to grow production to about 6 5m ounces by 2017  Its reserve base of 99m ounces is also quite robust  second only to Barrick   Unique to Newmont is that it s the only gold company listed on the flagship S P 500 stock index  It is also a pioneer in how it spins out its cash flow  offering investors a gold price linked dividend  On the cost front Newmont s  650 cash costs are a bit higher than its peers   but it still has plenty of margin and remains quite profitable   Overall Newmont Mining rounds out the big three of GDX s major holdings  With Barrick  Goldcorp  and Newmont combining for well over one third  38   of this ETF s weighting  investors ought to take a keen interest in how these major producers fare   Silver Wheaton  SLW   NYSE  5 5   With a name like Gold Miners ETF  I was quite surprised to see Silver Wheaton as one of GDX s top holdings  And I was even more surprised to find out that SLW was one of 6 silver stocks that combine to hold 10  of GDX s total weighting  But I really don t see any problem with this considering silver s high correlation to gold  And especially so since GDX s biggest silver holding is one of the world s best silver stocks   Silver Wheaton is one of the most profitable silver companies on the planet  yet provocatively it doesn t mine a single ounce of the metal  SLW is what is known as a streaming company  which is not to be confused with a royalty company  Its business model is actually quite brilliant  in that it pays miners an upfront sum for the right to purchase all or a portion of their future silver production at a low fixed price   In 2012 Silver Wheaton is expected to have attributable silver equivalent production of a whopping 28m ounces  If we scrub this up with the world s primary silver miners  this makes SLW second largest behind only Fresnillo PLC  These ounces are mostly coming from primary gold and base metals mines  17 to be exact  And SLW is buying this silver at an average cash cost of just over  4 00  Even more astounding is SLW is expected to grow attributable production to 48m ounces by 2016  with only a modest increase in cash costs  This company is a cash cow   Yamana Gold  AUY   NYSE  5 0   Yamana Gold is a company that we ve been following at Zeal for a long time  This producer has seen incredible growth over the years  and currently operates 8 mines in Mexico  Brazil  Chile  and Argentina  These mines are expected to deliver 2012 gold equivalent production of about 1 2m ounces  at super low net cash costs of less than  250   One thing that has impressed me with Yamana over the years is its ability to shift focus from acquisitive growth to organic growth  AUY s stellar technical team has so far made four major discoveries that have all ended up being economically feasible to development  And these projects are expected to lead to a production increase of nearly 50  by 2014   AngloGold Ashanti  AU   NYSE  5 0   With 2012 production expected to come in at about 4 3m ounces  AngloGold Ashanti ranks as the world s third largest gold miner  This global powerhouse owns 20 mining operations in 10 different countries  And its stock has long been a mainstay on most of the world s gold mining indices   Unfortunately it has been a long time since AngloGold has found favor with investors  Among the chinks in AU s armor is it was one of the last producers to reduce its hedges  its cash costs are typically on the high side    805 in 2012   and a large portion of its operations are located in South Africa  a brutally hostile place to mine during gold s bull    For these reasons and more AngloGold s stock has struggled  And this is readily apparent when you compare its market cap to its peers  Incredibly at  12b AU s market cap is less than that of Yamana  a company that produces just a quarter the gold  And amazingly its market cap is only about a third that of Goldcorp  a company that only produces about half the gold  This disparity speaks for itself   Randgold Resources  GOLD   NASD  4 8   In addition to having the coolest stock symbol of all the gold stocks  Randgold Resources is a solid mid tier gold producer  In 2012 it is expected to produce around 800k ounces of gold  at cash costs of around  640   This production will come from 3 mines in Mali and one in Cote d Ivoire  And with the addition of a large new mine currently being developed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo  production is expected to increase to 1 2m  ounces by 2014  Randgold is an excellent African gold miner   Kinross Gold  KGC   NYSE  4 8   Kinross Gold is one of the world s top 10 gold producers  with 2012 gold equivalent volume expected to come in around 2 5m ounces  KGC is well diversified  with 10 operating mines on 4 different continents  And its reserve base is quite robust at 63m ounces   Unfortunately Kinross is another major producer that has had its fair share of struggles over the course of gold s bull  In addition to costs that are higher than most of its peers    700   KGC has had some growing pains  And its recent pains surround some of its recent acquisitions  In addition to a  3b goodwill impairment charge on the projects it acquired from Red Back Mining in 2010  KGC will be faced with major challenges in raising capex to expand and develop its large projects in Mauritania  Ecuador  Chile  and Russia   Eldorado Gold  EGO   NYSE  4 7   Eldorado Gold is an excellent mid tier producer that possesses the ability to successfully operate in countries that tend to hold higher degrees of geopolitical risk  EGO owns 7 mines in China  Turkey  Greece  and Brazil  And in 2012 they will combine to produce 660k ounces at cash costs in the lower quartile of industry average   465   Eldorado also has ambitious growth plans  with a targeted annual rate of 1 7m ounces by 2016   Agnico Eagle Mines  AEM   NYSE  4 3   Agnico Eagle Mines is another excellent mid tier gold producer  Its 5 operating mines in Canada  Finland  and Mexico will combine to produce about 975k ounces in 2012  Cash costs are a bit on the high side at about  720  but this is hopefully only temporary as it optimizes production at its newest and largest mine  AEM also has a strong portfolio of exploration and development projects that should lead to material production growth in the years ahead   In all  GDX s top 10 holdings account for nearly three quarters of its total weighting  The 9 gold companies collectively produce about 25m ounces of gold  which is the equivalent of about 30  of the total global mined supply  And with an average market cap of  16b   owners of GDX are indeed taking a heavy stake in the largest gold stocks this sector has to offer   GDX s remaining 20 holdings are quite diverse  These companies include a wide range of major  mid tier  and junior gold producers  and also several silver miners  5 0  of total weighting   royalty companies  2 9    and non producing juniors   1 0     Overall GDX is a fantastic vehicle that gives investors excellent gold stock exposure  And I would highly recommend this ETF for investors who have no desire to pick stocks and or learn about this sector  But with a modified capitalization weighted system applied to a sector that only has a small pool of large stocks  some of the dead weight up top can really throttle performance  Discretion is out the door when trying to mirror an index with this methodology   For this reason prudent investors would be a lot better off picking their own basket of stocks  And it really doesn t take much research to grasp an understanding of how to pick stocks in this sector  A high level scrub of financials  corporate presentations  and project portfolios will quickly separate the wheat from the chaff  If an ETF like GDX is capable of positively leveraging gold s performance  imagine what a skillfully selected portfolio of stocks can do   The bottom line is gold is likely in the beginning stages of a spectacular new upleg  And where gold goes  so usually do gold stocks  In fact  the beaten down gold stocks are due for a major rally that ought to greatly leverage gold s to the upside  And as measured by the venerable GDX Gold Miners ETF  this leverage is already underway   GDX is likely to see a lot of interest as a new wave of investors is drawn to the gold stock sector  This ETF offers exposure to some of the biggest and best gold stocks there are  while also hedging individual company risk  But for investors who have the stomach to take on this risk  their chances of achieving even greater gains improve when they hand pick only the highest quality high potential stocks ,2012-09-02,Scott

101048,322563,WPM,David Christensen   Can Dividends Cure Gold Equity Hangovers   ,opinion,A market hangover may be causing suffering among gold mining equities  but some cash rich companies still beguile investors with record breaking dividends  Dividend distributions are up by about one third year over year from many major mining companies  according to David Christensen  chief executive and president of ASA Gold and Precious Metals Limited  The Gold Report spoke with Christensen at the Denver Gold Forum in this exclusive interview  The Gold Report  This year could be described as a hangover from the high gold prices of last fall  The price of gold hit a high of around  1 900 ounce  oz   it is now about  1 760 oz  Yet  we do see some bubbling and some positive news in the space  I m sensing a cautious optimism among institutional investors  David Christensen  In recent weeks  there has been a general uptick in enthusiasm for gold mining shares  As you pointed out  it s been a very tumultuous year for mining shares and the gold price  While the gold price has stabilized  it hasn t set a new high in more than 12 months  That has led to some investors withdrawing money from the mining sector  At the same time  the shares of many gold miners failed to perform  Cash flow was generally less than investors expected given the relatively high prices  Mining companies weren t generating the growth investors desired and internal rates of return have been much lower than investors had been seeking  As a consequence  there was a selloff in the gold mining shares  Part of the selling pressure was newer money that came into the sector over the last few years  such as hedge funds  looking to make an early exit from the sector  Gold funds typically remain fairly static in terms of their overall portfolios  while hedge funds come in and out of the sector  As the sector lost momentum and the general equity markets began to improve  hedge funds found alternative places to put their money  The consequence was that there were no buyers and a lot of selling pressure  Many of these shares are down more than one third from where they were a year ago  TGR  Still  there are so many gold producers  many of which are in your portfolio  that are still operating at very impressive cash flows with impressive balance sheets  How are they attracting new money the hedge funds and the generalists back into their shares  DC  It s really pretty simple  They have come out of a very rapid period of growth and are beginning to generate very strong cash flows and earnings  Moreover  gold producers are increasing their dividends  Dividend distributions are up by about 30  year on year from most of the major mining companies  We have companies today that are distributing three times what you could get from a safe T bond investment here in the U S   while providing added portfolio diversification from investing in a gold mining share  TGR  That s pretty compelling to a lot of investors who are looking for income right now  DC  We see some good value in the sector at the present time due to the increasing volume of distributable cash flow  The simple cash flow multiples or multiples to net asset value  NAV  for the industry are at the lowest valuations we ve seen in several decades perhaps during my career  Many of the mining companies on the senior side are trading at 0 7 0 8 times NAV  Mid caps to juniors are at about half of their intrinsic value  Now is a good time to consider many of the gold mining shares  TGR  ASA has around a half billion dollars in assets  How many stocks do you own in the fund  DC  It fluctuates between 30 34 positions  Right now  we re probably at about 32 positions in the portfolio  We re very heavily weighted toward some of the quality benchmark companies that most people would be familiar with  such as Barrick Gold Corp   ABX TSX  ABX NYSE   Newcrest Mining Ltd   NCM ASX   Goldcorp Inc   G TSX  GG NYSE  and  of course  one of the all time stellar performers  Randgold Resources Ltd   GOLD NASDAQ  RRS LSE   Randgold has been the largest or second largest position in our portfolio for a good part of the last five years  Beyond that  there are a number of small companies that make up much of the growth component of the portfolio  They are names that aren t on everybody s radar screens  such as Silver Lake Resources Ltd   SLR ASX   Osisko Mining Corp   OSK TSX   Detour Gold Corp   DGC TSX   Lake Shore Gold Corp   LSG TSX  and Stornoway Diamonds Corp   SWY TSX   These will change over time depending on how we feel those companies are doing  but they do provide a lot of the growth for the portfolio  TGR  I noticed a couple of platinum names and a silver name in the portfolio  It s not a gold only fund  but certainly is very heavily weighted toward gold  DC  It is a precious metals fund  which typically will mean that we may underperform some of the purer gold shares in a rising gold price environment  However  we tend to look at these investments over a longer cycle  For example  we invested in platinum mining shares for the long term positive attributes of the platinum industry several decades ago and during that time  they have been some of the best performing investments in the portfolio  We have found that a more diversified precious metals portfolio has outperformed the gold portfolio over longer periods  But a gold fund  at times  will provide more leverage to a change in the gold price  TGR  A subsector within the space is the royalty sector  You own Franco Nevada Corp   FNV TSX  FNV NYSE  and Royal Gold Inc   RGLD NASDAQ  RGL TSX   DC  The royalty sector is one of the stronger business models in the precious metals space  and Royal Gold and Franco Nevada are the two big players  They have historically been phenomenal companies in the portfolio  We are very long term shareholders in those names  TGR  What about Silver Wheaton Corp   SLW TSX  SLW NYSE   DC  ASA does not own Silver Wheaton  There are a number of reasons for it  At the moment  we prefer to get most of our silver exposure through a little company called Tahoe Resources Inc   THO TSX  TAHO NYSE   which has been a strong performer in the portfolio during the last year  Tahoe is developing a high grade silver asset in Guatemala  which we think is very attractive  TGR  What progress has Tahoe made on that asset  DC  Tahoe has commenced construction of its project  It is starting the second decline into its operations  and things seem to be going very well  It doesn t have its operating permits yet  but it wasn t expecting to have them by this time  Tahoe doesn t need them for another nine months or so before it commences operations  At this point  the development of the asset seems to be on time and on budget  and the stock has continued to perform very well  We believe it has one of the better management and operating teams in this industry  By the way  there have been no issues with its location in Guatemala either  TGR  Guatemala doesn t seem to be having the political or jurisdictional problems that have been impacting other Latin American countries  Do you have a favorite jurisdiction  Your assets are really all over the planet  DC  Gold deposits are put where Mother Nature put them  I don t have the option to move an asset  As a result  we don t have the benefit of picking countries first  What we do is choose a quality project  If the quality of the project is sufficient to offset the risk of operating in a given jurisdiction  then we ll consider it  Nobody in their right mind would take a low quality project in a high risk jurisdiction  At the same time  we might take a lower return project in a safer jurisdiction as part of our portfolio makeup  That risk adjustment is a constant ongoing process within the portfolio  You know  there was a time when a gold fund  such as ASA  would have been largely a South African portfolio  Up until the 1970s  there were only a handful of gold mining operations outside of South Africa  TGR  The Carlin Trend hadn t been discovered at that point  DC  Newmont Mining Corp   NEM NYSE  existed  but it was also a significant copper producer  There was Homestake Mining  which is no longer in business  and Hecla Mining Co   HL NYSE   That was largely the North American gold mining industry  At that time  ASA was largely a South African portfolio of gold mining shares  As the world has developed and exploration techniques have improved  we ve become more diversified  TGR  It was interesting to hear in presentations today about some of these large capital expenditure projects that are taking place in far flung locations all over the planet that one would never have thought of in the 1950s  DC  I ll be honest I have favorite countries that I like to travel to and visit operations  They aren t necessarily where I prefer to invest  TGR  Your fund has obviously struggled in the last several quarters because of languishing equity prices in the gold and silver space  even with the strength of the commodity price  Have you adjusted the portfolio at all based on the relative weakness of equity prices  I know you re a long term bull in the space  DC  ASA does tend to be a very long term investor  There are securities in our Top 10 holdings that we ve owned for decades  They didn t become Top 10 holdings because we bought 10  of the fund in the stock  They became Top 10 because we bought 1  that grew 10 times  They ve just gotten there through success  In the course of the last year  as the crisis in the industry broke and mining finance wasn t available to develop projects  those companies that were going to be in need of financing in the next year were some of the ones that we quickly ejected from the portfolio  We knew that they were going to be under significant pressure and that we were going to be able to buy those back as the market environment improved  There was a lot of turnover in the portfolio that wasn t typical for us  TGR  I m assuming that those were some of the smaller  and mid cap companies  DC  Absolutely  There were some adjustments from a risk standpoint in the larger caps  as well  The market began to deteriorate in the gold sector  Some valuation gaps broke out where companies that we considered to be very high risk assets that weren t being discounted by the market became overweight positions and some that were lower risk had taken the brunt of the selling  Some adjustments were made to lower the overall risk of the portfolio and hopefully improve its returns going forward  TGR  Do you have a mandate  Will you look at a company of any size  DC  We look for asset quality and good management teams first and foremost  When it comes to market cap  we don t have a hard and fast rule  We generally like a portfolio position to be at least 100 basis points of the portfolio or 1  of assets under management  If we re a  500 million  M  portfolio  I have to be able to move  5M of stock in and out of that position at any one time  If the liquidity isn t there to do that  then the company is simply too small  It s a simple math problem for us  TGR  You have to have the liquidity  The only company that I don t really know in your holdings is Silver Lake  Tell me a little bit about that one  Is that still in the portfolio  DC  We actually met with Silver Lake management about 30 minutes ago  One of the benefits of being in Denver is all the major companies in the industry are here at one time  Silver Lake is developing several assets in Australia  which we think are very strong  Most of the management comes from Western Mining Co   previously one of the largest mining companies in Australia  predominately in nickel  The strength of the management team and its approach to the industry is a combination that could make it an outperformer going forward  We re looking at this asset very carefully  TGR  The company is not listed on a North American exchange at this point  DC  It is only listed in Australia  TGR  The Australian stock exchange is looked on with a little bit of a jaundiced eye  When you buy an Aussie stock  do you take a closer look at their balance sheet  Do you do more due diligence on a stock like that than you would on a North American listed issue  DC  I hate to be flip  but honestly  no  There are certain financials that we look at in any asset  The level of modeling and the diligence is the same regardless of where they re listed  The exchange they re listed on is a tertiary consideration  Newcrest Mining is one of the largest Aussie mining companies in the world  TGR  And it s in your top five holdings  DC  Yes  it s our number three position  TGR  We haven t seen too much discovery  There was GoldQuest Mining Corp  s  GQC TSX V  big discovery in the Dominican Republic  Is CGA Mining Ltd   CGA TSX  CGX ASX  still in your portfolio  DC  Oh  yes  very much so  TGR  That s in the Philippines  We ve seen some interesting things out of the Philippines  DC  Historically  we haven t done well in the Philippines as investors  CGA  for us  is a bit of  for lack of a better term  a concept stock that we believe will be a good performer for the portfolio going forward  It has a good project and strong management team  It provides a little bit of exposure to that jurisdiction  TGR  You re on the board of the Denver Gold Forum  What are your responsibilities  DC  The Denver Gold Group is a not for profit organization that puts on conferences to assist the gold mining industry reach out to investors  like myself  for potential investment consideration  We host these conferences every year  The board tries to take the concerns of our members  the companies that are here  and reflect them in the conference to do the best job we can for the industry  TGR  The general attitude here is one of measured optimism  It feels as if we re all moving forward cautiously in this space  There s a little more excitement today than there was even a month ago  DC  Look at what s going on in the world today  concerns about political and economic situations in the United States  Europe and the Middle East  what s going on with the euro and the U S  dollar  People can t help but consider gold as an alternative investment  Gold prices will continue to do well for the next 12 24 months  Many countries  in fact  are looking to diversify their holdings as are investors into gold bullion  as well as dollars and euros  It s only a natural process  It s smart for investors to keep anywhere from 2  to 5  of their portfolios in precious metals  It provides a good diversification for an overall portfolio  TGR  Thank you  David  I appreciate your time   is CEO

101050,322565,WPM,Junior Miners Are Outperforming Gold Bullion  ,opinion,The technicals are lining up for precious metals players  not just the fundamentals The fundamentals for gold and silver appear to be making a positive turn as the US  ECB and Bank of Japan simultaneously signals Worldwide QE3  The charts are just beginning to make new uptrends and may have much more room to go  One must remember both gold and silver have not made new inflation adjusted highs despite record sovereign debt levels and a coordinated worldwide currency debasement  There is much more room to go in this rally as many investors still need to unwind record positions in cash and Treasuries  Over the summer a record number of retail investors held their largest cash position in many years  Now they must look for alternatives as the Central Banks are hoping to increase inflation to promote spending and investing  which will hopefully create employment  It is clear that policy makers are fighting for inflation as economic growth continues to stagnate not only in the U S  but in Europe  Japan and even China  Meanwhile during this recent summer correction  governments around the world were buying gold and silver as a hedge against the U S  dollar and the Euro which now appears to be crashing into new lows Since the expiration of QE2  gold outperformed silver  the large producers and the small miners  However  that trend appears to be reversing as the cash strapped junior miners are getting more interest from the cash rich majors and royalty companies who need to look for resource growth  Notice the major royalty deals that Silver Wheaton just recently signed for the first time since 2007   The majors are hungry for growth and are sitting on large cash positions which is losing value as Central Banks print dollars  Too many dollars chasing dwindling supplies of precious metals may cause a major price spike  The majors must invest in the junior miners which in a bull market could provide great leverage and move exponentially higher in percentage terms than bullion   As we have believed for many months  governments around the world will be forced to print dollars to deal with a moribund economy while interest rates rise prompting investors to flee bonds into the undervalued precious metals and commodities  We saw capitulation in the mining stocks in late May when they pulled back to 2010 levels  Some junior miners are cheaper now at  1550 gold then when gold was  600 an ounce   For many months we informed our readers that a rotation will continue to occur from overbought equities and treasuries into the record oversold junior miners which could cause a major percentage gain over the next 12 18 months where technical conditions were so oversold that we could see snapback gains of possibly 200 400   This happened before in the miners in 2008 and at other pivotal turning points such as in 2000 when the dot com bubble burst and we believe it will happen again in 2013  Below you may find the video ,2012-09-30,Jeb Handwerger,https://www.investing.com/analysis/junior-miners-are-outperforming-gold-bullion-138170,138170
101070,322585,WPM,A Painless Way To Buy Plummeting Mining Shares,opinion,Without intending it  Rick s Picks may have become an oasis for gold and silver bulls who are at the point of despair over the mining sector s relentless  and presumably unjust  plunge  We have good news for you   Using technical tools to tweak your timing and risk management  it s possible to buy  crap  stocks all the way down without getting hurt if you re early  We use the word  crap  ironically  of course  since it is only when stocks have been beaten down as badly as those in the mining sector that they become screaming bargains  And that pretty much sums up the situation as far as we re concerned  Not that the blighters who have been doing the selling couldn t bludgeon bullion shares even lower before they relent  In the meantime  wouldn t it be lovely to take all that stock from their undeserving hands   and to do so without penalty or punishment if we are premature On the subject of mining sector  crap   a perfect example is the execrated and abhorred GDXJ  an Exchange Traded Fund  ETF  that tracks the shares of junior gold mining companies   Although it has an ardent following among Rick s Picks subscribers  GDXJ has unfortunately proven treacherous to the financial health of long term investors  Some of them may have thought GDXJ looked like a great bargain a couple of months ago when it was trading for around  30 a share  down from a high of  43 in 2011  We told readers to hold off on buying  however  warning that the stock could eventually fall to  20 or even lower  That is still a possibility  Nonetheless  to avoid missing a possible long term bottom  we started nibbling at 23 93  a  Hidden Pivot  target first advertised in the newsletter when GDXJ was still above  26   The buy at 23 93 proved timely when the stock  having gone no lower than 23 90 that day  surged to 25 79   a 7 percent rally  With the stock steeply on the rise  we further advised subscribers to take partial profits to reduce position risk  And then we sat back and waited for GDXJ s fabulous bull market to unfold It was not to be  however  and when GDXJ fell anew  we recommended exiting the position  still profitable on paper  at 23 59   And then we did it all over again  buying August 23 calls when the stock was hitting a new  targeted low at 22 74   The options cost us  1 80 apiece  but we were able to reduce their effective cost to 1 45 by selling half of them for a profit when GDXJ rallied to 23 85  Thereafter  it was  rinse and repeat    With GDXJ shares getting schmeissed yet again yesterday  we exited the options on the opening for 1 50  booking a small profit on paper   And now  we plan to try again if and when the stock falls to our next downside target  20 72 Worth All the Work By now  you re probably thinking this sounds very labor intensive   It is  but it is still the best way we ve found to take the sting   and most of the risk   out of buying assets that look like bargains on paper but which are nevertheless continuing to get savaged on a regular basis  however unjustified  This would be true of  Silver Wheaton  SLW  as well  another mining stock with which Rick s Picks readers have had a longstanding love hate relationship  We like the stock ourselves as a long term play  but our enthusiasm will always be tempered by the coldly technical analysis for which Rick s Picks is known  It led us to buy June 40 42 calls spreads a couple of months ago when the stock was carving out a promising bottom  Immediately thereafter  when SLW rallied as expected  we took sufficient partial profits to reduce the cost basis of our vertical bull spreads to zero  And a good thing  too  for despite Silver Wheaton s atrocious performance ever since  we continue to hold a riskless  bullish position that causes us no concern   That s not to say our spreads will produce a profit  however  That would require SLW to rally above  40 between now and mid June  when the options expire   Most Silver bulls would have taken that bet back in early March  when we got on board near  34  But with the stock currently trading for around 28 34  it has become a 50 to 1 horse For the record  we told readers to buy more Silver Wheaton shares yesterday at 27 97  a Hidden Pivot correction target  Lo  the stock bottomed at exactly 27 96  see chart above  after plummeting  1 38  or nearly 5 percent  in the first hour of the session  The trampoline bounce from within a penny of the target took SLW to 28 76 intraday  We were well on top of the move with an intraday bulletin telling subscribers to take a partial profit at around 28 66   This effectively reduced our cost basis for the shares to 27 47   50 cents beneath the pit of despair bottom achieved at the low  How can we lose  right ,2012-04-24,Rick Ackerman,https://www.investing.com/analysis/a-painless-way-to-buy-plummeting-mining-shares-121083,121083
101071,322586,WPM,Exchange Trading Out Sleazes Carnival Midway,opinion,An amusing coincidence  I was posting to the Rick s Picks forum a moment ago about how exchange trading has come to resemble a sleazy carnival operation  and lo  the E Mini S Ps have shot up six points in mere seconds  This was an after hours move   the best time to stage these heists  since there is little legitimate buying or selling to get in the way of the perpetrators  I don t wish to insult carny operators by comparing them to exchange dealers and market makers  by the way  since the guys and gals who work the midway at least come face to face with the rubes they are ripping off  Not in the world of electronic trading  though  The pros who are doing the fleecing operate under a veil of secrecy that can be lifted only by securities regulators or the FBI The forum thread concered trading against phantom bids and offers that seem to be there only when you don t need them  Caf  Americain s Jesse had posted the following at his own blog   I am not trading nearly as frequently or aggressively as in the past because a  I am getting older b  these markets are almost ridiculous  It s like playing cards with the little girls  If I put in an order for a few thousand shares  the liquidity from a large offered set of multiple positions evaporates instantly and I close on maybe 100 shares  If I offer to buy above market but below ask I get ten  friends  appearing instantly along with my bid  Phantom MarketsJust so  This has been our experience as well  mainly in the equity option markets  On a Level 2 trading screen  one might see 5000 up bids and offers for call options that rarely trade  So who would be offering thousands of them  and for what reason  Some might suspect high speed   algo   traders  but that s not how those guys work  Typically  high frequency trading takes place without the display of bids and offers  How could they be reflected on a screen  given that such trades are sometimes effected at the rate of hundreds or even thousands per second  No  the phantom bids and offers that are reflected so ostentatiously have been put there by neural network computers programmed to act only if an offsetting  highly advantageous opportunity arises I learned about this shell game the hard way when I worked as an option market maker on the floor of the Pacific Exchange during the 1980s  Market makers typically did not trade with each other  nor did they honor each other s markets  Turn to one of them in a desperate attempt to buy a dozen puts or calls  and they would tell you to take a hike  Imagine my excitement when Timber Hill moved into the Microsoft pit where I traded  The firm s broker supposedly stood ready to honor 100 up markets in any put or call  Except that they would move those bids and offers out of range whenever some trivial market change occurred that might have given me an edge on an arbitrage  For instance  I might have been be waiting for an uptick in some obscure stock to signal an end of day short squeeze in computer stocks  Turning to Timber Hill s broker  I would shout   Buy 100 of the Jan 60 calls for 1 30   To which he would reply   I m at 1 40 now   Could their neural networked computer have been monitoring the same obscure stock for signs of an impending market move  Possibly  More likely is that their machine was watching ten other indicators that it had learned would move before my  trigger  stock knew what hit it High frequency trading operates at a level even further removed from reality  Regulators have recently begin scrutinizing this game  but merely doing so may obligate them to shut the whole business down  since there is no legitimate or even redeeming rationale for the practice  Don t be surprised if this happens within the next twelve months  It won t make the game any cleaner  only a smidgen less absurd ,2012-04-25,Rick Ackerman,https://www.investing.com/analysis/exchange-trading-out-sleazes-carnival-midway-121232,121232
101072,322587,WPM,May Silver s Precise Bounce Is Encouraging,opinion,Is the worst over for silver  From a technical standpoint  both the Comex futures and Silver Wheaton shares have done exactly what we might have expected of them if they were carving out a durable bottom  On Monday  the mining stock came with a single penny of a 27 97 correction target where we d told subscribers to get long using an 8 cent stop loss  Then  yesterday morning  May Silver futures trampolined from a low that lay just 1 5 cents from a correction target also identified using Hidden Pivot analysis  In both instances  powerful rallies began from within a hair of the targets  raising the odds that an important low is in  Our 29 940 price objective for the May Comex contract was flagged three weeks ago when the futures were trading above  31 an ounce  Yesterday s explosive bounce from 29 925 carried them all the way to 30 740   an 81 cent surge that would have been worth  4000 to any trader lucky enough to have caught the entire ride As for Silver Wheaton  subscribers have been instructed to hold onto half of any shares they may have bought when the stock bottomed Monday at 27 96  Yesterday  tracking the ballistic move in bullion futures  Silver Wheaton traded for as much as 29 79  That represents a gain on paper of more than 8  in less than a week  since subscribers were told to take a partial profit near 28 61  With our cost basis effectively reduced to 27 47  we can afford to let our profits run  But will the move continue  It s impossible to be sure  However  based on the energetic leap that these two silver vehicles have taken so far  we are encouraged to hold onto at least a small portion of our original position in Silver Wheaton for a potential four bagger  We should note in the meantime that the stock is not yet out of the woods  technically speaking  By our Hidden Pivot runes  SLW will need to rally a further  2 44  topping a peak at  32 20 recorded on April 12  to turn the daily chart decisively bullish for the intermediate term  At that point  we d say there s at least a 40  chance that the correction begun almost exactly a year ago is over ,2012-04-26,Rick Ackerman,https://www.investing.com/analysis/may-silver’s-precise-bounce-is-encouraging-121360,121360

101074,322589,WPM,Why These Silver Stocks Could Bounce In A Major Way,opinion,As I was reviewing the list of stocks hitting 52 week lows this week  I noticed an unusual cluster of stocks  silver miners  These stocks have been under heavy pressure in recent weeks and are falling anew  leaving them    at least in the context of recent trading patterns and valuation sentiments    quite cheap  Then again  just because something is cheap doesn t mean it s a bargain  After all  stocks moving below their 52 week lows can fall yet further before rebounding  So are these lagging silver mining stocks offering up value  or are they just a value trap    Here s what I found   The cycle and costs    a double whammy Silver miners  just like any other mining firm  are seeing rising costs as labor and equipment expenses have both risen steadily in recent quarters  Higher expenses aren t a short term blip    they re the  new normal   Adding insult  commodity prices have been steadily falling on concerns that a European economic implosion will affect global trading partners from Brazil to China    Yet here s the most important factor  Even with rising expenses and falling selling prices  silver miners continue to be a solidly profitable group  The EPS  earnings per share  figures noted above actually understate their profitability  High levels of depreciation dampen net income  but operating cash flow per share for almost every one of these companies is solidly higher than that EPS figure    Emotions rule Yet these stocks aren t selling off on valuation  Instead  investors are increasingly spooked that the troubles in Europe will put a brake on global economic growth  crimping demand for silver and pushing prices ever lower  Silver has actually been on a roller coaster ride since the start of 2011  Roughly a year ago  the global economy was starting to look a bit healthier  and commodities traders were snapping up silver contracts in anticipation of rising demand for this industrial metal  But fresh economic concerns have pushed silver back to levels it touched on two recent occasions  Make no mistake  Europe s problems should greatly concern you  as I noted   You shouldn t be surprised to see the market take a quick tumble on a day the headlines are especially scary  Yet it s impossible to know when such an event will happen    if at all  And if you are a long term investor  then you need to start thinking about buying whenever a deep sell off emerges  These are precisely the areas that will have the strongest snapback when conditions stabilize and growth returns  And growth surely will return to places like China  Brazil and the United States  all of which are poised for sustained growth    Right now  the sell off in these sliver mining stocks looks like a severe overreaction  trading in many instances for half of their 52 week high  Sure  they could fall further  but odds are they will be well higher in a few years once the current economic scares no longer dominate trading sentiment    Not just cheap  but a bargain as well   So where are the bargains now  Wall Street analysts are starting to compile a list of favorites  each using slightly differing methodologies  Dahlman Rose has been looking at mining stocks in the context of what their dividends will likely be in a few years  They note that Pan American Silver  Nasdaq  PAAS  has heavy capital spending commitments for the next 12 months  but should then be generating solid free cash flow after that  If this company boosted its payout ratio to 50  in 2014  then the dividend would be  1 95 a share  good for a dividend yield above 5   according to Dahlman Rose    Merrill Lynch prefers to look at the projected long term output of a company s mines  in some cases up to eight years  and then figures out what a particular miner should be worth in relation to the cash flow that the silver output will generate  For example  Merrill thinks industry giant Silver Wheaton  NYSE  SLW  is worth  51 a share  roughly twice the current stock price  For Hecla Mining  NYSE  HL   the target is  6  or nearly 50  above the current price    Analysts at UBS are bullish on Couer D Alene Mines  NYSE  CDE   The miner released first quarter results earlier this week that appear to have missed estimates  but after backing out a series of one time inputs  UBS found that Couer D Alene actually earned  0 39 a share  well ahead of UBS   0 18 a share forecast  They note  the significant beat relative to expectations was driven by higher production and lower costs   and see shares rising from a recent  18 50 to  28    Hecla Mining also reported results this week that were  frankly  uninspiring  Yet as I ve noted in a few recent articles  Hecla s results are being dampened by troubles at a key mine  and results in 2013 should look far better   Its Lucky Friday mine should be back in operation early in the year   UBS figures Hecla s mines are worth more than  7 a share  well above the current  4 share price    Risks to Consider  These silver stocks could still fall lower as Europe s troubles deepen and or if the  for silver drops further     Don t try to call the bottom on this sector  It may already be in  It may not  We just don t know  Instead  focus on the fact that these silver miners now represent deep long term value  whether as an asset play or a cash flow play  Commodity plays in general provide great trading opportunities  as they are often oversold in tough markets and overbought in brighter times  Indeed  I wouldn t stick around with these stocks if they were anywhere their 52 week highs  But the 52 week lows that are in place are surely enticing candidates to buy    BY David

101078,322593,WPM,Silver Correction Putting Miners Under Pressure,opinion,After weeks of sailing on troubled waters  the silver market is giving mixed signals  Analysts are struggling to discern whether or not the metal will be able to consolidate above resistance at  28 50  or whether silver is still in danger of further sell offs  Much will depend on developments in the US dollar market and the global economy   a view shared by Randy Smallwood  president and CEO at Silver Wheaton  a Vancouver based silver streaming company The euro crisis has been a big depressing influence on commodity markets in recent months  With the continent s debt crisis getting worse by the day  many investors are being drawn to the dollar  Most are confident that the eurozone is in great danger  Despite record low yields  traders are continuing to buy US Treasurys Capital is also slowly moving out of China  The country s economic model   based on generating export surpluses   could be heading for difficulty  An increasing number of Western companies have announced their intention to move production out of China  Bureaucratic fees were increasing to a point where many businesses had ceased making profits As Smallwood notes  the increasing demand for the dollar is having a negative effect on silver and other precious metals  price development  But the long term outlook for the white metal remains excellent  On one hand silver can be recycled at a much lower cost than gold  And demand from industrial end users will continue to grow in the coming years  which should have a positive effect on the price Since reaching its  50 high in the spring of 2011  the silver price has almost halved  Small and medium sized silver producers are having difficulties financing themselves without compromising their capital  European banks have been silver mines  main financiers  but now these banks are struggling with growing financial problems and are trying to reduce their own balance sheets  Many a silver mine could be harmed by this Just recently Aquarius Platinum  that it will be temporarily halting production at its Marikana platinum mine  located in northwest South Africa  According to the company  current platinum prices have rendered production at the mine unprofitable  Similar production halts in the silver sector would be painful in the short term  Nevertheless  a drop in supply would most probably have a positive effect on long term prices ,2012-06-14,GoldMoney News Desk,https://www.investing.com/analysis/silver-correction-putting-miners-under-pressure-126435,126435

investment for fund managers today is to hide in the defensive stocks  large caps and strong brand names that pay higher a dividend yield relative to Treasuries  Prime candidate is S P 100  which has bulls celebrating with an upside break out and a new bull market high this week  However  alarmingly low breadth is not confirming the break out  in my opinion European stocks have now gained for 10 weeks straight  I am very uncomfortable with that type of a streak for any asset class  let alone one like European stocks where the fundamental situation seems to be worsening  Gains are attributed to oversold stock prices  negative sentiment and most importantly  hope  that central bankers including ECB s Mr Draghi will deliver more stimulus Gold and Silver have been in a tight trading range since May of this year  Furthermore  this trading range continues to narrow even further with Bollinger Bands seriously compressing to at least a 12 month low  A major resolution should be close at hand and interestingly some miners seem to be leading the break on the upside  with Silver Wheaton moving 11  this week alone Big PictureShort term  we can see that copper and gold has failed to rally with other risk assets like Equities  Currencies and Crude Oil over last several weeks  Furthermore  the short term rise in the DAX 30  Commodity Currencies and Brent Crude  not shown here  has been almost vertical  So far no major commodity has regained the 200 day MA Leading IndicatorsGlobal economic data continues to beat economist s expectations  This is a positive for the time being and it has been helping global stocks and other risk assets move higher in the last couple of weeks Despite data improvements relative to economists expectations and despite the rise in the stock market  ECRI WLI refuses to move higher and remains in a downtrend of lower highs  It seems that each rise in the stock market  produced by central bank stimulus  has created smaller and smaller boosts to real economic activity  New OECD Leading Economic Indicator data shows Eurozone and China remain in a serious slowdown with economic contraction  while the US is now slowing and fading from positive growth  Japan is following the US into a slowdown too  while other BRIC countries are also losing momentum  with Russia recently entering negative growth on the LEI as well  In summary  OECD Total LEI s uptick in growth from the 2011 slowdown  is now rapidly fading   Featured Article Majority of market participants are discussing weather or not central banks are about to engage into re inflating policies  which the world has witnessed several times since the 2008 recession and which Pavlov s dogs have become accustomed to at any sign of economic slowdown  While it is my opinion that various QE s from global central banks will occur eventually  the current  hopes  for further stimulus are not justified  Various data points  which Ben Bernanke himself follows closely  reveal that the time for additional easing is still NOT upon us   You must be reading the beginning of this article and pretty much thinking that I am full of  you know what   since you have heard the rumours that Federal Reserve will most likely start a QE3 come Jackson s Hole  After all Mr Bernanke and other FOMC members have made promises over the last several months for further easing  Well  regardless of weather I am wrong or right  I personally think there is close to a 0  chance of QE3 right now  Let me explain  The chart above shows US Treasury 5 Year Break Even Rate  also known as market s forward inflation expectations over a 5 year maturity  The Fed closely follows these readings and prefers   tries to keep the expected inflation range between its mandate target of 2  on the downside and 3  on the upside  At various times  if the inflation expectations move out of the preferred target band  the Fed tends to intervene It tightens monetary policy if inflation expectations exceeds 3   by letting various monetary programs conclude   and it eases monetary policy if inflation expectations falls below 2   starts monetary programs as it worries about deflation shocks   In the chart above  we can see various interventions by the FOMC have been guided by the above indicator Assuming I am right and inflation expectations are way to high for the Fed to stimulate right now  the question is what would happen to major assets globally  Good question  let us compare the 5 Year Break Evens against S P 500 As we can see  the correlation between these two indicators is extremely positive  Historically  every Fed stimulus program came about due to a deflation shock  where the market s expectations of future inflation rate dropped below the Fed s target range  Historically the story runs like this The market crashed into October 2008  the VIX capitulated above 80 and every single man and his dog were fearful that the world was well and truly ending  FOMC started the QE 1 during that infamous deflation shock of 2008  Equities started their bottoming process  however  it became obvious that inflation expectations still remained well below 2  target range  The Fed upped the ante on QE and the market bottomed almost instantly  A super rally followed Recovery lasted well into spring of 2010  when the  inflation trade  became consensus  Majority of market participants started talking about how Federal Reserve was going to start its hiking cycle and the 5 Year Break Even hit the upper range of Fed s target  What followed was a market flash crash that was blamed on a trader s fat finger mistake   highly likely story    falling Core inflation figures and slowing economic activity 5 Year Break Evens found themselves edging onto the Fed s 2  target during summer months  which is the lower bound of the range  It was time to act  At the Jackson s Hole meeting in late August 2010  Federal Reserve Chairman Ben  Helicopter  Bernanke announced that he was going to begin another round of QE  The market bottomed almost instantly and another super rally followed well into the early parts of 2011 The inflation outlook was running well and truly wild at this point  Emerging markets were overheating and commodities were going through the roof  It was once again time for the Federal Reserve to end all of its programs and think about how to start tightening monetary policy  Break Evens were again around the 3  upper bound range and the S P 500 as well as majority of all other risk assets started peaking  majority of which are still below this high  All of a sudden in late July  US budget problems started to appear on front page as we watched politicians play a game of chicken  refusing to raise the debt ceiling  Eventually in early August  S P downgraded the US and risk assets crashed  The sell off was blamed on the US losing its AAA rating  but we all know that Bonds rallied and Stocks Commodities fell because QE2 finished  which meant the Federal Reserve was tightening their expansive policy and closing the stimulus taps Only a couple of months pasted and the Break Even rate found itself on the lower range of the Fed s 2  target  The deflation trade became consensus again  just like during the summer months of 2010  Recession talk was spreading like wildfire  It was time to act  Out of nowhere  FOMC held a  panic  meeting and the Federal Reserve Chairman Ben  Helicopter  Bernanke announced that he was going to stimulate again  starting a program called Operation Twist  The market bottomed almost instantly and another strong rally followed So here we are today with 5 Year Break Even rate around 2 7   well away from Fed s lower bound of 2   and yet Pavlov s dogs are fuelling the current risk rally on a  hope  that further money printing is just around the corner  The reason I say  hope  is because it takes a blind man not to recognise that economic activity is slowing rapidly  the business cycle is contracting and the global economy is approaching a recession  At the same time  S P 500 is less than 1  below its bull market high   Unless Bernanke is willing to risk the Federal Reserve s reputation and go against his mandate  one could easily assume that  hopes  of further stimulus coming out of the FOMC meetings or Jackson s Hole are just that    hopes  For the Fed to restart its  money printing  programs  we would need to see Break Evens fall towards 2   In other words we would need to see another deflation shock within the financial markets and if correlations are anything to go by  that would mean a strong sell off in the S P 500 and Crude Oil  a serious spike in the VIX and a rally in the US Dollar and Treasury Bonds  It is only then that we could see Federal Reserve and  Helicopter Ben  act again    Trading DiaryOutlook  I am of the opinion that the risk asset bear market is upon us and that the global economy continues to slow rapidly into a recession  US GDP has grown 5 out of the last 6 quarters below 2   which tends to be stall speed  Over the last 60 years  whenever stat like that occurred  we always entered a recession  At the same time corporate earnings and gross profit margins are at record highs  so I expect a mean reversion unlike so many stock analysts  Cash levels with mutual funds  retail investors and money market funds are at extreme lows  financial stress is starting to rise  volatility is at very complacent levels and credit spreads are very narrow relative to fundamentals  so I expect a risk off scenario in due time Positioning  Long focus is towards secular commodity bull market  with Precious Metals and Agriculture offering the best value  Substantial position is held especially in Silver  because I believe central banks will eventually print money again  as the global economic activity deteriorates  Precious Metals longs are hedged because Silver could break down below  26 support  but on upside break hedges will be taken off  Short focus is towards secular equity bear market  with cyclical sectors and credit offering best selling opportunities  Mild to modest exposure is held short in the Junk Bond market  as well as various US stock sectors like Technology  Discretionary and Dow Transportation Watch list  Commodity currencies like aussie  kiwi and loonie are also on my watch list of potential shorts right now  as negative surprises await with China slowing dangerously  With the euro being the most hated currency  a better risk off trade could be selling the British pound right now  A major short in due time will be US Treasury long bonds  as they are extremely overbought and in a mist of a huge bubble mania  but first we have to wait for the eurozone dust to settle ,2012-08-14,Tiho

Anyone who follows Karen Starich here on Zentrader knows that there could be tough times ahead for silver and oil  So I put together two trades to take advantage of a downturn in those sectors  one using options on Silver Wheaton Corp   SLW  and one on the United States Oil Fund LP ETF  USO   Not wanting to risk too much  the first trade is a vertical bear put spread on SLW  Loss on the trade is limited to the net debit  and I hope to minimize that loss should it become necessary  Vertical spreads are also nice because they often close themselves out without resulting in a position in the underlying stock Here s the trade

Hoping to capitalize on a drop in oil in the near term and a possible bounce back early next year  the last trade is a calendar call spread on USO  Again  it is a low risk trade due to the protection provided by the long call in case some unforeseen event causes oil prices to spike  If prices do drop in December  the short call would expire worthless and the premium retained could cover most or all of the loss on the long call  which could either be sold at that point  or held to benefit from a January rebound Here s the trade

101110,322625,WPM,Facts And Figures About Silver Investing,opinion,There are strong fundamentals in favor of silver  The metal is in short supply and demand is rising  With bullish signs in favor of silver many prominent silver investors see the price of silver increasing several times and eventually hitting a 1 15 ratio against gold  Industry veteran Eric Sprott  called gold the investment of the last decade and silver the investment of this decade I have provided some facts and figures in this article to show why silver is undervalued and has a lot of upside potential  Part of the argument for higher silver prices in the future is shortages in supply and a growing usage in technology  Another reason is that silver is a monetary metal and will attract investors during what I believe will be an inflationary times ahead First  there is growing demand for silver in industry and the metal is used in a wide array of applications including electronics  solar panels  mirrors  and various medical devices  There are constantly new application found that can use silver  and demand for silver in electronics alone has more than doubled over the past decade  while demand in solar panels is up six fold  The chart shows demand for silver in different applications  Although  demand in photography and silverware is declining  the increasing demand in industry and investment is quickly rising  and the overall trend is up When it comes to supply of silver it gets more interesting  Although  supply from mining has been increasing it still cannot meet global demand  Only through recycling scrap silver has the industry been able to keep up with demand  The chart shows mine production versus total demand for silver Another interesting fact is that there is much more  above ground stock  of gold than it is of silver  despite silver being 16 times more available in the ground  Since silver is no longer used in money  Government stocks are all but depleted while the silver made available through mining gets consumed in industry and end up in different appliances  With virtually no stock and frequent shortages  silver is often in backwardation  a condition referred to when the price of a futures contract is trading below its spot price due to a shortage in the underlying commodity ConclusionSilver is in a secular bull market and with strong demand and limited supply the stage is set for much higher silver prices in the future  In addition to supply and demand imbalances silver has a history of being a monetary metal and a safe haven against inflation  sovereign debt crisis and other looming threats  Silver has been coined the  poor man s gold  and once gold gets too expensive for most people  the masses will turn to silver as the next best thing  With such a limited supply there is no limit for how high the price can go   However  it s worth noting that silver is much more volatile than gold because its heavy use in industry  so be prepared for a wild ride There are many ways for retail investors to invest in silver  and perhaps the easiest way is through an ETF like the iShares Silver Trust  SLV   although I prefer the safety of physical ownership and thereby avoiding any counterparties  For those that prefer leverage  I recommend Silver Wheaton Corp  SLW   which is the largest metals streaming company in the world  They generate its revenue primarily from the sale of silver it acquired from various minors at attractive prices ,2011-12-05,Rob Hall,https://www.investing.com/analysis/facts-and-figures-about-silver-investing-107621,107621
101111,322626,WPM,How To Invest In Gold ETFs,opinion,There is any easy way to invest in Gold  Exchange Traded Funds If you have ever seriously considered investing in gold  you may have pondered the inconvenience of accumulating  and securely storing  physical gold Most people who buy physical gold purchase coins  since gold bars weigh 400 troy ounces At  1623 per ounce  a single gold bar will cost you  649 200 The only secure place for it would be in a safe deposit box at a bank How do you bring it to the bank If you were involved in an accident on the way there  you could lose that  649 200 Would your insurance coverage be adequate for such a loss There happens to be a much easier way to invest in gold  Exchange Traded Funds wherein the shares represent specific amounts of gold In the case of the SPDR Gold Shares ETF  one share represents 1 10th of an ounce of gold  stored in a vault located somewhere in Canada This type of gold investment is easy to buy and sell The resulting market liquidity and transparency provide great advantages over haggling with a gold dealer when you decide to sell If you invest in that bar  a sale becomes an  all or nothing  proposition On the other hand  a gold ETF allows you to buy or sell individual shares at your convenience   right from your smartphone Although the price of the shares is based on 1 10th the price of an ounce  there is a slight discrepancy  due to the fact that the ETF itself may find it necessary to acquire gold from another source to fill the order Commissions and maintenance are often included in the share prices Gold ETFs are  passive  funds which employ no fund manager   thus avoiding that expense There are quite a number of gold ETFs available to those interested in this relatively safe investment Although many companies go bankrupt   gold will never become worthless You could lose a significant percentage of your investment if the market for gold crashes   but you will never lose your total investment Let s take a look at some particular gold ETFs The most popular gold ETF is the SPDR Gold Shares ETF  NYSEARCA    was established in November of 2004  has enjoyed a Year To Date market return of 5 20  It has a market capitalization of  67 3 billion and a net expense ratio of  40 Second Opinion Weekly Report downgraded  to  Neutral  from  Long  10 days ago    The iShares Gold Trust ETF  NYSEARCA IAU  was established in January of 2005 and has enjoyed a YTD market return of 5 38  It has a market capitalization of  9 5 billion and a net expense ratio of  25 Second Opinion Weekly Report downgraded IAU to  Neutral  from  Long  17 days ago    The Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF  NYSEARCA GDX  was established in May of 2006 and has sustained a negative YTD market return of  5 21  It has a market capitalization of  7 7 billion and a net expense ratio of  53 Second Opinion Weekly Report downgraded GDX to  Avoid  17 days ago Because this ETF invests in mining companies  which might mine other precious metals as well as gold   the fund s value does not specifically track the price of gold   as is the case with the other gold ETFs The top five components of this fund are  Barrick Gold  15 73    Goldcorp  13 22    Newmont Mining  9 67    Silver Wheaton  5 44   and Anglogold Ashanti  5 36      The ETFS Physical Swiss Gold Shares Fund ETF  NYSEARCA SGOL  was established in September of 2008 and has enjoyed a YTD market return of 5 16  It has a market capitalization of  1 8 billion and a net expense ratio of  39 Second Opinion Weekly Report downgraded SGOL to  Neutral  from  Long  10 days ago    Before reading this article you may have thought  Gold is gold   so what difference does it make which ETF I choose   Hopefully  you may have found the answer to that question by now Good luck  Disclaimer   trades a wide variety of ETFs and positions can change at any time ,2012-04-06,John Nyaradi,https://www.investing.com/analysis/how-to-invest-in-gold-etfs-119366,119366
