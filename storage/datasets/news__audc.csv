8351,229866,AUDC,Altice s Comprehensive Portfolio Shows Promise  Risks Remain,opinion,On Jun 5  we issued an updated research report on Altice USA  Inc    NYSE ATUS    one of the largest broadband communications and video services providers in the United States Altice has been rolling out enhanced data and services for its business customers through its unit  Altice Business  Formed by merging its Lightpath  Optimum and Suddenlink business brands under a single umbrella  Altice Business offers the best in class data  voice  video and managed services to about 2 million customers  Altice Business has also standardized its product portfolio  providing customers with access to services that meet their needs  regardless of size or region  and creating more value and choice  Additionally  the company is building a next generation fiber network capable of delivering broadband speeds of 10 Gbps  reflecting its continued investment in technology and innovation for customers in the United States The company remains on track with its five year plan to build a FTTH  fiber to the home  network and deploy its new home communications hub  The company believes the FTTH network will be more resilient with reduced maintenance requirements  fewer service outages and lower power usage  which is likely to lead to further cost efficiencies  This network will allow Altice to satisfy demand for increasing speeds and support evolving technologies  such as the expected transition of mobile networks to 5G and enable it to capitalize on associated revenue growth opportunities Altice also augmented its market position as a pioneer in the advertising business with the launch of a4   an advanced advertising tool   to provide audience based  multiscreen advertising solutions for its clients  With this  the company has successfully implemented a strategic plan to strengthen its footprint in digital advertising through multiple acquisitions and investments     From being the first MVPD  multichannel video programming distributor  partner to offer addressable advertising solutions in the New York DMA  Altice has evolved as a leading player in this segment and has subsequently created a niche for itself  This was achieved through the acquisitions of Cablevision  NYSE CVC  way back in 2015  followed by Audience Partners  a leading provider of authenticated IP addressability technology  and Placemedia  a premier provider of programmatic ad solutions for OTT and on demand television With the successful integration of these businesses with Cablevision s advertising and data business  Altice has brought to the fore unique skill sets for advertisers to identify the target audience across screens and local and national TV  They can now create an effective media plan  execute the buy and measure cross screen reach  frequency and attribution to measure the efficacy of the program Leveraging the superior reach of a4  advertisers can reportedly extend their content to more than 90 million households  85  of broadband subscribers and 1 billion devices in the United States  This would significantly aid advertisers to screen their messages to target pool of audience  thereby reducing operating costs However  Altice has underperformed the  with an average loss of 39 1  in the past year against a gain of 1 9  for the latter  The company operates in a highly competitive industry against a variety of broadband  pay television and telephony providers and delivery systems  including broadband communications companies  wireless data and telephony providers  video signals  video content and broadcast television signals available to residential and business customers  Moreover  consumers  selection of an alternate source of service due to economic constraints  technological advances or preference is likely to curb demand for the company s services  The company s ability to increase the number of subscribers of its services is highly dependent on penetration rates In addition  Altice s programming costs increased 2 5  year over year in first quarter 2018 primarily due to a rise in contractual programming rates  partially offset by the decrease in video customers  We expect programming costs per customer to increase going forward Nevertheless  we remain impressed with the inherent growth potential of this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock

8531,230046,AUDC,AudioCodes  AUDC  Sees Hammer Chart Pattern  Time To Buy ,opinion,"AudioCodes Ltd    NASDAQ AUDC   has been struggling lately  but the selling pressure may be coming to an end soon  That is because AUDC recently saw a Hammer Chart Pattern which can signal that the stock is nearing a bottom 
What is a Hammer Chart Pattern  
A hammer chart pattern is a popular technical indicator that is used in candlestick charting  The hammer appears when a stock tumbles during the day  but then finds strength at some point in the session to close near or above its opening price  This forms a candlestick that resembles a hammer  and it can suggest that the market has found a low point in the stock  and that better days are ahead 
Other Factors
Plus  earnings estimates have been rising for this company  even despite the sluggish trading lately  In the past 60 days alone 1 estimate has gone higher  compared to none lower  while the consensus estimate has also moved in the right direction 
Estimates have actually risen so much that the stock now has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  suggesting this relatively unloved stock could be due for a breakout soon  This will be especially true if AUDC stock can build momentum from here and find a way to continue higher of off this encouraging trading development ",2016-05-09,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/audiocodes-(audc)-sees-hammer-chart-pattern:-time-to-buy-200129115,200129115

8611,230126,AUDC,6 Stocks To Watch  AUDC  CVNA  ETSY  JNCE  PGNX  TLRA,opinion,"It was kind of a mixed market on Tuesday  A lot of stocks we follow did well and a lot of new ones came to the forefront  For now  let s begin by taking a look at one of our old favorites 
AudioCodes Ltd   AUDC 
AUDC which we were all over last July when it was trading in the 7 8 range  has made it all the way up to 15  or more than doubled  You can see the stair step it s had  recently consolidating in a coiling like pattern  It had a big breakout on Tuesday  jumping 1 44  or 10 11   to 15 69  on 688 237 shares traded  That s the best volume for this stock in a long time  I think that if this stock will make it up to 17  it may extend it all the way up to 21 at some point 
Carvana Co   CVNA 
CVNA after consolidating for three weeks  we re following a huge run that took it from 30 to 60  On Tuesday  it was up another 3 88  or 6 58   to 62 82  on 2 8 million shares  For me  the target has to be a retest of the old highs around 71 72 
Etsy  Inc   ETSY 
ETSY popped out of a wedge on Tuesday  and although not a big one  still  it was up 1 57  or 2 3   to 69 73  on 3 55 million shares  The volume picked up  It looks like it s going to extend to the recent highs at 73 35  If it gets through that  we re looking at 83 85 
Jounce Therapeutics  Inc   JNCE 
JNCE after inversing in a head and shoulder s pattern  it formed a flag  and on Tuesday it popped out of the flag  gaining 37 cents or 5 82   to 6 73  on 418 803 shares traded  All it needs to do now is take out 7 35  and it will be headed to the 8 1 2 9 zone going forward 
Progenics Pharmaceuticals  Inc   PGNX 
PGNX which I put a swing on Tuesday because I believed it was going break out  and it did  but it backed off  A pullback is sometimes a buying opportunity  We ll see  It closed up just 13 cents  or 2 72   to 4 91  on 1 88 million shares  We need to get a follow through on this one  There s some resistance at 5 40  but I m looking for a swing to 6 1 2 
Tilray  Inc   TLRY 
TLRY one of swing trades  is doing great  After the pop and pullback  a wedge formed  It broke out  pulled back and tested  formed a flag  and then broke out again on Tuesday  on a nice 72 cent pop  or 1 14   to 63 83  on 1 3 million shares  I think this stock will get to 7 1 2 quickly  and then it may make it up to 8 1 2 9

Adient plc  ADNT 
Adient  NYSE ADNT  popped 1 50  or 6 9   to 23 21  on 2 million shares on Tuesday  I like this chart so much that I ve been watching it continuously  and I decided on Tuesday  after breaking the falling wedge with some energy and good volume  I would put a swing on it  Now  I m looking for a move to the 26 range  a gap fill to 27 1 2  and then a run to 32 33 
AudioCodes Ltd   AUDC 
AudioCodes  NASDAQ AUDC  a stock we ve been following for a couple years  which I put a swing on back in Oct Nov 2017  has down very well over the last year and a half  On Tuesday  it made a new multi year high  jumping 1 64  or 10   to 18 09  on 1 4 million shares  reaching a high of 18 45  That s the highest level in 20 years  The next target is 25 
IRadimed Corporation  IRMD 
Iradimed  NASDAQ IRMD  also popped on Tuesday  gaining 75 cents  or 4 08   to 19 14  on 73 010 shares traded  with a high of 19 40  It got up to resistance  Let s see if it can get through this level at 26 16  My next target is 28 1 4  If it gets through that  we could see a run to the top of the channel that comes in about 33 33 1 2 
Luckin Coffee Inc   LK 
Luckin Coffee  NASDAQ LK  is doing well  It exploded on Monday and had a nice follow through on Tuesday  running up 1 78  or 8 23   to 23 40  on 9 4 million shares traded  I m looking for a run to the all time high at 25 96 and take it into the high 20 s 
Microbot Medical Inc   MBOT 
Microbot Medical  NASDAQ MBOT  had a big pop on Tuesday  moving up 1 67  or 32   to 6 95  on 232 734 shares traded  That takes it out of a 2 month base but leaves it at resistance  If it can get up through the next target at 8 1 2  which is my near term target  it could very well fly 
Qudian Inc   QD 
Qudian Inc  NYSE QD  held the trendline and moving averages on Tuesday  and then popped 66 cents  or 8 4   to 8 52  on 6 3 million shares  I m looking for a move to 9 15 for it to get to 11 00

8613,230128,AUDC,ANIK  AUDC  BYND  DBD  OC  OSTK  Stock Charts To Watch,opinion,"Anika Therapeutics  Inc   NASDAQ ANIK  had a major pop on Thursday and exploded 11 78  or 29   to 52 60  on 1 4 million shares  and reaching as high as 56 22  That was the biggest volume in more than a year  You can see the breakaway gap and run up and a strong close  which tells me its ready to move  Although there is resistance here  the next target will have to be 61  Then we re looking at mid to high 60 s 
AudioCodes Ltd   NASDAQ AUDC  continues to push  You can see it breaking out of the coiling type pattern  and also the bottom of the channel  moving average and 50 day  There was a breakout day on an inside day on Wednesday  and on Thursday  it was up 69 cents  or 4   to 18 52  on 447 188 shares traded  I think this stock will go to 21  and then mid 20 s after that 
Beyond Meat  Inc   NASDAQ BYND   which I showed you last weekend that this coil was developing  I said that if it pops  it may run to test the high and take it out  That high was 202ish  On Wednesday  it was up 19 94  or 10   to 222 86  with a high of 222 88  on 9 7 million shares  It s up another 8 61  3 86   to 231 47 in after hours  This is a stock that could run on Friday  The angle that I have it run in might be a quick run into that 250 range  which is my near term target 
Diebold Nixdorf  Incorporated  NYSE DBD  after the decline  broke out and killed it  going from the  30 s range to the 2 3 dollar range  Then it exploded Jan  Feb  and March  taking it from the 2 3 dollar range to Thursday s high at 13 40  On Thursday  it had a breakaway gap and then ran up to 2 88  or 28   to 13 17  on 5 3 million shares  The first level of resistance is 13 17  and the next level comes in at 16 1 2 3 4  which is the next target for DBD 
Owens Corning  NYSE OC  has a beautiful pattern  I love the declining channel  a breakout  a pullback  the base formed  a breakout of two corrective falling wedges  and then the pop out  I put a swing on it on Wednesday and it followed through on Thursday  popping 96 cents  or 1 64   to 59 50  on 1 95 million shares  I m looking for this to make a quick test of the gap at about 64  and then the high 60 s  That s the big one  but the gap is a huge one in the 70 s  Targets are 63  68  70  and 71 going forward 
Overstock com  Inc   NASDAQ OSTK  actually did have a breakout that moved up and then backed off  It was up on a fraction on Thursday  only 10 cents  to 19 21  on 6 7 million shares  Volume picked up  though  It may  if it consolidates  shoot out and test resistance at 19 21  If it gets through that  targets are 23  and then 26 1 2

8614,230129,AUDC,5 Stock Charts To Watch  ABEO  AOSL  AUDC  AVMXY  NERV,opinion,"Abeona Therapeutics Inc  NASDAQ ABEO  has been in a downtrend since 9 00  and change  down to 1 46  not even three weeks ago  It exploded two weeks ago  and has been coiling and consolidating for a couple weeks now  On Wednesday  it popped 28 cents  or 10   to 3 20  on 882 081 shares traded  To me  it looks like it s about to pop and go  If it gets through 3 40  I m looking for 4  and then 4 3 4 as target 
Swing trade  Alpha and Omega  Semiconductor Ltd  NASDAQ AOSL  gained 20 cents  or 1 54   to 13 22  on 73 303 shares traded on Wednesday on an inside day  It looks to me like it s poised to pop  The wedge is right at resistance  If it gets through that zone  16 is your target 
 AudioCodes Ltd   NASDAQ AUDC  has been awesome for a year now  and on Wednesday  it ran 1 02  or 5 06   to 21 18  on 433 488 shares traded  Basically  it broke out from the 6 00 7 00 zone  and since  has tripled  The recent wedge or coil that formed has broken out and been up for six days  having run from under 17 to 21 50  I think it s near the top of the channel  and may have only a little bit left toward 23 24  So  keep an eye on that one 
Swing trade  Avita Medical Ltd   OTC AVMXY  had a key breakout on Wednesday  popping 66 cents  or 9   to 7 94  on 412 222 shares traded  and reaching new all time highs at 7 95  With this kind of pattern  it wouldn t shock me if it went to 11 80  14  and 15 
Minerva Neurosciences Inc  NASDAQ NERV  is at the point where it might explode  In June it made a big pop  pulled back  formed a wedge  consolidated for another month  broke out and retested  The volume was pretty low on the pullback  but it popped again on Wednesday  and gained 31 cents  or 4   to 8 42  on 315 060 shares traded  For me  I think it s ready to go  I m looking for a move to 9 1 2 and 11 1 2

8616,230131,AUDC,Stock To Watch  AMKR  AUDC  CRSP  IOVA  NEO  XRX,opinion,"Amkor Technology   Inc   AMKR 
Amkor Technology Inc  NASDAQ AMKR  which over the last year  built a nice long base  formed a triple top  and on Tuesday  it exploded  and ran to new all times highs  through double resistance and to the top of the channel  jumping 3 84  or 35   to 14 92  with a high of 15 00 even  on 7 2 million shares  A breakout on this kind of volume usually indicates a thrust to a new trend or intermediate moves  which could take it  at least  to 17  18  19  maybe more  That was a massive  breakaway move and I think it s going to go higher 
 AudioCodes Ltd    AUDC 
AudioCodes Ltd  NASDAQ AUDC  which we ve been talking about for three years  has gone from 2 80 all the way up to 22 00  seven fold or even more  This stock is in a beautiful rising channel  You can see Tuesday s pop of 1 51  or 7 82   to 20 81  with a high of 21 12  on 714 017 shares traded after a really good earnings report  broke the recent consolidation  It popped with the best volume we ve seen since July when it broke out  I think it will test Tuesday s high  and if it gets through that  the short term target is 22 50  intermediate is 25 
CRISPR Therapeutics AG  CRSP 
 Crispr Therapeutics AG   NASDAQ CRSP  is an old swing from back in March  It met our target in August  pulled back down  broke out  created a new rising channel  and on Tuesday  it exploded 4 07  or 9   to 48 92  with a high of 49 00 even  on 1 3 million shares  It has taken it back up to test the 50 50 1 2 resistance  If it gets through that  54 and 57 are the next targets going forward 
Iovance Biotherapeutics  Inc   IOVA 
Iovance Biotherapeutics Inc  NASDAQ IOVA  finally convinced investors after the move up was abated by forming a flag  and then popping out of it on Tuesday  running up 97 cents  or 4 97   to 21 20  with a high of 21 41  on 764 428 shares traded  If this gets through and above 21 90  this is a stock that s going to start moving  Targets are 23 1 4  26 26 1 2  and more 
NeoGenomics  Inc   NEO 
 NeoGenomics Inc   NASDAQ NEO  has had a beautiful uptrend since early 2018  it came down this August  in a mini  5 wave move down  bounced  and then on Tuesday  it broke out  ramping up 2 50  or 12   to 23 36  with a high of 23 51  on 1 9 million shares  That s almost double the regular volume  It broke out across double tops and the 50 day moving average  It was absolutely stellar  Now  I m looking for this stock to make a move back up to 25 26  even 28 1 2 
Xerox Corporation  XRX 
Xerox Corporation  NYSE XRX  is one of our stocks from a while back  It formed a V bottom late December  popped  pulled back and did a 50  retracement in August  formed a right handed extended V  and then on Tuesday  it had a big pop with a breakaway gap  jumping 3 63  or 12   to 34 42  with a high of 35 86  on 6 1 million shares  I think key resistance is just overhead  but I put a swing on it  and it feels to me like it s about to go ballistic to the channel top  A measured move on this one could get it to the mid 40 s  maybe 50  Stay tuned  it s going to be interesting
