120398,341913,LHX,Trump lays out plan to privatize air traffic control system,news,"By David Shepardson WASHINGTON  Reuters    President Donald Trump outlined a plan on Monday to privatize the U S  air traffic control system to modernize it and lower flying costs  but his proposal drew immediate criticism from Democrats who said it would hand control of a key asset to special interests and big airlines  Trump s proposal to spin off air traffic control from the Federal Aviation Administration  FAA  was part of a weeklong White House focus on infrastructure  The administration is looking to shift the spotlight back onto Trump s agenda and away from a growing probe into alleged ties between his campaign and Russia   We re proposing reduced wait times  increased route efficiency and far fewer delays   Trump said   Our plan will get you where you need to go quickly  more reliably  more affordably  and yes  for the first time in a long time  on time   Executives from United Airlines  Hawaiian Airlines  HAII UL   American Airlines and Southwest Airlines  all represented by the Airlines for America lobbying group  attended the Trump speech  The group praised the Trump plan  which most airlines back  The proposal  which would require congressional approval  is opposed by many Democrats and some Republicans  The FAA spends nearly  10 billion a year on air traffic control funded largely through passenger user fees  and has spent more than  7 5 billion on next generation air traffic control reforms in recent years  Trump said current air traffic reform efforts have failed and were a  total waste of money   It is unclear if privatization would speed the rollout of new systems such as satellite based aircraft tracking that replaces ground radar dating back to World War Two  Proponents say a private entity could sign contracts with vendors more quickly than if deals are put through the FAA s procurement process  which also is subject to budget instability   Opponents  including Delta Air Lines  NYSE DAL   say the U S  system is so large that privatization would not save money  and would drive up ticket costs and could create a national security risk  Opponents also say technology upgrades would be sidetracked while the private entity was set up  potentially adding years to awarding contracts   There also are concerns that airlines would dominate the private company board and limit access to airports by business jets   The new systems would represent major wins for U S  companies that have been positioning for the shift  Technology company Harris Corp  NYSE HRS  is a leading candidate to supply the FAA with real time aircraft tracking data in partnership with satellite operator Iridium Communications Inc  Harris already provides a similar data feed using 640 ground based antenna towers  and the FAA is its largest customer  Chief Executive Bill Brown said in an interview  Iridium has a joint venture that has partnered with air traffic control authorities in Canada  Italy  Ireland and Denmark to provide air traffic surveillance  in cooperation with Harris  Under Trump s proposal  a board made up of airline  union and airport officials would oversee the nonprofit entity that would assume oversight after a three year transition  House of Representatives Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi said in a statement that Trump was recycling  a tired Republican plan that both sides of the aisle have rejected  and would  hand control of one of our nation s most important public assets to special interests and the big airlines   The Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association said it will not support a plan that imposes fees on small plane owners   The U S  has a very safe air traffic system today and we don t hear complaints from our nearly 350 000 members about it   said Mark Baker  the group s president  The infrastructure push comes as the White House seeks to refocus attention on core promises to boost jobs and the economy Trump made last year during his presidential campaign  Those pledges have been eclipsed by the furor over Russia s alleged meddling in the election  That drama will come to a head on Thursday when former Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey  who was leading the Russia probe until Trump fired him last month  testifies before a Senate panel  Trump has denied any collusion between Russia and his campaign  He has struggled to keep the spotlight on plans that could give him a political boost

120428,341943,LHX,Exelis to offer drone tracking system as industry  NASA seek to ease safety fears,news,By Alwyn Scott NEW YORK  Reuters    U S  aerospace company Exelis Inc  N XLS  is close to unveiling a low altitude surveillance system for drones  the latest sign of how a  highway in the sky  is likely to evolve  The system  whose existence has not been previously reported  shows how  Exelis  and other companies are racing to create technology that enables drones to safely fly over long distances to do everything from inspections of remote pipelines to surveys of crops or delivery of packages  The U S  Federal Aviation Administration recently proposed regulations that largely ban unmanned aircraft systems from many of those tasks by requiring that remote pilots keep the drones in sight  This is giving foreign companies the chance to leap ahead of the U S  in figuring out how to best exploit drone technology  But the National Aeronautics and Space Administration  NASA  is working with Exelis and other companies  universities and government agencies  to develop an air traffic management system that could persuade the FAA to allow flights beyond the line of sight  provided the operator is using such a tracking system  Exelis  products  called Symphony UAS Vue and RangeVue  are significant because Exelis has a head start on competitors  It has the exclusive right to use a data feed it already supplies the FAA to track manned aircraft  using 650 ground stations  It will augment the feed with lower altitude data that pinpoint drone locations  says Exelis  which is being taken over by communications company Harris Corp  N HRS  in a  4 75 billion deal   For any drone that needs to go beyond line of sight  this is a potential solution   Edward Sayadian  vice president of civil aerospace systems at Exelis  told Reuters  Exelis said it plans to announce the products this month and make RangeVue available this summer at some of the six sites the FAA has set up to test drones  The company developed the system quickly in the last six months  and hasn t yet set prices   For graphic click here  While Exelis sees potential markets overseas  it is focused initially on the U S   where it can leverage its ground stations and FAA feed  It also wants to be part of whatever overall system the FAA adopts after NASA finishes work on the prototype in three to five years  In the meantime  Exelis said it plans to market its UAS Vue and RangeVue directly to companies that want to operate drones commercially in the U S       SAFETY FEARS NASA and the industry face steep challenges overcoming fears of thousands of drones crisscrossing the skies  crashing into planes and people  A Reuters Ipsos online poll recently found 73 percent of U S  respondents want drone regulations  When drones are in the same airspace as airliners   I need to be able to see them on my display just like I see a 747   said Capt  Tim Canoll  president of the Air Line Pilots Association International  the world s largest union for pilots  Canoll and aviation safety experts also worry about latency  the lag time as control commands are transmitted to drones  and what happens when the control link is lost and the drone is out of control  Other companies also are addressing drone safety  San Francisco based startup DroneDeploy  for example  has a system that automatically checks the drone s battery life  surrounding terrain  weather and other parameters and prevents flight if there s a problem  NoFlyZone org  based in El Segundo  California  is building a database to keep drones away from private residences and other properties  Airware  based in San Francisco  is building an operating system for commercial drones that works with a variety of aircraft  cameras and other tools  Sagetech  of White Salmon  Washington  is making transponders for drones so that they can send location data to a system like the one Exelis has built  Amazon com Inc  O AMZN  is developing its own technology for drone package delivery  known as Prime Air  but says it sees the importance of a drone traffic management system and is working with NASA on the prototype   We won t launch Prime Air until we are able to demonstrate safe operations   said Gur Kimchi  vice president of Amazon Prime Air  NASA has decades of experience with air traffic management research and development  and plans multiple  builds  of the prototype unmanned aircraft traffic management  UTM  system  NASA s system will provide services such as airspace configuration  weather and wind data  strategic flows of drones  sequencing  separation management between drones and contingency support  said Parimal Kopardekar  the NASA principal investigator of the project at the Ames Research Center in Silicon Valley   It also will allow  geo fences  to be placed around airports and other sensitive areas such as the White House  where a small quad copter breached a security perimeter and crash landed in January   MOVING MAP Exelis  drone tracker will show terrain  weather and airspace boundaries in real time  The system can be called up on tablets and laptops  and can send emails and text message alerts if a drone is in a danger area   It s like the moving map that you have on the GPS in your car   Exelis  Sayadian said   Exelis also is creating portable relay stations that can be set up in the field to extend the range a drone can fly away from the pilot  It plans to test them on the trans Alaska oil pipeline this year  Though NASA is working with Exelis  it said other communications companies also could provide drone tracking in the final system  The system that is ultimately adopted could be operated and maintained by federal  state or local governments   or by

120536,342051,LHX,Buy These 5 Low Leverage Stocks If You Want To Avoid Risk,opinion,Leverage is a well known business strategy of using borrowed funds to finance the purchase of inventory  equipment as well as other company assets  These funds can also be utilized to pay back the company s prior debt  Companies can obtain such funds either using debt or equity Statistically  companies prefer debt over equity  This is because debt is easily available and cheaper than equity financing  Moreover  in case of debt financing  notwithstanding whether the interest charges are from a loan or line of credit  the interest payments are tax deductible  However  in case of equity financing  a shareholder not only becomes a partial owner of the company but develops a direct claim on the company s future profits as well Yet  debt financing has its share of drawbacks  The problem arises when leverage  referred to as the amount of debt a company bears  becomes exorbitant  A high degree of financial leverage means high interest payments  which affect a company s bottom line Since a debt free corporation is almost impossible to find  choosing a less debt ridden stock should be an appropriate option for a risk averse investor   And here comes the importance of leverage ratios  which can measure the exact amount of debt risk a company bears  Debt to equity ratio is one such measure  perhaps the most popular one  to evaluate a company s creditworthiness for potential equity investments Analyzing Debt EquityDebt to Equity Ratio   Total Liabilities Shareholders  EquityThis metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears  A company with a lower debt to equity ratio shows improved solvency for a company Investors must be looking for stocks exhibiting solid earnings growth in the last couple of quarters  However  blindly investing in stocks displaying solid earnings growth  without considering their debt level  is not a wise move The Winning StrategyConsidering the aforementioned factors  it is prudent to choose stocks with a low debt to equity ratio to ensure steady returns However  an investment strategy based solely on the debt to equity ratio might not fetch the desired outcome  To choose stocks that have the potential to give you steady returns  we have expanded our screening criteria to include some other factors Here are the other parameters Debt Equity less than X Industry Median  Stocks that are less leveraged than their industry peers Current Price greater than or equal to 10  The stocks must be trading at a minimum of  10 or above Average 20 day Volume greater than or equal to 50000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable Percentage Change in EPS F 0  F  1  greater than X Industry Median  Earnings growth adds to optimism  leading to a stock s price appreciation Score of A or B  Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  offer the best upside potential Estimated One Year EPS Growth F 1  F 0  greater than 5  This shows earnings growth expectation Zacks Rank  1 or 2   Irrespective of market conditions  stocks with a Zacks Rank  1 have a proven history of success Excluding stocks that have a negative or a zero debt to equity ratio  here are five of the 54 stocks that made it through the screen Federal Signal Corporation   NYSE FSS    The company provides infrastructure maintenance equipment and public safety tools   It delivered average positive earnings surprise of 16 48  in the

120586,342101,LHX,Telecom Stock Roundup  AT T Wins Spectrum Licenses  Nokia s Deal   More,opinion,In the past five trading days  telecom stocks traded relatively flat for the most of the week to end in a surge  as President Trump and his Chinese counterpart showed intention to resume bilateral trade talks as early as next week  Before the state heads meet on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Osaka  Japan  high level officials are likely to set the ball rolling to pull bilateral ties away from brinkmanship that has dragged relations to its nadir The telecom industry has bore the brunt of the tariff war with various trade restrictions affecting the supply chain mechanism and risking the sustainability of businesses  While several U S  firms have appealed to the government to ease the trade embargoes  the global telecom industry has showed signs of massive disruption  The story is somewhat similar on the other side as well  with China telecom sector recording slower revenue growth as it continues to feel the pinch The trade negotiations between the two warring countries will aim to resolve these issues  In addition  experts widely view the change of stance as a possible ploy by Trump to get wind in the sail of his re election campaign  However  he was quick to point out that the deal  if any  would be  fair deal  to both the countries  China s foreign ministry also remained optimistic about the resumption of the bilateral talks  but maintained that discussions must be on  equal basis  The tense undercurrents were further amplified when China s leading smartphone manufacturer Huawei announced that its overseas sales plunged about 40  as a fallout of the U S  tariffs and trade sanctions by various European firms  The company aims to reduce its annual production by  30 billion over the next two years to tide over the storm  In a likely counter attack  Huawei intends to utilize its 56 492 patents on telecommunications  networking and other hi tech inventions worldwide to gain leverage on U S  firms and demand patent settlements to the tune of  1 billion  The technology warfare between the two nations  with Huawei at the centerstage  took a fresh turn when U S  Senator Marco Rubio filed a legislation to prevent such an eventuality and negated the threat with the amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act It remains to be seen how the bilateral negotiations pan out in the future and eliminate the various stumbling blocks that threaten to derail the global economy with an element of uncertainty   Regarding company specific news  spectrum

completion of the latest round of telecom spectrum auction by the Federal Communications Commission   FCC Auction 102   AT T Inc    NYSE T   has emerged as the leading bidder among all participants

won 24 GHz spectrum in 383 Partial Economic Areas for a nationwide average of 254 MHz  Bulk of the license wins were secured in the upper 500 MHz portion of the 24 GHz band  which will enable the company to command a strong nationwide coverage with solid spectrum depth and capacity in several top markets where demand is often the greatest  Notably  AT T has won nearly 286 MHz of broadband spectrum on average in the top 10 markets   Read more   2     Nokia  HE NOKIA  Corporation   NYSE NOK   has inked an agreement with utility firm   Cleco Holdings   to modernize the latter s microwave

120621,342136,LHX,Harris  HRS  Hits 52 Week High  Can The Run Continue ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Harris  HRS   Shares have been on the move with the stock up 8 7  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  194 59 in the previous session  Harris has gained 42 7  since the start of the year compared to the 12 1  move for the Zacks Computer and Technology sector and the 16 4  return for the Zacks Wireless Equipment industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on May 1  2019  Harris reported EPS of  2 11 versus consensus estimate of  2 04 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 1 47  
For the current fiscal year  Harris is expected to post earnings of  8 15 per share on  6 74 billion in revenues  This represents a 25 38  change in EPS on a 9 04  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  9 01 per share on  7 22 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 10 55  and 7 18   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Harris may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Harris has a Value Score of C  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are A and D  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of B 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 23 6X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 21 8X versus its peer group s average of 16 1X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 2 95  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank

120646,342161,LHX,Telecom Stock Roundup  Qualcomm s Bypass Plans  T Mobile s Merger Efforts   More,opinion,In the past five trading days  telecom stocks witnessed a gradual uptrend despite tense undercurrents related to the tariff war  With the Trump administration temporarily easing some trade restrictions on Chinese smartphone manufacturer Huawei  the industry appeared to be on   firm footing and remained well poised to minimize any potential supply chain disruption  As the tariff war virtually leads to intense technology warfare between the two superpowers of the global economy  the industry is likely to get polarized into two distinct halves  with the U S  firms apparently holding a slight advantage due to their technological supremacy Last week  Trump had signed an executive order to declare national emergency that effectively barred U S  firms from either buying or selling any telecom equipment to firms like Huawei that are deemed to pose national security risks  The directive invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act  which bestowed the President with the authority to regulate commerce in view of the national emergency that threatened the country  The U S  Commerce Department immediately added Huawei along with 70 of its affiliates to the Entity List   a list of entities that are ineligible to receive any item without the government approval However  the government later offered a 90 day window till August 2019 to Huawei to enable it purchase components from U S  suppliers to fulfill its commitments for existing products  The temporary relief is primarily intended to aid U S  telecom service providers  which rely on Huawei equipment  to chalk out alternate arrangements and avoid any market disruption  Estimates reveal that out of  70 billion spent by Huawei in 2018  U S  firms reportedly received  11 billion  The current restrictions will  however  remain in force for any new and upcoming products from the stable of the Chinese firm Responding to such stringent actions and in order comply with the U S  government sanctions to prevent alienation  several European firms are following suit and are either suspending their deals or cancelling pre orders  Carriers in South East Asian countries in Japan and Taiwan have also shelved future orders for new smartphone models from Huawei  This could jeopardize 5G rollout schedules in various countries as it would involve getting rid of cheaper Huawei networking equipment and build newer ones from scratch  Meanwhile  the U S  lawmakers have introduced a bill to provide up to  700 million to the telecom carriers  particularly in rural areas  to replace such equipment that are deemed a security risk Regarding company specific news  efforts to bypass trade ban  merger

major themes in the industry      With the emergence of the smartphone market and subsequent usage of mobile broadband  user demand for coverage speed and quality has increased manifold  This has resulted in growing need for advanced networking architecture  in turn  leading service providers to spend more on routers and switches  Hence  these companies are likely to benefit from the higher spending pattern among carriers to upgrade their networks to support the incremental growth in data traffic  Further  to maintain superior performance as traffic increases  there is also a continuous need for network tuning and optimization  creating a demand for state of the art wireless products and services  At the same time  the industry participants focus on leveraging expanding media

latest report by the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association  which represents the U S  wireless communications industry  both the United States and China are currently on equal footing for 5G readiness  This represents a marked improvement from 2018 when the United States was trailing way behind China and South Korea  This was reportedly made possible through continued investments from the industry and a prod from the top policymakers to update networks faster  With a holistic top down approach  the United States was able to expedite the process to set up the required infrastructure and back it up with testing and launching of early networks in key locations  5G is billed as the technology of the future with faster download speed and seamless transfer of data  Leveraging state of the art communication network architectures  5G is touted to be the primary catalyst for next generation IoT services  These include connected cars  augmented reality and virtual reality platform  smart cities and connected devices that will revolutionize key industry verticals  Moreover  5G is likely to augment the scalability  security and universal mobility of the telecommunications industry

120675,342190,LHX,Harris  HRS  Hits Fresh High  Is There Still Room To Run ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Harris  HRS   Shares have been on the move with the stock up 10  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  183 12 in the previous session  Harris has gained 34 9  since the start of the year compared to the 19 5  move for the Zacks Computer and Technology sector and the 25 7  return for the Zacks Wireless Equipment industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on May 1  2019  Harris reported EPS of  2 11 versus consensus estimate of  2 04 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 1 47  
For the current fiscal year  Harris is expected to post earnings of  8 07 per share on  6 73 billion in revenues  This represents a 24 31  change in EPS on an 8 94  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  9 per share on  7 21 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 11 47  and 7 01   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Harris may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Harris has a Value Score of C  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are A and F  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of B 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 22 5X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 20 6X versus its peer group s average of 17 2X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 2 81  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Harris currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Harris fits the bill  Thus  it seems as though Harris shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term ",2019-05-12,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/harris-hrs-hits-fresh-high-is-there-still-room-to-run-200420768,200420768

120704,342219,LHX,Telecom Stock Roundup  Harris  Corning Trump Earnings Estimates   More,opinion,In the past five trading days  telecom stocks witnessed an uptrend after an initial decline as more industry participants reported earnings  However  the sector lost some of the gains at the later stages of the week as the industry remained mired in uncertainty regarding the probable merger of T Mobile US Inc    NYSE S   and Sprint Corporation   NYSE S    The firms have extended the deadline for the merger to Jul 29  2019  by which they need to convince both the U S  Federal Communications Commission and the Justice Department to give a nod against anti competitive and anti trust issues Meanwhile  the overall earnings season has unfolded on a relatively promising note  with better than expected performance by most sectors dispelling widespread recessionary fears  However  the Technology sector  of which the Telecom stocks are part  has recorded a sedate start to the earnings season  and is on track to record one of the softest performances in recent years  Taking the broader picture in count  the industry appears to be still grappling with the aftereffects of the trade war and higher investments for technology and infrastructure upgrade for 5G deployments   On the other hand  uncertainty regarding U S  China trade negotiations remained another stumbling block  as the nine month old trade war that disrupted supply chains and weighed on the world economy is yet to be fully resolved  Although both the warring countries have agreed upon the enforcement mechanisms  the finer details are reportedly still under deliberations  As the industry awaits an early resolution to the prolonged bilateral talks to better focus on the impending 5G boom  efforts are on to give a final push to a mutually acceptable trade deal by May end that is easily enforceable Regarding company specific news  quarterly earnings primarily took the center stage over the past five trading days

million or 82 cents per share in the year ago quarter  The bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 35 cents  Quarterly net sales increased 38 4  year over year to  758 8 million  attributable

For HRS  shares are up 0 48  over the past week while the Zacks Wireless Equipment industry is down 0 69  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 9 53  compares favorably with the industry s 1 19  performance as well 
While any stock can see a spike in price  it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market  Over the past quarter  shares of Harris have risen 12 93   and are up 20 69  in the last year  On the other hand  the S P 500 has only moved 8 35  and 12 86   respectively 
Investors should also take note of HRS s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  Right now  HRS is averaging 765 676 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook

Harris Corp    NYSE HRS    Corning Inc    NYSE GLW    NETGEAR  Inc    NASDAQ NTGR    Frontier Communications Corp    NASDAQ FTR   and Woodward  Inc    NASDAQ WWD   Here are highlights from Thursday s Analyst Blog  Telecom Stock Roundup  Harris  Corning   MoreIn the past five trading days  telecom stocks witnessed an uptrend after an initial decline as more industry participants reported earnings  However  the sector lost some of the gains at the later stages of the week as the industry remained mired in uncertainty regarding the probable merger of T Mobile US and Sprint Corp  The firms have extended the deadline for the merger to Jul 29  2019  by which they need to convince both the U S  Federal Communications Commission and the Justice Department to give a nod against anti competitive and anti trust issues Meanwhile  the overall earnings season has unfolded on a relatively promising note  with better than expected performance by most sectors dispelling widespread recessionary fears  However  the Technology sector  of which the Telecom stocks are part  has recorded a sedate start to the earnings season  and is on track to record one of the softest performances in recent years  Taking the broader picture in count  the industry appears to be still grappling with the aftereffects of the trade war and higher investments for technology and infrastructure upgrade for 5G deployments   On the other hand  uncertainty regarding U S  China trade negotiations remained another stumbling block  as the nine month old trade war that disrupted supply chains and weighed on the world economy is yet to be fully resolved  Although both the warring countries have agreed upon the enforcement mechanisms  the finer details are reportedly still under deliberations  As the industry awaits an early resolution to the prolonged bilateral talks to better focus on the impending 5G boom  efforts are on to give a final push to a mutually acceptable trade deal by May end that is easily enforceable Regarding company specific news  quarterly earnings primarily took the center stage over the past five trading days Recap of the Week s Most Important Stories1     Harris Corp  reported

120734,342249,LHX,Telecom Stock Roundup  AT T Launches 5G  Verizon s Streaming Focus   More,opinion,In the past five trading days  telecom stocks witnessed a roller coaster ride as the initial uptrend was followed by a sharp downtrend as optimism on 5G launch eroded with the apprehension of a muted earnings season  Several micro factors further compounded the market anarchy and the industry apparently failed to make any noticeable headway over the past week Per the latest report by the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association  which represents the U S  wireless communications industry  both the United States and China are currently on equal footing for 5G readiness  This was made possible through continued investments from the industry and a prod from the top policymakers to update networks faster  With a holistic top down approach  the United States was able to expedite the process to set up the required infrastructure and back it up with testing and launching of early networks in key locations  The marked an improvement from last year  when the United States was trailing way behind China and South Korea in the 5G race  probably spurred an uptrend for the telecom stocks in general However  as focus shifted to corporate earnings and declining estimates  the stocks witnessed a volte face and nullified the earlier gains  Earnings growth projections for the first quarter of 2019 and for the second quarter are currently hovering in the negative territory  fuelling speculations of an impending recession  Although an economic downturn is likely to occur as part of a boom and bust cycle  given the fact that we are in the midst of the longest ever bull market  recessionary fears seem a bit exaggerated  The decline in earnings estimates is largely due to unfair year over year comparisons with the respective quarters of 2018  when corporate tax cuts significantly boosted earnings  Nevertheless  broad based expectations of a soft earnings season seem to have dampened investor sentiments  triggering a downtrend On the other hand  uncertainty regarding U S  China trade negotiations persisted as the nine month old trade war that disrupted supply chains and weighed on the world economy is yet to be fully resolved  Although both the warring countries have agreed upon the enforcement mechanisms  the finer details are reportedly still under deliberations  As the industry awaits an early resolution to the prolonged bilateral talks to better focus on the impending 5G boom  efforts are on to give a final push to a mutually acceptable trade deal that is easily enforceable Among other developments  the bill introduced by the Democratic lawmakers in the House and Senate to reinstate the net neutrality rules that the Federal Communications Commission had repealed in 2017  passed the floor test in the House of Representatives with a resounding win of 232 190 in voting  Titled  Save the Internet Act   the bill aims to discourage blocking or throttling content and consider Internet access as a  utility  under Title II of the Communications Act  However  stiff resistance is apprehended in the Senate where Republicans hold the majority  Moreover  the bill is likely to be vetoed by Trump as he had been vocally skeptical of net neutrality in the past Regarding company specific news  5G launch  collaborations and strategic deals

120735,342250,LHX,Why Harris  HRS  Could Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  Harris  HRS   which belongs to the Zacks Wireless Equipment industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
This technology and communications company has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 3 66  
For the last reported quarter  Harris came out with earnings of  1 96 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 91 per share  representing a surprise of 2 62   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  1 70 per share and it actually produced earnings of  1 78 per share  delivering a surprise of 4 71  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Harris lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Harris currently has an Earnings ESP of  0 69   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on May 1  2019 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss

120736,342251,LHX,Harris  HRS  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Harris  HRS  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on May 1  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This technology and communications company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 04 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  22 2  
Revenues are expected to be  1 70 billion  up 8 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 23  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Harris 
For Harris  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 69  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Harris will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Harris would post earnings of  1 91 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 96  delivering a surprise of  2 62  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Harris doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/harris-hrs-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200410317,200410317

120893,342408,LHX,What Makes Harris  HRS  A Strong Momentum Stock  Buy Now ,opinion,"Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock s recent trend  which can be in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   And for investors following this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic  it can be tough to define  Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy  but the Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Harris  HRS   which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B  We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score  like price change and earnings estimate revisions 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Harris currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
Let s discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for HRS that show why this technology and communications company shows promise as a solid momentum pick 
Looking at a stock s short term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum  since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment  It s also helpful to compare a security to its industry  this can show investors the best companies in a particular area 
For HRS  shares are up 4 16  over the past week while the Zacks Wireless Equipment industry is up 0 54  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 16 78  compares favorably with the industry s 4 71  performance as well 
Considering longer term price metrics  like performance over the last three months or year  can be advantageous as well  Shares of Harris have increased 10 64  over the past quarter  and have gained 5 92  in the last year  In comparison  the S P 500 has only moved 1 12  and 5 31   respectively 
Investors should also take note of HRS s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  Right now  HRS is averaging 1 205 601 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions  in addition to price changes  Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well  A nice path here can help show promise  and we have recently been seeing that with HRS 
Over the past two months  4 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost HRS s consensus estimate  increasing from  7 86 to  7 98 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  3 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Given these factors  it shouldn t be surprising that HRS is a  2  Buy  stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B  If you re looking for a fresh pick that s set to soar in the near term  make sure to keep Harris on your short list ",2019-02-12,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/what-makes-harris-hrs-a-strong-momentum-stock-buy-now-200387330,200387330

uncertainty triggered by trade related headwinds in the aftermath of China U S  row over Huawei  Although the end of the federal government shutdown after a record 35 days seemed to ease the concerns related to the availability of funds for the speedy deployment of 5G technologies  bilateral trade woes with China continued to haunt the sector  This even overshadowed the earnings season  which was quite a dampener compared with the past few quarters The U S  Justice Department has charged two units of China s Huawei Technologies Co Ltd with a 10 count indictment  accusing them of stealing robotic technology from T Mobile to test smartphones  durability  The court has further arraigned Huawei Device Co Ltd and Huawei Device USA Inc on Feb 28 to stand trial for the charges  The latest indictment traces its roots to a civil suit filed by T Mobile in Seattle District Court in 2014  in which it accused Huawei of stealing trade secrets at the behest of R D team based in China  Although the case was settled with a  4 8 million compensation award to T Mobile in 2017  it seems that the Trump administration will leave no stone unturned to ban China s Huawei and ZTE  HK 0763  from the country Additionally  the federal prosecutors have also issued a 13 point indictment against Huawei for allegedly deceiving international banks into clearing transactions  worth millions of dollars  with Iran despite economic sanctions  However  no arraignment date has been put forth for it  Meanwhile  the Trump administration continued to put pressure on China by formally seeking the extradition of Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou from Canada  Notably  Canada now has time till Mar 1 to assess the request To make matters worse  the government is supposedly preparing an executive order that could give sweeping powers to the Commerce Department to review imported products by domestic firms and ban the outright sale of such equipment on grounds of national security interests  Industry observers feel that it could ultimately serve as a knell to some Chinese telecom firms and make it virtually impossible for them to operate in the U S  shores if the bill is passed by the President Despite the conundrums  both the United States and China have continued with their trade negotiations to seek a long term solution to the trade war  The bilateral trade talks between U S  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Chinese Vice Premier Liu have failed to come up with any notable solution after the first round  It remains to be seen if at all a breakthrough could be achieved in the

120947,342462,LHX,Top Research Reports For Union Pacific  AbbVie   General Dynamics,opinion,"Thursday  January 31  2019
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Union Pacific  UNP   AbbVie  ABBV  and General Dynamics  GD   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Buy ranked Union Pacific s shares have outperformed the Zacks Rail industry   20 4  vs   12   in the past year  Union Pacific reported better than expected earnings per share and revenues in the fourth quarter of 2018  Both the metrics also increased year over year  Higher freight revenues on the back of volume growth aided top line growth  
For 2019  the company anticipates volumes to increase in the low single digit range  The Zacks analyst thinks Union Pacific s efforts to reward its shareholders are encouraging  Notably  the company has hiked dividends thrice since November 2017 
Improvement in operating ratio and low tax rates are added positives  Its efforts to promote safety are noteworthy as well  However  high debt levels and operating expenses are concerns  Escalated capital expenditures are contributing to rise in costs 
 You can   
Shares of AbbVie have lost  29 6  in the past year  underperforming the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry s decline of  1 2   AbbVie missed estimates for earnings and sales in the fourth quarter  The Zacks analyst thinks AbbVie s key drug  Humira has been performing well in the United States based on strong demand trends despite new competition  
Moreover  Imbruvica has multibillion dollar potential  Mavyret saw a stronger than expected launch and has become a significant contributor to sales  AbbVie has also been successful in expanding approvals for its cancer drugs  Imbruvica and Venclexta  
AbbVie has an impressive late stage pipeline comprising several products with multibillion dollar potential expected to be launched in the near term  Sales erosion due to direct biosimilar competition to Humira in international markets will be a big headwind in 2019  Also costs to support expected new product line extension launches are likely to hurt profits in 2019 
 You can   
General Dynamics  shares have lost  23 2  in the past year  underperforming the Zacks Aerospace   Defense industry s decrease of  6 3   General Dynamics ended fourth quarter 2018 with both earnings and revenues surpassing expectations  
The Zacks analyst thinks the company enjoys solid demand for its varied defense products leading to organic growth  whereas a notable acquisition strategy adds to inorganic growth  The company is on track to achieve FAA type certification for its G600 aircraft later this year  which is expected to enter service in 2019  
These new jets are likely to be significantly accretive in terms of revenues as well as earnings for the company  once they become available to global customers  Moreover  a comparative analysis of the company s historical EV EBITDA ratio reflects a relatively gloomy picture that might be a cause for investors  concern

121034,342549,LHX,Qualcomm Rejects Renewed NXP Bid Offer On Trade War Truce,opinion,As President Trump reached a 90 day trade war truce with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping  the latter offered an olive branch by indicating that QUALCOMM Incorporated s   NASDAQ QCOM    44 billion deal to acquire NXP Semiconductors N V    NASDAQ NXPI   could be considered for approval if it is resubmitted  A Reuters report  however  claimed that although Qualcomm appreciated the renewed offer as a positive development for U S  firms  it would rather not contemplate rebidding and would prefer moving ahead than considering an already closed chapter Qualcomm aimed to acquire NXP to diversify its revenue stream and staked a claim in October 2016 with an initial offer price of  38 billion  While Qualcomm primarily relies on chip sales to mobile phone manufacturers that is fast becoming a saturated market  NXP has considerable presence in the budding market for automotive chips  Therefore  the acquisition of NXP would have enabled Qualcomm to diversify into highly lucrative end markets such as auto  secured devices  connectivity and secure payments  offering high margin businesses with strong potential for growth However  NXP shareholders rejected the bid in favor of a better price  forcing Qualcomm to offer a higher bid of  44 billion in February 2018  Thereafter  the deal was stuck in red tape as the U S  firm received approvals from eight of the nine global regulators  China being the only nation opposing the buyout on antitrust concerns The approval was put on hold by China s Ministry of Commerce as a bargaining tool to seek more concessions from the United States after the two nations were engaged in a bitter trade war  Moreover  the regulators had to contend with domestic chip companies  which raised objections to the deal arguing that it was a potent threat to their survival   The issue further spiraled into a full fledged conflict when the U S  government banned sale of components by American firms to the China based telecom equipment maker  ZTE Corp  HK 0763   Although  the Trump administration later eased some of the restrictions on ZTE  Qualcomm did not receive the go ahead for the acquisition from China within July 2018  Consequently  Qualcomm was forced to abort the deal and paid a termination fee of  2 billion to NXP Since then  both the companies seem to have moved on  pursuing respective stock buyback programs to reward shareholders with risk adjusted returns  While Qualcomm has embarked on a  30 billion stock repurchase plan  spending about  22 6 billion till September 2018 using cash reserves kept for the deal  NXP has announced its own  5 billion share buyback program The revamped dynamics perhaps leave no room for the companies to revert their course and fulfill the stalled deal  The reported comments from a Qualcomm executive further endorse this viewpoint and President Xi s offer seems to have fallen flat Qualcomm currently sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   Other top ranked stocks in the same space include Juniper Networks  Inc    NYSE JNPR   and Harris Corporation   NYSE HRS    both carrying a Zacks Rank of 2  Buy   You can see  Juniper Networks surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters  the average positive earnings surprise being 11  Harris outpaced estimates in each of the preceding four quarters  the average earnings surprise being 7 1  Wall Street s Next Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time  It s a once in a generation opportunity to invest in pure genius ,2018-12-03,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/qualcomm-rejects-renewed-nxp-bid-offer-on-trade-war-truce-200364443,200364443

Cylance s highly skilled cybersecurity workforce and market leading portfolio of endpoint solutions are a strategic fit for Blackberry  TO BB  and will complement its Unified Endpoint Management and QNX businesses  The company further expects that the addition of Cylance will enhance the cybersecurity capabilities of Blackberry Spark  making it an indispensible proposition for Enterprise of Things  EoT   While BlackBerry Spark offers secure chip to edge communications platform for EoT to create trusted connections between any endpoint  QNX empowers leading original equipment manufacturers to build secure  scalable and trusted software solutions for connected and autonomous cars Operating as a leading player in the enterprise mobility management  BlackBerry is widely recognized for productivity and security innovations  The company delivers one of the most secure end to end mobile enterprise solutions in the market through a broad portfolio of products and

fiscal 2019 GAAP revenues decreased 11 8  year over year to  210 million due to lower revenues from Service access fees and Handheld devices  Moreover  legal issues like the payment dispute with Nokia  HE NOKIA  Corporation   NYSE NOK   have hit its long term credibility High technological obsolescence also remains a significant challenge for the company  increasing its operating costs for continuous R D efforts for frequent new product introductions to fend off competition  Moreover  with increasing global exposure  BlackBerry faces the risk of adverse foreign exchange fluctuations

replaced by a gradual decline  This was primarily led by investors  apprehension about the resumption of a bitter high tech Cold War with China that was apparently on pause As President Trump offered a 90 day truce to his Chinese counterpart on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Argentina  telecom stocks inched up on expectations of fruitful negotiations related to the tariff war  However  the stock euphoria soon sizzled out on news that Meng Wanzhou  the chief financial officer of Huawei  was arrested in Canada and faced probable extradition to the United States over potential violations of sanctions on Iran  Serving as the deputy chairwoman of the management board  Meng is the daughter of the founder of Huawei  the leading telecom manufacturer in China  Consequently  the detention and eventual arrest of such a high profile business tycoon rattled the markets and put the political environment on high alert Time and again  the U S  administration has asked federal agencies to abstain from using China s ZTE  HK 0763  and Huawei products over perceived risk of espionage  The Pentagon has also banned the sale of smartphones from these manufacturers from all military establishments  The U S  officials had even reached out to allied countries to persuade them from refraining to use Huawei telecom equipment  accusing it of sophisticated and intensified cyberattacks to siphon off data for possible collection and analysis Although the underlying issue is cited to be related to national security concerns  the bone of contention perhaps stems from an innate desire

121074,342589,LHX,Telecom Stock Roundup  Nokia  NETGEAR  Sprint Report Earnings   More,opinion,In the past five trading days  telecom stocks experienced a downtrend for the bulk of the week and mirrored the broader S P 500 Index  albeit with a relatively below par performance  Broader sell off  apprehension of a Fed hike in the imminent future and global macroeconomic woes seem to be the primary reasons for the decline as healthy corporate earnings failed to soothe investor nerves  In addition  the unrelenting trade war tensions with China appear to dent the long term profitability of the telecom firms To add to the woes  the U S  Commerce Department has issued a restraining order for domestic firms to stop selling key software and technology to China provincial government owned Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit Co   citing national security threats  The trade restrictions  similar to the one imposed earlier on ZTE  HK 0763   is likely to harm the already strained ties between Washington and Beijing due to the ongoing trade war  The strategic move is further likely to affect the revenue generating model of the U S  telecom companies as China reportedly buys more computer chips than any other country in the world   The telecom industry  however  had something to cheer about in the past week when the Trump administration announced that the federal government is likely to issue the  national spectrum strategy  by next summer to funnel unused airwaves to the private sector  Federal agencies are likely to assess the quantum of spectrum required to fulfill missions of national interests in the near future and share the remainder with cellphone carriers  technology companies and other emerging industries  The endeavor is likely to encourage higher deployment of 5G

Melita will leverage Ericsson s flagship solution  the Ericsson Radio System  ERS   Ericsson will also help modernize and expand the virtual Evolved Packet Core  These features will offer Melita the flexibility required to meet the expanding demand for new 5G and IoT use cases 
Earlier this week  Ericsson joined forces with Vertiv and NorthStar to drive cost effective and sustainable network evolution toward 5G  within the Ericsson Radio Site System  The partnership will merge Vertiv s faculties in power  thermal and infrastructure site management solutions with NorthStar s leadership in battery as well as energy storage solutions and incorporate it into the Ericsson Radio Site System 
ERS leverages a multi standard  multi band and multi layer architecture to help mobile operators transform their radio networks  The system delivers industry leading performance on the smallest site footprint with the least energy consumption 
ERS supports 5G New Radio capability and enables quick and smooth migration to 5G in existing bands  in addition to rapid coverage expansion of such services for operators 
In spite of solid offerings  Ericsson is witnessing negative industry trends and adverse business mix in mobile broadband  Particularly  uncertainty in the financial markets  reduced consumer telecom spending and delayed auctions of spectrums pose significant threats for the company 
Operators have been cautious in making new investments  especially in the emerging markets  which has affected the company s revenues and profits  Further  Europe and Latin America   the markets with the biggest impact   are expected to witness an increasingly challenging investment environment 
Ericsson Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
   As far as earnings performance is concerned  Ericsson has had a dismal earnings surprise history over the trailing four quarters  missing estimates terribly all through  The company has lagged estimates by a whopping 552 5  on an average 
Ericsson s earnings estimates have moved south in the past couple of months  indicating analyst s bearish sentiment for the stock  For 2018  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings has been revised downward from 17 cents to 3 cents over the past 60 days  driven by three downward estimate revisions versus just one upward 
Over the past year  the company s shares have lost 1 6   underperforming the  s average gain of 5 9  

Nevertheless  Ericsson expects to stabilize its operations amid a difficult market in 2018  CEO Ekholm s restructuring plan will streamline the company s focus areas  improve profitability and revitalize its technology as well as market leadership 
It is to be seen whether these steps will help Ericsson to get back on the growth track  Right now  we are apprehensive over the impact of the restructuring and tough market conditions on the company s profits and share price in the near term 
We have a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  on the stock  at present  Investors who are looking for exposure to the upcoming 5G upgrade cycle or IoT might look at players like Nokia  HE NOKIA  Corp    NYSE NOK   and Cisco Systems  Inc    NASDAQ CSCO

121332,342847,LHX,5 Telecom Stock Set To Beat Estimates This Earnings Season,opinion,"The U S  telecommunications industry had a disappointing 2017  Cut throat pricing competition resulting in lower ARPU  average revenue per user  and margins  massive investment for upcoming 5G wireless network and fiber optic buildout resulting in low free cash flow and intense competitive pressure shifted investor s focus toward other growth oriented industries in an overall bull market in 2017 However  the situation has been showing signs of easing from fourth quarter 2017 as most of the major telecommunications stocks have done well since then  The momentum is likely to continue in 2018 albeit at a slow pace  Several positives have appeared for this industry in the last quarter of 2017 Major PositivesPresident Donald Trump s proposed policy changes have made the overall economic outlook fairly bullish  The two pro growth agendas of Trump  namely  significant cut in corporate tax and deregulation are major catalysts to the U S  economy   Trump has stated that he wants to do away with nearly 75  of all governmental regulations during his term as the President  We believe that the telecom industry will be one of the major beneficiaries of this policy change On Dec 14  2017  in a landmark decision  the U S  telecom regulator Federal Communications Commission  FCC  repealed the Net Neutrality laws that it had imposed under the Obama regime  There is little doubt that the ISP industry will be the major beneficiary after FCC dismantling Net Neutrality  The current FCC s less restrictive regulatory attitude may also pave the way for new merger and acquisition deals between ISPs and online digital media companies The proposal to reduce corporate tax rate from 35  to 20  faced by telecom carriers would be immediately accretive to cash flow  Trump s tax proposal will result in a huge windfall for telecom operators  The carriers can utilize this money for 5G network R D and its deployment   The telecom industry is highly capital intensive in nature  Therefore  the immediate expensing of investment in all tangible  intangible and real property  other than land  would significantly benefit telecom carriers  This would encourage telecom operators to increase investment for capital expenditure  Major proposals such as a pledge to spend  1 trillion in infrastructure projects over a period of 10 years coupled with the above mentioned policy changes are likely to spur higher consumer spending Performance So FarPer the latest  report  only 53 S P 500 members have reported fourth quarter earnings results as of Jan 19  Total earnings for these companies are up 11 7  from the same period last year on 7 5  higher revenues  with 81 1  beating EPS estimates and 75 5  beating revenue estimates  The proportion of companies beating both EPS and revenue estimates is 62 3  The Q4 earnings season is on track and is expected to be very good  Four important points can be inferred from the results thus far  First  the  11 7  earnings growth for the 53 index members compares is about the same as the  11 9  growth in Q3 and modestly below the 4 quarter average of  12 8   Second  the  7 5  revenue growth for these 53 index members represents a notable acceleration in growth momentum  Third  the 81 1  proportion of the companies beating EPS estimates in Q4 is the highest we have seen from these 53 index members in other recent periods  Fourth  the 75 5  of the companies beating revenues is similarly the highest we have seen from this group of companies in recent periods   Read More

Momentum to Continue in 2018
A growing economy speeds up the demand for real time voice  data  and video manifold  The escalation in demand has encouraged telecom service providers to undertake large network extensions while upgrading plans  The rising demand for technologically superior products has been a silver lining for the telecommunication industry in an otherwise tough environment  This in turn has given a boost to the demand for telecom equipment manufacturers 
Additionally  a major characteristic of the telecommunications industry is that it is immune to international geo political disturbances even when these lead to economic fluctuations  The need to remain connected is so very human  springing from our earliest tendencies to communicate with our fellow human beings  An era of digitization and technology is essentially built on this human craving  It is here that telecommunications come to the fore as a necessary utility  Consequently  any non U S  economic volatility is not expected to have an immediate effect on the industry 
Furthermore  President Donald Trump s proposed policy changes have made the overall economic outlook fairly bullish  Major proposals such as a pledge to spend  1 trillion in infrastructure projects over a period of 10 years  overhaul of the tax structure to reduce tax burden and easy regulatory policies  are likely to spur higher consumer spending that may create about 25 million new jobs over a decade  This in turn will fuel long term economic growth 
A Close Watch on Net Neutrality
On August 2017  the FCC closed the window for comments and replies after receiving 22 million comments on Net Neutrality rules  The regulatory body will examine these suggestions before taking a final call  Notably  in May 2017  the FCC voted 2 1 to start the formal process of unwinding the Net Neutrality rules 
In January 2017  Trump elected existing Republican commissioner Ajit Pai as the new Chairman of the U S  FCC  Appointment of Pai as the head of the regulatory body appears to have put Net Neutrality back on the front burner as he is a staunch Net Neutrality opponent 
Trump himself is a strong critic of Net Neutrality  There is little doubt that if the FCC scraps Net Neutrality laws either fully or partially  the ISP industry will be the major beneficiary

121491,343006,LHX,My Favorite Stock For May,opinion,"We now know what it takes to truly  earn  the title of president of the United States 
It s not something that takes a stroke of a pen    It s not an idea born in the halls of Congress    And it s not a well rehearsed line in a prime time speech 
No  What it takes to truly become America s president requires little more than a nod in the middle of the night 
As Trump gave his signal to the USS Porter last week  unleashing a torrent of 59 cruise missiles on Syria  in the eyes of many  he finally became President Trump 
 I think Donald Trump became president of the United States   said CNN s Fareed Zakaria  It cements the mainstream press  belief that all that other  little  stuff a president does   like tax policy or trade negotiations   is boring and unworthy of our attention 
It s launching bombs   and big bombs in Afghanistan  apparently   that makes a man worthy of the Oval Office 
An editorial in China s Global Times adds a worldly view to the idea 
 If Pyongyang conducts its sixth nuclear test in the near future   the author wrote   the possibility of U S  military action against it will be higher than ever  Not only is Washington brimming with confidence and arrogance following the missile attacks on Syria  but Trump is also willing to be regarded as a man who honors his promises  
It s war that the world respects 
So it s war the world will get 
There s a dirty little secret about war that no president wants to admit    but they ll gladly take advantage of it 
The truth is  no wartime president has ever been defeated in a re election 
In fact  depending on your definition  the only American president to never declare war was Jimmy Carter    a lukewarm leader who served just one term 
Clearly  Trump will declare war  His ego demands it 
It s an idea investors must pay attention to 
It means we must invest wisely 
A president who s ready to fight is great news for one of my favorite stocks 
If you ve been paying attention  you know I recently unleashed a passion project aimed at leading men to fulfilled  successful lives  It s entirely separate from Investment U or The Oxford Club 
It s called Manward Press 
And it s been wildly successful   much more so than I ever imagined 
Part of the success   I argue   is that I ve been sending all new readers a report I wrote late last year  It details three stocks every man  or woman  must own 
All three stocks are loaded with potential    but one may be the perfect stock for the Trump administration 
It s Harris Corporation  NYSE  NYSE HRS  
Its chart from the last year tells the tale   

If Trump launches more missiles  the action over the last 12 months will look sluggish  This stock will soar 
I expect it could more than double    starting in May 
That s because it s a key recipient of defense spending dollars 
But what s truly great about it is it s a stock that few folks have heard of  It s not like the big name defense stocks that everybody knows about 
Instead  it s mostly the folks who use the products   like I have   who know just how valuable the company is to a country with defense  or perhaps offense  on its mind 
Think of Harris as a quiet behind the scenes player in the defense sector  Like the companies that are minting millionaires by quietly supplying parts for the iPhone    Harris is getting rich supplying the world s big name defense contractors 
For example  we ve all heard about the billions of dollars being spent on the Pentagon s F 35 program  But few folks know that Harris has delivered more than 780 000 items for the program 
The company also supports our troops with communication gear  Its radio equipment is on the front lines sending classified maps  images and data across the airwaves 
But its lineup goes far beyond the Pentagon  Governments of every size in the U S  send checks   big checks   to the company each year  Police  fire and medical services all rely on Harris and its near monopoly within the realm ",2017-04-17,Investment U,https://www.investing.com/analysis/my-favorite-stock-for-may-200183069,200183069

The financial details of the deal have been kept under wraps  The transaction is not expected to have a material impact on ViaSat s non GAAP earnings for fiscal 2017 
ViaSat had a partnership with Arconics prior to the acquisition  which focused on catering to the wireless In flight Entertainment   IFE   needs of airline customers 
Arconics offers a connected aircraft software platform  which enables wireless IFE  Electronic Flight Bag   EFB    Airline Document Management and Cabin Management solutions  The platform helps communicate and share data with the aircraft and leverages on the available connectivity to connect with ground systems across avionics or mobile platforms 
Arconics  clients list spans five continents  and they depend on its software to operate their fleets safely and efficiently  Arconics s clients include Qatar Airways  Tigerair Australia  Ryanair  Cathay Pacific  Philippine Airlines  Aer Lingus and SpiceJet  among others 
The buyout will enable ViaSat to acquire aviation grade software  broader expertise and mobile applications  which will boost safety and efficiency of flying for pilots  cabin crews and flight operations teams  ViaSat will also gain access to entertainment applications and will be able to explore opening new service and revenue opportunities

Thus  adding Arconics  capabilities will position ViaSat as the market leader for connectivity  passenger services and flight deck applications and operations  and enable it to deliver end to end experiences across the aircraft value chain 
ViaSat s Commercial Air business is proving to be a key profit driver  strongly supplementing growth  Going forward  the company s expansion strategies  higher value service plans  and addition of other ancillary services look promising 
Additionally  ViaSat s in flight Internet services are already on a roll  having won lucrative contracts from leading commercial flights like Virgin America Inc    NASDAQ VA   and American Airlines Group Inc    NASDAQ AAL    This acquisition will add further momentum to the same and looks to be conducive to top line growth

ERICSSON LM ADR Price and Consensus
   Touted as the next generation of mobile technology  5G has achieved rapid momentum over the past year  5G networks have the capability to radically lessen latency  accelerate download and upload speeds  enhance network reliability and spectral efficiency  Also  they have the potential to support IoT development  by considerably escalating the number of devices that can connect to the network simultaneously 
According to a research by Ovum  global 5G subscriptions are projected to reach 24 million by 2021  with Asia Pacific having a 40  share and Europe accounting for 10  
Ericsson continues to aggressively drive progress in 5G technology and is involved in multiple engagements with different operators across the world  It has already signed significant 5G agreements with telecom biggies  like Vodafone  LON VOD  Group   NASDAQ VOD    Telefonica  MC TEF  and Qualcomm Inc    NASDAQ QCOM    to bank upon the commercialization of 5G technology 
We believe that strategic partnerships  dominant market share and favorable industry trends will aid the company to benefit significantly from the impending commercialization of the networks 
However  Ericsson is contending with stiff competition from Huawei Technologies Co  and Nokia  HE NOKIA  Corp  Slumping demand in Russia and Brazil  and accelerating negative industry trends have further compounded its problems 
Whether the growth and cost streamlining efforts of this Zacks Rank  4  Sell  company will help it beat industry wide demand blues  remains to be seen

121652,343167,LHX,Harris Corporation  a Negative Correction is Expected ,opinion,After   PBI   we would like to present a deterministic price model for a technology company from the S P 500 list   This time we present a company from technology category   Harris Corporation  NYSE  HRS  which     The model is a deterministic one since we decompose HRS share price into a weighted sum of two consumer price indices  both leading the price by several months  One cannot deny the fact that there exists an inherent trade off between shares of a given company and goods and services it produces provides  Therefore  one might assume the growth in a CPI related to HRS  e g  information technology  relative to some independent but dynamic reference consumer price  e g  food  should be manifested in a higher pricing power for the studied company  It so happened that both involved CPIs lead the share price  In other words  a HRS share price accommodates all changes in the overall price of information technology with a time lag of several months  Those who know that have a good statistical reason to beat the market All in all  our stock price model tries to find one defining CPI and the best reference CPI  Both CPIs are taken from a set of 92 different  not seasonally adjusted  CPIs and the best model has the smallest RMS error between July 2003 and February 2012  This set is not a complete one but includes the headline and core CPI  all major categories from food to other goods and services  and many minor subcategories with long enough history  i e  continuous estimates should be available since 2000   One can extend this set and might obtain a more robust model  We have borrowed the time series of monthly closing prices of HRS from Yahoo com  February 2012 is included  and the CPI estimates through January 2012 are published by the BLS   As mentioned above  the evolution of HRS share price is defined by the consumer price of the index of information technology  IT  and the index of food  F   The defining time lags are six and four months  respectively    The best fit model for is as follows   HRS t      2 76F t 4    10 39IT t 6     8 53 t 1990    553 00   February 2012 where HRS t  is the HRS share price in U S  dollars   t is calendar time  Figure 1 displays the evolution of both defining indices since 2002   In the empirical model  both indices have negative slopes and the IT index defines the growth of the price  Higher food prices suppress the level of HRS share price   Figure 2 depicts the high and low monthly prices for a HRS share together with the predicted and measured monthly closing prices  adjusted for dividends and splits   The predicted prices are well within the limits of the share price uncertainty   The model residual error is shown in Figure 3 with the standard deviation between July 2003 and January 2012 of  3 42   Due to the sensitive balance between the growth in food price and the fall in the IT index the share price has many peaks and troughs  Currently  this proportion between the growth rates of the F and IT indices has moved the predicted HRS price far from the observed one  Hence  we can not exclude that the actual price will fall by a few dollars by May 2012  A similar correction was observed in 2008  Figure 1  The evolution of defining indices Figure 2  Observed and predicted monthly closing prices for a HRS share  Figure 3  The model residual error  sterr  3 42 ,2012-03-11,Ivan Kitov,https://www.investing.com/analysis/harris-corporation:-a-negative-correction-is-expected-116583,116583

121654,343169,LHX,Shorts For The Taking,opinion,"These short setups are flying off the shelves 
So you ve gotta get them while they re hot  Hours before Tuesday s close  SPX had given up all of the day s gains and was trading at break even  Considering the fact that SPX sold off 40  points on Monday and that it has failed to hold a mild dead cat bounce tells you that the bears are pouncing at every chance they get 
I went ahead and added one additional short position Tuesday  but there are plenty of other short setups ripe for the picking in the list below  A couple of them that really stick out are Harris Corporation  NYSE HRS   which is starting to breakdown quite nicely on the daily chart  Others include  NYSE JNS    NYSE LVLT  and  NYSE ROK
