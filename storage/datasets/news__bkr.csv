Prepared Remarks 
OperatorGood day  ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Baker Hughes Company Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2019 Earnings Call  At this time  all participants are in a listen only mode  Later  we will conduct a question and answer session and instructions will follow at that time   Operator Instructions  As a reminder  this conference call is being recorded I would now like to introduce your host for today s conference  Mr  Jud Bailey  Vice President of Investor Relations  Sir  you may begin Judson Bailey    Vice President of Investor RelationsThank you  Good morning everyone and welcome to the Baker Hughes Company fourth quarter and full year 2019 earnings conference call  Here with me are our Chairman and CEO  Lorenzo Simonelli and our CFO  Brian Worrell  The earnings release we issued earlier today can be found on our website at bakerhughes com As a reminder  during the course of this conference call  we will provide forward looking statements  These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve a number of risks and assumptions  Please review our SEC filings and website for a discussion of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially  As you know  reconciliations of operating income and other non GAAP to GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release With that  I will turn the call over to Lorenzo Lorenzo Simonelli    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Jud  Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us  We delivered a solid fourth quarter with strong orders in our Turbomachinery and Oilfield Equipment segments  solid operating performance from our TPS business  strong free cash flow and better execution in our Digital Solutions business  These positives were partially offset by weaker than expected margin performance from our OFS business For the full year of 2019  we achieved a number of key milestones  including 20  year over year order growth in TPS  almost 300 basis points of margin improvement in TPS  12  order growth in OFE and free cash flow of  1 2 billion  In addition  we accelerated our separation efforts from GE  launched our new company brand and positioned ourselves to compete more effectively in a changing marketplace  I cannot thank our employees enough for their hard work and dedication to achieve our goals throughout the year As we look into 2020  we see a macro environment that is slowly improving as well as a range of opportunities to further strengthen Baker Hughes on both the near term and long term basis  In the near term  we continue to identify and execute on opportunities to improve our day to day operations and cash flow efficiency in 2020  Looking out on a longer term basis  we see a number of attractive growth opportunities for our company and we remain focused on positioning Baker Hughes for the upcoming energy transition and the digital transformation of the industry  This balance between near term and long term objectives can be found in each of the strategic goals that I highlighted on our last earnings call  To remind you these goals are  one  margin improvement in our Oilfield Services and Oilfield Equipment businesses  two  evolving our portfolio  specifically leveraging some of our unique core competencies to expand our offerings in the industrial and chemical end markets as well as improving our position for the energy transition and three  continuing to expand our digital offerings to drive greater efficiency as well as safer and more reliable operations for our customers  together with our AI partner  C3 Over the last several months  we have spoken at length about our first goal of execution and operational improvement  which remains an important focus for Baker Hughes in 2020  However  today I would like to spend some time  providing insight on how we are thinking about our goal of portfolio evolution and positioning for the Energy Transition  As you know  Energy Transition is an important topic that has gained a significant amount of momentum in the industry and the investment community over the last six to 12 months As we have stated previously  Baker Hughes is firmly committed to playing a leading role in a lower carbon future  One year ago  we made our own commitment to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and our corporate strategy remains clearly focused on being the leading energy technology company to help facilitate the Energy Transition  As we look ahead to the next two decades  there are various published forecasts on the long term demand outlook for hydrocarbons and the expected growth rate for renewable energy sources  Within these forecasts  there are a wide range of predictions for growth or peak demand for the different types of hydrocarbons in the coming decades  Our view remains that in almost any scenario  natural gas will be the key transition fuel and perhaps even a destination fuel for a lower carbon future  As a result  we believe that natural gas demand will grow at more than twice the pace of oil over the next 10 years and that LNG demand growth will be higher still at an annual rate of 4  to 5  Against this market backdrop  we believe that Baker Hughes is uniquely positioned to provide technologies and solutions that help our customers lower their carbon footprint  While there is strong recognition of our world class LNG franchise  our broad portfolio also offers a wide range of products that help customers lower their carbon footprint today and that are directly tied to the continued growth in renewable energy sources  Some examples of these products are well known  like our LM9000 aeroderivative gas turbine  which can reduce NOx emissions by 40  and overall CO2 equivalent emissions by up to 25  compared to alternative turbines in its class  However  there are broader system level uses where our TPS equipment has the opportunity to be deployed in carbon reduction applications  For example  our core technologies in compression have the capability to help deliver carbon capture  utilization  and storage and we are actively marketing these solutions to customers today  In one application  we reconfigured our NovaLT gas turbine generator technology to operate 100  on hydrogen and we continue to explore opportunities in the hydrogen value chain  in both transportation and production  As another example  our Turbomachinery Equipment can be used to help deliver mechanical storage of energy for use in peak demand for renewables  enabling customers to store and deliver renewable sourced energy to the grid efficiently and effectively In addition  we see three new technology areas emerging as part of the Energy Transition  for which our Digital Solutions segment is uniquely positioned  The first is emissions monitoring  where our products such as Lumen and Avitas are directly applicable  Lumen is a suite of methane monitoring and inspection solutions  and Avitas offers smart inspection and monitoring service solutions in both land and aerial applications  The second area is emissions reduction  where our Flare IQ flare management system allows downstream operators to reduce flaring emissions by 90   The third area is condition monitoring for renewables  specifically in wind turbine applications  Our Bently Nevada business within Digital Solutions has monitoring devices  which ensure detectability of the most costly and critical drive train failure modes  deployed on more than 32 000 wind turbines globally a tremendous installed base we have built over the last decade While these technologies combined represent a small percentage of Baker Hughes overall revenue today  they are products and services that we believe have great growth potential and also provide a strong platform for future product introductions and carbon based initiatives with customers  As we execute on these near term and long term strategic initiatives  we are also mindful of the ever changing macro backdrop across the energy markets  On this note  we generally believe that macro fundamentals have slightly improved over the last few months as dynamics on both the demand and supply side have become more positive  With that said  our incrementally positive view of the macro environment is tempered by growing geopolitical risk  most notably in the Middle East On the demand side  the outlook for oil and gas has modestly improved with the recent Phase 1 trade deal  the slight improvement in PMIs for key economies and continued positive economic data out of the US  We believe that these variables should be supportive of a firm oil demand outlook in 2020 and one in which our customers will continue to execute their budget plans and advance important projects On the supply side  the outlook has also firmed with another recent round of OPEC production cuts and more signs of slowing US production growth  Importantly  we believe the continuation of solid demand growth  combined with the growing commitment to E P capital discipline helps support a more constructive macro outlook  Further  we believe the continuation of these trends could begin to reduce excess crude inventory by later this year or into 2021 and support multiple years of growth internationally Although the macro environment appears to be improving  our overall outlook for our OFS and OFE segments remain largely unchanged from the framework we outlined on our third quarter earnings call  For our OFS segment  we now believe that North America D C spend in 2020 is trending toward a low double digit decline rate versus 2019  This view is based on early E P budget announcements and the lower exit rate in the fourth quarter of 2019  We continue to believe that our differentiated OFS portfolio will provide somewhat of a buffer to the challenges in the North American market  Internationally  our expectations remain mid single digit growth  but with a slight bias to the upside driven primarily by an improving pipeline of opportunities In the OFE segment  our outlook is for the subsea tree market to remain stable  around 300 trees in 2020  We expect to maintain our position in the subsea market driven by strong execution for customers and continued traction with our Subsea Connect strategy For TPS  while we do not expect the exceptionally strong year for LNG FIDs in 2019 to repeat in 2020  our outlook for this segment remains constructive as we execute the largest backlog in the company s history and expect continued growth in services and non LNG equipment awards  For the LNG portion of our TPS segment  our outlook remains constructive  Despite some softness in near term spot prices  conversations with our customers have not changed materially  If spot price weakness persists  we would expect this to shift the balance for future FIDs toward more economically advantaged brownfield projects in the 2021 to 2025 time frame  We were pleased to see around 90 MTPA of LNG FIDs between the fourth quarter of 2018 and the end of 2019  While just short of the 100 MTPA we thought the industry could FID in this period  we believe that FID activity in 2020 should remain solid and at least in line with the average annual FID levels witnessed in the prior cycle between 2011 and 2015 In our Digital Solutions segment  we continue to believe global GDP growth is the most relevant metric by which to forecast this business given the variety of end markets it serves  The oil and gas market drives approximately 50  of DS revenue  with 20  coming from the power market  and the balance from a number of industries including aerospace  automation  consumer electronics  and other industrials  With over 90  of DS revenue coming from hardware and associated software solutions across a range of brands such as Bently Nevada  Nexus Controls  Druck  Panametrics  and Reuter Stokes  this is a mature  stable business with the best in class measurement  sensing  and inspection technology In summary  we delivered a solid fourth quarter and full year 2019  We are clearly focused on executing our strategy and generating strong free cash flow  improving margins  and driving returns With that  let me turn the call over to Brian Brian Worrell    Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Lorenzo  I will begin with the total company results and then move into the segment details Orders for the quarter were  6 9 billion  up 1  year over year and down 11  sequentially  The year over year growth was driven by strong orders in Oilfield Equipment  Sequentially  the decrease was driven by Turbomachinery  which booked a very large LNG order in the third quarter  Remaining Performance Obligation was  22 9 billion  up 3  sequentially  Equipment RPO ended at  8 1 billion  up 10  sequentially and services RPO ended at  14 8 billion  Our total company book to bill ratio in the quarter was 1 1 and our equipment book to bill in the quarter was 1 2 Revenue for the quarter was  6 3 billion  up 8  sequentially  driven by Turbomachinery  Digital Solutions and Oilfield Equipment  offset by Oilfield Services  Year over year  revenue was up 1   driven by OFS and OFE  offset by declines in TPS and DS  Operating income for the quarter was  331 million  which is up 11  sequentially and down 13  year over year  Adjusted operating income was  546 million  which excludes  216 million of restructuring  separation  and other charges  We incurred  135 million of new restructuring charges in our OFS business during the quarter as we continue to work through a new phase of cost out and productivity initiatives  These are primarily focused on supply chain optimization  improving asset utilization  and driving down product and service delivery costs  Separation and merger related charges in the quarter were  57 million Adjusted operating income was up 30  sequentially and up 10  year over year  Our adjusted operating income rate for the quarter was 8 6   up 140 basis points sequentially and up 70 basis points year over year  Corporate costs were  118 million in the quarter  which is modestly higher than third quarter levels and our initial expectations a few months ago  We expect the corporate line to increase slightly from this level in 2020 as we continue to accelerate our separation efforts  I will go into more detail on these costs in a moment Depreciation and amortization was  354 million  down sequentially and flat year over year  We expect depreciation and amortization to remain around this level in the first quarter of 2020  Tax expense for the quarter was  212 million  which was higher than expected  driven by the geographic mix of earnings and certain year end provisions GAAP earnings per share were  0 07  down  0 03 sequentially and down  0 21 year over year  Adjusted earnings per share were  0 27  up  0 06 sequentially and up  0 01 year over year Free cash flow in the quarter was  1 1 billion  which was above our expectations  We delivered  639 million from working capital  driven by strong collections and inventory management in OFS  as well as progress collections in TPS and OFE  Overall  we are very pleased with the cash performance in the fourth quarter as OFS saw improvements after the shortfall in the third quarter  We continue to see improvement in our working capital processes and are focused on optimizing our cash operations to ensure we deliver on our free cash flow conversion target When I look at the total year 2019  I am pleased with our financial results  which reflect our consistent execution on the priorities we set out at the beginning of the year  Orders for the full year were up 13  in 2019  driven by 20  order growth in TPS and 12  order growth in OFE  TPS book to bill was 1 4 in the year and OFE book to bill was 1 2  Full year revenue was up 4   Our OFS and OFE businesses were both up 11   offset by declines in TPS and DS  Despite a challenging macro environment for the broader energy market  we were able to grow total company adjusted operating income margins by 60 basis points  We drove margins higher in three of our four segments  with improvements of 270 basis points in TPS  190 basis points in OFE and 40 basis points in OFS  offset by a 120 basis point decline in DS  Overall  the results for each of our product companies are in line with the framework we outlined at the beginning of the year Corporate costs for the year were  433 million  As I mentioned  we expect to incur an additional  50 million to  60 million of corporate costs in 2020 related to the ramp up in separation efforts  We have a significant number of transition services agreements in place with GE across a range of functions including IT  HR  Treasury  and other infrastructure to ensure we maintain the continuity of our business operations  Importantly  we expect these incremental costs to recede in 2021 as we roll off the transition services agreements and utilize our own systems  In conjunction with the separation activities  we are also taking the opportunity to upgrade our systems and sunset some aging processes and infrastructure to ensure Baker Hughes is best positioned to drive further efficiencies in our operations which should lead to higher margins We generated  1 2 billion of free cash flow in 2019  We were very pleased with our cash performance in the year and continue to improve our working capital metrics  We invested  976 million in net capital expenditures in 2019 and we expect to see similar net capex levels in 2020  Included in our 2019 free cash flow results are  307 million of restructuring  separation and merger related cash outflows  As we have outlined  we expect restructuring related outflows to decline in 2020  offset by an increase in separation related cash outflows  Given the strong level of free cash flow generated in 2019  we ended the year with  3 2 billion of cash on hand and net debt of  3 4 billion after returning  1 billion of cash to shareholders through buybacks and dividends  We continue to see our balance sheet as a key strength and differentiator in this cyclical industry Now I will walk through the segment results in more detail and give you our thoughts on the outlook going forward  In Oilfield Services  the team continues to navigate a challenging environment in North America  while driving strong growth internationally  OFS revenue in the quarter was  3 3 billion  which was down 2  sequentially  North American revenue was down 11  sequentially  driven by declining rig count and weaker completions in US Land  as well as a double digit sequential decline in our Gulf of Mexico operations  International revenue was up 4  sequentially  driven by continued growth in the Middle East  Asia Pacific  and Latin America Operating income in the quarter was  235 million  down 14  sequentially and margins declined 110 basis points  OFS margins were below our expectations primarily due to weaker North American results and lower product sales than originally planned  Despite coming in slightly below our expectations  we believe the margin headwinds in the fourth quarter are largely transitory and our expectations for 2020 are unchanged  As we look at 2020 for our OFS segment  we expect international spending to increase in the mid single digit range with most of the growth coming from a number of offshore markets and regional strength in the Middle East  North Sea  and parts of Latin America  Given our focus on execution and improving margins  I would expect our international OFS business to generally track in line with industry trends In North America  we expect US D C spend to decline low double digits versus 2019 as domestic E Ps continue to restrain spending to generate more free cash flow  Similar to 2019  we would expect revenue for our North American OFS business to outperform industry spending trends given our production weighted mix  For margins  we expect to deliver year over year growth  driven primarily by our cost out and productivity enhancement actions  I will also reiterate that over time  our goal remains to close the margin gap with peers  As we look ahead to the first quarter  we expect North America to get off to a relatively slow start and expect typical seasonal trends in key Eastern Hemisphere markets like the North Sea and Russia  As a result  we expect total OFS revenue to experience a modest sequential decline and for margins to decline slightly  but still remain well above year ago margin levels Next  I will cover Oilfield Equipment  Orders in the quarter were  1 1 billion  up 6  year over year driven by growth in both equipment and service orders  Equipment book to bill in OFE was 1 7  We booked several key awards in the quarter totaling 22 trees  which brings our 2019 total to 73 trees  With this level of awards  we maintained a similar position in the market as in 2018  Revenue was  765 million  up 5  year over year  This increase was primarily driven by better Subsea Services activity and Subsea Production Systems volumes  partially offset by lower revenues in Flexibles  Operating income was  16 million  up 28  year over year  driven by increased volume in SPS  Operating margins were up 20 basis points sequentially and up 40 basis points year over year As we look at our OFE segment in 2020  we believe that offshore market fundamentals should support another solid year of orders with subsea tree awards expected to remain relatively consistent with 2019  For 2020  we believe that OFE should see revenue growth in the high single digit range following two years of strong orders growth  We expect volume growth in SPS and improving mix from Flexibles to drive solid margin improvement in OFE in 2020  For the first quarter  we expect the trend of year over year revenue growth to continue as we execute on the positive momentum from our SPS and Flexibles product lines  Based on our anticipated project conversion schedule  we expect OFE revenues to increase in the mid single digit range on a year over year basis along with modest margin improvement Moving to Turbomachinery  Orders in the quarter were  1 9 billion  down 10  year over year  Equipment orders were down 16  year over year and equipment book to bill was 1 5  During the quarter  we booked an award for the liquefaction equipment on Total s Mozambique Area 1 LNG project and we had some important wins in Onshore Offshore Production  including two FPSO awards in Latin America  Service orders in the quarter were down 4  year over year  mainly driven by lower contractual services  offset by higher transactional services and upgrades Revenue for the quarter was  1 6 billion  down 8  versus the prior year  For the quarter  services revenue was down 2  versus the prior year and equipment revenue was down 18   driven primarily by business dispositions  Operating income for TPS was  305 million  up 19  year over year  driven by higher services mix and cost productivity  Operating margin was 18 7   up 430 basis points year over year and up 520 basis points sequentially  Overall  TPS results for the quarter came in slightly above our expectations with a much stronger margin rate offsetting revenue that was below our expectations  While the supply chain issues that impacted the third quarter lingered into the fourth quarter  the primary driver behind the lower than expected revenue was slower conversion of our equipment backlog than we anticipated  Rod and the team have done a very good job of managing costs and execution as they work to deliver on the largest LNG equipment backlog in TPS s history The 2020 outlook we provided for TPS last quarter remains largely similar  Given the consecutive years of strong order growth in 2018 and 2019  we expect year over year revenue growth of roughly 20  and for margins to continue to expand  I would note  however  that our current expectation for revenue conversion is weighted more toward the second half of the year based on project timing  For orders  we still believe that TPS could be flat to down low double digits compared to 2019 levels  As you know  timing on large projects can vary  which drives a wide range of scenarios  As we think about the first quarter  we expect TPS revenues to be roughly flat with first quarter 2019 levels given the equipment conversion schedules that I previously mentioned  On the margin front  we expect to show solid improvement on a year over year basis Finally  on Digital Solutions  orders for the quarter were  645 million  down 4  year over year  Growth in our Controls and Inspection businesses was partially offset by declines in Measurement   Sensing and Pipeline   Process Solutions  Regionally  we saw strong orders growth in Asia and the Middle East offset by declines in the other regions Revenue for the quarter was  659 million  down 5  year over year  primarily due to the sale of the Digital APM product line  Excluding the impact of this disposition  revenue was down slightly with growth in Bently Nevada  Inspection  and Measurement   Sensing offset by declines in Controls and Pipeline   Process Solutions  Operating income for the quarter was  109 million  down 5  year over year  driven by lower volume  Despite the decline in year over year revenue  we delivered on productivity and cost out to hold the margin rate flat versus the fourth quarter of 2018 Looking ahead to the full year 2020 for DS  we continue to expect revenue growth in the low single digits and modestly higher margins  This outlook takes into account a GDP plus growth rate  but anticipates that DS is likely to see some continued softness in the power business  Revenue growth will also be impacted as we pivot our software strategy with the sale of the Digital APM offering and work closely with our AI partner  C3 on new opportunities  For the first quarter  we expect revenue to decline in the mid single digits year over year and for margins to decline modestly due to the non repeat of a large project in the first quarter of 2019 In closing  we delivered a strong fourth quarter  finishing at a solid 2019 for Baker Hughes  As we look forward to 2020  we are clearly focused on executing our strategy and generating strong free cash flow  improving margins  and driving returns With that  I will turn the call back over to Jud Judson Bailey    Vice President of Investor RelationsThank you  Operator  let s open the call for questions Questions and Answers OperatorThank you   Operator Instructions  Our first question comes from James West with Evercore ISI James West    Evercore ISI    AnalystHey  good morning gentlemen Lorenzo Simonelli    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerHi James James West    Evercore ISI    AnalystSo Lorenzo  you guys are clear leaders in the energy transition here  And I wanted to maybe talk a little bit higher level about the various buckets you re attacking  I mean clearly natural gas is a big part of the strategy and you have some leading products there  You also have your own internal ESG plans and goals  many of which you ve been highlighting over the last year  but then you also have products and services that hit all parts of the carbon chain whether that s monitoring and then carbon capture  So how do you think about  I mean if I bucket those into those three  if that s the way you think about it  If not  please let me know  But how do you think about which ones do you want to allocate more capital to  less capital to  which are the bigger growth drivers  maybe in the intermediate term for Baker and I guess what is your overall strategy Lorenzo Simonelli    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  James  thanks  And as you know  the energy transition and the theme of energy transition has gained a lot of attention over the course of the last 12 months  A year ago  you ll recall that we actually made our commitment relative to reducing our own carbon footprint 50  by 2030 and achieve net zero by 2050  And as you look at Baker Hughes  we are really playing a critical role at the energy transition across a number of areas  given our broad portfolio and I highlighted some of those in script that was prepared  But if you look at some of the key areas  the first I d say is  as you look at natural gas and you look at LNG  clearly  for the energy transition and reducing the amount of CO2  there is going to be an increasing use of natural gas as a transition  but also destination target and we see that LNG is going to continue to grow over the next few decades even as renewables grows as well and that s a key focus for us with the introduction that we ve made at the LM9000  also our fast application of the novelty  which is hydrogen based  So clearly a shift toward    on the rotating equipment side helping in the energy transition  Beyond that as you look also the Digital Solutions platform  clearly with what we have as Lumen and also Avitas  these are solutions that enable our customers to monitor and also understand how they can reduce their carbon footprint  So you look at our broad portfolio  we re uniquely positioned and that s why we say from a standpoint of moving energy forward and also being an energy technology company  we re going to be helping our customers and partners through this energy transition Brian Worrell    Chief Financial OfficerYeah  James  if you look at how we re allocating capital  clearly  we re continuing to invest in TPS  which is having an impact today  We ve got lots of opportunities and adjacencies in TPS  we can put a little bit of capital to work either through technology development or some partnerships and can grow our footprint there and then Digital Solutions  it s a high margin business  we get good returns  We ll continue to invest capital there  So I think you ll see us balance the capital allocation with short term and then long term as we continue to pivot the portfolio as part of energy transition  So we ll update you if there are any changes there  but I think we ve got a pretty good approach right now to drive short term growth and margins as well as position the portfolio for the long term James West    Evercore ISI    AnalystYeah  totally agree  And then maybe a follow up on the LNG pricing issue  Short term pricing weakness has impacted perception of the LNG  liquefaction build out story  but it seems to me that were two things  one  that it hasn t really changed the conversations on the better capitalized projects and number two  lower prices now probably with even better demand in the future for LNG  Are those fair statements that are making and do you agree that it s not going to cause any real weakness in the kind of build out cycle beyond the    I know we want the same record year we saw last year  but that we re pretty much full steam ahead Lorenzo Simonelli    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  James  you re looking at it the right way  If you look at recent LNG spot price weakness  it doesn t change the overall long term LNG demand and supply dynamics  And in fact the conversations we re having with our customers are really toward the continued demand for LNG over the long term and if you take a step back  you look at where we re going to be by 2030  it s going to be between 550 million tons to 600 million tons of demand and to produce that you re going to need 700 million tons of installed capacity  So even with where we are today with the construction of 60  Phonetic  MTPA and also the 90 that was FID last year  you ve still got another 130 to 150 that s got to go in the next coming years  So we feel good about the LNG space and we feel good about the long term aspect of it OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Angie Sedita with Goldman Sachs Angie Sedita    Goldman Sachs Group Inc     AnalystGood morning  guys Lorenzo Simonelli    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerHi Angie Brian Worrell    Chief Financial OfficerHi Angie Angie Sedita    Goldman Sachs Group Inc     AnalystHi  So I appreciate the details  Brian on the revenue side when we think about 2020 in Q1  But if we could drill down a little bit on the margin side  thoughts around Oilfield Service margins in 2020  I know you re not where you really want to be  but how much self help you think you could have going into the year for 2020 and when do you think we could start to see some parity versus your peers Brian Worrell    Chief Financial OfficerYeah  Angie  look  we did see margins below where we wanted them to be in the fourth quarter and there wasn t really one thing that I can point to that say it was the main driver  There were a couple of things going on that impact of the margin rate  I d say  first as we saw slightly lower than anticipated activity in the US land market for us  which we think was really largely customer and basin specific  We also saw as we went into the end of the year  some weakness in our Gulf of Mexico operations  which obviously carries higher margin rates for obvious reasons there  And then lastly  I d say our product sales were lower than we anticipated  We knew they were going to be lower  because if you remember  we had a very strong third quarter as we accelerated some of those product deliveries to meet customer demand and we did have some of those slip out of the quarter  So those three things combined put pressure on the margin rate versus what we expected  but you know based on what I m seeing today  they re largely transitory in nature and I don t see them impacting us as we roll into 2020 And if I look at 2020  we expect a large portion of that margin improvement to    as you say be self help with cost out and productivity initiatives that we re driving and you saw we posted some restructuring reserves in the quarter as we had very specific programs in supply chain and service delivery across Maria Claudia portfolio to help drive the margin rate improvement and I d say that the other thing that supports margin rate improvement in 2020 is we re really getting to the maturation phase of some of the larger integrated contracts internationally where we saw some ramp up cost this year and we ve come up the learning curve  So I can see strong margin improvement in those contracts  So that should certainly help the overall margin rate And If I look at the overall cost out and productivity initiatives  they are really in two buckets  Angie  One is around efficiency and operations optimization and the other is around product costs  So for instance around product costs  we ve been working for quite some time with the engineering and product teams to identify specific areas where we can go in and drive cost out  some of that is target costing  some of it s looking at a broader supply base and some of it s looking at overheads to see how we can leverage overheads globally more efficiently  On the efficiency and productivity side  we re looking at a lot of opportunities to cross train individuals to make sure you don t have to send multiple people who were going to have idle time when they re out on a rig and it s taken us some time to really get through those details and understand how to attack that  But with what we put up in restructuring in the quarter  the plans we have in place  we feel good about our ability to continue to grow margins in 2020 in OFS  So our framework is really unchanged and Maria Claudia and the team as well as the whole enterprise are focused on getting those margin rates up Angie Sedita    Goldman Sachs Group Inc     AnalystThanks  That s very helpful  Brian  I appreciate that  So maybe you can do the same thing around TPS given the strong backlog you already had in hand  thoughts around margins for 2020  I think you ve said in the past  maybe low to mid teens  Is that still a fair assumption  And do you think ultimately that the high teens is where you would consider your run rate Brian Worrell    Chief Financial OfficerYeah  Angie  I am very pleased with how Rod and the team have closed out the year and are managing customer expectations with its incredibly large backlog and balancing cost and returns as they go through  So pleased with where they are today  Look  our outlook for 2020 margins  again  is largely unchanged from what we talked about in the last call  And just to remind you  there are a few dynamics that come into play that really impact how much margin accretion we will have in the year  First  we expect contractual services and transactional services to grow in 2020  which is accretive to margins  you mentioned the large backlog  the largest in our history  We will see more LNG equipment revenue come through in 2020  While that is accretive to overall equipment margin  it does have a negative mix effect as we talked about for the total business  And then we are in the early stages of executing on the two very large LNG projects  Arctic 2 and VG  which tend to have their lowest margin point at the beginning of the execution and you start to see that accrete over time  So that will have an impact here  And then you know  we ve talked a bit about the technology spend in TPS and we said we were evaluating that and back actually to James s earlier question  we see a lot of opportunity in energy transition to continue to grow this franchise and strengthen its position in the marketplace  So I d expect technology spend to be roughly where it is this year So if you add all that up  I d say that the more revenue we have  the faster it grows  it impacts the magnitude of the upside in margins and you saw that come through in the dynamics of the third and fourth quarter and how strong our services was versus the equipment  but overall goal is to continue to drive margin enhancement in the business and over time  we do see mid to high teens as revenue normalizes in the portfolio and services continue to grow and with the large equipment backlog we have now  especially in LNG  you ll start to see that services backlog grow over time as we sign customers up for long term service agreement  So largely unchanged tailwinds in the business and I think  Rod and the team are doing a great job managing through that OperatorThanks  Your next question comes from Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America Merrill Lynch Chase Mulvehill    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystHey  good morning  I guess I wanted to come back to the TPS service commentary  Earlier you talked about the largest LNG backlog in the history and you ve kind of touched on some of the digital things that you re doing  Could you talk a little bit about the opportunities that you have on this    the LNG service side with this significant backlog and then what Digital ultimately means for the TPS or the LNG service business and potentially maybe some shift over to the contractual side of the services business Brian Worrell    Chief Financial OfficerYeah  Chase  look  I m very happy with how the services business is performing in TPS  And on a reported basis for the year  the service revenue was flattish  slightly down  When you take into account some of the dispositions that we had as well as the impact of FX for the total year  revenue actually was up mid single digits operationally  So  performing pretty much in line with how you would expect this portfolio to perform and this year it represented about 60  of TPS s revenue and that will obviously change over time as the equipment starts to convert  And as you pointed out  contractual services is a big piece of that as are our transactional services  That contractual services backlog is about  13 billion today and we expect that to continue to grow  And just to round out services we do have installation and upgrades including there as well as some services on pumps and valves  but the large majority are contractual services If I take a look at the transactional piece  we had growth in 2019 in mid single digits  I would expect that to continue into 2020  And from a digital standpoint  lots of opportunities in the services portfolio  One  internally to help us operate better and use our partnership with C3  We ve got tons of data on this equipment and how we operate in the field  We think that C3 can help us unlock even more internal productivity as we execute on these service contracts and provide transactional services and upgrade  And in addition  there are opportunities to introduce some of this in to these contractual services to help the customers equipment performed better  And then there is lots of things we can do with the data that we have from things that aren t on contractual services and put together offerings forecasts customers to help drive better productivity and better up time for the equipment  So I think it s an untapped opportunity right now  We re not counting on a lot of that as we roll into 2020  We ll be working a lot with C3 and our teams and I would expect to see some of those digital things kick in the outer years to have a meaningful impact on revenue Chase Mulvehill    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystThanks  Very good Lorenzo Simonelli    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerChase  just maybe to add  If you look at on the Digital side and the C3 partnership  we ve actually launched already two solutions into the marketplace  One around reliability  which really targets the up time for the equipment and that can be applied to the service agreements and drive efficiency and productivity and then also optimization  And so really as we look at the next few years  Digital is a key area of focus and it s going to drive a lot of efficiencies Chase Mulvehill    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystGot it  Understood  Thank you  One real quick follow up  Obviously you ve got the GE offering overhanging out there still  Could you talk to how much Baker Hughes would look to repurchase alongside an offering  Should we think of it kind of free cash flow after dividends for 2020 or would you actually add a little bit of leverage to take down a little bit more stock Brian Worrell    Chief Financial OfficerYeah  Chase  I d say that look our overall capital allocation and corporate finance policy  it really hasn t changed from what we talked about in terms of commitments turned 40  to 50  of net to shareholders through dividends and buyback and I think as you and I ve talked before  we will certainly evaluate any potential offerings by GE and put that into our thinking as we allocate capital over the course of the year  So no real change there in terms of how we re thinking about it and you should assume that we re certainly taking that into account as we look at our free cash flow and all of our metrics for the year OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from David Anderson with Barclays David Anderson    Barclays Capital Inc     AnalystHi  good morning  I was hoping to dig into a little bit in your chemicals business here  which is getting some more attention lately with your biggest competitor changing hands  I was wondering if you just talk about the business mix and what you see as the primary growth drivers in next several years in terms of offshore onshore  now in downstream which is not really a market we hear much about  you highlighted a big contract with Valero today  Could you just kind of talk about that business and how you see that developing Lorenzo Simonelli    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Dave  if you look at our chemical franchise and again  we ve mentioned it before that we think it s a great area that we ve been in on the upstream side and actually got a good footprint in North America and we ve actually allocated capital to increase our presence internationally  If you look at our expansion in Singapore facility as well as in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and I think actually the M A activity you just mentioned validates a lot of the approach that we ve had  We ve got an increasing usage of chemicals when you look at enhanced oil recovery  You ve also got an opportunity on the downstream side  as you mentioned  which we ve got an opportunity to grow in  And when you look at the specialty chemicals that we provide and its application  it s increasing across both the upstream and downstream  So we feel good about the strategy we got in place and also the growth trajectory for this chemicals business over time Brian Worrell    Chief Financial OfficerYeah  And Dave  if I look at where we are today  we re predominantly North America  We do have an international presence  But with the investments we re making in Singapore and Saudi to shift capacity  we see more growth coming for us Internationally and today we re mostly upstream  We do have some downstream and I think there is a lot of growth opportunities for us in downstream as well  And the other thing I d point out about the investments that we re making  the Singapore investment is really going to reduce our cost base  better manufacturing  better supply chain cost  better logistics cost  And then what we re doing in Saudi is really size for the region to allow us to be very responsive to a lot of very large customers in that region  So again  we like the space  we re putting capital to work there and we would expect to see growth and margin accretion in chemicals David Anderson    Barclays Capital Inc     AnalystYeah  I was going to say    and presumably  this is rather accretive to your OFS business I would assume  correct Brian Worrell    Chief Financial OfficerYeah  We like this business  Yes David Anderson    Barclays Capital Inc     AnalystOkay  And maybe just on a different subject  I just want to ask about kind of your OFS business mix in North America and just kind of how you feel about kind of where you are  whether or not you re satisfied out there and there s been some reports out there that potentially you may be looking to exit the Lufkin Rod Lift business  I would have thought that would be kind of part of your longer term strategy  you talked about more of the production side  but maybe this is more capital intensive than you like  I was just wondering maybe if you could comment on that and perhaps more broadly on your North American mix in terms of where you want to be Brian Worrell    Chief Financial OfficerYeah  Dave  I think we talked about the portfolio before and I have basically said that we want to focus the company in areas that are highly differentiated  We have seen the less fragmentation that allow us to generate higher returns and look  as we look at the energy transition and how we expect that to unfold  if there are areas that don t meet that criteria  we would potentially look to generate cash by not having those in the portfolio and redeploying that cash in the areas where we can get higher returns over the short term in the end and or a better fit long term within the portfolio  So I d say  look  the North American market has changed quite a bit over the last few years and there are some areas where we think the technology or the fragmentation are going to make it harder to get returns that justify them being inside the portfolio and we ll continue to look at that  but nothing right now that I need to update you on in terms of things that are changing  And as we have news  we ll certainly let you know  but I want you to understand we are focused on returns here and where we deploy this incremental capital dollars and I think the market has changed quite a bit and where we re relooking some things OperatorThank you  Your next question comes from Sean Meakim with JPMorgan Sean Meakim    JPMorgan Chase    AnalystHey  good morning Brian Worrell    Chief Financial OfficerHey  Sean Lorenzo Simonelli    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerHey  Sean Sean Meakim    JPMorgan Chase    AnalystSo you ve good free cash in the quarter  typical seasonality and maybe some catch up from 3Q in OFS like you mentioned  Of the  600 million on working capital benefit  how much would you attribute to just typical seasonal collections versus progress payments from the new projects coming in and we re sticking maybe with perhaps a peak order cycle in  19 we ll see  Can you maybe just talk about how the cash flow profile looks over the course of the typical TPS project and how that should influence expectations for free cash in  20 and  21 as you start to convert these projects Brian Worrell    Chief Financial OfficerYeah  So I would say  we did have typical seasonality  And I think the majority of what we saw in the quarter was related to that typical seasonality  As we talked about on the third quarter call  OFS came in below expectations and they really turned the corner here in the fourth quarter by making up on some of that and it was really driven by strong collection process overall  And that s all the way from billing on time  following up  getting the collection thing and the team did a really good job of managing inventory inputs as we had been making a lot of process changes over the course of the year and that came through  We did have some benefit from progress collections in TPS and OFE  but I think you have to look at it in totality  it s a small piece  but progress is only one piece of the equation  because at the same time you re getting down payments or you re getting progress collections as you re executing on the project  you are also bringing in inventory as well  So it s not a one for one follow through in terms of free cash flow  you have to look at more accounts on the balance sheet And in TPS typically  you start out with a down payment  We have long lead items that you bring into the project  And then based on certain milestones  you build a customer and you collect  So one of the first things I look at in any TPS project is the cash curve to see what our cash position looks like in that and our goal is to have them be favorable from a cash flow standpoint  So you will see ebbs and flows and progress collections over the lifecycle of a project in receivables and inventory  But I would say it was a small impact here in the fourth quarter  As I go into 2020 and look at how I think it will play out  we should see smaller impact from progress payment and we saw in 2019  but do believe that the improvements we ve been driving in working capital processes across the franchise  not just in OFS should help offset that The other thing I would say is we expect capex  net capex to be roughly flat from a dollar standpoint  but down as a percentage of sales is obviously we see more growth in TPS and OFE and in the round out free cash flow in total Sean  we do expect restructuring cash outlay to be down significantly  but the separation cash outlay will offset that  So net net  we see good dynamics as we go into 2020 for free cash flow strength Sean Meakim    JPMorgan Chase    AnalystGot it  Thank you for that  Brian  So maybe just come back to margin progression in TPS  So you ve got strong revenue growth this year  You ve topped up your guidance today versus last quarter  I think that makes sense  We have somewhat limited historicals from last cycle  so it s not much of a track record in terms of incremental margins and I think earlier in the call  you talked about at a high level the impact between fixed cost absorption versus services versus equipment mix  just as we roll all that together in terms of the flow through to year over year incremental margins  how do you think about that on a normalized basis Brian Worrell    Chief Financial OfficerYeah  Look  as I said  it really depends on how quickly revenue grows on the equipment side as to what the the absolute margin percentage increase will be  but under all the scenarios that I see today  we do see some margin accretion in TPS  I will note that based on the customer requested delivery schedules and the way the projects we re executing  we do see the second half being much heavier from an equipment standpoint and an overall revenue standpoint  So we would expect the second half to be much larger from a revenue standpoint and that obviously has an impact on the fixed cost absorption as you look at more revenue in the first half  So look  we ll continue to update you throughout the year if that changes  but right now  that s how I see things playing out OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Bill Herbert with Simmons William Herbert    Simmons   Company International    AnalystThanks  Good morning  So back to cash flow and free cash flow  Brian  just very quickly  One  do you expect working capital to be a cash generator or a cash consumer in 2020 And secondly  remind us what your free cash flow conversion target is  I think it s like 90  of net income  And if that s the case  it seems like you re going to crush that again  So could you update us on both of those  please  Thank you Brian Worrell    Chief Financial OfficerOkay  Bill  Yeah  So if I look at the free cash flow conversion target  it is 90  of net income over time  And I think you re going to have some years based on the projects business and how we re driving working capital where you can exceed that  in some years where it could be below that based on mix of business  So 90  is the through the cycle goal  And if I look at overall working capital with the dynamics we talked about earlier  the strong progress payments in 2019  again not quite as strong in 2020  but will have some offsets with the other working capital processes that we re driving  I mean you could see a year where working capital is a slight usage based on those dynamics and the growth that we have in the portfolio  but you should expect our working capital metrics to continue to improve William Herbert    Simmons   Company International    AnalystThank you OperatorOur next question comes from Scott Gruber with Citigroup Scott Gruber    Citigroup    AnalystYes  Good morning Brian Worrell    Chief Financial OfficerHey  Scott Scott Gruber    Citigroup    AnalystJust a couple of detailed ones here  What was the profitability split between the North American OFS business and international business in 4Q and is that spread pretty similar to what you re looking for in 1Q  And then it sounds like you believe that the Gulf activity slump  which impacted 4Q is transitory  Does that snap back in 1Q  Is that in your guide or is that more of a 2Q event Brian Worrell    Chief Financial OfficerYeah  Scott  we do see some improvement in 1Q in the Gulf  I don t know that I call it a snap back  but we do see improvement there and obviously that has a positive impact on margin rate  as I said for obvious reasons  So look  frac boats were down in 4Q  which is a big driver of that and we do expect that to come back  As far as the profitability  look  we don t disclose profitability by region there  but I would say from a dynamic standpoint  we continue to expect to see the softness in North America and feel pretty good about the growth opportunities that we re seeing in international  And the thing that I would remind you of that I think I mentioned in when I talked to Angie is that a lot of these large integrated projects were up the learning curve there and we should see margin accretion in 2020 as we execute on those projects and a lot of those start up costs as well as just getting to know the field costs have abated  So feel pretty good about the margin progression internationally and the growth backdrop there Scott Gruber    Citigroup    AnalystGot it  And then just coming back to the chemicals business  It sounds like the growth investments there will be beneficial to your overall OFS mix and return profile  Are you able to provide any color on the magnitude of the new plants relative to the size of your current chemicals business  Just trying to think about the impact of those the Petrolite as they come on and when do they come on in the years ahead Lorenzo Simonelli    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerLook  from a timing perspective  again  these plants are in construction  So you won t see anything in 2020  They ll start going into a commissioning phase and more in 2021  As we mentioned  we see international growth opportunities  So stay tuned  We ll give more updates as we start completing the plants Brian Worrell    Chief Financial OfficerYeah  And again  I just reiterate here  It s not all going to be incremental capacity  We are shifting capacity here and again  the Singapore facility is going to be very cost advantage  So in addition to growing internationally  we ll have the benefits of higher margin rates for product that s coming out of Singapore  And look  as we get closer to commissioning and things firm up  we ll give you guys some insights into how we re thinking about that  but I m spending a lot of time there and again like I said  we like this business and like the capital we re putting to work there OperatorLadies and gentlemen  this does conclude today s Q A portion of the conference  I d like to turn the call back over to our host for any closing remarks Lorenzo Simonelli    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerJust  thanks again for joining us  We closed out a strong 2019  You saw the

 Reuters    A grand jury in Alaska this week indicted General Electric s Baker Hughes  N BHGE   two of its subsidiaries and an employee  for 25 felony charges of assault relating to toxic chemical releases at a construction site  according to authorities 
The indictment charges Baker Hughes and John Clyde Willis  identified as a manager for the oilfield services company  The 25 charges stem from chemical releases in 2014 during building of a chemical transfer facility in Kenai  Alaska  according to a statement from Alaska s Attorney General s office 
Construction crew at the facility were repeatedly exposed to toxic chemicals  the statement said  but Baker Hughes  two of its subsidiaries and Willis failed to respond to worker complaints until several were taken to hospital following a  large exposure event  
Five crew members experienced prolonged serious injury  including ataxia  memory loss  migraines  vertigo  respiratory issues and tremors  according to the statement 
Willis could not immediately be reached for comment 
Baker Hughes said it was committed to safety and that it operates its oilfield services facility in Kenai in compliance with the law 
 We vigorously deny the claims made against us  and will exercise our right to present evidence that the allegations are without merit   We have confidence in the judicial system and that the full facts will be presented in court   a spokesperson said 
The company and Wallis have been indicted on 10 counts of first degree assault  10 counts of second degree assault  and five counts of third degree assault

97117,318632,BKR,Brexit impasse takes its toll on British business investment,news,"By William Schomberg
HUTHWAITE  England  Reuters    As uncertainty over Brexit spills into its fourth year  Swiftool Precision Engineering has taken a tough investment decision  it will press ahead with a plan to spend 250 000 pounds   323 000  on a 3D printer but a new workshop roof will have to wait 
Like many British companies  the small  family owned firm which makes parts for aircraft engines and offshore oil wells wants more clarity on what leaving the European Union might mean for its business before carrying out all its investment plans 
 You become more mindful   director Sam Handley said at the company s workshops  near Mansfield in central England  where it employs 126 people 
Swiftool  SPE  is not alone in being cautious  British business investment has fallen 1 1  since the Brexit referendum in June 2016 and analysts warn that could cause long term damage to the economy 
Over the same period  business investment in the other Group of Seven big  industrialized economies has risen 10   with the United States posting an increase of 13   according to Alpesh Paleja  an economist with the Confederation of British Industry 
 With every piece of machinery we have to convince the bank that we are doing the right thing  Every decision counts   Handley said 
SPE cuts parts to within a hundredth of a millimeter for global manufacturers such as Britain s Rolls Royce  L RR   U S  company Baker Hughes  N BKR  and Germany s  Siemens   DE SIEGn  and is busy working on scores of potential new orders 
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is urging voters to end the Brexit impasse by giving him a majority in parliament in an election on Dec  12  so he can get the divorce deal he struck with Brussels last month past lawmakers 
But like many executives frustrated by Brexit  Handley is not counting on a breakthrough any time soon 
 I don t think the uncertainty is going to lift at all  I think we might get a hung parliament  If this was a business  they would have been removed from their post   she said  referring to parliament   It s disgraceful  
PRODUCTIVITY PLUNGE
Weak business confidence is not just a British phenomenon  The International Monetary Fund says Sino U S  trade tensions are hurting investment globally  But Brexit uncertainty threatens to turn the British problem into a crisis 
Bank of England Deputy Governor Dave Ramsden said last month that weak investment has eaten away at Britain s growth potential to the extent that the economy is now too inflation prone to allow the central bank to cut interest rates 
The car sector   which is grappling with the prospect of high EU tariffs on top of global upheaval in the auto industry   cut investment by more than 70  in the first half of 2019  according to an industry group 
European planemaker Airbus  PA AIR   meanwhile  warned this year it might stop building aircraft wings in Britain if the country leaves the EU without a withdrawal agreement 
Warning signs about Britain s diminishing growth potential are flashing in its productivity record 
It has long lagged the performance of the United States  France and Germany and in the three months from April  British output per hour fell at its fastest annual pace in five years 
Paul Mizen  an economics professor at the University of Nottingham  said a survey of companies set up in 2016 by his university along with Stanford University and Britain s central bank did not bode well for productivity going forward 
 Investment growth has been affected to the greatest extent among the most productive firms  which indicates that the productivity average for the UK as a whole will be lower  
Mizen said the Decision Maker Panel survey also showed that constantly changing Brexit scenarios were distracting companies from focusing on boosting productivity 
Johnson says things could improve quickly  Getting his Brexit deal through parliament would  unleash a great tide of investment into this country and be a demonstration of confidence in the UK economy   he told lawmakers in October 
But even if Johnson secures his divorce deal  it looks unlikely he would be able to settle the next stage of Brexit quickly by hammering out a new EU trade deal before another potentially nerve jangling deadline at the end of 2020 
What s more  the opposition Labour Party has raised the prospect of more uncertainty  If it wins on Dec  12  it would try to a strike a new exit deal and hold another referendum  throwing the Brexit question up in the air again 
STERLING AND STEEL
At SPE  which makes parts for shipyards working for Britain s navy as well as the aviation and petroleum sectors  Handley assumes there will be more bumps in the road 
Potential Brexit problems include disruption at Britain s borders with the EU that could push up the price of the steel her company needs  or a further fall in sterling that would make imports of key parts from the United States more expensive 
To address those risks  SPE has stockpiled steel and  after taking a 140 000 pound hit from a bout of sterling weakness in 2018  makes sure it hedges all its foreign exchange exposure 
But top of Handley s worry list is uncertainty about the rules for the aviation industry   its biggest growth market 
Johnson has left open the possibility of diverging from EU standards in sectors such as aviation to help Britain secure post Brexit trade deals with the United States and others 
Having to comply with different sets of rules would mean additional costs for British manufacturers that could erode their competitiveness 
 There was just no warning about that   Handley said   It felt so unfair  
For now  SPE is pressing on with day to day business  In a room off a busy workshop  sales staff are working on more than 70 enquiries from potential customers 
 I think we will still be in a state of flux in 12 18 months  time   Handley said   But you ve just got to find a way round it if you can

SEOUL  Reuters    Oil prices held steady near three month highs on Friday on the back of easing Sino U S  trade tensions that have weighed on demand as well as the global economic growth outlook 
Brent futures  LCOc1  rose 2 cents  or 0 03   to 66 56 a barrel by 0145 GMT  while U S  West Texas Intermediate crude  CLc1  was down 9 cents  or 0 15   at  61 09 per barrel 
Both benchmarks were still on track for a third consecutive weekly rise 
Progress in a long running trade dispute between the United States and China  the world s two biggest oil consumers  has boosted expectations for higher energy demand next year 
China on Thursday announced a list of import tariff exemptions for six oil and chemical products from the United States  days after the world s two largest economies announced an interim trade deal 
 A world with less uncertainty  following last week s proposed U S  China trade agreement  was the real driver of the market optimism on the 2020 outlook   ANZ Research said in a note 
JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  raised its 2020 oil price outlook earlier this week amid OPEC led output cuts and an improved global trade outlook 
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries  OPEC  and its allies including Russia agreed in early December to make a further cut of 500 000 barrels per day  bpd  from Jan  1 on top of previous reductions of 1 2 million bpd

Shares of Baker Hughes  NYSE BKR  climbed 14 3  in December  according to data from S P Global Market Intelligence  as the broader market climbed and after a Wall Street analyst weighed in with a positive note on the oil stock 

So what
For perspective  the broader industry also enjoyed gains last month  leaving the SPDR S P Oil   Gas Exploration   Production ETF up an impressive 16 3  
But Baker Hughes  momentum was also aided by a positive note on Dec  11 from Stephens analyst Tommy Moll  who initiated coverage on the company with an overweight rating and a  28 per share price target  Moll argued at the time that Baker Hughes could see margin improvements given its  self help  initiatives  and is  not only the most compelling large cap in oilfield services and equipment  but also an underappreciated industrial investment  
Now what
Indeed  Baker Hughes was one of the 10 best performing energy stocks of 2019  helped by new liquefied natural gas projects  cost synergies realized by integrating General Electric s energy business into its own operations  and GE steadily selling down its stake in the company to remove an overhang on the share price  But if Moll was correct  Baker Hughes stock could still have some room to run ",2020-01-06,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pedj-,2053364
97159,318674,BKR,Saudis trumpet  56 billion deals as conference ends amid partial boycott,news,"By Andrew Torchia and Marwa Rashad RIYADH  Reuters    Saudi Arabia said it signed  56 billion of deals at an investment conference this week and expected the United States to remain a key business partner despite a partial boycott of the event over the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi  Over two dozen top officials and executives from the United States and Europe  including U S  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and chief executives of big banks  canceled their participation in the conference over the killing of Khashoggi inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct  2  There was concern that  temporarily at least  commercial ties with the West could be damaged as the blow to Riyadh s reputation and the risk of economic sanctions over the Khashoggi affair made it harder to enter new deals  Still  the three day Future Investment Initiative conference drew hundreds of businessmen and government officials from around the world to a palatial venue in Riyadh  aiming to attract foreign capital to support Saudi economic reforms    There were more than 25 deals signed worth  56 billion   Saudi Energy Minister Khalid Al Falih told state television on Thursday  adding that U S  companies accounted for most of those contracts  He added   The U S  will remain a key part of the Saudi economy because the interests that tie us are bigger than what is being weakened by the failed boycotting campaign of the conference    Saudi Arabia at first denied any involvement in Khashoggi s death but a Saudi official eventually attributed it to a botched attempt to return him to the kingdom  Turkey has dismissed Saudi efforts to blame rogue operatives and urged Riyadh to search  top to bottom  for those responsible  Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman told international investors at the conference that the furor over the killing would not derail the kingdom s economic and social reform drive  In protest at the Khashoggi case  British billionaire Richard Branson suspended discussions with Saudi Arabia s Public Investment Fund  which hosted the conference  over a planned  1 billion investment in his group s space ventures  On Wednesday  New York City s chief pension fund official urged financial market index providers to reconsider decisions to add Saudi Arabia to their emerging markets products    decisions that are expected to attract at least  15 billion of foreign funds into the country next year  However  Saudi officials mounted a business as usual campaign at the conference  and many of the big Western banks whose top executives boycotted the event sent sizeable teams of lower ranking executives to Riyadh  The teams met Saudi officials on the sidelines of the conference  bankers said  Few senior executives from China and Japan announced they were withdrawing from the event  putting pressure on the Western firms to maintain a presence or risk losing business      A senior European banker at the conference said that while the Saudi image among some international bond investors had been damaged  investment patterns would probably return to normal in a couple months   Business has a short memory   he said  Although many European countries have voiced concern over the Khashoggi case  they are wary of taking further action because they do not want to jeopardize billions of dollars in defense contracts with Saudi Arabia  several diplomats in the Gulf told Reuters  Germany is so far alone in halting arms sales to the world s largest oil exporter  Other European countries have largely limited their reaction to calling for those responsible to be held accountable  Britain said on Wednesday it was joining the United States in revoking visas of people said to be involved  DEALS State oil firm Saudi Aramco said it had signed deals with 15 international partners worth more than  34 billion at the conference  The firms included U S  oil field services giants Schlumberger  Halliburton  N HAL  and Baker Hughes  N BHGE   There were also deals to bring foreign investment and technology into Saudi Arabia s education  health care and housing construction industries  Some of the deals were memorandums of understanding which may never progress to the stage of firm contracts  and other deals had already been planned for months  so there was a strong element of public relations in the  56 billion total  Nevertheless  Economy Minister Mohammed al Tuwaijri told the conference that the government had received many expressions of interest from Asian and European companies in buying Saudi state assets  An ambitious privatization program was announced two years ago but there have been very few actual deals since then  Tuwaijri said on Thursday  however  that the program would proceed in the next few months now that legal and regulatory problems had been resolved   From now until the first quarter of 2019 we have four opportunities in silos and grains   he said  adding that deals in the education  healthcare and water desalinisation sectors would also be offered in this period  
Finance Minister Mohammed al Jadaan disclosed positive figures for government finances  which have been a major concern for foreign investors since oil prices plunged in 2014  Non oil revenue in the third quarter jumped 48 percent from a year ago while spending surged 25 percent  he said ",2018-10-25,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/deals-signed-at-saudi-conference-worth-56-billion-energy-minister-1658991,1658991

dollar agreements  mainly energy deals  despite a boycott of the event by dozens of high level Western politicians  bankers and top executives scheduled to speak at the three day gathering that ended on Thursday  Yet the event paled in comparison to the 2017 inaugural investment conference  when robots roamed the venue as the kingdom turned its focus to the promise of new technology and announced

Future Investment Initiative  FII  forum this year  vowing  big numbers  in a sector  far away from oil   But when the final session ended  no such announcement had been made   It s going back to old economy while the FII was supposed to be about the future  Old economy coming to the rescue of the new economy   said one participant at the investment conference  Saudi Arabia signed 25 agreements on Tuesday worth more than  55 billion in the energy  petrochemicals  infrastructure and transportation sectors  Out of the total  state oil giant Saudi Aramco alone signed memoranda of understanding worth  34 billion with some of its key longtime partners such as France s  Total   PA TOTF   and international service companies Schlumberger  Halliburton  N HAL  and Baker Hughes  N BHGE   Asked by reporters about the impact of the Khashoggi killing on Aramco  chief executive Amin Nasser answered with a question of his own   How much did we sign today     How much was signed by Aramco  34

 al Falih  Nasser and Total up on stage  and had them sign stuff that those who know energy already knew   Total signed deals for engineering studies to build a petrochemical complex in Jubail  where it already has a refinery venture with Aramco on the eastern coast of Saudi Arabia  It also signed an agreement for a possible investment of a retail service station network with Aramco  Both announcements are not new and have been in the works for months   TEST OF FRIENDSHIP The French oil major s Chief Executive Patrick Pouyann  issued a statement in support of Saudi Arabia  which is facing one of its toughest political crises in decades  before he flew to Riyadh to take part in the event as a panelist   Some business leaders have decided that the circumstances do not allow them to visit Riyadh  I respect their choice  Total has never been in favor of sanctions and isolation   for example  against Russia  Iran or Qatar   and nor do we support boycotts   Pouyann  said   Total has partnered with Saudi Aramco for 40 years   Several Western countries including key ally the United States were discussing the prospect of sanctions against the world s top oil exporter  Russian President Vladimir Putin  whose country has been cooperating closely with the kingdom on oil markets  said he could not justify ruining relations with Riyadh  Russia sent a delegation of more than 30 entrepreneurs and leaders of major Russian companies to the FII  Riyadh and Moscow are leading the so called OPEC  alliance in managing the oil market and the two major producers coordinate on output policies closely  African and Arab leaders  including close ally King Abdullah of Jordan  also rallied around Riyadh  Leaders from Bahrain  the United Arab Emirates and Lebanon walked beside Prince Mohammed as he entered the main hall on Wednesday  The prime minister of Pakistan  the presidents of Gabon and Senegal and the deputy prime minister of Ethiopia spoke onstage  In sectors like banking and consulting  where Western companies have a deep presence in the kingdom  senior executives canceled their engagements at the conference but still sent regional representatives for appearances and meetings   Credit Suisse   SIX CSGN   HSBC  Mastercard  NYSE MA  and Siemens remained  strategic partners  for the event  while consulting firms Deloitte  EY  McKinsey  Oliver Wyman  PwC  Strategy  and the Boston Consulting Group stayed on as  knowledge partners   Global investment banks  which according to Refinitiv data earned  2 7 billion in fees in Saudi Arabia since 2000  all sent delegations  even if their top bosses stayed away      HSBC  which has a 40 percent stake in a Saudi bank and has played an active role in the kingdom in recent years  had one of the largest teams with around 10 people  including Samir Assaf  the head of its investment bank       An executive from a Chinese financial firm said some Western executives there were keeping lower profiles because of the Khashoggi affair   A lot of the movers and shakers are represented here  you just don t see them   On the first day  Saudi officials thanked friends who came   Let me first express my appreciation and gratitude for the many friends and partners who are with us today as we all know these are difficult days for us in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia   said Falih   We are going through a crisis of sorts   On Wednesday  Prince Mohammed broke his silence about the killing of Khashoggi  one of his prominent critics  vowing to bring those responsible to justice  Striking a defiant tone  he took the stage for a panel discussion  touting Saudi Arabia s reform drive and highlighting the promise of Middle East economies  even Qatar s with which the kingdom is in a protracted dispute   Any success for the kingdom of Saudi Arabia is very contagious to the region   said Bahrain Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad al Khalifa   In a remark that played well in the main conference chamber  where Saudis formed a larger proportion than in 2017  Prince Mohammed added   I think that the new Europe is the Middle East

97359,318874,BKR,U S  shale oil braces for the unfamiliar in 2017  inflation,news,"By Swetha Gopinath and Arathy S Nair  Reuters    U S  shale producers are facing their first production cost increase in five years in 2017 as industry activity picks up and energy service providers hike fees to take a bigger share of the profits generated by higher oil prices  Drilling innovations over the past decade have generated a dizzying reduction in the cost of pumping oil from shale formations across the United States   the world s largest energy consumer   triggering an energy revolution and a production boom  When that boom ended with the onset of a two year global price war in 2014  shale producers responded with even deeper cost cuts  Technological breakthroughs allowed producers to wring more oil from the rock and halved the per barrel price needed to turn a profit  But for the first time since 2012  shale producers will see a rise in break even production costs this year  according to data from Rystad Energy  which surveys producers  The per barrel costs will rise an average of  1 60 across the shale patch to  36 50  For a chart of the fall and recent rise of shale oil production costs  see   The drive to lower costs has run its course for now  and service firms are leveraging power in the more crowded oilfields  such as the Permian basin in West Texas  to eke out higher payments from producers   Firms that supply rigs  crews  technological expertise are clamoring to take back discounts they extended during the slump  in some cases asking for between 10 percent and 15 percent more as the number of rigs and crews deployed in the fields rises  Producers expect that to continue   In the Permian  activity has picked up  and going forward we would expect to see some pressure    Chevron  Corp s  N CVX  Chief Executive John Watson said on an earnings call last month   Oil service providers acknowledge  however  that their price hikes may not stick until drillers generate enough demand to burn through the remaining spare capacity in the oil service sector  In a securities filing on Feb  8  service provider  Baker Hughes  Inc  N BHI  cautioned that drilling  activity needs to increase meaningfully before excess service capacity can be substantially absorbed and meaningful pricing recovery takes place   PERMANENT COST SAVINGS Service inflation represents only a fraction of the expected rise in international crude prices this year  A Reuters poll of 31 analysts and economists forecast benchmark U S  oil prices will average  56 08 per barrel in 2017  up from  43 47 last year   Between half and two thirds of the cost savings achieved during the oil price slump are likely to become permanent even if oil prices tick higher  according to industry experts and company estimates  Shale companies deployed more rigs than they have done in sixteen months last week  and have steadily increased the number in the field to take advantage of crude prices that have mostly held at more than  50 per barrel since the world s top oil exporters  both OPEC and non OPEC  agreed to cut supplies in late November  A further rise in the oil price could quickly stir drilling activity across the United States  which would in turn accelerate service fee and labor cost inflation  That is a worrying development for an industry that has lately gotten used to costs heading only down  There were 207 hydraulic fracturing fleets at work in January across the U S   up 20 percent from last June  according to data from Houston based Primary Vision  which tracks oilfield service equipment usage    Pioneer Natural Resources  Co  N PXD  has its own fracturing crews  which it hopes will help offset rising service costs elsewhere   I believe we will be able to keep our inflation numbers down to more like approximately 5 percent  but the internal plan is to make sure that cost inflation is offset by our efficiency gains   Pioneer Natural Chief Executive Tim Dove said on a post earnings call earlier this month  HEDGING AGAINST INFLATION Other companies have locked in contracts to insulate themselves from the rise in service and labor costs  WPX Energy  a leading shale oil producer in North Dakota and Texas  has sought to protect against price inflation through contracts for sand  stimulant  equipment and services  said CEO Rick Muncrief in an interview  Other companies including  Hess Corp   N HES  hope to beat the inflation forecasts with yet more efficiency gains  Hess hopes to wring more barrels out of each well with new techniques that allow it to conduct hydraulic fracturing at 60 spots along a well  up from the usual 50  president Greg Hill said on a conference call last month   In addition  using more sand and other proppants   used to keep fissures in shale rock open   in the wells should help boost production  Hill said  Oil producers can already count on many cost savings achieved in recent years  such as reductions in the time it takes to drill wells  said G rcan G len  an energy economist at the Bureau of Economic Geology at the University of Texas at Austin       Once you know better how to do things  you re not going to change that when oil prices move higher   said G len  But the possibility of more deep cost reductions are  for the most part  gone  A number of companies saw break even costs at the wellhead   the price required to profit from oil at a new well   stagnate between the third and fourth quarters  data from Rystad Energy showed

97360,318875,BKR,U S  shale firms lift reserves while oil majors take Canada hit,news,"By Swetha Gopinath and Arathy S Nair  Reuters    Top shale oil producers are lifting their crude and gas reserve estimates for the first time in two years   even as many major oil companies are cutting the same projections and taking write downs on more expensive fields  Rising confidence in the growth prospects of the U S  shale patch is in striking contrast to the retreat of the world s top oil firms from the high cost oil sands of Canada  The increase in reported shale reserves is driven by new drilling efficiencies  leaner operations and improved well completion techniques  industry experts said   Many wells that were not profitable a year ago have become profitable  because those advances have cut the cost of producing from shale  said Per Magnus Nysveen  a senior partner at consultancy Rystad Energy  The top 20 U S  shale firms   a group that includes  Pioneer Natural Resources  Co  N PXD  and Chesapeake Energy Corp   N CHK    hiked their proved oil reserves by nearly 7 percent on average in 2016  according to a Reuters review of year end financial filings  While shale producers reap the benefits of technological advances  oil majors that bet billions of dollars on giant long term projects in Canada have taken a hit  On Thursday  Royal Dutch Shell plc  L RDSa  became the latest energy giant to quit on oil sands  Shell said it would remove 2 billion barrels of oil from its reserves and take a  1 3 billion to  1 5 billion after tax impairment in a retreat from most of its Canadian oil sands operations   Exxon Mobil  Corp  N XOM  and ConocoPhillips  N COP  last month reported total reductions of nearly 5 billion barrels of proved reserves from oil sands projects after deciding they could not be pumped at current prices  Overall  the 10 U S  oil companies with the largest holdings in conventional oil fields reduced their reserves by 13 4 percent in 2016  according to a Reuters  analysis of year end regulatory filings  SHALE TURNAROUND In 2015  the same shale firms  a group which do not operate in conventional oil fields  reported that proved reserves had fallen by 13 percent on average as low oil prices made many fields unprofitable  Firms operating in shale oil fields use hydraulic fracturing to tap oil in rock formations that cannot be accessed by conventional drilling methods  The reserves reflect oil and gas that can be profitably tapped in the next five years and are valued by investors as a measure of future revenue growth  Greater reserves also can give the companies more borrowing power  The 2016 shale reserve gains  while modest  came as conventional drillers were paring back their own estimates as oil prices remain below the levels needed to make output from higher cost fields profitable  The cost of pumping a barrel of oil from Canada s oil sands is much higher than the cost of producing oil from shale   The reported 2016 increases in shale reserves are based on U S  Securities and Exchange Commission rules and use an average West Texas Intermediate  CLc1  oil price of  42 75 per barrel in 2016   The oil price on Thursday fell below  50 per barrel amid worries about growing crude inventories  especially from shale producers   Shale producers  reported natural gas reserves were based on a  2 49 per million British Thermal Units  MMBtu  average price in 2016  down from  2 58 a year earlier   Recent production increases from U S  shale fields have rattled OPEC producers aiming to pare global crude inventories  In remarks to industry executives at an energy conference in Houston this week  Saudi Oil Minister Khalid al Falih warned that OPEC won t accept shale oil rivals getting  free rides  from its production cutbacks  The implied threat was that OPEC could reverse the output cuts  which took effect in January  and flood the world market with oil  kicking off another price war  The curbs have boosted oil prices and in turn revived the shale industry in the United States after a two year downturn  BOOST FROM TECHNOLOGY The technological improvements in shale fields include the ability to drill further into the earth  both vertically and horizontally  creating more underground sites in each well for hydraulic fracturing    Reserve growth really comes down to better well design   said Michael Dynan  vice president for portfolio and strategic development at Schramm  a manufacturer of drilling rigs  Such changes are helping oil firms tap more oil and gas while keeping spending low   Continental Resources Inc   N CLR  says it found twice the reserves per dollar spent in 2016 than in 2014  More recently  producers have also embraced big data analysis techniques that are providing  a lot of insight into how best to drill a well  where to locate a well and the fracking techniques to use   said Binu Mathew  who heads digital products at GE Oil   Gas  which is merging with  Baker Hughes  Inc  N BHI    Such advances are only the beginning of the shale oil industry s efforts to wring more oil from wells for less money  said Stephen Ingram  southern region director of Halliburton Co s  N HAL  completion and production business  HIGHER CONFIDENCE Another factor in aiding reserves is the sharp decline last year in fees charged by oilfield service suppliers  Oilfield service firms are looking to take back some of the discounts they extended during the downturn  but shale producers say they expect to hold the line on expenses as they continue to expand production  Some of the reported gains in reserves are coming from un drilled acreage  which makes them less certain  At least six of the companies Reuters analyzed reported a rise in proved reserves based on undeveloped properties in 2016  Investors have increasing faith in the profit potential of such undeveloped properties  however   Confidence is very high that they are going to be turned into proved  producing assets   said Todd Heltman  a senior energy analyst at investment firm Neuberger Berman  Still  some investors worry that shale firms are becoming too aggressive about booking undeveloped reserves  
 There is no geological risk here  but if your wells don t live up to your expectations  you have negative reserve revisions   said Bill Costello  a portfolio manager at Westwood Holdings Group  referring to downgrading proved reserves to uneconomic to tap categories ",2017-03-09,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/u.s.-shale-firms-lift-reserves-while-oil-majors-take-canada-hit-465035,465035

price collapsed after the company said it had overstated its reserves by 20 percent  No listed oil major has seen its stated deposits stay unchanged for the past 30 years   Aramco declined to comment   Saudi Aramco does not comment on rumor or speculation   a company spokesman said  Gaffney  Cline and Associates also declined to comment  while DeGolyer did not respond to a request for comment  A reserves total that is significantly above or below the 261 billion figure is likely to affect Aramco s potential value  Earlier phases of the audit have supported Aramco s statements on the total size of deposits  Aramco is showing all its data to the auditors  the sources said  and is using two firms rather than one in an effort to bolster confidence that the process is not a rubber stamping of Aramco figures    Our reserves have been partially audited and are bigger than we actually booked   Falih said this week   On every metric  Aramco will surprise analysts on the upside   lowest cost  highest cash flow  solid reserves that will be certified by third party agencies   WHAT S IN THE GROUND  Historically Aramco has provided little detail publicly on its reserves other than total volume  Publicly traded oil companies such as BP and Shell with assets distributed globally give more detail than just a headline figure  including reserves by geographic location and whether they are developed or undeveloped  However  they do not give reserves by individual field   and for Aramco that is precisely what investors want  because its oil is concentrated in one country  Saudi Arabia  Sadad al Husseini  a former Aramco senior executive and now energy consultant  said Aramco has extensive details on its reserves in every field but it was not common practice for national oil companies to identify their deposits on that basis    What it might do initially is give a corporate summary and break it down by crude grade with more data to follow   he said  Aramco s precise level of disclosure has yet to be decided  the source familiar with the plans said  He noted that Western majors do not list reserves by field   There is no way Aramco will be giving field by field detailed reserves   another industry source familiar with the plans said  adding that the firm considers reserves decline rates and field maturity as sensitive  non public data  The question of how much oil is left at the biggest Saudi field  Ghawar  has long intrigued market watchers    What they need to offer is a package of assets with value chain  operating and financial detail comparable to that made available by integrated oil companies   said Jason Kenney  head of European oil and gas research at Santander  MC SAN   
 I doubt you re going to get a full breakdown of the 261 billion barrels   but maybe the IPO is not about a full upstream offering either  To attract the investors  you ve got to offer the same level of transparency as alternative investments  ",2017-03-10,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/trillion-dollar-question-looms-as-aramco-audits-oil-reserves-465222,465222

97363,318878,BKR,Undaunted by oil bust  financiers pour billions into U S  shale,news,By Ernest Scheyder HOUSTON  Reuters    Investors who took a hit last year when dozens of U S  shale producers filed for bankruptcy are already making big new bets on the industry s resurgence  In the first quarter  private equity funds raised  19 8 billion for energy ventures   nearly three times the total in the same period last year  according to financial data provider Preqin   The quickening pace of investments from private equity  along with hedge funds and investment banks  comes even as the recovery in oil prices  CLc1  from an 8 year low has stalled at just over  50 per barrel amid a stubborn global supply glut  The shale sector has become increasingly attractive to investors not because of rising oil prices  but rather because producers have achieved startling cost reductions   slashing up to half the cost of pumping a barrel in the past two years  Investors also believe the glut will dissipate as demand for oil steadily rises   That gives financiers confidence that they can squeeze increasing returns from shale fields   without price gains   as technology continues to cut costs  So they are backing shale oil veterans and assembling companies that can quickly start pumping   Shale funders look at the economics today and see a lot of projects that work in the  40 to  55 range  per barrel of oil  said Howard Newman  head of private equity fund Pine Brook Road Partners  which last month committed to invest  300 million in startup Admiral Permian Resources LLC to drill in West Texas  Data on investments by hedge funds and other nonpublic investment firms is scant  but the rush of new private equity money indicates broader enthusiasm in shale plays   Demand for oil has been more robust than anyone imagined three years ago   said Mark Papa  chief executive of Centennial Resource Development Inc  O CDEV    Papa referred to the beginning of an international oil price crash in 2014  which took many firms in the shale sector to the brink of bankruptcy  Centennial is a Permian oil producer backed by private equity fund Riverstone  Papa  a well known shale industry entrepreneur  built EOG Resources Inc  N EOG  into one of the most profitable U S  shale producers before he retired in 2013  The chance to further develop the Permian  he said  was enough for him to come out of retirement to deliver one of its bigger recent successes  The value of Riverstone s original  500 million investment has grown nearly four times since Centennial s initial public offering last fall   A TON OF PRIVATE CAPITAL   Riverstone this year copied the Centennial model  putting experienced managers atop a startup charged with acquiring operations or assets  The equity fund hired Jim Hackett   the former head of shale producer Anadarko Petroleum Corp  N APC    to run the newly created  Silver Run Acquisition Corp  II  O SRUNU   Hedge funds Highfields Capital Management LP and Adage Capital Management have taken stakes in the new company  which has a valuation of about  1 billion after going public last month   Private equity fund NGP Natural Resources XI LP invested  524 million last fall in Luxe Energy LLC  a shale producer formed in 2015 by former  Statoil   OL STL  executives   NGP s investment was effectively a bet that Luxe could repeat its success of early 2016   Then  NGP contributed about  250 million to Luxe  which used the money to acquire land in the Permian   and sold it seven months later for a double digit profit  This year s drilling rush could be tested if global supplies grow too fast or if demand cools  The U S  drilling rig count is rising at its fastest pace in six years and U S  crude stockpile are close to 533 million barrels   near an all time high and enough to supply the United States for 25 days   But some investors say even a decline of  10 in the oil price would not dissuade them   There is a ton of private capital to invest in the U S  oil industry   said Gerrit Nicholas  co founder of private equity fund Orion Energy Partners   Nicholas said he is comfortable lending even if oil prices fall to  40 per barrel  Orion this month helped finance the expansion of a Florida oil storage terminal  a move predicated in part on growth in U S  oil exports  Since the U S  lifted its oil export ban last year  crude exports have climbed to about 746 000 barrels per day  according to U S  Energy Information Administration data   BETTING ON OPEC S SELF INTEREST The oil industry has seen boom and bust cycles since the first well was drilled about 160 years ago  and industry and government have sought to tame the volatility for just as long   Texas regulators set output quotas from the 1920s through the 1970s  a practice that served as a model for the creation of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries  OPEC   The U S  boom has caused concern among OPEC member nations ahead of its meeting next month in Vienna  where they will consider extending oil production cuts that first took effect in January  Investors believe the cartel s members will extend the cuts because it is in OPEC s financial interest to prevent a steep drop in oil prices   That likely will keep money flowing to nimble U S  oil producers and the companies that provide them with services and equipment  Investors see the United States as the new swing producer  having the ability to quickly increase supply in response to any sudden increase in demand   The U S   with its substantial inventory capacity and swing oil producer status  should see strong onshore activity for the next few years   said Charlie Leykum  founder of private equity fund CSL Capital Management LLC  in an interview  CSL has invested in several oilfield service business in the past year  It partnered with Goldman Sachs  N GS  and  Baker Hughes  Inc  N BHI   for instance  to create a shale services company  Centennial s Papa expects the flood of fresh capital to push U S  production up 23 percent to 11 3 million barrels a day  bpd  by 2020  based on strong demand for oil   We re still in a hydrocarbon based economy   said Papa  For a graphic on

deals are trading significantly below their intended acquisition prices on worries that the deals will die  presenting an opportunity for some big name investors  The deal spreads span 10  20 or 30 percent in some cases  against long term averages in the low single digits  and funds such as T  Rowe Price and Franklin Mutual Advisers have made significant additions to target company shares  according to Thomson Reuters data   It s unclear whether the funds are seizing on an arbitrage opportunity or are scooping up shares for other reasons  such as seeing value in the target company regardless of whether the deals go through  The funds declined to comment  But shareholders stand to profit handsomely in the event the deals win approval  Investors may be more wary about deals

 purchase of pharmaceutical rival Allergan  N AGN  fell apart in the wake of new tax rules  Risks to the pending deals stem largely from antitrust concerns  particularly in healthcare industry  or because the buyers are Chinese companies  said investors   The market is pricing these risks properly in our view   said John Orrico  chief investment officer of New York based Water Island Capital

21 percent below Aetna s offer of about  34 billion  DOUBTS THAT DEALS WILL CLOSE  The wide spreads indicate strong doubts that deals will close  adding some risk to owning the target company shares  Investors who buy now hoping to profit may find that a scuttled deal drags the stock down lower   But the wider the spread  the closer the shares may be to their price without a merger premium  That could mean less of a fall should the deal collapse   Take Cigna  At  126 a share  the stock is trading below where it was a year ago when news of the deal broke  That could soothe current investors

 I think the trend is that there s a decline of stocks worldwide and the stock building rate is slowing down considerably  we expect towards the stock draw will start to kick in   Birol told Reuters 
In addition  Birol said he would like to see upstream oil investments start to rebound in 2016  following a decline of roughly 40  over the last two years  The IEA expects Non OPEC oil production to decline by 700 000 bpd in 2016  Birol said  representing the largest annual output decline in more than 20 years  Last month  the U S  Department of Energy forecasted that Non OPEC production will fall by 400 000 bpd this year  amounting to the sharpest decrease in eight years  Birol hopes to see a rebound in U S  capital expenditures in 2017 after massive declines in each of the last two years  as crude futures have fallen more than 60  from their peak of  115 a barrel in June  2015

On Wednesday morning  the U S  Energy Information Administration  EIA  reported that crude inventories nationwide decreased by 4 94 million barrels for the week ending on April 1  falling sharply below consensus estimates of a build of 2 85 million barrels  As U S  crude stockpiles remain near all time record highs  any considerable draws are viewed as extremely bullish for persistently low oil prices  Since rallying from 13 year lows in mid February  oil futures have traded in near lockstep with U S  equities

97493,319008,BKR,U S  lawsuit against activist ValueAct puts mutual funds on alert,news,"By Michael Flaherty and Ross Kerber NEW YORK BOSTON  Reuters    The U S  government s lawsuit against ValueAct Capital targets one activist investor but could call into question routine practices across the  16 trillion mutual fund industry  according to attorneys and industry representatives  The U S  Department of Justice last week alleged that the hedge fund improperly classified two company investments as passive   and therefore exempt from disclosure requirements   while taking an activist role with executives  ValueAct disputes the claim  Some communications the government cites as evidence are similar to discussions that are increasingly common between traditional  buy and hold funds and companies in their portfolios  The case comes as active and passive investors work more together to pressure management at underperforming companies  Activists court passive shareholders before launching such a campaign  and passive investors recruit activists to agitate  several activist managers told Reuters   Traditional funds may need to reassess their compliance with disclosure laws  according to a memo to clients from Davis Polk  a New York law firm with expertise in financial services   Such an institution will have to examine whether it can claim to have a truly  passive  intent   said the memo  issued in response to the ValueAct case  Those firms could include  for instance  T  Rowe Price Group  O TROW   BlackRock Inc  N BLK  and Vanguard Group  Spokespeople at those companies declined to comment  and representatives of seven additional fund firms contacted by Reuters declined to comment or said executives were unavailable  The Justice Department also declined to comment  An industry trade group said the case could restrain shareholders from addressing important issues with corporate executives and board directors   The DOJ case could have a chilling effect on dialogues between companies and their shareholders   said Amy Borrus  deputy director at the Council of Institutional Investors  a Washington D C  based nonprofit whose members include pensions  endowments and major mutual funds  For a graphic showing the increase in company shareholder communication programs  see  Competition for better returns has led some big mutual fund firms to take a more active role  weighing in on issues such as CEO pay and corporate governance  Vanguard Chairman and CEO William McNabb  in a speech last June in New York  described how the firm increasingly addresses matters of concern with companies in its portfolio   We ve become more targeted in whom we mailed letters to and more prescriptive in our language   McNabb said  For example  Vanguard sent out 500 letters in March 2015 to independent chairs and lead directors outlining six principles of corporate governance  McNabb said  SIX WORDS At the heart of the ValueAct case are six words in a 40 year old law that requires disclosure of certain investments to assist the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission in antitrust review of mergers  The intent is to prevent investors from secretly buying up stakes to agitate for industry consolidation  The Hart Scott Rodino Act requires all buyers of voting securities worth more than  76 3 million to notify the government  unless they were bought  solely for the purpose of investment   The government alleges ValueAct failed to disclose a  2 5 billion position in two companies that planned to merge   oilfield services peers  Halliburton Co   N HAL  and  Baker Hughes  Industries Inc   N BHI  ValueAct is fighting the case and has said that its outreach to the companies was standard shareholder input and not active investing  The firm declined to comment for this story  Among the evidence asserted by the government is a December 2014 meeting with the Baker Hughes chief financial officer  where ValueAct s chief executive discussed gaps in the company s North American margins and other underperforming areas  The government also cited a ValueAct email sent to Halliburton s CEO in July 2015 to schedule a meeting about executive compensation  Davis Polk points out in its client memo that it s common for investors with stakes deemed passive to discuss those topics with corporate management   It does seem to be     a typical subject of discussion   wrote the firm  which represents Baker Hughes in the merger  BLURRED BOUNDARIES John Briggs  an antitrust attorney with the law firm Axinn  Veltrop   Harkrider LLP  called the case a one off enforcement effort against ValueAct that does not necessarily signal a broader crackdown or a change in legal interpretation  But Briggs agreed that the case highlights the blurring boundaries between activist and traditional fund managers  A ValueAct win could further cloud the issue  while a government victory could prompt major investors to dial back pressure on companies  A managing director at a large asset manager  speaking on condition of anonymity  said that he and his colleagues routinely discuss business improvement and executive compensation with company executives  believing such topics do not cross legal lines  The ValueAct case could change that interpretation  the manager said  The lawsuit could take months or years to resolve  Any resulting limits on fund managers could clash with a separate effort led by the U S  Securities and Exchange Commission in the early 1990s encouraging more dialogue between investors and public corporations

On the New York Mercantile Exchange  WTI crude for January delivery fell 0 72  to  36 50 a barrel 
Overnight  crude futures plunged to fresh seven year lows after OPEC reported on Thursday that it pumped oil at its highest level in more than three years in November  exacerbating longstanding concerns related to the excessive supply glut on global energy markets 
U S  crude futures fell to their lowest level since February  2009 in the U S  morning session  before rallying slightly just before the close  Since peaking above  100 a barrel 18 months ago  the front month contract for WTI crude has plummeted more than 80

Last month  OPEC pumped 31 695 million barrels of crude per day  an increase of 230 100 from its level in October  OPEC s daily output has eclipsed its production ceiling of 30 million barrels per day by at least 1 million for the majority of the year  The world s largest oil cartel triggered a prolonged downturn in crude prices last November by ignoring calls to slash production in an effort to maintain market share 
OPEC s production  excluding output from Iraq  fell slightly for the month  Iraq  though  increased production by 248  000 barrels per day in November  representing a spike of 247 5  from its level in October  Saudi Arabia  the world s largest exporter  pumped 10 13 million bpd last month  a reduction of 25 000 bpd  Production in Iran remained flat at 2 876 million bpd  Iran could ramp up production by as much as 1 million bpd next year  as Western powers ease a wide range of economic sanctions against the Gulf state

In its December oil market report  released on Friday  the Paris based International Energy Agency  IEA  projected global demand growth in 2016 to slow considerably  widening the gulf in the supply demand imbalance worldwide  Next year  the IEA anticipates that global demand will grow by 1 2 million barrels per day  down from its 2015 expectations for growth of 1 8 million bpd  
At the same time  the IEA expects non OPEC production to decrease by 600 000 bpd in 2016 as high priced U S  shale producers continue to get squeezed out of the market from crashing oil prices  The agency anticipates that U S  domestic output will decline by 415 000 bpd  comprising nearly 70  of the total non OPEC declines  By comparison  global production outside of the powerful cartel surged by an estimated 2 4 million bpd in 2014  contributing to the current supply glut  
Shortly after Thanksgiving last year  OPEC rattled the energy industry with a strategic decision to leave its production ceiling above 30 million barrels per day in an effort to defend its market share  The tactic appears to be working  Since the audacious move  market share from U S  producers has flattened while OPEC has turned market share losses into gains  according to a fourth quarter report from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas  
 These trends will likely continue   the report stated   Overall  the OPEC strategy is one of collateral damage  where all parties are losing but some can sustain more losses than others   
On Thursday  OPEC said it pumped 31 695 million barrels of crude per day in November  an increase of 230 100 from its level a month earlier  While production in Saudi Arabia fell slightly by 25 000 bpd to 10 13 million bpd last month  it was offset by a 248 000 bpd increase in output from Iraq  OPEC supply is expected to increase exponentially next year  when Iran could ramp up production by much as 1 million bpd if a slew of economic sanctions are eased against the Gulf state 
 Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies have the least to gain from supply cuts  they enjoy significant fiscal buffers and risk losing market share to other countries if output is trimmed   the report from the Dallas Fed added   As a consequence  OPEC will further increase its market share  while U S  producers experience a flattening or even a decrease in the near future  
OPEC s strategy last November triggered a prolonged battle with U S  shale producers  flooding global markets with excess supply  As a result  crude prices have fallen sharply by more than 60  over the last year  
 OPEC s decision to scrap its official production ceiling and keep the taps open is a de facto acknowledgment of current oil market reality   the IEA said in the report   The freewheeling OPEC policy does not   for now   alter the status quo on its supply  
Oil services firm  Baker Hughes   N BHI  said Friday that U S  oil rigs fell by 21 to 524 for the week ending on Dec  4  The rig count fell to its lowest level since April  2010  providing further indications of forthcoming declines in U S  output

A day earlier  futures spiked 10 2 cents  or 4 51   after data showed natural gas supplies rose less than expected last week 
For the week  the December natural gas contract gained 5 0 cents  or 2 15   the second straight weekly rise 
Updated weather forecasting models released Friday afternoon showed a return to cool weather in the U S  Midwest and mid Atlantic regions  following a warm spell earlier in the month 
Natural gas prices have closely tracked weather forecasts in recent weeks  as traders try to gauge the impact of shifting outlooks on early winter heating demand 
The heating season from November through March is the peak demand period for U S  gas consumption 
Meanwhile  the U S  Energy Information Administration said Thursday natural gas supplies in storage rose by 52 billion cubic feet last week  below expectations for an increase of 60 billion 
That compared with builds of 63 billion cubic feet in the prior week  91 billion cubic feet in the same week last year  while the five year average change for the week is an increase of 68 billion cubic feet 
Total U S  natural gas storage stood at 3 929 trillion cubic feet  3 9  above the five year average for this time of year and almost 10  higher than levels at this time a year ago 
Last spring  supplies were 55  below the five year average  indicating producers have more than made up for all of last winter s unusually strong demand

On the New York Mercantile Exchange  crude oil for delivery in December rose 0 86  to  44 44 a barrel 
On Sunday  China said the October trade surplus came in at  61 64 billion  a tad more than  60 34 billion in September  with exports down 6 9  as imports slumped 18 8  
October s trade surplus came in at a new monthly record due to a steeper drop in imports rather than any improvement in exports  The strong trade surplus partially explained a surprise rise in China s foreign exchange reservesannounced on Saturday 
China s foreign exchange reserves rose by  11 387 billion in October from September  the first monthly increase in six months  suggesting the wave of capital outflows that s spooked markets may be abating 
While the PBOC may be happy with the surplus  which helps offset capital outflows and ease yuan depreciation pressure  both exports and imports fell more than expected  pointing to weak demand at home and abroad 
Imports have now dropped for 12 straight months  and have fallen by more than 10  for three consecutive months since the PBOC s yuan devaluation in early August which eroded the currency s purchasing power

The Labor Department reported that the U S  economy added 271 000 jobs last month  the largest increase since December and easily surpassing expectations of 180 000  The unemployment rate inched down to 5 0   the lowest since April 2008

Despite the tighter outlook for North America  output remains robust in other countries  Saudi Arabia and other Gulf OPEC members have indicated they will continue to stick to their policy of defending market share by keeping production high 
Oil prices have lost nearly 60  since last summer as lingering concerns over a glut in world markets drove down prices 
In the week ahead  investors will be looking ahead to Friday s U S  data on retail sales  producer prices and consumer sentiment for fresh indications on the likelihood of a December rate hike

Crude prices have fallen more than 45  over the last year since OPEC roiled global markets with its decision to leave its production ceiling above 30 million barrels per day in an effort to maintain market share  Any major declines in U S  shale production could provide signals that OPEC s strategy is prevailing

On the Intercontinental Exchange  ICE   Brent crude for November delivery wavered between  51 30 and  53 51 a barrel before closing at  53 11  up 1 77 or 3 41  on the session  Brent futures exceeded  53 a barrel for only the second time since Sept  1  Meanwhile  the spread between the international and U S  domestic benchmarks of crude stood at  3 64  just above Wednesday s level of  3 62 at the close of trading 
In prepared remarks for an address in front of the International Monetary Fund s International Monetary and Financial Committee  El Badri predicted that global demand will increase this year at a level considerably higher than previously anticipated  Citing stronger than expected demand in the U S  and Europe  as well as South Korea  El Badri forecasted that global oil demand will spike by 1 5 million barrels per day for 2015 
 The US has shown bullish oil demand growth for the first eight months of this year  with gasoline and jet fuel leading gains  Gasoline consumption was encouraged by lower oil pump prices  in addition to improving car sales   El Badri said in the remarks   A similar trend was also observed in OECD Europe with diesel and LPG supporting growth  In Asia Pacific  oil demand in Japan remained sluggish  indicating a contraction compared with last year  Declines in direct crude burning and fuel oil consumption have contributed negatively to oil demand growth  In contrast  South Korea saw a very bullish first half of 2015  with naphtha consumption in the petrochemical industry lending support to growth  
El Badri s remarks have fueled speculation that OPEC could institute measures to raise oil prices in the near future  Crude prices are down by roughly 50  since OPEC rattled global energy markets with a strategic decision last November to leave its production ceiling unchanged above 30 million barrels per day 
The comments also came on the heels of bullish projections by the U S  Energy Information Administration regarding a potential tightening of the global supply demand imbalance  In its October Short Term Energy Outlook  the EIA forecasted that global supply next year will rise to 95 98 million bpd  a level 0 1  lower than its estimates in September  In addition  the EIA also said that demand is expected to rise 270 000 bpd to 95 2 million bpd  amid stronger projections for Chinese demand growth  The forecasts represent a 0 3  increase from the EIA s projections in September 
On Wednesday  the EIA said that U S  crude inventories for the week ending on Oct  2 rose by 3 1 million barrels  slightly above expectations for a build of 2 2 million barrels  At 461 0 million barrels  U S  crude oil stockpiles remain near levels not seen for this time of year in at least the last 80 year",2015-10-08,Investing.com,"https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/nymex-crude-higher-in-asia-on-fed-views,-baker-hughes-ahead-365339",365339

Industry observers have placed less emphasis on U S  rig counts in comparison with recent years  as U S  shale producers continue to remove inefficient rigs while maintaining output  A controversial decision by Opec in November to keep its supply ceiling above 30 million barrels per day triggered an arms race of sorts with the U S  for global market share

In a closely watched report released on Thursday  the International Energy Agency  IEA  said global demand for crude will increase by 1 4 million barrels of day in 2015  a rate approximately 300 000 bpd faster than previous forecasts  The increase could push demand to 94 million bpd  above 2014 levels of 92 6 million bpd  A rise in U S  gasoline demand and higher car sales in China spurred the growth expectations  the IEA said 
The expected spike in demand could help counter record global supply  In May  OPEC supply levels edged up 50 000 bpd to 31 33 million bpd  as producers in Saudi Arabia  Iraq and the United Arab Emirates continued to pump oil at record monthly rates  The output marked OPEC s highest monthly supply level since August  2012 
Consequently  OPEC kept its output over 1 million bpd above its official supply target for the third consecutive month 
While global oil supply dropped by 155 000 bpd in May amid lowering non OPEC production  supply levels still remained approximately 3 0 million bpd higher than last year at this time at 96 million bpd  according to the IEA  In total  the IEA anticipates non OPEC supply growth to increase by 195 000 bpd for 2015 to 1 million bpd 
Average crude prices in May moved above  60 a barrel  after falling below  45 at the start of the year  Crude futures are still down roughly 40  since peaking in the triple digits 12 months ago 
On Wednesday  the U S  Energy Information Administration  EIA  said crude stockpiles last week fell by 6 8 million bpd  The draw came amid strong demand among gasoline refineries nationwide  which increased its storage capacity to 94 6   On a global level  however  outages and delays at gasoline refineries in Saudi Arabia  the UAE  India  Brazil and Colombia have helped crude prices stabilize 
 Short term imbalances in the global refining industry appear to be supporting oil prices   whether directly for products or more indirectly for crude   in the face of a lingering supply overhang  the latest available data suggest   the IEA said in the report   These imbalances could go some way towards resolving an apparent disconnect between crude prices and fundamentals  on the one hand  prices appear to have stabilized after staging a partial recovery earlier this year  and the contango in crude futures has narrowed  on the other hand  inventory builds continue amid signs of persistent oversupply

In addition  the IEA said OPEC production increased on the month to 50 000 bpd to 31 33 million bpd  amid record output by Saudi Arabia  Iran and the United Arab Emirates  Currently  global supply hovers around 96 million bpd a level approximately 3 0 million bpd higher than last year at this time 
Crude futures are down roughly 40  since peaking above  100 a barrel last summer  In November  OPEC roiled global markets by keeping its production ceiling unchanged   a policy the world s largest cartel reiterated last week when it decided to maintain output above its target supply level of 30 million bpd  It is widely believed Saudi Arabia  the world s largest exporter  devised the strategy in an effort to undercut U S  shale producers by depressing the price of crude 
While shale producers have been forced to slow output at the lower prices  some industry observers have been enamored with their ability to drill more efficiently during the downturn 
 The shale oil industry is resilient and flexible   just as it can be pushed out of the market by very low prices  it can promptly get back into the market when prices improve   George L  Perry  a senior fellow in Economic Studies at the Brookings Institute wrote in a Fortune editorial   An extended attempt by OPEC to close down the shale industry is a lose lose situation  and as such is very unlikely to happen

98554,320069,BKR,Crude oil futures   weekly outlook  June 15   19,news,"Investing com   Oil prices fell sharply on Friday as concerns about oversupply continued to weigh  but still ended the week higher  boosted by a weaker dollar 
Crude for July delivery settled down 1 33  at  59 96 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange  For the week  the contract rose 1 4   the biggest weekly gain since April 
Brent crude for July delivery  the global benchmark  was down 1 9   to settle at  63 87 a barrel on the ICE Futures exchange  The contract rose 0 88  on the week 
Oil prices fell amid concerns that higher output by Saudi Arabia would feed into a global supply glut  Saudi Arabia said Wednesday it had raised output over the past three months in response to stronger global demand 
Concerns on supply overshadowed a report showing another fall in the latest U S  oil drilling rig count   Baker Hughes   NYSE BHI  said Friday that there were seven fewer oil rigs working in the U S  last week  pointing to further cutbacks in drilling and production 
Global oil production is outpacing demand following a boom in U S  shale oil production and after OPEC s decision last year not to cut production 
Earlier this month OPEC decided to maintain its output quotas at 30 million barrels per day 
In its monthly report on Thursday the International Energy Agency said it expected world oil demand to increase faster than it previously forecast this year  buoyed by lower prices and economic growth 
The IEA said global demand for oil would increase by 1 4 million barrels a day this year  300 000 barrels a day more than it previously forecast  to a daily average of 94 million barrels this year 
Global demand in 2014 was about 92 6 million barrels a day  the agency said 
Meanwhile  the dollar ended the week lower against the other major currencies  as uncertainty over when the Federal Reserve could start to raise interest rates weighed 
The U S  dollar index  which measures the greenback s strength against a trade weighted basket of six major currencies  was at 94 98 late Friday  flat for the day  The index ended the week down 1 42   the second straight weekly decline 
A weak greenback makes dollar denominated commodities such as oil cheaper for holders of other currencies 
In the week ahead  investors will also be looking ahead to Wednesday s Federal Reserve rate statement for a clear signal on when it could start to raise interest rates 
Greece s debt talks will also remain in focus with time running out to reach cash for reforms deal before the end of the month

98583,320098,BKR,US Jobs Market Seen Firming Despite Lackluster Growth,news,"By   

U S  job growth was likely solid in May and wages probably picked up a bit  suggesting sufficient momentum in the economy for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates later this year 
Nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 225 000 positions last month after rising by 223 000 in April  according to a Reuters survey of economists  The unemployment rate is expected to hold steady near a seven year low of 5 4 percent 
The Labor Department will release its closely followed employment report at 8 30 a m  on Friday amid concerns over the economy s inability to rebound strongly from a first quarter slump 
 While economic growth is not as strong as we would like it to be  we have seen some good economic data points   said Karyn Cavanaugh  senior market strategist at Voya Investment Management in New York   There is really no reason that a zero interest rate is appropriate  
The Fed has kept overnight rates near zero since December 2008  Officials from the U S  central bank will meet on June 16 17  but the economy s sluggishness has left financial markets doubting whether the Fed will be able to raise rates this year 
U S  gross domestic product contracted at a 0 7 percent annual pace in the first quarter  although the drop probably exaggerated the economy s weakness given a mix of temporary factors at play 
Even so  growth is off to a slow start in the second quarter  in part because of the lingering effects of a strong dollar and spending cuts in the energy sector 
Payroll gains have slowed from last year s average of 260 000 jobs per month  Economists put the blame on steep job cuts in the mining sector and the restraining impact of a strong U S  currency on exports and the factory sector 
SOLID  SUSTAINABLE GAINS
If the payroll gain comes in as expected in May  it would mark an acceleration from the first quarter s average of 184 000 jobs per month 
 It is perhaps a testament to how far the improvement in the labor market has progressed that job gains less than 250 000 now seem to be considered lackluster   said Michelle Girard  a senior economist at RBS  LONDON RBS  in Stamford  Connecticut 
 To the contrary  policymakers no doubt view gains of that magnitude as solid  sustainable and sufficient to keep the unemployment rate on its downward trajectory  sufficient to meet the pre requisite for a rate hike  
The unemployment rate is within striking distance of the 5 0 percent to 5 2 percent range that most Fed officials consider consistent with full employment 
The jobs report is expected to show steady gains in wage growth  Average hourly earnings are forecast increasing by 0 2 percent in May after barely rising in April 
 The risk is finally moving to the upside  given the firming demand for entry level workers and improving composition of employment gains   said Diane Swonk  chief economist at Mesirow Financial in Chicago   The minimum wage     has picked up over the last year  which is showing up as upward pressure on wages for low wage jobs  
Walmart  NYSE WMT   the largest private employer in the United States  this week announced it would raise minimum wages for more than 100 000 U S  workers  its second wage hike this year 
Economists anticipate that payroll gains last month were broad based  though the mining sector probably purged more jobs as it works through the thousands of cuts announced by oil field companies  Schlumberger has announced about 20 000 layoffs this year   Baker Hughes   NYSE BHI  and Halliburton  NYSE HAL  are also cutting thousands of jobs 
A strengthening housing market likely lifted construction employment  and manufacturing payrolls probably picked up a bit as automakers ramped up production ",2015-06-05,International Business Times,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/us-jobs-market-seen-firming-despite-lackluster-growth-345226,345226

Although the majority of OPEC s smaller nations have advocated for a slash in production output to boost prices  they have been overruled by Saudi Arabia which is looking to undercut U S  shale producers by depressing prices 
 The reality now is that we cannot have this  100  a barrel  anymore  This is a fact  We have less value for our barrels   OPEC secretary general Abdalla Salem el Badri said at a Friday news conference 
A content Saudi Arabian oil minister Ali al Naimi told reporters afterward that he was surprised by how amicably the meeting went 
On the Intercontinental Exchange  ICE   brent crude for July delivery rose 1 32 or 2 14  to 63 35 a barrel  ending a two session skid  Brent futures also fell before the meeting dropping below  61 before rallying later in the session  The spread between the international and U S  benchmarks for crude stood at 4 23  slightly above Thursday s level 
Iran  which could release a glut of crude into the global markets over the next several months if longstanding economic sanctions are lifted by Western powers  announced Friday that it is currently producing approximately 3 million bpd  In a span of only five years  Iran is optimistic it can double output to a level of 6 million bpd by 2020 
An outflow of Iranian oil into the global markets is considered to be bearish for crude prices  which have been tamped down by a glut of oversupply in recent months

98589,320104,BKR,Crude plunges as diminishing Chinese imports  Iran exports weigh,news,"Investing com    Crude futures fell sharply on Monday as energy traders continued to react to the long term ramifications of OPEC s decision last Friday to keep its production ceiling above 30 million barrels per day 
On the New York Mercantile Exchange  WTI crude for July delivery fell 1 00 or 1 70  to 58 12  extending a recent skid over the last week  U S  crude futures traded between 57 88 and 59 12 on a light day of trading 
On the Intercontinental Exchange  ICE   brent crude for July delivery dipped 0 69 or 1 07  to 62 62  falling for the fourth time in five sessions  The spread between the international and U S  benchmarks of crude rose to  4 50  above Friday s level of  4 23 
At a semi annual meeting of its members on Friday in Vienna  OPEC decided to maintain production at its current level   a move which caused crude to spike roughly 1 5  on the session  While in Vienna  Iran oil minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh said he is optimistic that his nation could double production from its current level of 3 million bpd within the next five years if it can increase its crude exports exponentially 
Moving forward  energy traders will focus intently on Iranian exports as the nation works toward completing a comprehensive nuclear deal with Western powers later this month  Once a deal is reached  Iranian officials said at the meeting that it could double exports with six months of the removal of longstanding economic sanctions  An outflow of Iranian oil into the global markets is considered to be bearish for crude prices  which has been weighed down by a glut of oversupply in recent months 
Traders will also monitor a bid by Indonesia to return to OPEC  Indonesia  which suspended OPEC membership in 2008 when its import level exceeded its amount of crude exports  announced its intention to pursue full membership in the cartel at the meeting  The inclusion of the Southeast Asian emerging nation could help level the global supply demand balance  Indonesia consumes around 1 5 million barrels of crude per day and is seeking supply agreements with OPEC members in order to import more oil  according to reports 
Also on Monday  crude prices slid amid disappointing import and export data in China  In May  the Asian nation s trade surplus widened to  59 5 billion  up from  34 2 billion a month earlier  Exports fell by 2 5  on a year over year basis  while imports declined by more than 17   In terms of crude  Chinese imports fell to 5 47 million bpd a decline of 26  on a year over year basis  In April  China became the world s largest importer of crude  Chinese imports fell sharply last month  as the nation s state owned oil company drew from its enormous stockpiles while its tankers off the Strait of Malacca continued to horde cheaper crude 
Energy traders await the release of weekly U S  crude stockpiles at the middle of this week for further indications on current supply levels  Last Friday  oil services firm  Baker Hughes   NYSE BHI  said that the number of oil rigs nationwide fell by four on the week to 642  the lowest level since August  2010  It marked the 26th consecutive week of weekly rig declines  Though U S  shale producers have been forced to slash drilling due to the lower price of crude  they have still maintained high production levels by keeping their more efficient rigs online

98609,320124,BKR,Asian shares mixed with Shanghai  Hong Kong up on PMI views,news,Investing com   Asian shares were mixed on Monday after a slew of data painted a reasonable picture for growth in China  Japan and Australia  though some dull spots remain The Nikkei 225 fell 0 35  despite solid numbers on manufacturing and capital spending and the S P ASX 200 eased 1 07  But the Shanghai Composite was up 2 77  as manufacturing data met expectations and the Hang Seng index was up 0 66  The China HSBC Manufacturing PMI for May met expectations at 49 2  a slight tick up from 49 1 in April  with the official CFLP at 50 2  a mild improvement from the previous month but just short of the expected 50 3  The May CFLP PMI rose slightly  indicating economic growth is moving toward stabilization   said Zhang Liqun  a government economist  on the CFLP PMI While Annabel Fiddes  economist at Markit  on the HSBC PMI  said it  signalled a further deterioration in the health of China s manufacturing sector in May   A solid fall in new export work contributed to fewer new orders  which in turn led to the first contraction of output in 2015 so far  Furthermore  sustained job cuts  ongoing destocking activities andreduced purchasing activity all suggest that the sector may remain in contractionary territory as we head into mid year  The latest survey data therefore suggest that more stimulus measures may be required to help boost domestic demand and recover some growth momentum  The Asian nation is the world s largest copper consumer  accounting for almost 40  of world consumption last year Earlier  the Australia AI Group manufacturing index rose 4 3 points to 52 3  the highest since October 2013 Manufacturing is getting a boost mainly from food and beverages which are supported by local demand and exports as a result of a lower exchange rate  The flow of benefits for domestic producers from the lower Australian dollar is picking up as exports recover some of the ground lost in recent years   said AI Group Chief Executive Innes Willox  This was a clear positive for performance in May together with strong residential construction activity and very low interest rates and helped propel the sector into expansionary territory for the first time in six months  There remains a fine balance  however  and the rapid decline in mining construction  the progressive closure of automotive assembly and subdued local business investment in machinery and equipment continues to weigh on local demand  In Japan  capital spending for non financial firms jumped 7 3  year on year in the first quarter  compared to an expected drop of 0 1   Japan manufacturing for May was steady at 50 9 as expected Also in Australia the Melbourne Institute inflation gauge for May rose 0 3  month on month  unchanged building approvals fell 4 4   more than the 2 0  decline seen  business inventories for the first quarter rose 0 4   more than the 0 1  seen and company profits for the first quarter gained 0 2   less than the 0 5  quarter on quarter expected Last week  West Texas Intermediate oil futures soared more than 4  on Friday  after data showed that the number of rigs drilling for oil in the U S  fell by the most in four weeks last week  soothing worries that the sharp decline in drilling activity may be nearing an end Industry research group  Baker Hughes   NYSE NYSE NYSE BHI  said late Friday that the number of rigs drilling for oil in the U S  fell by 13 last week to 646  The drop marks the 25th straight week of declines and the biggest fall in four weeks A week earlier  the rig count fell by just one  marking the slowest rate decline over the last 24 weeks and fuelling concerns that U S  shale production could rebound in the months ahead Market players have been paying close attention to the shrinking rig count in recent months for signs it will eventually reduce the glut of crude flowing into the market The U S  Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday that crude oil inventories fell by 2 8 million barrels last week to 479 4 million  It was the fourth straight weekly decline Elsewhere  on the ICE Futures Exchange in London  Brent for July delivery rallied  2 98  or 4 76   to end at  65 56 a barrel on Friday Despite the disappointing reading  most market experts expect the U S  economy to rebound in the second quarter  as transitory factors recede Economic data released in the past week  including reports on inflation  new home sales  business investment and consumer confidence all indicated that the economy is gaining momentum after a slowdown in the first quarter  supporting the case for higher interest rates later this year In the week ahead  investors will be focusing on Friday s nonfarm payrolls report for May  for fresh indications on the strength of the economy and the timing of a U S  rate increase On Monday  Germany is to release preliminary data on manufacturing activity  The euro zone is to release final data on manufacturing sector growth Later in the day  the U S  Institute of Supply Management is to release data on manufacturing activity Last week  U S  stocks fell broadly on the final trading session of the month  as U S  GDP for the first quarter was revised downward on Friday as expected  providing a harbinger for tepid economic growth over the current period Stocks dropped considerably on Friday after GDP in the first quarter was lowered to minus 0 7  from an initial reading of 0 2   The reading was in line with analysts  expectations of a downward revision of minus 0 8   A surge in imports to 5 6  from an initial gain of 1 8   linked to an abrupt unloading of imports at West Coast ports was thought to be responsible for the revision  A port work stoppage throughout the winter weighed on the U S  economy in the first quarter The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S P 500 Composite fell more than 0 6  on the session  while the NASDAQ

98654,320169,BKR,Crude surges nearly 5   as drop in U S  rig count eases supply fears,news,"Investing com    Crude futures surged nearly 5  on Friday  as a dwindling U S  rig count provided the clearest indication in months that concerns over a glut of oversupply in the market may be easing 
On the New York Mercantile Exchange  WTI crude for July delivery soared 2 62 or 4 54  to  60 30 a barrel  WTI crude ended a month above  60 a barrel for the first time since November  days after OPEC rattled markets with its decision to keep production levels constant  The move triggered an arms race of sorts with the U S   flooding the market with a surplus of crude causing prices to crash 
In spite of Friday s surge  crude futures are still down more than 12  since November 27 when WTI crude plunged nearly  5 a barrel following OPEC s bombshell announcement  Ever since  industry experts have paid close attention to U S  rig counts  which have fallen at an alarming rate over the last six months 
On Friday  oil services firm  Baker Hughes   NYSE BHI  said the number of oil rigs in the U S  last week dropped by 13 to 646  the lowest level since August  2010  A week earlier  the U S  rig count fell by one to 659 marking the slowest rate decline over the last 24 weeks  Nevertheless  the rig count is still down drastically after peaking above 1 600 last fall 
In addition  analysts from Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  believe crude prices may have stabilized to a level that could convince producers to intensify production  Last week  U S  crude production increased to 9 566 million barrels per day up from a total of 9 262 for the week ending May 15 
 We believe that should West Texas Intermediate crude oil prices remain near  60 bbl  US producers will ramp up activity given improved returns with costs down by at least 20    analysts from Goldman Sachs  Global Investment Research wrote in a note to investors 
Over the last two months  U S  shale production has leveled off as crude stockpiles reached near full storage capacity  Crude inventories  as well  have decreased markedly over the past several weeks  In its weekly Petroleum Status Report released on Thursday  the Energy Information Administration  EIA  said that U S  crude stockpiles decreased by 2 8 million barrels for the week that ended May 22  marking the fourth consecutive week of weekly declines  Analysts expected crude stockpiles to decline marginally by 0 9 million barrels on the week

98660,320175,BKR,NYMEX crude holds weaker despite some upbeat signs in Asian data ,news,Investing com   Crude oil prices held weaker in Asia on Monday as a mostly upbeat set of readings on the regional economy failed to spur investor excitement on demand prospects Energy traders are also awaiting a critical OPEC meeting in Vienna on Friday  The oil cartel is largely expected to keep production levels steady above 30 million barrels per day  despite ongoing concerns over ample global supplies On the New York Mercantile Exchange  crude oil for delivery in July fell 0 82  to  59 80 a barrel The China HSBC Manufacturing PMI for May met expectations at 49 2  a slight tick up from 49 1 in April  with the official CFLP at 50 2  a mild improvement from the previous month but just short of the expected 50 3  The May CFLP PMI rose slightly  indicating economic growth is moving toward stabilization   said Zhang Liqun  a government economist  on the CFLP PMI While Annabel Fiddes  economist at Markit  on the HSBC PMI  said it  signalled a further deterioration in the health of China s manufacturing sector in May   A solid fall in new export work contributed to fewer new orders  which in turn led to the first contraction of output in 2015 so far  Furthermore  sustained job cuts  ongoing destocking activities andreduced purchasing activity all suggest that the sector may remain in contractionary territory as we head into mid year  The latest survey data therefore suggest that more stimulus measures may be required to help boost domestic demand and recover some growth momentum  The Asian nation is the world s largest copper consumer  accounting for almost 40  of world consumption last year Earlier  the Australia AI Group manufacturing index rose 4 3 points to 52 3  the highest since October 2013 Manufacturing is getting a boost mainly from food and beverages which are supported by local demand and exports as a result of a lower exchange rate  The flow of benefits for domestic producers from the lower Australian dollar is picking up as exports recover some of the ground lost in recent years   said AI Group Chief Executive Innes Willox  This was a clear positive for performance in May together with strong residential construction activity and very low interest rates and helped propel the sector into expansionary territory for the first time in six months  There remains a fine balance  however  and the rapid decline in mining construction  the progressive closure of automotive assembly and subdued local business investment in machinery and equipment continues to weigh on local demand  In Japan  capital spending for non financial firms jumped 7 3  year on year in the first quarter  compared to an expected drop of 0 1   Japan

worries that the sharp decline in drilling activity may be nearing an end Industry research group  Baker Hughes   NYSE NYSE NYSE BHI  said late Friday that the number of rigs drilling for oil in the U S  fell by 13 last week to 646  The drop marks the 25th straight week of declines and the biggest fall in four weeks A week earlier  the rig count fell by just one  marking the slowest rate decline over the last 24 weeks and fuelling concerns that U S  shale production could rebound in the months ahead Market players have been paying close attention to the shrinking rig count in recent months for signs it will eventually reduce the glut of crude flowing into the market The U S  Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday that crude oil inventories fell by 2 8 million barrels last week to 479 4 million  It was the fourth straight weekly decline Elsewhere  on the ICE Futures Exchange in London  Brent for July delivery rallied  2 98  or 4 76   to end at  65 56 a barrel on Friday

military genius would help him if he let his troops outrun their supply wagons  Food and water are as important as guns and ammunition to an army By analogy  our economy marches on oil  Factories and power plants  cars and trucks  computers and smartphones   none of them run by themselves  they all need a source of energy  Which puts energy companies   and the investors who buy their stocks   in a potentially enviable position  They occupy a  necessary niche   one that customers will always need  in good times or bad  booms or busts International banking firm Credit Suisse has released a year end report on their favorite energy stocks  those that the firm s analysts believe have potential to lead their sector in growth for 2020  Hindsight being perfect  we won t know the actual results until next December   but we can analyze the companies and their market positions  and make intelligent estimates of near term performance This is where TipRanks  a company that tracks and measures the performance of Wall Street s financial analysts  offers an invaluable service  In addition to tracking the analysts  TipRanks also collects and collates data on more than 6 400 publicly traded

information on three of Credit Suisse s top 2020 energy plays Sunrun  Inc   RUN Sustainability is all the rage in energy  as environmentalists  activists  investors  and just plain old concerned citizens want to ensure a cleaner future  New tech has made it possible to extract fossil fuels from previously marginal reserves  and scrubbers exist to keep pollutants from the air   but drilling and burning still do environmental damage  Solar energy is one option as providers and customers consider switching  and here  too  new technology has improved the available choices  Sunrun  a company providing residential solar options  is clear example Sunrun offers customers three choices for adding solar power generation to their homes  a lease model  in which the company installs and owns photoelectric panels  and the customer uses the power generated to reduce electricity bills  a model  in which solar panels charge batteries which are then used to reduce grid power use during peak rate hours   or replace it during an outage  and a purchase system  in which the customer buys solar power generation technology  has it installed  and enjoys the benefits The company has leveraged demand for its products to produce quarterly profits since Q2 2019  and build up a  1 63 billion market cap  Sunrun s Q3 earnings  reported in November  missed the forecasts but showed strong year over year gains  EPS was up to 23 cents  from a 2 cent loss the year before  while revenues gained 5  year over year to hit  215 5 million Credit Suisse s Michael Weinstein makes RUN stock a  top pick

year  The Q3 numbers  reported in November  showed the result   earnings were down  both year over year and against the estimates  even though revenues were up  Increased production did not quite make up for the lower product prices  Put into numbers  the EPS was still strong at  1 47  and revenues reached  975 million FANG paid out a dividend of 18 75 cents per share  for an annualized payout of 75 cents and a decidedly modest yield of 0 81   That yield is roughly half the sector average   but it is reliable  as FANG has been maintaining or raising the dividend for the last two years  and with a payout ratio of just 12   it is easily sustainable Company management recently revised down their 2020 production guidance  putting it into line with 2019 s actual numbers   and the company underperformed the sector last year  Credit Suisse analyst Betty Jiang looked at management s action and sees in it reason to believe that FANG will improve performance in the coming year  She writes   While management has made a concerted effort  with much improved disclosure  to explain the factors that drove the downward revision  we continue to field questions on the impact of co development on 2020 well productivity and perhaps more importantly  whether this is truly a one time reset  our answer is  yes    Based on our work  we believe FANG s revised 2020 production is achievable while they will likely continue to be successful in driving down costs  Jiang puts a  116 price target on FANG shares  showing her confidence in a 25  growth potential   To watch Jiang s track record  click here

U S  oil futures have been well supported in recent weeks as an ongoing collapse in rigs drilling for oil in the U S  added to expectations that shale oil production has peaked and may start falling in the coming months 
According to industry research group  Baker Hughes   NYSE BHI   the number of rigs drilling for oil in the U S  fell by 8 last week to 660  the 23rd straight week of declines and the lowest level since September 2010 
Oil traders have been paying close attention to the shrinking rig count in recent months for signs it will eventually reduce the glut of crude flowing into the market

In a positive development for energy companies  crude stockpiles have declined for three consecutive weeks amid increased refinery demand  as summer driving season nears 
At the Cushing Oil Hub in Oklahoma  the nation s largest storage facility of crude  storage capacity remains near 80   according to Genscape  Inc  In April  the figure hovered around 90   exacerbating concerns that the U S  could reach full storage capacity

98728,320243,BKR,Crude futures relatively unchanged as Iran  supply glut remain in focus,news,"Investing com    Crude futures were mixed on Friday  as concerns of a supply glut prompted investors to question a recent upswing in prices 
On the New York Mercantile Exchange  WTI crude for June delivery fell 0 14 or 0 25  to  59 75 a barrel  extending a mild slump to its third straight session  Texas Light Sweet futures pared some of their losses from the U S  morning session when it plunged more than 2  to a session low of  58 40 before moving back toward  60 a barrel in afternoon trading 
For the week  WTI crude peaked at  61 85 days after soaring to a five month high at  62 58 on May 6 
In April  U S  crude futures surged more than 20  amid a slowdown in shale field production  WTI crude is still down substantially from its 12 month high last June when it moved above  107 a barrel 
The sharp reversal in recent weeks has spooked some private equity investors  who are betting on an imminent sell off  Analysts at Blackstone  NYSE BX  Group LP s distressed credit unit  for instance  are reportedly abandoning investments in several energy companies upon the belief that crude futures are about to turn lower 
On the Intercontinental Exchange  ICE   meanwhile  brent crude for July delivery gained 0 10 or 0 15  to 66 80  Investors turned their attention to July futures  which spiked above  70 on May 6  after June contracts expired earlier this week  Much like WTI  brent enjoyed a stellar month in April when prices rose by more than 15  
The spread between the international and U S  domestic benchmarks of crude stood at  7 05  above Thursday s level of 6 80 
Market players digested the conclusion of Thursday s Persian Gulf summit at Camp David when U S  president Barack Obama tried to assuage concerns of Middle East allies stemming from a proposed Iranian nuclear pact  Speaking to reporters at the Maryland retreat  Obama reaffirmed the government s support of the Gulf partners by considering the use of military force to help aid their defense  Western powers are facing a June 30 deadline to reach a final agreement on a comprehensive deal with Iran 
If economic sanctions are lifted against Iran  the Gulf nation could nearly double its exports from a current level of 1 0 million barrels per day  An outpouring of Iranian oil may depress prices in a global market already saturated by oversupply 
Elsewhere  oil services firm  Baker Hughes   NYSE BHI  said in its weekly rig count that the number of U S  oil rigs nationwide decreased by eight on the week to 660  The modest drop marked the 23rd consecutive weekly decline  as the rig total fell to its lowest level since August  2010 
The pace of decline  however  continued to slow as observers keep a close eye on a prolonged production battle between the U S and OPEC  In February  for instance  the rig count fell by more than 60 on consecutive weeks  The rig count still remains roughly 60  lower from its peak of 1 609 in October 
The U S  Dollar Index  which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies  was relatively flat on Friday at 93 39

The gold price soared on safe haven bids hitting upper resistance and oil was down over a dollar on fears that trade war uncertainty would muddle  if not reduce  the global oil demand outlook  Of course  that was a couple of hours ago  Now we are back to having talks with China and maybe even diplomatic talks with Iran  President Trump said   China called last night our top trade people and said   let s get back to the table   They have been hurt very badly  but they understand this is the right thing to do and I have great respect for it   Trump told reporters during a bilateral meeting with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el Sisi on the sidelines of the G7 summit  This comment reversed markets as gold gave up its gains and oil and stocks turned positive   They want to make a deal   Trump said   That s a great thing   Except that China might not have made the call 
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang said   I haven t heard about this   I am sure he was concerned they were keeping him out of the loop  Or maybe President Trump mis spoke  Politico reported that Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin told reporters that Chinese Vice Premier Liu had called for talks to resume when Trump pressed him for details during a bilateral meeting later in the afternoon with the Indian prime minister  It wasn t immediately clear  however  if Mnuchin was referring to a phone call Liu made to U S  officials or his comments at a technology conference earlier in the day 
Should we now pay more attention to U S  China trade talks or U S  Iranian talks that could unleash Iranian oil barrels back on the market  Maybe you just need to trade short term with the charts  The Wall Street Journal reported that Trump also backed away from confrontation over Iran on Monday  a day after French President Emmanuel Macron stunned other leaders by inviting Iran s foreign minister to Biarritz for talks on the stand off between Washington and Tehran  Trump told journalists that they had been wrong to report that he was blindsided by the five hour visit of Mohammad Javad Zarif to the summit s sidelines  and said that while he thought it was too soon for a meeting  he had no objections to it

98834,320349,BKR,Baker Hughes  BHGE  To Report Q1 Earnings  What s In Store ,opinion,Baker Hughes  a GE company   NYSE BHGE   is set to release first quarter 2019 results before the market opens on Apr 30  Based in Houston  TX  Baker Hughes is one of the world s largest oilfield service providers  The company s integrated oilfield products and digital solutions help customers to acquire  refine  and transport hydrocarbons efficiently and cost effectively  with low environmental concerns In the last reported quarter  the company s earnings of 26 cents per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny due to lower contributions from Bently Nevada and Controls businesses  In the trailing four quarters  the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3 4   beating estimates just once  In the to be reported quarter  it is expected to report earnings of 14 cents per share Baker Hughes  a GE company Price and EPS Surprise   Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement Which Way are Estimates Trending Let s take a look at estimate revisions to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company before the earnings release The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first quarter earnings of 14 cents has witnessed no upward revisions and three downward revisions by firms in the past 30 days  This is indicative of an improvement from the reported earnings of 9 cents in the year ago quarter The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first quarter revenues is pegged at  5 6 billion  suggesting an improvement of 4  from the year ago reported figure Factors at PlayExplorers are focusing more on shale oil and gas rather than conventional production  The growing need for advanced and complex techniques for extracting hydrocarbons from shale and offshore deep water regions is expected to be reflected in Baker Hughes  first quarter earnings The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first quarter operating income from the Digital Solutions unit is pegged at  73 million  This estimated figure is flat with the year ago reported number but lower than  115 million in the last reported quarter The Oilfield Equipment segment is expected to generate an operating income of around  2 million compared with the year ago period s reported loss of  6  The expected figure  however  is lower than  12 million profit recorded in fourth quarter 2018 The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first quarter operating income from the Oilfield Services segment is pegged at  178 million  implying a rise from the year ago reported figure of  141 million but a decline from the last reported quarter s  224 million The Zacks Consensus Estimate for operating income from the Turbomachinery   Process Solutions is pegged at  114 million  indicating a decrease from  257 million in fourth quarter 2018 and  119 million in the year ago period Total orders from all the segments for the first quarter is expected to be almost  7 billion  suggesting an increase from the year ago figure of  5 2 billion and the last reported quarter s  6 9 billion  Increase in total orders and rising profit levels from Oilfield Equipment and Oilfield Services units will definitely boost the company s first quarter earnings  However  lower profit levels in Turbomachinery   Process Solutions can affect earnings growth in the to be reported quarter What Our Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively show that Baker Hughes is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the quarter to be reported  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  Unfortunately  this is not the case here as elaborated below Earnings ESP  Earnings ESP represents the difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Baker Hughes has an Earnings ESP of  4 02  as the Most Accurate Estimate stands below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 14 cents  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Zacks Rank  Baker Hughes currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Though a Zacks Rank of 3 increases the predictive power of ESP  a negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult  You can see  We caution against Sell rated stocks  Zacks Ranks  4 and 5  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions Energy Stocks With Favorable CombinationHere are some companies from the energy space which  according to our model  have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in the upcoming quarterly reports Houston  TX based Apache Corporation   NYSE APA   has a Zacks Rank  2 and an Earnings ESP of  28 93   The company is scheduled to report quarterly earnings on May 1

Here are highlights from Wednesday s Analyst Blog  
Top Stock Reports for Verizon  Abbott Labs and Illinois Tool Works
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Verizon  Abbott and Illinois Tool Works  These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Verizon s shares have gained  22 1  in the past year  outperforming the Zacks Wireless National industry s increase of  10 2  during the same period  Verizon started 2019 on a promising note with solid performance in the first quarter  primarily backed by the wireless business 
The company recorded modest top line growth and remains well poised to benefit from the impending 5G boom  The Zacks analyst thinks focus on online content delivery  mobile video and online advertising are likely to stoke further growth  Management also raised its earlier guidance on underlying strength of its business model 
However  Verizon continues to struggle in a competitive and saturated U S  wireless market  where spectrum crunch has become a major issue  The wireline division is struggling with persistent losses in access lines owing to competitive pressure from VoIP service providers and aggressive triple play offerings by cable firms  Verizon is also spending heavily on promotion and lucrative discounts to woo customers  which is also weighing on margins 
Shares of Abbott have gained  29 5  over the past year  outperforming the Zacks Medical Products industry  which has increased  5 9  over the same period  Abbott exited first quarter 2019 with better than expected earnings and revenues figures 
The Zacks analyst likes the strong and consistent performance by the company s EPD and Medical Devices segments on an organic basis  The company has been hogging the limelight within Diabetic Care on growth with FreeStyle Libre  Within Structural Heart  worldwide strong uptake of MitraClip has improved further following the FDA approval of its upgraded version 
This apart  synergies from Alere consolidation in the form of revenues from Rapid Diagnostics have been driving growth  Abbott s emerging market performance has been promising  On the flip side  sluggish Rhythm Management arm in the United States continues to dent growth  Increasing currency headwinds to some extent dented Abbott s international performance in the last reported quarter 
Illinois Tool Works  shares have outperformed the Zacks Industrial Machinery industry over the past six months  gaining  14 4  over the period versus the industry s  10 3  increase  The Zacks analyst thinks Illinois Tool will gain from a diversified business structure  policy of rewarding shareholders handsomely  enterprise initiatives and skilled management team 
In first quarter 2019  the company s earnings surpassed estimates but declined year over year due to weak sales  higher taxes  forex woes and restructuring costs  For 2019  it anticipates earnings per share to increase 4 8  year over year  Enterprise Strategy is anticipated to boost margins by 100 basis points  bps   Share buybacks are likely to amount to  1 5 billion 
However  organic sales are predicted to increase 0 5 2 5   down from previously mentioned 1 3   Also  high tax rate and unfavorable foreign exchange  that will lower earnings by 6 cents in the second quarter  remain concerns  Earnings estimates for 2019 have declined in the past 30 days

98838,320353,BKR,Permian Drillers Steal The Spotlight  4 Stocks Worth Tracking,opinion,For years  the Permian Basin has been contributing to the United States  oil production boom  Since 2010  production growth of crude volumes in the prolific basin has crossed 300   Permian drillers have now become more efficient as they are now deploying lesser rigs to produce more of the commodity Although the  problem in the basin may act as a damper  favorable oil prices along with production growth of the commodity are likely to support the Permian drillers  cashflow  thereby helping upstream energy players consistently return capital to shareholders Permian Drillers  Efficiency ImprovesIn its latest weekly release  Baker Hughes  a GE company   NYSE BHGE    reported that Permian  which employs roughly half of the nation s total rigs  has seen a decline in oil drilling rig count for five consecutive weeks Despite the decline  the Permian is likely to witness growth in oil production volumes  According to the   EIA   in June  the basin will produce 8 495 thousand barrels of oil per day  MBbl D   up by 83 MBbl D from May s production  Not only that  of all major plays in the United States including Anadarko  Appalachia  Bakken  Eagle Ford  Haynesville and Niobrara  Permian will contribute to 48 9  and 49 1  of total oil production volumes in May and June  respectively  added EIA Hence  higher expected production volumes despite decline in oil drilling rig count reflect improving efficiency of the Permian drillers Boosting Shareholder s ReturnsPermian drillers are focused on returning cash to shareholders through dividend payments and share buybacks Along with its first quarter 2019 result announcement  Diamondback Energy  Inc    NASDAQ FANG     which exploits and produces oil in the Permian   said that its prime objective is to consistently pay capital back to stockholders  The company has received approval from the board of directors to repurchase up to  2 billion of shares through Dec 31  2020  Diamondback also recently raised its quarterly dividend payment by 50  In December 2018  Pioneer Natural Resources Company   NYSE PXD    a pure play Permian driller  got an authorization from its board of directors to repurchase  2 billion common stock  As of May 6  Pioneer Natural has managed to repurchase a total of  328 million worth shares  The upstream energy stock is also returning cash to shareholders through dividend payments  The company recently increased its semi annual dividend payments by 100  and is also planning to raise dividend further Drillers in the SpotlightGiven that Permian has a huge inventory of low cost premium wells  drillers operating in the basin are likely to keep ramping up oil production  For the higher production levels  most of the Permian drillers expect capital spending related to drilling  completions and facilities  D  C   F  to decline significantly through 2019  This reflects improving capital efficiency levels of such explorers and producers It seems to be an opportune moment for energy investors to consider stocks of Permian drillers   Here  we present two stocks carrying a Zacks

ramping up activities in the Permian  The company is allocating 50  of its capital budget toward exploration and production operations in the Delaware sub basin  inside the broader Permian  This is likely to help the company fulfil expectation of boosting oil production volumes by 17  through 2019 Moreover  over the past 12 months  the Zacks  2 Ranked firm has returned more than  4 billion capital to stockholders With the divestment of its Eagle Ford resources  Pioneer Natural Resources Company has become a pure play Permian stock  With sole exposure to the nation s most prolific basin  the Irving  TX based firm looks to extract as much as 1 million barrels of crude oil every day by 2027 In the first quarter of 2019  this Zacks Rank  2 company produced more oil than it estimated  Moreover  the company projects oil production from the basin through 2019 in the band of 203 to 213 thousand barrels of oil per day  MBbls D   higher than 181 MBbls D in 2018  For increasing production volumes  the company expects capital spending related D  C   F to decline almost 11  through 2019  reflecting improving efficiency in capital spending Headquartered in Midland  TX  Diamondback Energy  is a pure play Permian player having presence across more than 344 000 net acres in the Permian The company  with a Zacks Rank of 3  expects oil production growth of 30  through

98917,320432,BKR,Crude oil futures rise amid sharpest U S  rig reduction in four weeks,news,"Investing com    Crude oil futures rose modestly on Friday  amid the sharpest rig reduction in the U S  over the last four weeks   
After two consecutive weeks of minimal declines  oil services firm  Baker Hughes   NYSE BHI  said in its weekly report that the number of oil rigs nationwide declined by 42 to 760 rigs last week  its lowest weekly total since December  2010  Oil and gas rigs dropped by a combined total of 40 on the week to 988  it lowest combined total since August  2009   
Since last fall  oil rigs have been closing at an alarming rate  Rig use in the U S  is down by more than 50  since exceeding a level of 1 600 last October  Rig counts have now declined for 18 straight weeks  marking the fastest decline in the U S  in more than 25 years   
WTI crude for May delivery moved up roughly 30 cents to  51 85 following the report  building on minor gains earlier in the session  At the close  WTI crude dropped slightly to  51 70  up 0 91 or 1 79   Crude futures fell to a daily low of  50 11 in European afternoon trading  before steadily increasing in U S  morning trading   
Energy traders are keeping a close eye on supply levels  after the U S  Energy Information Administration reported that that U S  crude oil storage increased by 10 95 million barrels for the week that ended April 3  The increase represented the largest weekly buildup for WTI crude nationwide since 2001  In addition  the massive buildup pushed U S  crude stockpiles to 482 4 million barrels  the highest level in more than 80 years   
While rig counts in the U S  have been declining exponentially  oil is still being pumped at one of its fastest rates in 30 years   
On the Intercontinental Exchange  ICE   brent crude for May delivery gained 1 34 or 2 37  to close at  57 91 a barrel  The spread between international and U S  domestic benchmarks stood at  6 21  up from  5 74 on Thursday   
High geopolitical risk throughout the Persian Gulf has weighed on crude over the last two weeks  On April 2  crude prices plunged after Iran reached the framework of a deal with Western powers regarding its nuclear program  The preliminary accord resulted in the easing of economic and financial sanctions levied by the U S  and the European Union that have limited Iranian exports to approximately a million barrels of crude oil per day since 2012   
On Thursday  Ayatollah Ali Khamenei  Iran s supreme leader  took a hard line against sanctions  asserting in an address in Theran that the restrictions  should be lifted all together on the same day of the agreement  not six months or one year later   The White House and its Western partners have been in favor of gradual easing of sanctions   
The release of a surfeit of Iranian oil into a global market that is already beset by a glut of supply has exacerbated concerns of a further decline in prices  Crude futures are down by more than 50  since last July

98937,320452,BKR,Oil Stocks To Watch For Q4 Earnings On Jan 31  BHGE  VLO  COP,opinion,The Q4 earnings season is underway  with 136 S P 500 members having already released their respective quarterly results  as of Jan 29  The companies recorded year over year earnings growth of 12 6  on 5 9  higher revenues Around 69 1  of the S P 500 companies surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings  while 60 3  beat revenue estimates Energy Sector to Outperform OthersCombining the reported results and the ones to be released henceforth  overall earnings for the S P 500 Index are estimated to increase 11  year over year on 5 5  higher revenues  It is to be noted that excluding the Energy sector  the Index is expected to report a 9 1  year over year earnings growth  In fact  per the latest  report  Energy will outshine all sectors with earnings growth of 62 7  year over year  This depicts the importance and weightage of the Energy sector in the S P 500 Index Let s see how the energy market performed during the fourth quarter and which factors are playing a definitive role in the Energy sector Deriving Strength From Y Y Rise in Oil   Gas PricesIn the October December quarter  the West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude plunged from a multi year high of  76 40 a barrel in early October to below  45 in late December  per the   EIA   Delicate demand outlook on fears of global economic slowdown kept energy stocks under pressure  Even the enforcement of sanctions against Iran by the United States last November could not keep oil price from plunging  This was because Washington provided sanction waivers to several big oil importing countries to continue shipping Iranian crude till mid 2019 Despite the plunge  the average WTI oil prices in October and November 2018 were recorded at  70 75 and  56 96 per barrel  higher than  51 58 and  56 64 in the respective months of 2017  per EIA  However  the average crude price in December 2018 declined on a year over year basis  Although plummeting crude prices during the October to December quarter of 2018 should have hurt upstream businesses  a year over year uptick in prices in the initial two months might have helped explorers and producers  This  in turn  should help the oilfield services providers as more exploration and production works increase the demand for their services Moreover  per EIA  the average natural gas prices for the months of October  November and December of 2018 were reported at  3 28 per Million Btu   4 09 per Million Btu and  4 04 per Million Btu  higher than  2 88   3 01 and  2 82 recorded in the respective months of 2017  Hence  the commodity pricing environment was favorable for natural gas producers Also  the free fall in oil price through the fourth quarter was a

98964,320479,BKR,Crude oil futures surge amid increased Saudi prices  reduced U S  output,news,"Investing com    Crude oil futures surged on Monday  experiencing one of its highest daily gains of the year  amid the rising cost of Saudi Arabian oil for Asian delivery and hopes for reduced output in the U S   
On Sunday night  Saudi Arabia announced it is raising oil prices for May sales to Asia  marking the second straight month it has instituted a price hike for Asian buyers   
On the Intercontinental Exchange  ICE   brent crude for May delivery soared 5 94  or 3 23 to 58 23 a barrel  amid increasing margins for refiners  Prices for oil futures fell below  56 a barrel in U S  morning trading before increasing steadily throughout the trading session to settle at  58 10

Output in Saudi Arabia  the world s largest exporter of crude  is approaching near record levels  The surge in Saudi output has offset poor production in Iraq due to unseasonable winter weather and in Libya  where production has stalled due to increased fighting   
Last Thursday  WTI crude futures plummeted to  48 75 a barrel after reports surfaced that Iran reached a preliminary accord with Western powers on enhanced limitations for its nuclear program  The deal resulted in the easing of economic and financial sanctions against Iran  fueling speculation that a glut of Iranian oil could be released into an already saturated market   
Still  questions remain on how quickly Iran s oil export can be released into the broader market  While the agreement allows U S  president Barack Obama to temporarily suspend financial sanctions against Iran  he still needs Congressional approval to halt the sanctions permanently  Facts Global Energy  an energy consulting firm  forecasts that the Iranian oil exports could reach a level of 1 7 million barrels per day within 12 months  up from its current level of roughly a million barrels per day  The predictions may be overstated  however  if the sanctions are not fully lifted until 2016   
It is unknown how much the added supply level could further depress prices   
Meanwhile  renowned oil trader Andy Hall continued to take a bullish stance on crude futures  Reiterating comments he made in February  Hall said it might take a little longer than previously anticipated for  lower prices to work its magic   In February  Hall said he considered  40 a barrel as an  absolute price floor   for crude  Hall is the head of commodities trading at Astenbeck Capital  a  3 1 billion Hedge Fund in Connecticut

98966,320481,BKR,Crude oil futures rebound from massive sell off one day earlier,news,"Investing com    Crude oil futures pared some of their losses on Thursday from one of the sharpest daily declines on the year  following a record buildup last week as supply concerns continue to weigh on energy prices   
On the New York Mercantile Exchange  WTI crude oil for May delivery rose 0 45 or 0 89  to 50 87 a barrel  Crude prices for Texas light sweet moved up steadily in U S  afternoon trading to reach a high of 52 03  before falling off slightly before the close   
A day earlier  crude oil futures plummeted more than 6  after the Energy Information Administration  EIA  said in its weekly inventory report on Wednesday that U S  crude oil storage increased by 10 95 million barrels for the week that ended April 3  more than tripling its expected count of 3 28 million  The figure represents the largest weekly buildup for WTI crude nationwide since 2001   
The surprising inventory build pushed stockpiles to 482 4 million barrels  the highest level in more than 80 years  The glut of supply has heightened fears that the U S  will reach full storage capacity by the end of next month  a trend that some analysts believe may push WTI crude below  35 a barrel   
On the Intercontinental Exchange  ICE   brent crude for May delivery rose 1 06 or 1 91  to 56 61 a barrel  Brent futures reached a daily high of 58 01 in U S  afternoon trading before settling slightly lower  The spread between the international and U S  domestic benchmarks increased to  5 74  above Wednesday s level of  5 07   
The prices surged as Iran oil minister Bijan Zanganeh told Reuters during his visit to China that Opec will  coordinate itself   to adapt to his nation s return to oil markets as a safeguard for preventing prices from crashing  Iran reportedly has 30 million barrels of oil ready for export after the Persian Gulf nation reached the framework of a nuclear deal with Western powers last week   
The preliminary accord resulted in the easing of economic and financial sanctions levied by the U S  and the European Union that have limited Iranian exports to approximately a million barrels of crude oil since 2012

Meanwhile  the spread between the Brent and the WTI crude contracts stood at  8 79 a barrel  compared to  8 75 by close of trade on Friday 
Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Ali al Naimi said on Sunday that the kingdom will continue to pursue the strategy of defending its own market share against non OPEC producers rather than help support oil prices 
 We tried  we held meetings and we did not succeed because countries outside OPEC were insisting that OPEC carry the burden and we refuse that OPEC bears the responsibility   Naimi said 
The comments underlined the view that Saudi Arabia will not change its stance on oil production 
Oil prices have fallen sharply in recent months as OPEC resisted calls to cut output  while the U S  pumped at the fastest pace in more than three decades  creating a glut in global supplies 
Industry research group  Baker Hughes   NYSE BHI  said on Friday that the number of rigs drilling for oil in the U S  fell by 41 last week to 825  the 15th straight week of declines and the lowest since March 2011

99000,320515,BKR,Crude posts one of its largest weekly gains since  11  despite Fri drop,news,"Investing com    While crude futures fell by more than  2 a barrel on Friday as supply concerns related to the crisis in Yemen diminished  oil prices still ended the week with one of its highest weekly gains in more than four years 
Although Saudi Arabian led airstrikes against Shiite backed Houthi rebels in Yemen continued on Friday  questions arose on the impact of the attacks on the nation s oil supply  Yemen is strategically located on the Bab el Mandeb  a strait that connects the Gulf of Aden with the Red Sea  Earlier this week  crude prices shot up amid heightened fears that the closure of the strait could limit oil exports out of the critical chokepoint 
Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS   however  may have assuaged such fears with a contingency plan for oil tankers in the event that the strait is closed  In a note to investors  analysts from the bank raised the possibility that the tankers could be diverted to travel around Africa if the strategic pathway is unavailable  In addition  U S  Army General Lloyd Austin told a Senate hearing that the military will work with its Gulf and European partners to ensure that the strait remains open in spite of the conflict 
As a result  WTI crude for May delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell  2 69 or 5 22  to  48 75 a barrel  On Thursday  WTI crude surged more than 5   its largest daily increase for the month of March  after Saudi Arabia and Egypt announced plans for launching a ground attack against the Houthi militants  For the week  WTI crude increased by approximately 6  or  2 20 a barrel  one of its top weekly increases since 2011 
Meanwhile  British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond indicated that the two sides negotiating an Iranian Nuclear pact were more than  halfway to a deal   An accord with Western powers could loosen sanctions against Iran  freeing up millions of barrels that are currently stored in reserves  Iran reportedly has 30 million barrels of stored oil ready for export once the sanctions are lifted  The added amounts could depress an oil market already inundated with a large supply glut 
Goldman Sachs downplayed the effects of both geopolitical events on crude prices 
 We expect both events to have negligible near term supply impacts  with the build in crude inventories set to continue in the second quarter of 2015  Longer term  a deal with Iran could lead to greater Opec supplies although the timing of the sanction relief remains uncertain   the firm said in the investor note 
On the Intercontinental Exchange  ICE   brent crude for May delivery fell  2 83 or 4 78  to  56 36 a barrel  Brent futures rose by nearly 45 cents for the week

A day earlier  London traded Brent prices surged to  59 78  before ending at  59 19  up  2 71  or 4 8  
Global oil prices spiked by more than three dollars on Thursday after Saudi Arabia and a coalition of Gulf region allies launched air strikes in Yemen to counter Iran backed Houthi rebels besieging the southern city of Aden

U S  supply levels demonstrate few signs of retreating from record highs  according to the IEA  Nationwide  crude oil inventories have reached 448 9 million barrels   the most in more than 80 years   
 It continues to defy expectations   the IEA said in its monthly report   
The agency also revised upward its forecast of annual demand to 93 5 million barrels per day  up by 100 000 from previous estimates   
Reports from oil services firm  Baker Hughes   NYSE BHI  that weekly rig counts had tumbled to its lowest level in four years had little impact on WTI prices  The number of oil and gas rigs for the week ending Mar  6 fell by 67 to 1 125  down by nearly 600 rigs from last year at this time  For the week that ended Feb  27 oil and gas rigs in the U S  declined by 75 to 1 192  A week earlier  the rig count dropped by 43 to 1 267 
Despite the dwindling levels  domestic production continues to hover near record highs of 9 0 million per day  according to Baker Hughes  Earlier this week  the EIA revised its annual production level to 9 35 million barrels a day 
As prices tumbled on Friday  Opec issued a bulleting blaming the United States  reliance on shale oil production for the continual declines  Still  it is expected that shale oil production in the U S  could reach the lowest in four years by April 
Meanwhile  the rapidly appreciating U S  dollar moved higher on Friday  placing additional pressure on crude oil  The U S  Dollar Index  which measures the greenback versus a basket of six major currencies  cracked the historic 100 barrier for the first time in more than 11 and a half years  The index reached 100 37 in U S  afternoon trading  as EUR USA fell toward 1 05 ",2015-03-14,Investing.com,"https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/crude-oil-plunges-under-$45-a-barrel,-as-prices-near-a-year-low-332308",332308

99045,320560,BKR,Energy To Power S P 500 s Q1 Earnings Growth  5 Oil Picks,opinion,Major energy players on the S P 500 index are expected to start reporting Q1 numbers starting mid April  Like in the last three quarters  we expect the Energy sector to contribute majorly to the index s earnings growth this time around  In fact  excluding Energy  we anticipate a drop in S P 500 s earnings growth to 14 4  from 15 9  Last year  the sector generated  11 6 billion in net operating cashflow  which was enough to meet capital expenditures of  5 5 billion  This resulted in positive free cashflow of  6 1 billion in 2017  the highest since 2009 We also believe that the healthy crude pricing scenario will help the sector report substantial free cashflow in Q1 Oil Pricing Scenario RosyPer the   EIA   average WTI crude prices for the first two months of 2018 have been  63 70 and  62 23 per barrel  respectively  The average monthly oil price had never traded near the  60 per barrel mark since 2015  Also  during the entire of March  the commodity traded above  60  reflecting a healthy pricing scenario The oil production cut extension deal signed by OPEC players late last year continued to support the rally in crude  On Nov 30  2017  OPEC members met non OPEC players to decide on an extension of the crude production cut accord  first signed in late 2016  beyond the first quarter of 2018  All crude exporters decided to extend the deal through 2018 end Strong Earnings GrowthWe expect Energy to post the strongest earnings growth in first quarter 2018  courtesy of the tick up in oil price  Compared with the January to March quarter of 2017  Energy is expected to see earnings growth of 60 8  on 15 7  higher revenues  per the latest  Notably  Energy s Q1 earnings growth is expected to surpass 20 9  of the technology sector   the market s largest segment with boundless investment opportunities  Moreover  for the second  third and fourth quarters of 2018  we project Energy s earnings growth at 112 5   62 2  and 51 2  respectively For the first quarter of this year  we expect Energy to record  14 6 billion in earnings  higher than  11 4 billion and  9 1 billion in fourth quarter 2017 and first quarter 2017  respectively  On top of that  for the second  third and final quarters of 2018  we look forward to Energy raking in  17 3 billion   17 8 billion and  17 3 billion  respectively Which Energy Players Will Make the Most The fate of upstream energy firms is largely dependent on oil prices  With increased exploration and production activities  a higher number of rigs will likely get hired and oil field services players are expected to clinch more contracts for setting up oil wells In fact  the market has seen a ramp up of crude drilling activities in the January to March quarter of 2018  As per data provided by Baker Hughes  a GE company   NYSE BHGE     oilfield service provider   the total number of rigs exploring oil fields in the United States rose from 747 to 797 in the aforesaid quarter Choosing stocks with earnings beat potential might be a difficult task unless one knows the way to shortlist  One way to do this is to pick stocks that have the

On the ICE Futures Exchange in London  Brent oil for April delivery hit an intraday low of  58 88 a barrel  a level not seen since February 25  before trading at  58 99 during European morning hours  down 83 cents  or 1 39  
Members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries should not lower production to  subsidize  higher cost shale  OPEC Secretary General Abdullah al Badri said on Sunday  His comments came at the Middle East Oil and Gas conference in Bahrain 
Oil prices have fallen sharply in recent months as OPEC resisted calls to cut output  while the U S  pumped at the fastest pace in more than three decades  creating a glut in global supplies 
On Friday  London traded Brent prices dropped 75 cents  or 1 24   to end at  59 73 as the U S  dollar strengthened broadly following the release of upbeat U S  employment data 
The Labor Department reported that the U S  economy added 295 000 jobs in February  far more than the 240 000 forecast by economists 
The unemployment rate ticked down to 5 5  from 5 7  in January  the lowest since May 2008  Economists had forecast the unemployment rate would fall to 5 6  
The robust jobs report fuelled expectations that the Federal Reserve will start raising interest rates as early as June  boosting the greenback 
The U S  dollar index  which measures the greenback s strength against a trade weighted basket of six major currencies  slipped 0 3  to 97 45 early on Monday  after hitting an 11 year peak of 97 84 earlier 
Dollar denominated oil futures contracts tend to fall when the dollar rises  as this makes oil more expensive for buyers in other currencies

Industry research group  Baker Hughes   NYSE BHI  said Friday that the number of rigs drilling for oil in the U S  fell by 63 last week to 923  the lowest since June 2011 
Market players have been paying close attention to the shrinking rig count in recent months for signs it will eventually reduce the glut of crude flowing into the market 
However  total U S  crude oil inventories stood at 444 4 million barrels as of last week  the most in at least 80 years  indicating that cheap prices have yet to affect output 
The spread between the Brent and the WTI crude contracts stood at  9 46 a barrel early on Monday  compared to  10 12 by close of trade on Friday 
Elsewhere  China reported a trade surplus of  60 6 billion in the January February period on Sunday  compared to expectations for a surplus of  10 8 billion and up from a surplus of  60 0 in January 
Exports surged 48 3  from a year earlier last month  above expectations for a 14 2  increase  while imports tumbled 20 5   much worse than forecasts for a decline of 10 0  
The slide in imports pointed to persistent weakness in the economy  fuelling speculation policymakers will have to introduce further stimulus measures to boost growth 
China is the world s second largest oil consumer after the U S  and has been the engine of strengthening demand 
Meanwhile  the euro was likely to remain under pressure as investors looked ahead to a meeting of euro group finance ministers in Brussels later in the day to discuss proposed Greek economic reforms

99111,320626,BKR,4 Stocks To Gain Even If OPEC Decides Against Deal Extension,opinion,"The scheduled meeting of OPEC members with non OPEC crude exporters for the third time in Vienna  Austria  is dominating the headlines  It should provide an answer to the million dollar question   will oil continue to trade above  55 a barrel   The landmark production cut accord  first signed in late 2016  helped oil cross the  50 a barrel mark  After the deal  with the advancement of crude  major energy players regained financial strength and have been rewarding shareholders with healthy dividends OPEC MeetingOn Nov 30  OPEC members will meet non OPEC players to decide on an extension of the crude production cut accord beyond the first quarter 2018  More than 20 oil producers  including leading exporters like Russia and Saudi Arabia  will participate in the Vienna meeting  The agreement entails putting roughly 1 8 million barrels a day of crude oil out of the market Possible OutcomesMost analysts are expecting the Vienna meeting to conclude with a deal extension for another nine months next year But Russia concerns might compel OPEC to push for either a shorter extension  say six months  or to delay its verdict until the first quarter next year  said CNBC  Both the decisions contradict the market s expectations and hence could lead to a fall in oil prices     Tom Kloza of Oil Price Information Service added that it will be difficult for crude to cross  59 05 even if the cartel chooses the nine month extension because recent crude prices are already reflecting the information Six Month ExtensionAlternative investment manager Again Capital believes that it will be hard to convince Russia for more than a six month extension Again Capital added that Russian oil producers are not willing to extend the agreement as it will open up scope to ramp up drilling activities in the U S  This in turn will hurt crude prices No Decision on Deal ExtensionIf OPEC refrains from taking any decision in the Nov 30 Vienna meet  oil prices will collapse   British multinational bank Barclays   NYSE BCS   said that OPEC s decision to delay its verdict until the first quarter of next year will disappoint the market  Per Barclays  Brent crude will decline to the mid  50 range from more than  60 a barrel Nine Month ExtensionCNBC reveals that with the speculation of oil to go up  hedge funds are opting for more long positions on crude futures  The decision is creating a ceiling in the oil price chart as traders will probably book profits once the commodity reaches a certain mark On top of that  the gathering of crude drillers in oil resources  as revealed by the recent rig count  of oilfield services player Baker Hughes  a GE company   NYSE BHGE    will also hinder the crude rally Baker Hughes reported that rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 923 in the week ended Nov 22   higher than the prior week s 915  This marked an increase for three consecutive weeks after the tally fell for five weeks in a row Which Energy Stocks to Buy The fate of energy companies largely depends on crude

99113,320628,BKR,5 Energy Stocks That Crushed The S P 500 In 2017,opinion,The S P 500 index witnessed steady growth in earnings over the last three quarters and will likely report earnings growth in the fourth quarter as well  As per our   the index garnered a total of  277 3 billion   293 4 billion and  303 2 billion in the first  second and third quarters  respectively  For the October to December quarter  we expect higher earnings for the S P 500 at  310 9 billion We note that the energy sector has been a major contributor to the S P 500 s growth story  In fact  among all the 16 Zacks sectors in the index  energy is probably the only one which is expected to witness triple digit earnings growth in Q4 Hence  it seems prudent for investors to choose stocks from a sector that has clearly crushed the S P 500 in 2017 Healthiest Free Cash Flow Since Oil WeaknessBefore considering any particular stock or sector  investors should analyze the security s free cash flow  Free cash flow measures the amount of operating cash flow remaining for business investments after deducting capital spending    Our proprietary model shows that the sector has witnessed almost a 161 1  rise in free cash flow over the trailing 12 months  Also  the sectors free cash flow has been the healthiest since the free fall in crude price in mid 2014   Reflecting the bullishness  long term debt for the sector declined over the first nine months of 2017  Short term debt also plunged reflecting the sector s improving financial strength   What s Driving the Energy Sector The improving financial metrics were primarily supported by a partial recovery in crude price in 2017  Looking at the U S  Energy Information Administration s  EIA  average crude prices for all the months in 2017  it is clear that the commodity pricing scenario has been much better than the prior year period                             The year 2017 has been a remarkable one for energy investors with the OPEC agreeing to extend the production cut deal beyond the first quarter of 2018  an imperative step to fight the global crude glut  On Nov 30  OPEC members met non OPEC players to decide on an extension of the crude production cut accord  first signed in late 2016  More than 20 oil producers  including leading exporters like Russia and Saudi Arabia  participated in the meeting As expected by most analysts  all crude exporters decided to extend the deal through 2018 end  Through the end of next year  Saudi Arabia  Russia and their allies pledged to put 1 8 million barrels a day of crude oil out of the market Which Energy Stocks Beat the S P 500  Year to date  the S P 500 index rallied 20 6   The U S  stock market is regularly scaling all time highs  Stocks have mostly rallied since last year s election  with a booming U S  economy  supportive monetary policy and robust corporate earnings being the key growth drivers  Expectations that the Trump administration s proposed tax and regulatory reforms will help companies and consumers have boosted investors  sentiments further  There are energy stocks that have rallied higher than the S P 500 on a year to date basis  Before zeroing in on the stocks  let us take a look at how the upstream  midstream and downstream businesses have fared in 2017 The healthy oil price scenario was favorable for upstream business as explorers were able to sell the commodity at a higher price  This resulted in an increased number of drilling rigs at domestic oil resources  per the report of Houston based oilfield services player Baker Hughes  a GE company   NYSE BHGE    According to the report  from Jan 6 to Dec 15  rig count jumped from 665 to 930 Crude production surged on ramped up drilling which drove demand for midstream properties like pipeline and storage facilities  Companies engaged in refining and marketing businesses were major gainers as well  Free cash flow for the industry rose 21 3  over the trailing 12 months  Higher refinery margins and utilization primarily supported the results   Our ChoicesEmploying our proprietary   we found four energy stocks that have gained more than 20 6   beating the S P 500 index The stocks also flaunt

99114,320629,BKR,Why Halliburton Is A Better Stock Than Schlumberger For 2018,opinion,"Among the major oilfield services firms  Schlumberger Limited  SLB  and Halliburton Company  NYSE HAL   HAL  deserve a special mention  given their massive market caps of  86 4 billion and  38 8 billion  respectively  These companies dominate and define the  to which they belong to 
Both of these firms have interesting earnings surprise histories  Halliburton surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the prior four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 41 2   However  Schlumberger beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in only one of the last four quarters and came up with an average positive earnings surprise of 4 2  
Given that West Texas Intermediate crude recently traded at  60 per barrel  the highest mark since Jun 25  2015   we can say the business environment is highly favorable for oilfield services players  The latest rig count report by Houston based Baker Hughes  BHGE  clearly shows that the number of rigs exploring for oil and gas in the United States has increased from 665 to 931  year to date  Ramping up drilling activities should call for more oilfield service contracts  
Although both the stocks are attractive picks for investors based on their earnings reports and favorable business scenario  our research shows Halliburton is a better choice than Schlumberger for 2018  
The Analysis
We have employed three parameters for an in depth comparative analysis 
Positive Earnings Estimate Revisions
Earnings estimate revisions are at the heart of the Zacks investment philosophy  Stocks that have recently had their estimates revised upward by analysts tend to outperform the market in the next 9 12 months 
In the last 60 days  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Halliburton s 2018 earnings has risen from  2 11 per share to  2 16 per share  Moreover  for 2018  we expect the company to report year over year earnings growth of 86 5  
However  the story is different for Schlumberger  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 has been revised downward  from earnings per share of  2 25 to  2 14 in the last 60 days  Also  for 2018  we anticipate the company to witness year over year earnings growth of 46  
Strong Potential to Generate Cash Flow
Investors often look for indicators that help them determine the ability of a company to generate free cash flow from investments  For this purpose  we have employed the free cash flow yield ratio  Companies with strong operations generally have high free cash flow yield 
Our proprietary model shows that free cash flow yield for Halliburton is 3 7   higher than 3 5  for Schlumberger   
Sufficient Funds to Meet Capital Expenditure
A company s free cash flow is calculated after deducting capital spending from operating cash flow  In the last four quarters  free cash flow for Halliburton came in at  1 566 billion  indicating that the firm has sufficient cash flow to fund capital spending 
In other words  Halliburton generated  2 516 billion in net cash from core operations  while its capital spending amounted to  950 million  Most importantly  its trailing twelve month free cash flow for 2017 has turned positive from negative free cash flow of  2 279 billion in 2016  reflecting massive improvement in the company s operations  
Although Schlumberger s free cash flow of  3 289 billion is higher than that of Halliburton  it has been decreasing steadily since 2015  If the trend continues  Schlumberger s reliance on debt capital for financing future operations will increase Conclusion
Our comparative analysis shows that the returns from investment at Halliburton are higher than Schlumberger  On top of that  earnings estimate revision trends are also in favor of Halliburton 
This is reflected in Halliburton s Zacks Rank  2  Buy   which suggests that the stock could outperform the broader U S  equity market over the next one to three months  Meanwhile  Schlumberger carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold

99170,320685,BKR,US Oil Boom More Like A Whisper  Drilling Data Say,news,"By   

U S  energy companies are easing off on the creation of oil wells as crude prices hover around six year lows  according to drilling data released Wednesday  The slowdown in production is costing the American economy thousands of jobs and could halt the U S  oil boom until prices recover 
Oil companies drilled 28 percent fewer wells in January across the continental U S  than they did last June  an analysis by Rice University s Baker Institute for Public Policy found  Oil prices per barrel have plunged by more than one half since last summer    from  100 plus then to about  50 now    as the global crude supply outstrips demand 
Wells drilled in January can produce about 515 000 barrels of oil a day  or 8 5 percent less crude than wells drilled in June  according to Drillinginfo Inc   which supplied data for the report  In the past month  oil production has continued to drop  falling by about 9 percent in January as the number of oil rigs and new permits for drilling steadily decline  the Drillinginfo Index said 

The data came on the heels of a Tuesday announcement by the Halliburton Co   a Houston oil field services firm  that it plans to cut between 5 200 and 6 400 jobs as oil and gas production slows  The cuts represent from 6 5 percent to 8 percent of the company s 80 000 person workforce 
 Unfortunately  we are faced with the difficult reality that reductions are necessary to work through the challenging market environment   Halliburton representative Emily Mir told reporters in a statement 
Baker Hughes Inc  said last month that it would cut 7 000 jobs worldwide because of lower oil prices  Globally  the world s top four oil field services companies have slashed a combined 30 000 jobs in recent weeks 
The scaling back of U S  energy production is a victory for the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries  led by Saudi Arabia  The oil cartel has so far declined to curb its own production  a move that would shore up crude prices and allow North American firms to maintain market share  OPEC said Monday it now expects countries outside the cartel to grow production by just 850 000 barrels a day in 2015  down from its previous forecast of 1 27 million barrels a day ",2015-02-11,International Business Times,"https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/us-oil-boom-more-like-a-whisper,-drilling-data-say-327646",327646

Wall Street Expects Terrific Q2 Earnings  Top 5 Picks 

	Double digit gains among the biggest Internet stocks on the Wall Street have raised overvaluation concerns  while increased uncertainty over President Trump s agenda could trigger a market pullback in the second half of this year  An overly aggressive Fed and a further decline in oil prices might lead to a correction of 10  or more this year 

	However  over the next few weeks  Wall Street is likely to focus less on such concerns and more on Corporate America  which is certainly poised to be in a healthy shape mostly from an earnings perspective  Consistent earnings growth enthralls almost everyone  right from the top brass to research analysts  This is simply because earnings are a measure of the money a company is making 

	This could be an excellent earnings season for the S P 500  which in turn will boost its operating earnings per share for the trailing 12 months  Improved second quarter economic growth  strong manufacturing and service surveys  and a moderate uptick in wage growth are expected to help Corporate America post relatively high profit margins in Q2 

	Earnings growth is expected to be led by energy  financials and information technology  Hence  let us keep an eye on stocks that are likely to make the most of the second quarter earnings season  Here  we should also bear in mind that better than expected earnings performances generally lead to a rally in the share price 

Q2 Earnings Season Takes the Spotlight

	According to estimates  total second quarter earnings for the S P 500 cohort are expected to be up 5 8  from same period last year on 4 5  higher revenues  This would follow earnings growth of 13 3  in Q1 on 7  revenue growth  the highest in at least two years  Sam Stovall  chief investment strategist at CFRA Research  further added that history shows the final tally will be better in Q2  as actual EPS exceeded initial estimates in each of the last 21 quarters and have done so by an average of 3 6 percentage points  

	If we move beyond Q2  total earnings for the S P 500 cohort are anticipated to increase 6 3  on 4 5  higher revenues in Q3 and gain by 9 8  on 5 3  higher revenues in Q4  For the entire year  total earnings for the index are expected to be up 7 4  on 4 2  higher revenues  This will be way more than 1 1  earnings growth on 2 1  higher revenues recorded last year  read more     

Potential Gainer of Q2

	Energy is expected to be the biggest contributor to the overall earnings growth in the second quarter  Even though oil prices slipped from late May through late June  Corporate America is expected to fight such headwinds  with energy sectors earnings growth expected at over 300   Other sectors likely to see double digit earnings growth in Q2 are Aerospace  Construction and Industrial Products sectors  with gains of 48 8   15 7  and 11 9   respectively 

	The two biggest sectors in the S P 500 Index  Finance and Technology  are also projected to put up a stellar show  Despite a flattening yield curve  financials will post strong revenue growth from capital markets since investment banking got a boost in advisory fees for IPOs  while M A saw continuous growth  To top it  encouraging annual  stress test  results  Fed forging on with the 25 basis point  bps  rate hike amid inflation worries and the Trump administration expected to push for lesser banking regulations are some of the positives that bode well for the financial sector  For Finance  earnings are expected to be up 5 8   read more     

	The technology sector is expected to register 10 1  earnings growth  Semiconductor industry earnings gains are estimated to drive the biggest share of an increase in technology sector earnings 

	Tech has come a long way  evolving from the dot com catastrophe to becoming a safety trade and are now favored by active managers  While tech companies being less sensitive to both taxes and interest rates bode well for them  one time tax on trillions of dollars held overseas will provide a necessary windfall for such companies who have hoarded money outside the U S  read more     

5 Stocks to Buy for Explosive Earnings Growth

99225,320740,BKR,Mexico Passes Oil And Gas Reform Laws,news,"By    Mexican President Enrique Pe a Nieto s oil policy came one step closer to fruition on Tuesday when legislators passed the Mexico Congress  energy bill that s set to finalize a broad overhaul of the country s natural resources wealth  The move is expected to boost Mexico energy production and open Mexico s oil fields through privatization 
The legislation cleared Mexico s Senate on Tuesday and passed the lower chamber early on Saturday following several months of debate  President Pe a Nieto is expected to announce the Mexican energy reform package in a speech this evening 
 This is monumental   Jorge Pi on  an oil expert at the University of Texas at Austin  told International Business Times about the measures   It shows the commitment of the Mexican government to move forward  
The new Mexican energy reform  rules hash out the fine print of the wider policy approved in December  which revised the Mexican Constitution to allow private and foreign firms to explore for and produce energy in the country  ending the 75 year Pemex monopoly  Pemex is Mexico s state run oil company  The new laws govern changes in areas such as energy regulation  tax policy  concessions and joint ventures 
Proponents of Mexico s energy reform hope it can stem declining production from Mexico s onshore and offshore oil fields by attracting outside expertise  Mexico is among the world s top 10 oil producers  but the Pemex monopoly has made it difficult to attract technology and resources needed to tap abundant  unconventional oil reserves in the Gulf of Mexico and in shale deposits in the northern states  they say 
Last year  Pemex produced about 2 5 million barrels of crude oil per day  a slight dip from 2012 and a stark fall from the 2004 peak of nearly 3 5 million barrels per day  according to U S  Energy Information Administration statistics   Pemex expects its crude output to fall farther to 2 41 million barrels a day this year    its lowest production in two decades  Bloomberg News reported in July 
Major oil companies such as Exxon Mobil Corp  NYSE XOM  Chevron Corp  NYSE CVX and Royal Dutch Shell Plc  NYSE RDS A  have long expressed interest in tapping Mexico s oil reserves  as have mid sized companies and petroleum services firms like Baker Hughes Inc  NYSE BHI and Halliburton Co  NYSE HAL  Under the new laws  Mexico could attract an additional  20 billion in foreign direct investment as soon as 2015  according to Bank of America Corp 

 We think that it would be a win win if ever there was one   William Colton  Exxon s vice president of corporate strategic planning  told reporters in December ahead of the constitutional reform 
President Enrique Pi on Nieto listed two key reasons for the global oil industry s interest in Mexico  First  the country s resource base is largely proven  and U S  oil companies already have experience tapping offshore reserves and shale deposits north of the border  The Burgos Basin  one of Mexico s largest shale deposits  for instance is estimated to hold 600 trillion cubic feet of recoverable shale gas and 13 billion barrels of recoverable shale oil  the sixth largest and eighth largest resources in the world  respectively 
Mexico is  not a new frontier area that has to be discovered  and in which there will be high risk exploratory drilling   he said 

Second  Mexico s proximity to the United States makes it easier and cheaper to transfer equipment  personnel and technical support from company headquarters in Texas or Louisiana  compared to setting up shop in the Middle East   There s an attractiveness from a cost perspective   Pi on said 
Mexican energy officials have modest ambitions for oil and gas output under the new energy landscape  saying they expect to increase output by roughly 500 000 barrels a day    to reach about 3 million barrels a day   by 2018  the New York Times reported this week  Over the longer term  the government hopes that private investment in offshore and shale fields will boost output even higher 
Mexico s energy  reform still faces fierce opposition from legislators on the left and much of the public  who fear that Mexico s oil wealth will flee the country and instead line the pockets of private and foreign companies  But Pi on said he doesn t think a public referendum to reverse the reforms is likely  since the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party  PRI  and conservative opposition National Action Party  PAN  control the majority of seats in Congress and the bulk of Mexico s 31 states   I think this is irreversible   he said of the overhaul ",2014-08-06,International Business Times,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/mexico-passes-oil-and-gas-reform-laws-301613,301613
99231,320746,BKR,US Rig Count Up For 23rd Week  Oklahoma Leads The Way,opinion,Oil field services firm Baker Hughes Inc    NYSE BHI   recently reported the rig count for the week ended Jun 23  In the U S   the total number of rigs increased from the preceding week  primarily owing to a rise in the number of land rigs  This also marks the 23rd consecutive increase in the U S  weekly rig count after the nation witnessed a drop in the count in the week ended Jan 13 Investors should know that among all the states in the U S   Oklahoma witnessed the highest rise in rig count  Rig Count Increases for North America Total rig count in North America   the U S  and Canada   for the week ended Jun 23 was 1111  The reported figure was higher than 1092 a week ago and 497 a year earlier Total U S  Rig  Total number of rigs in the U S  was 941  higher than 933 recorded in the week ended Jun 16  as well as 421 a year ago Of the total U S  rigs  land rig count stood at 915  The reported figure is higher than 908 rigs recorded in the previous week and 397 a year ago The number of U S  offshore rigs for the week ended Jun 23 was 22  The rig count is in line with the previous week s count and higher than 21 rigs recorded in the previous year U S  Oil Rig Count  The count was up by 11 from the previous week to 758  The number had skyrocketed to 1 609 in Oct 2014   the highest since Baker Hughes started reporting oil and natural gas rig counts separately in 1987  The tally was also well above the previous year s rig count of 330 U S  Natural Gas Rig Count  The count went down by 3 from last week to 183  Moreover  the current natural gas rig count is nearly 90  below the high of 1 606 reached in late summer 2008  There were 90 active natural gas rigs in the year ago period Canada Rig Count  In Canada  the total rig count was 170  compared with 159 last week  The count was 76 a year ago    Reasons for the UpsideIn North America  the U S  and Canada rig counts increased from the prior week and year  Oklahoma  where rig count rose by 5  was mainly responsible for the increase in the U S  weekly rig count  Rig count in North Dakota and Louisiana increased by 3 and 2  respectively  Let s analyze the broader factors  OPEC and 11 non OPEC players  including Russia  decided in the Vienna meeting on May 25  to  the production cut deal until Mar 2018  Thus  it is an ideal time for shale players to increase production at the expense of OPEC  especially because oil is trading way above the historical low level reached last February  No wonder  U S  shale producers have been gathering to oil patches as they aim to sell the commodity at higher prices  We should consider President Donald Trump s exit from  as a factor encouraging drillers to continue pumping more oil   Companies Poised to Benefit  Companies belonging to the  industry are likely to benefit the most from these developments  Our proprietary model shows that Viper Energy Partners LP  VNOM   Jagged Peak Energy Inc    NYSE JAG    Legacy Reserves LP   NASDAQ LGCY   and W T Offshore Inc    NYSE WTI   are among the upstream companies that are worth a bet right now  Viper Energy sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   while Jagged Peak  Legacy Reserves and W T Offshore carry a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  Viper Energy managed to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the prior four quarters  with an average positive earnings surprise of 20 35   Jagged Peak Energy is expected to see 295 4  rise in revenues in 2017 Legacy Reserves had an average positive earnings surprise of 11 84  in the last four quarters  On top of that  the stock will likely see an 85 6  increase in 2017 earnings W T Offshore beat earnings in each of the last four quarters at an average of 69 21  Zacks  Hidden TradesWhile we share many recommendations and ideas with the public  certain moves are hidden from everyone but selected members of our portfolio services  Would you like to peek behind the curtain today and view them Starting now  for the next month  I invite you to follow all Zacks  private buys and sells in real time from value to momentum   from stocks under  10 to ETF to option movers   from insider trades to companies that are about to report positive earnings surprises  we ve called them with 80   accuracy   You can even look inside portfolios so exclusive that they are normally closed to new investors ,2017-06-26,Zacks Investment Research,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/us-rig-count-up-for-23rd-week,-oklahoma-leads-the-way-200197779",200197779

99262,320777,BKR,Are U S  Shale Players Winning The Oil War Against OPEC ,opinion,"Crude supply glut has been weighing on commodity prices for over three years now  The intense race between big oil producers vying for market share has been adding to the problem 
Among the key producers  the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries  OPEC  and U S  shale drillers are noteworthy  We believe that shale players enjoy an edge over the OPEC in the production ramp up race  courtesy of the signing of a historical output cut deal by the cartel  Also  the agreement was extended in May 
How Did Crude Lose Strength 
During the 1990s and early 2000  the U S  was more dependent on crude import as domestic demand was way higher than the level of oil supply  With the invention of new techniques like hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling  U S  shale producers ramped up oil production considerably 
The shale boom turned the U S  into an oil surplus economy from a crude deficit one  Along with the U S   the OPEC also pumped more crude  All these led to a supply glut of the commodity  resulting in a price slide since mid 2014 
Weak Oil for Years
Oil prices have not been able to rebound to the levels achieved in the first half of 2014  In fact  it seems almost impossible for the commodity to scale back to the  100 per barrel level   
The constant race between major oil producers has led to the persistent slump in crude  The picture below clearly shows the downward trend in the commodity from Jun 2014 to Apr 2017  The data provided has been gathered from  

OPEC Output Cut to Drive Crude 
On Nov 30  2016  OPEC signed a landmark deal to curtail crude production by 1 2 million barrels a day  Following the cartel  on early December last year  non OPEC players headed by Russia have decided to lower oil output by 558 000 barrels per day  Hence  the collective cut stands at 1 8 million barrels a day 
In fact  on May 25  producers from both the sides voted to maintain the oil production cut until the end of the first quarter of next year  All these measures are reflective of oil producers  efforts to drive oil prices  which presently stand way below the mid 2014 level  
U S  Shale Players Bank on OPEC Measures
While the OPEC and some major producers like Russia are preparing to maintain the production cut  U S  shale players have been gathering on oil plays to pump more  This marks an opportune time for the U S  shale players to bump up production 
Also  given that crude has recovered from last year s historical low  U S  drillers will be able to sell the excess commodity at higher prices  The recent  of Baker Hughes Inc    NYSE BHI   is in support of the gathering of U S  drillers on crude resources 
We can say that stocks belonging to the industry are likely to benefit the most from these developments  Our proprietary model shows that Bonanza Creek Energy Inc    NYSE BCEI    Legacy Reserves LP   NASDAQ LGCY   and W T Offshore Inc    NYSE WTI   are among the upstream companies that are worth a bet right now 
Stocks from the  industry   such as Core Laboratories NV   NYSE CLB    C J Energy Services Inc    NYSE CJ   and Flotek Industries  Inc    NYSE FTK     are also poised to benefit as they will help upstream companies set up oil wells 
All the stocks from both the industries carry a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see

99298,320813,BKR,U S Rig Count Crosses 900 For First Time In 2 Years,opinion,"Oil field services firm Baker Hughes Inc    NYSE BHI   recently reported the rig count for the week ended May 19  2017 
Along with imminent OPEC meeting  the announcement of the U S rig count also made it to the headlines as the total number of oil and natural gas rigs crossed the mark of 900 for the first time since May 1  2015  Also  this is the 18th consecutive increase in the U S  weekly rig count after the nation witnessed a fall in the number of rigs during the week ended Jan 13   
North America Rig Count Increases
Total rig count in North America   the U S  and Canada   for the week ended May 19  was 986  The reported figure was higher than 965 a week ago and 448 a year earlier        
Total U S  Rig  Total number of rigs in the U S  was 901  This was higher than 885 rigs in the week ended May 12 and much higher than 404 a year ago       
Of the total U S  rigs  land rigs were 874  The reported figure is higher than 860 rigs in the previous week and 375 rigs in year ago period     
The number of U S  offshore rigs for the week ended May 19  was 23  This is higher than 21 rigs in the previous week but lower than 24 rigs in the previous year   
U S Oil Rig Count  The count was up by eight from the previous week to 720  The number had skyrocketed to 1 609 in Oct 2014   the highest figure since Baker Hughes started reporting oil and natural gas rig counts separately in 1987  The tally is also well above the previous year s rig count of 318   
U S Natural Gas Rig Count  The count improved by eight from the last week to 180  However  the current natural gas rig count is nearly 90  below the high of 1 606 reached in late summer 2008  There were 85 active natural gas rigs in the year ago period     
Canada rig  In Canada  the total rig count was 85 compared with 80 rigs in last week  There were 44 rigs a year ago         
Reasons for Improvement
In North America  both the U S  and Canada rig counts increased from the prior week and the previous year  Texas  where rig count rose by eight  was mainly responsible for the increase in the U S  weekly rig count  Oklahoma  where the count of rig was up by four  was also responsible for the rise in the number of rigs in the U S    
Let s analyze the broader factors for the increase in rig count in the U S  Since OPEC and non OPEC countries agreed to curb crude output amid the supply glut  oil prices jumped and nearly doubled from the lows it slipped to in last February  Also  energy ministers of Saudi Arabia and Russia held discussions to  to the end of Mar 2018  This should further strengthen oil prices 
Given these developments  U S  shale producers have been gathering to oil patches as they will be able to sell the commodity at higher prices  U S  exploration and production  E P  companies are expected to produce more  in turn  gaining a larger market share at the expense of OPEC

99299,320814,BKR,Trump s Paris Deal Exit To Support Oil Production  5 Picks,opinion,"President Donald Trump s exit from the Paris climate accord is now dominating headlines  When almost every country has signed the deal to protect the world from greenhouse gas emissions  Trump s pull out has become a topic of interest for investors 
The move will create jobs in the fossil fuel industry  This is also in line with the President s pre election commitments  This also lends an edge to U S  upstream companies over OPEC as they can now continue with their exploration and production activities 
Paris Climate Deal
The accord aims to bring all nations on the same platform in the fight against global warming  The efforts are directed toward putting a check on rising global temperatures by keeping it below 2 C above the pre industrial mark by the end of this century 
If this temperature mark is crossed  the world might face problems related to the availability of food and water  There could be a drastic change in the pattern of weather and a rise in sea levels 
Though there is no detailed description on how the countries will reach their respective goals  there is a framework with specified oversight and accountability  Out of the 195 countries that have signed the agreement  147 parties have ratified it 
Why Has Trump Pulled Out 
Trump thinks that the climate deal is not going to do much for the environment and called it a  self inflicted major economic wound   The president added that the treaty will paralyze the U S  economy  especially the fossil fuel industry  The accord will adversely affect the American workers and will give undue advantages to the biggest polluters of the world 
In other words  the President claimed that getting into the deal will distribute wealth among other countries  thus putting the interest of other parties ahead of the U S 
The decision reflects Trump s commitment toward his promise of creating jobs in America and giving preference to the country s energy industries 
Trump s Decision Favors Oil Players  
Oil players in the U S  have more initiative to continue production as Trump s pull out is in favor of fossil fuel  U S crude plays will likely see more drillers in the days ahead  In fact  the recent weekly rig count data provided by oil field services firm Baker Hughes Inc    NYSE BHI   showed the 20th consecutive increase in U S  weekly rig count 
We can say that OPEC s agreement of maintaining the production cut for another nine months along with Trump s recent decision will drive traction for U S  upstream players in the oil industry 
With increased exploration and production activities there will be higher requirements for drillers and oilfield services firms for digging and efficiently setting up the crude wells  Higher production will call for improved demand for new midstream infrastructures that includes transportation and storage facilities

Canada Rig Count  In Canada  the total rig count was 99  compared with 93 last week  The count was 41 a year ago 
Reasons for Improvement
In North America  the U S  and Canada rig counts increased from the prior week and the previous year  Oklahoma  where rig count rose by 3  was mainly responsible for the increase in the U S  weekly rig count 
Let s analyze the broader factors for the rise in rig count in the U S 
OPEC and 11 non OPEC players  including Russia  decided in the Vienna meeting on May 25  to  the production cut deal by another nine months  Thus  it is an ideal time for shale players to increase production at the expense of OPEC  especially because oil is trading way above the historical low level reached last February  No wonder  U S  shale producers have been gathering to oil patches as they aim to sell the commodity at higher prices

99342,320857,BKR,U S  Rig Count Rises For 17 Consecutive Weeks,opinion,"Oil field services firm Baker Hughes Inc    NYSE BHI   recently reported the rig count for the week ended May 12  2017  In the U S   the total number of rigs increased from the previous week  primarily owing to an increase in the number of land rigs  This is the 17th consecutive increase in the U S  weekly rig count after the nation witnessed a fall in the number of rigs during the week ended Jan 13  
North America Rig Count
Total rig count in North America   the U S  and Canada   for the week ended May 12  was 965  The reported figure was higher than 959 a week ago and 449 a year earlier    
Total U S  Rig  Total number of rigs in the U S  was 885  This was higher than 877 rigs in the week ended May 5  as well as 406 a year ago     
Of the total U S  rigs  land rigs were 860  The reported figure is higher than 853 rigs in the previous week and 382 rigs in year ago period   
The number of U S  offshore rigs for the week ended May 12  was 21  This is higher than 19 rigs in the previous week but lower than 22 rigs in the previous year   
U S Oil Rig Count  The count was up by nine from the previous week to 712  The number had skyrocketed to 1 609 in Oct 2014   the highest figure to have been registered since Baker Hughes started reporting oil and natural gas rig counts separately in 1987  The tally is also well above the previous year s rig count of 318    
U S Natural Gas Rig Count  The count slipped by one from the last week to 172  Moreover  the current natural gas rig count is almost 90  below the high of 1 606 reached in late summer 2008  There were 87 active natural gas rigs in the year ago period     
Canada rig  In Canada  the total rig count was 80 compared with 82 rigs in last week  There were 43 rigs a year ago          
Reasons for Improvement
In North America  only the U S  rig count increased both from the prior week and the previous year  Texas  where rig count rose by eight  was mainly responsible for the increase in the U S  weekly rig count 
Let s analyze the broader factors for the increase in rig count in the U S  Since OPEC and non OPEC countries agreed to curb crude output amid the supply glut  oil prices jumped and nearly doubled from the lows it slipped to in last February  Also  energy ministers of Saudi Arabia and Russia held discussions to extend the OPEC deal to the end of March next year  This should further strengthen oil prices 
Given these developments  U S  shale producers have been gathering to oil patches as they will be able to sell the commodity at higher prices  U S  exploration and production  E P  companies are expected to produce more  in turn  gaining a larger market share at the expense of OPEC 
Companies Poised to Benefit  
U S  E P firms are likely to benefit the most from these developments  Our proprietary model shows that Penn Virginia Corporation   NASDAQ PVAC    Stone Energy Corporation   NYSE SGY   and W T Offshore Inc    NYSE WTI   are among the upstream companies that are worth including in your portfolio  Penn Virginia sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   while Stone Energy and W T Offshore carry a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see    
All the three stocks show strong pricing figure and were able to outperform the Zacks categorized  industry  month to date  While the broader industry registered an increase 0 4  during the aforesaid period  shares of Penn Virginia  Stone Energy and W T Offshore gained 7 4   1 8  and 3  respectively

99383,320898,BKR,5 Oil Stocks Likely To Stand Out In Q1 With Stellar Earnings ,opinion,"The energy sector is one of the prime contributors to the S P 500 index and hence investors give utmost importance to this sector  especially ahead of a reporting cycle  Good news is that the energy sector is expected to progress from a modest loss in the year earlier period to positive earnings in the January to March quarter of this year  In other words  the sector is expected to see great growth in terms of revenues and earnings year over year 
This return to the profit path keep positive sentiments for the energy space alive ahead of Q1 releases from oil giants like Exxon Mobil Corp    NYSE XOM    Chevron Corp    NYSE CVX    Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa  plc  and BP Plc   NYSE BP   
Stable Oil   Gas Prices 
WTI crude price displayed significant improvement in first quarter 2017  on a year over year basis  In fact  we noted substantial increase in average oil prices in the first two months this year 
According to data provided by the  EIA   the average WTI crude price in January and February was  52 50 and  53 47 per barrel  respectively  compared with  31 68 and  30 32 per barrel a year ago 
This massive improvement in the commodity s price from the mid Feb 2016 multi year low level of  26 21 per barrel came on the back of OPEC s historical production cut agreement signed on Nov 30  2016  No doubt  the deal was one of the most effective measures to recover oil prices amid plentiful supply  However  Mar 2017 showed a comparatively bearish trend in oil prices owing to the resurgence in output by U S  shale producers  
We have also noted significant improvement for the price of natural gas  The average commodity price in January and February was  3 30 and  2 85 per Million Btu  respectively  compared with  2 28 and  1 99 per Million Btu a year ago 
Energy Sector to Witness Highest Q1 Earnings Improvement 
Per the latest   among all the 16 Zacks sectors  energy is expected to witness the highest aggregate dollar amount of earnings improvement  We expect the sector to earn  8 1 billion in the first quarter of this year against a loss of  1 6 billion in the prior year quarter   
Moreover revenue for the Oil Energy sector is expected to improve almost 33  year over year compared with an unimpressive 2  growth during fourth quarter 2016  Most importantly  the top line growth for the Oil Energy is also likely be the highest for the first quarter 2017 among all the 16 Zacks sectors 
Margins are predicted to increase 4 6  year over year compared with only 0 3  expansion during the October December quarter of 2016  Most importantly  when 11 Zacks sectors belonging to the S P 500 index are projected to show a decline in margin growth for first quarter 2017  positive anticipated growth for the Oil Energy sector turns out impressive  Also  the sector s margin growth is predicted to be the highest among all the 16 Zacks sectors defining the S P 500 index   
The table below shows what is expected from the different sectors in Q1 compared with what was achieved in the preceding quarter 

Potential Gainers in Q1
The oil and gas price improvement should contribute to earnings of exploration and production companies as the firms could sell the commodities at considerably higher prices 
The ramping up of drilling activities during first quarter 2017 is clearly visible from the monthly rig count data of Baker Hughes Inc    NYSE BHI    There has been an increase in rig count in each of the three months of the quarter 
Higher exploration activities should call for more transportation and storage of oil and gas and hence could be beneficial for midstream energy companies also

99384,320899,BKR,Summer Driving To Heat Up Crude  5 Stocks To Buy,opinion,"We have already entered into the summer driving season and Americans are on the road again  This year  U S  roads could see more drivers as the unemployment rate touched record lows and a huge number of SUVs and light trucks were sold over the last two years 
Definitely  refiners need to produce more gasoline to support increasing demand for petroleum products which could boost the price of oil 
Summer Driving Creates Hope for Oil Investors
April through September is usually considered the summer driving season  when long road trips are common in the U S  This definitely boosts consumption for gasoline   the end product that refiners produce after refining raw crude 
Refiners in the U S  are gearing up their operations signaling a reduction in stockpiles of crude that should ease the glut  This event is building up hope for oil investors to bet long on crude contracts  In fact  as per Bloomberg  for the first time over six weeks  more hedge funds are betting on higher WTI crude 
Refinery utilization is already high  This year  as of the week ended Mar 31  utilization was 90 8   According to U S  Energy Information Administration  this utilization level is the highest since Jan 6  Naturally  we are optimistic on the space as the summer driving season should only jack up the level of utilization 
We are excited also because analysts are expecting this year s summer driving season to boost oil prices  This is because sales of SUVs and light trucks increased for two years in a row  Moreover  the unemployment rate in the U S  slipped to the lowest level in almost a decade in March 
OPEC also bet on petrol demand in the U S  during the summer driving season  In other words  the more crude is processed by refiners to support higher gasoline demand  the greater will be the demand for raw oil and higher will be price of the commodity this summer 
Other Catalysts Driving Crude
As per data reported by the U S  Census Bureau  China imported 8 08 million barrels of light crude from the U S  during February  almost four times the purchase in January  This led China to surpass Canada as the biggest importer of U S  oil  The crude export level of U S  has skyrocketed to a record 31 2 million barrels in February  In fact  John Auers   executive vice president at financial consulting firm Turner Mason   Co    commented   The U S  is a larger exporter of crude than many OPEC countries  
According to Bloomberg  since the ban on U S  crude export was lifted in Dec 2015  the country has exported 239 million barrels of crude  We can say that light oil is gradually spreading across the world 
Growing shipment of U S  oil to Asia shows improving demand for domestic crude to the outside world  It is obvious that the country is snatching away market share from Saudi Arabia and other producers in the Middle East 
Moreover  speculation that OPEC might extend the production cut deal and Russia will likely follow the same path to combat crude glut is also giving crude a boost 
Potential Gainers
The expected improvement in oil prices should contribute to the cash flows of exploration and production companies as these firms generate revenues out of selling the commodity  Also  drillers and oilfield services players could be good bets as they help oil explorers to efficiently get oil out of the ground 
On top of that  improving demand for gasoline will contribute to refiners  profits  Overall  investors should bet on both upstream and midstream energy companies at least during the summer driving season 
5 Promising Stocks 
Picking the upstream energy stocks from the stock universe can be a daunting task  To simplify the task we have selected stocks using our proprietary   
Here we have picked stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   You can see  
Moreover  these stocks have VGM score of  A  or  B   Our  says that companies having a combination of good Zacks Rank and VGM score are poised for bigger returns 
Houston  TX based Baker Hughes Inc    NYSE BHI   is one of the major oilfield service companies in the world  providing an array of services to the global oil and gas industry 
The company currently carries a Zacks Rank  2 and has a VGM score  B   We also expect the company to witness year over year earnings improvement of 111 03  during 2017 
Incorporated in 1959  Houston  TX based McDermott International   NYSE MDR   is an engineering and construction company  solely focused on the offshore oil and gas business 
The company has a VGM score of  A  and a Zacks Rank  2  Also  McDermott surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the prior four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 512 50  
Ocean Rig UDW LLC   NASDAQ ORIG   is involved in offshore drilling services to exploration and production companies 
The driller carries a Zacks Rank  2 and has a VGM score of  A   Moreover  the company posted an average positive earnings surprise of 66 63  over the prior four quarters 
Headquartered in Houston  TX Evolution Petroleum Corporation   TO E   is involved in exploitation of oil gas resources in the U S 
Evolution Petroleum holds a Zacks Rank  2 and has a VGM score of  B   We are anticipating the company to post year over year earnings growth of 163 6  for the current year 
Based in Rome  Italy  Eni SpA   TO E    with its consolidated subsidiaries  is engaged in both upstream and refining businesses 
The company has a Zacks Rank  2 and a VGM score of  A   On top of that  for 2017  the company will likely see earnings growth of 762

Elsewhere look for Gold to continue its bounce in its downtrend while Crude Oil continues higher  The US Dollar Index looks to continue consolidation of the break out move while US Treasuries may have bottomed in their downtrend  The Shanghai Composite looks to continue to consolidate in the uptrend and Emerging Markets are consolidating the bounce in the downtrend 
Volatility looks to remain low but out of abnormally low levels keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETF s SPY  NYSE SPY   IWM and QQQ  Their charts show short term pullbacks likely to continue within the long term uptrends  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well 
Here are the first 5 ideas for the week  to get you started 
Baker Hughes Incorporated  NYSE BHI 
Baker Hughes  came off of a base in September to run higher to a top in early December  Since then it has been consolidating against support at a higher base at 64  The range has been tightening in a descending triangle  A break of that triangle would look for a  3 move  The broader target on a break to the upside would be a Measured Move to 83  The RSI is stalling in its pullback  holding in the bullish zone but the MACD is still falling  The Bollinger Bands  are squeezing  often a precursor to a move  There is resistance at 66 40 and 68 before 69 30  the April 2015 high  and 74 60  For the longer term trader there is also a Cup and Handle back to that April 2015 high that gives a target to 98  Support lower comes at 64 and 62 30  Short interest is low at 2 5   Enter long on a move over 65 75 with a stop at 64  As it moves over 66 75 move the stop to break even and then to a  1 50 trailing stop over 67 25  Take off 1 3 on a stall at 74 60 or higher  As an options trade consider the January 65 Calls  offered at  2 02 late Friday  and trade them like the stock trade  using the stock price as a trigger  stop and target  
CBOE Holdings Inc  NASDAQ CBOE 
CBOE  started higher off of a pullback kin October to find resistance at a significantly important level in November  It settled there for two weeks and then moved higher in a second leg  a 213  extension of the first move  From there it pulled back to the 161 8  extension and is consolidating as the Bollinger Bands squeeze  A slight lift Friday combined with the RSI strengthening in the bullish zone suggest a reversal and third leg higher may come soon  The MACD remains heading lower though  The 3rd leg would look for a move to 82 50  to complete a 3 Drives pattern  Support lower comes at 73 25 and 70 25 followed by 68 65  Resistance comes at 74 20 and 77 25  Short interest is elevated at 8 6   Enter long on a move over 74 20 with a stop at 73 20  As it moves over 74 50 move the stop to a  1 30 trailing stop and take off 1 3 on a stall at 82 50 or higher  As an options trade consider the January 72 50 Calls   2 20  and trade them like the stock trade 
Jabil Circuit  NYSE JBL 
Jabil Circuit   gapped higher after earnings out of a consolidation that had lasted 3 months  The gap opened at a very significant price level  The thin line shows the 23 65 price that has significance back to 2012  After the gap it has now pulled back to that level  A hold and reversal here would be a strong buy signal  But the RSI is pulling back and the MACD about to cross down  This suggests to watch for a break down and gap fill  There is support at 23 65 and then 22 50 and 22 before 21 25 and 20 50  Resistance above stands at 24 and 24 50 followed by 25 10  Short interest is moderate at 5 2   Enter short on a move under 23 50 with a stop at 24  As it moves under 23 25 move the stop to a 50 cent trailing stop and take off 1 3 on a stall at 22 or lower  As an options trade consider the January 24 Puts  80 cents  and trade them like the stock trade  There is big open interest at the 22 Put strike which could also pull it lower  If you are comfortable owning this stock at 22 then a January 23 22 1 2 Put Spread  20 cents  is a cheap way to add some downside participation on the way there 
JetBlue Airways Corporation  NASDAQ JBLU 
JetBlue  has been rounding out of a bottom for the past year  This seems to be firmly in place since November  As it continues higher it will set up a series of Cup and Handle patterns with increasing target prices  Over the last 2 weeks it has consolidated in a descending triangle  retesting the 20 day SMA  This give a Cup and Handle target of 29 on a break higher  The RSI is in the bullish zone and turning back higher while the MACD is resetting lower  There is support at 22 and 21 followed by 20  Resistance above stands at 23 and 23 60 followed by 24 65 and 26 50 before 27  Short interest is low at 3 0   Enter long on a move over 22 75 with a stop at 22  As it moves over 23 20 move the stop to break even and then to a 60 cent trailing stop over 23 35  Take off 1 3 on a stall at 27 or higher and by 29  As an options trade consider the January 22 Calls   1 00  and trade them like the stock trade 
Banco Santander  MC SAN 
Banco Santander  made a double top in July 2015 and started lower  It found support in February and bounced  but it could not get over its 200 day SMA or a 23 6  retracement of the down leg  In October it managed to move above the 200 day and set a higher high before a pullback  The pullback retested the 200 day SMA at a higher low and then it jumped higher to another higher high near the 23 6  retracement  Since early December it has moved in a bull flag and looks to be ready to break that to the upside into the New Year  That would give a Measured Move to 5 85  The RSI is bullish and rising while the MACD is also turning back higher  There is resistance at 5 25 and 5 55 followed by 5 80 and 6 05  Support lower comes at 5 00  Short interest is low at less than 1   Enter long now  over 5 10  with a stop at 5  As it moves over 5 30 move the stop to break even and then to a 20 cent trailing stop over 5 35  Take off 1 3 on a stall at 6 05 or higher  As an options trade consider the January 5 Calls  25 cents  and trade them like the stock trade

99421,320936,BKR,Opening Bell  Oil  NatGas Sink  NASDAQ Hits New High,opinion,"by Eli Wright
Oil fell yesterday on fears of oversupply ahead of US Crude Oil Inventories and natural gas prices sank to a one month low on warm winter weather forecasts  The US dollar dipped  and many equity markets  including the Dow and S P 500 followed suit  on weaker energy and financial stocks  The big exception was the NASDAQ  which hit another new record high  A variety of NASDAQ listed healthcare stocks saw strong gains yesterday as well  Currently  global markets are mixed 
In Asia overnight  the Hang Seng rose 0 73  to close at 22 738  However  the rising yen put pressure on the Nikkei Index  which dropped 0 79  to 19 301 44  The Shanghai Composite also fell  down 0 32  to 3 161 24 
In Europe this morning  the DAX edged 0 05  lower  to 11 558 50 while the Stoxx 50 declined 0 24  to 3 301 50  However the FTSE 100 has been riding the pound s decline to new record highs  The FTSE is currently up 0 18  to 7 250 50 
On Wall Street  the Dow lost 0 38  to close at 19 887 38 while the S P 500 fell 0 34  to 2 268 90  The NASDAQ  on the other hand  rose 0 19  to a record high of 5 531 82 
In pre market trading  the Dow is down 0 03   the S P is down 0 04   and the NASDAQ is flat 
The US 2 year Treasury yield has slipped bit to 1 194   However 10  and 30 year yields are both up  to 2 381  and 2 971   respectively 
Forex
The dollar traded weaker yesterday  the Dollar Index is currently down to 101 69  The JOLTS Job Openings report later this morning could spur the greenback higher  the expected 5 555M reading would be a bit higher than last month s numbers  The President elect s speech tomorrow  during which he will likely provide details on his plans for fiscal and trade policy  could have additional impact on the USD 
The Chinese yuan moved up 0 2  overnight  to 6 9236  after Chinese PPI came in at 5 5   better than the 4 5  expected  The Japanese yen is currently trading at 115 78 versus the dollar  And the euro firmed  back over  1 06 
In Britain on Sunday  Prime Minister Theresa May described her position on where things would stand once Article 50 was triggered  including that her government would prioritize populist politics and anti immigration reforms over access to Europe s single market  Traders took it to mean she favored a hard Brexit and they ve been expressing their displeasure ever since by offloading the pound  It has plummeted to an 11 week low of  1 2121 

In the coming days  sterling will likely be influenced by UK Manufacturing data and Trade Balance  figures  both due out tomorrow 
Commodities
The weaker dollar  combined with declining US equities  sent some investors back to gold  Yesterday the yellow metal advanced nearly one percent  It s currently trading at  1 184 65 
It may almost be time to shift from the bearish view of the precious metal  Even though since Election Day  US stocks have rallied 6 5  while gold has dropped as much as 7 6   yesterday s Wall Street price action showed that some investors think the stock market may be over inflated  as discussed here yesterday  Should that be the case  perhaps it could be time to view gold as undervalued 
Additionally  if inflation outpaces the Fed s rate hikes  than real rates what you get when you subtract inflation from the Federal funds rate could turn negative  which would be good news for gold bulls 
Oil fell more than two percent yesterday as last week s Baker Hughes report showing US oil rig counts at a one year high  the tenth straight weekly increase for this metric  finally began to outweigh the optimism traders had been feeling about OPEC production cuts 
It appears oil prices could at least for the foreseeable future remain in a tug a war  with news of OPEC production cuts counterbalanced by news of US production increases and or OPEC deal compliance failures  Some analysts think that oil bears are ready to challenge  50 support  However  as of this writing  oil prices are up approximately 0 30   crude is  52 32  while Brent is  55 33 
Natural gas prices fell 5  yesterday  as updated short term weather models expect above average temperatures in large swathes of the country for the next two weeks  It s currently trading at  3 157 
Stocks
Though the S P and Dow dropped  some NASDAQ listed stocks  in particular a variety of healthcare stocks were the big winners yesterday 

Diffusion Pharma  NASDAQ DFFN  skyrocketed an incredible 176 7   EnteroMedics Inc  NASDAQ ETRM  soared 92 6   and ARIAD Pharmaceuticals  NASDAQ ARIA  jumped 72 85   GenVec Inc  NASDAQ GNVC   Viking Therapeutics  NASDAQ VKTX   CTi Biopharma  NASDAQ CTIC   EXACT Sciences  NASDAQ EXAS   and NewLink Genetics  NASDAQ NLNK  all saw big gains as well  Even pet healthcare saw a bounce  animal hospital operator VCA Antech Inc  NASDAQ WOOF  agreed to be acquired by privately held food giant Mars  Inc and saw shares rise 28 29  
The S P drop of 0 34  yesterday was largely a product of sinking oil and gas prices  Virtually all 35 components of the Energy Index got hit and the sector led all S P decliners  falling 1 46

The Information Technology Index  up 0 20  yesterday  was one of the only sectors to post gains  The biggest gainer was Global Payments  NYSE GPN   which jumped 7 17  on better than expected Q2 2017 earnings  EPS was  0 89  higher than the expected  0 87  and revenue was  817 2M  significantly better than the  524M that was expected 
NVIDIA  NASDAQ NVDA  rose 4 05   it s now up 261  TTM  Applied Materials  NASDAQ AMAT  and Western Digital  NASDAQ WDC  both gained approximately 2  
In other news  it would be na ve to assume that every company that embraces Trump s campaign promise to bring jobs to America will see immediate gains  However  two companies Alibaba  NYSE BABA  and Fiat Chrysler  NYSE FCAU  saw their stock shares rise yesterday when they indicated they were in sync with Trump s job growth wishes 
Alibaba founder and executive chairman Jack Ma met with the President elect yesterday to discuss how Alibaba could create one million American jobs by connecting US businesses with Chinese consumers  It is estimated that 80  of Chinese online purchases are made via the Alibaba platform  Alibaba shares rose 0 88  yesterday  and are up an additional 0 08  in after hours trading 
As well yesterday  Fiat Chrysler pre empted a Trump Twitter attack  confirming the company plans to add 2 000 US jobs and invest  1 billion to upgrade its US factories  Shares rose 1 44  on the day ",2017-01-10,Investing.com,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/opening-bell:-oil-and-usd-down,-gold-rises,-markets-mixed-200171997",200171997

Energy   5 80 

Analysis conclusion  In an overbought market  seemingly  where everyone is looking for a pullback  the Energy sector is the most oversold of the 11 S P 500 sectors  and for good reason  Energy s market cap weighting in the S P 500 is roughly 8   and clients hold a roughly 8    10  Energy weight in their respective accounts  depending on the client   and that weight might be lifted a 1  or 2  this coming week given the sector s oversold status 
The top three sectors in the S P 500  by market cap weighting  are Technology at 20   Health Care at 15  and Financial s at 15   Relative to the benchmark weighting  Technology remains client s largest overweight relative to the S P 500 weight  Financials are overweight to neutral weight depending on the client  and Health Care is currently the most underweight at just 3    5  of accounts  but that weighting is currently being boosted after Health Care s under performance in 2016 
The dividend or  safety trade  we stayed away from for years which means Utilties  Telco  Reit s  MLP s  were never owned in any real size or quantity  or at all for that matter  and this  trade  continues to under perform relatively as interest rates start to rise  and a  return to global growth  theme starts to unfold across much of the world s markets 
How do  expected  Energy earnings look today  Source  Thomson Reuters I B E S   This Week in Earnings  as of 2 17 17 

Q4  17   162 7  vs 136 7  as of Jan 1  17 
Q3  17   220 9   vs 227 8  as of Jan 1  17

Q1  17   733 6  vs N A as of Jan 1  17 
Q4  16   0 8  vs  4 9  as of Jan 1  17

While the percentages look strong  this is a function of the Energy sector s very bad earnings in 2016  The expected net income dollar amounts or profitability are lower than prior years but there is still Energy sector earnings growth expected in 2017 
Energy s bear case is well understood  and the frackers that will turn on marginal projects if crude stays in the low  50 price range  I do think the Energy pricing landscape is forever changed with US fracking  and we likely wont see  100 crude oil for   well   ever given some of the recent findings  like in Mexico  etc    however  the easy compares with last year  the poor sentiment around the sector and the longer tailed cycles of the sector  lead me to conclude that giving the sector one or two more quarters to work higher makes sense   Long the XLE  NYSE XLE   OIH  IYE  and a small position in XOP  
One final thought on the sector  Factset s earnings work  is first rate  and high quality  On Factset s Weekly Earnings Insight  there is a section which details the  upward  and  downward  change in EPS estimates for the top 10 companies within the S P 500 respectively  It is an interesting graph for momentum investors that wish to follow trends in estimate changes 
The point is  in this week s Earnings Insight  5 of the top 10 companies with the greatest  upward change  in Q1  17 EPS are Energy companies 
1   Pioneer Natural Resources Company  NYSE PXD   715 
2   Anadarko Petroleum Corp  NYSE APC   227 5 
3   Murphy Oil  NYSE MUR    123 
7   ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP    99 
10   Concho Resources Inc  NYSE CXO    57 
And to be even handed for readers  of the Top 10 with the  downward change  in Q1  17 estimates  4 are also Energy companies 
3   Phillips 66  NYSE PSX    48 
6   Marathon Petroleum  NYSE MPC    83 6 
9   Transocean Ltd  NYSE RIG    192 4 
10   Baker Hughes Incorporated  NYSE BHI     356 
No question that today  Energy is what Jim Cramer would call a  battleground  sector  The deep water drillers like Transocean Ltd  NYSE RIG  and Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc  NYSE DO  are thought to be in secular decline  There is just going to be less demand for deep water oil and gas equipment with the emergence of fracking technology 
To conclude  given the sentiment and uncertainty around the sector  I thought it was worth a trade to the long side for the next quarter or two  Exxon  NYSE XOM  and Chevron  NYSE CVX  account for the lion s share of the sector net income and earnings  and together the two international  integrated oil giants comprise roughly 30  or more of the Energy Select Sector SPDR  NYSE XLE  and iShares US Energy  NYSE IYE  energy ETF s  Chevron had a disappointing Q4  16 earnings report and call  and CVS is now nearing its 200 day moving average  Exxon is still below its 200 day moving average 
While ETF s are currently being used to invest in the sector  individual companies may and can be bought and I may not post an update  The Q1  17 earnings reports will matter much both in terms of the actual results for the sector and how the stocks react to the financial results

	Friday s gains were mostly broad based with most of the major S P 500 sectors closed in the green while financial and energy sectors ended in negative territory  Both these two sectors were major performers after Trump s victory in U S  Presidential election 

	Recently  Trump s polices including tax cuts  repealing regulations and pickup in infrastructure outlays restored expectations of a pro growth agenda  However  investors remained skeptical on Friday over Trump administration s ability to implement his economic policies this year and wait for clues as Trump is set to speak at a joint Congress session Tuesday night

99461,320976,BKR,5 Energy Stocks To Buy As U S  Rig Count Hits 10 Month High,opinion,"In its weekly release  Houston based oilfield services company Baker Hughes Inc    NYSE BHI   reported a rise in the U S  rig count  number of rigs searching for oil and gas in the country    the eighteenth increase in 21 weeks  This can be attributed to addition in the tally of oil directed rigs as commodity prices tick up and efficiencies improve 
Importantly  bulk of the gains  11 out of 20  were in the Permian Basin of West Texas  an area that continues to be profitable even at the current low oil prices 
Analysis of the Data
Weekly Summary  Rigs engaged in exploration and production in the U S  totaled 588 for the week ended Nov 18  2016  This was up by 20 from the previous week s rig count and resumes the trend of recent increases that has only been snapped thrice since June  Rig counts have generally been rising during the last six months since plunging to an all time low of 404 in May  with the addition of a flood of new units 
Despite the steady climb  the current nationwide rig count is considerably lower than the prior year level of 757  It rose to a 22 year high in 2008  peaking at 2 031 in the weeks ending Aug 29 and Sep 12 
For the week under review  units engaged in land operations   which rose by 17 to 563   were the primary reason for the gain in rig count  Meanwhile  inland waters activity was up by 1 to 2 rigs  while offshore drilling units increased by 2 to 23 
Oil Rig Count  The oil rig count   that bottomed at 316 in May 2016   improved further  by 19  to 471  In fact  the number of active domestic oil rigs have gone up in twenty two of the last 24 weeks  As a result of this sustained gain  the current tally is now the highest in 10 months  Nevertheless  they are well below the previous year s rig count of 564 and only about 35  of the peak of 1 609 in Oct 2014 
Natural Gas Rig Count  The natural gas rig count   which plunged to their lowest level on record in Aug   increased for the ninth time in 12 weeks to 116  a gain of 1 rig from the previous week   Still  as per the most recent report  the number of natural gas directed rigs are languishing 93  below the all time high of 1 606 reached in late summer 2008  In the year ago period  there were 193 active natural gas rigs 
Miscellaneous Rig Count  The miscellaneous rig count  primarily drilling for geothermal energy  at 1 remained unchanged from the previous week 
Rig Count by Type  The number of vertical drilling rigs increased by 7 to 66  while the horizontal directional rig count  encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations  also known as shale formations  was up by 13 to 522  In particular  horizontal rig units jumped by 13 from last week s level to 470   the highest since Jan 
Gulf of Mexico  GoM   The GoM rig count was up by 2 to 23   all searching for oil 
Conclusion  Now s the Time to Buy  The Baker Hughes data  issued since 1944 at the end of every week  acts as an important yardstick for energy service providers in gauging the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry 
This generates considerable excitement among energy investors and has long been deployed to help predict future oil and gas production  When number of rigs decline  fewer wells are drilled  This means less new oil and gas are discovered  and ultimately production slows down 
As a result  an increase or decrease in the Baker Hughes rotary rig count heavily weighs on the demand for energy services   drilling  completion  production  etc 
With the U S  rig count continuing its upward movement  it might be a good time to add a few energy related stocks to your portfolio

After falling over 4  yesterday  oil prices have jumped 5  higher this morning in advance of news from today s OPEC meeting in Vienna  as markets await the most recent iteration of whether production cuts will or won t actually occur  Russia is not a part of these talks  but there remains a shred of hope that OPEC members could at least find some common ground on who should cut and by how much  Iran and Iraq both   meaning Saudi Arabia  Kuwait  Qatar  and the United Arab Emirates would need to absorb most of the over one million bpd oil production cut needed to drive up prices 
Asian buyers aren t happy with OPEC s attempt to artificially diminish oil supplies and have threatened to purchase oil from outside OPEC  which would only exacerbate OPEC s problems  In a related development  Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau yesterday approved  projects  which would improve Canada s ability to deliver Alberta crude to the Pacific coast and from there to China  It s expected to increase delivery by an additional 1 1 million bp daily 
A press conference by the President and Secretary General of OPEC is tentatively scheduled for 10 AM ET 
Analysts at Barclays and Goldman Sachs said that a deal could  above  50  but that a  no deal  outcome would foster expectations of oil prices averaging  45 through the first half of 2017 

If Brent prices start to fall   44 could quickly be breached  followed by a move to  41  and then to  38 

Crude s decision points are more compact than Brent s but the demarcations are similar   43 to  41 to  39 in the event of a fall  up to  49 and possibly further in the event of a rise 
The stronger dollar continued to weigh on precious metals yesterday  Gold fell 0 78   silver dropped 1  and platinum was 0 5  lower  If markets see undue volatility today because of oil  however  there may be a rush to safe havens

99464,320979,BKR,U S Rigs Continue To Rise Post OPEC Deal  What To Expect ,opinion,"After the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries  or OPEC  agreed on production cut last Wednesday  oil prices have started improving again  Energy investors are undoubtedly pleased with the cartel s announcement as the commodity market is already flooded with plentiful supply of crude 
However  we note that U S energy players have increased oil rig counts last week  even after OPEC s decision  In fact  the rig count has been increasing for the last five weeks consecutively  It clearly indicates that shale players have started to gather to the oil patches when the major crude producers  including OPEC members and Russia  are expected to curtail their output  
OPEC to Cut Production
Interestingly  this is the first time since 2008 that OPEC has signed a deal to cut oil production  No doubt this is the most crucial move in the energy sector this year to restore crude prices  In fact  oil has started to recover with West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude currently trading above  50 per barrel mark 
Per the accord  OPEC will lower its production by 1 2 million barrels per day  MMB D  to 32 5 MMB D   effective Jan 1  2017   from 33 6 MMB D  Notably  the production cut   almost 1  of worldwide output   is much more than what was projected by most analysts  
Saudi Arabiahas shouldered most of the output cut  It will lower production by about 486 000 barrels per day  Iraq  on the other hand  agreed to cut output by 210 000 barrels per day  which marks the second highest reduction  Also  non OPEC players  such as Russia  have shown willingness to cut production by 600 000 barrels per day  Of the total amount  Russia   the major non OPEC oil producing player   alone will cut output by 300 000 barrels 
Why More Oil Rigs on OPEC s Decision 
The present state of affairs is being considered by many as an opportune moment for U S shale players to outpace OPEC in the race for production share  With the cartel s output sacrifice  the U S energy companies are expected to take advantage of higher oil prices in the coming days by producing more oil 
In fact  U S energy players added more rigs last week  after OPEC announced its decision to curb output  In its weekly release  Houston  TX based oilfield services company Baker Hughes Inc    NYSE BHI   reported higher U S  rig count  number of rigs searching for oil and gas in the country  than the previous week 
Rigs engaged in exploration and production in the U S  totaled 597 in the week ended Dec 2  2016  This was up by four from the week before  In details  the report shows that oil rigs in the U S increased by three  while the natural gas rig count rose by one 
Shale Players on the Rise
It is a well documented fact that the Permian Basin has witnessed higher rise in rigs over the last week than any other major basin  The other three basins that showed increased rig counts are Haynesville  Eagle Ford and Barnett  As expected  the companies involved in exploration operations in those oil patches showed stock price appreciation 
Concho Resources Inc    NYSE CXO   and Devon Energy Corp    NYSE DVN   having resources in the Permian Basin improved 6 3  and 16   respectively  over the last five days  On the other hand  Marathon Oil Corp    NYSE MRO   and Chesapeake Energy Corp    NYSE CHK   with acres in the Eagle Ford basin increased 20  and 19   respectively  during the same period  
Also  each of these Zacks Rank  3  Hold  companies outperformed the broader industry  year to date  You can see  
To be precise  Concho  Devon and Chesapeake gained 53   50  and 61  respectively  while the Zacks categorized Oil   Gas U S Exploration   Production industry increased 47   Moreover  Marathon Oil has showed an improvement of 45  compared with only 5  increment for the Oil   Gas U S Integrated industry 
Bottom Line
U S players are once again on track to ramp up production  This is not a good sign for the overall energy industry  Once energy firms in the U S  start returning to fields with huge production potential  oil will again hit bottoms

 By Ryan Vlastelica
 NEW YORK  July 13  Reuters    Wall Street stocks rebounded
from a three day selloff on Wednesday as comments from Federal
Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke raised hopes for further stimulus
of the U S  economy if needed 
 The Fed s previous stimulus effort  known as QE2  had
helped the stock market to advance with  600 billion in bond
purchases  which added liquidity to the economy and contributed
to low interest rates 
  The possibility remains that the recent economic weakness
may prove more persistent than expected and that deflationary
risks might reemerge  implying a need for additional policy
support   Bernanke told the House Financial Services Committee 
 For details  see  ID nN1E76C0KZ 
 The CBOE Volatility Index   Wall Street s fear gauge 
fell 7 6 percent to 18 37 after the comments  Over the past
three days  the VIX climbed almost 25 percent while S P 500
lost about 2 3 percent  pressured by weak earnings and concerns
over Europe s debt crisis 
  The last round of quantitative easing was absolutely
beneficial for stocks  and the gains today are on the prospects
for what is potentially further stimulus   said John Kosar 
director of research at Asbury Research in Chicago   However 
the fact that we re even discussing another round shows how the
economy is still struggling  
 His comments came as investors were divided over whether
the Fed would introduce another round of stimulus to boost the
economy  especially after June s dismal jobs report  The Fed s
 easy money  policies since 2008 have been fueling the stock
market s rally 
 The Dow Jones industrial average  was up 124 27
points  or 1 00 percent  at 12 571 15  The Standard   Poor s
500 Index  was up 13 55 points  or 1 03 percent  at
1 327 19  The Nasdaq Composite Index  was up 33 64
points  or 1 21 percent  at 2 815 55 
 Energy and material stocks were the top gainers  The S P
energy sector index  shot up 1 5 percent while August
crude futures gained 1 2 percent alongside a drop in the
dollar  The S P materials sector index  rose 1 6
percent  Baker Hughes Inc  was one of the top energy
sector gainers  rising 3 7 percent to  75 14 
 Wall Street got an early boost from overseas data that
showed China s economy grew faster than expected in the second
quarter   ID nL3E7ID0AS 
 But there was still caution over developments in Europe 
Moody s downgraded Ireland s debt to junk late on Tuesday and
said Ireland was likely to follow Greece in needing a second
bailout  Irish bond yields jumped to record highs 
 ID nLDE76C0EI 
  Bernanke is helping stocks today  but considering
everything else that s on the table  I imagine that in a short
period the market will return to focusing on issues like Europe
and the U S  budget deal soon   said Dan Ripp  president of
Bradley Woods   Co Ltd in New York

 NEW YORK  July 13  Reuters    U S  stocks stopped a
three day slide  but ended well off the highs on Wednesday as
investors took the suggestion of further Federal Reserve
stimulus as a mixed blessing 
 Stock index futures dropped after Moody s Investors
Service said it may cut the United States  triple A rating due
to the rising chance its debt ceiling may not be raised by the
Aug  2nd deadline  For details  see  ID nWNA3574  and
 ID nN1376C1XJ 
 Concerns about the debt ceiling have been a headwind for
equities as no budget deal has been brokered  Futures
initially slumped on the news  though they later recovered
some of their losses  S P futures  fell 0 4 percent 
  The rating agencies were so slow to respond to anything
in 2007 and 2008 that now they re overly quick to respond  
said Paul Schatz  president and chief investment officer of
Heritage Capital in Woodbridge  Connecticut  who added that he
felt there was  no chance  of a default 
  I don t think this is a big deal and I don t think it
will move the needle for long  This will be a short term
issue  no more than half a day  
 In Wednesday s session  the three major U S  stock indexes
rose more than 1 percent at their peaks after Fed Chairman Ben
Bernanke suggested the Fed would consider additional measures
to support the economy if the outlook gets worse  Energy and
materials stocks led gains  but the rally fizzled in afternoon
trading 
  Bernanke s comments were a positive this morning  but we
had a little too much happiness early on   said Richard
Sichel  chief investment officer of Philadelphia Trust Co 
 The comments were not upbeat by any means  and obviously  no
one wants the economy to get to the point where more stimulus
is needed  
 The Fed s  600 billion bond buying effort  known as QE2 
has contributed to huge equity gains since September 
 In testimony to the House Financial Services Committee 
Bernanke said  the recent economic weakness may prove more
persistent than expected     implying a need for additional
policy support   For details  see  ID nN1E76C0KZ

stimulus from the Fed  but June s dismal jobs report altered

99539,321054,BKR,Oil Stocks Q3 Earnings Slated On Oct 28  XOM  CVX  PSX  IMO,opinion,The Q3 earnings season is in full swing with 198 S P 500 members already having reported their quarterly results Picture So FarThe 198 S P 500 Index members that have revealed their Q3 financial performance so far account for 40  of the index s total market capitalization  Total earnings for these companies have grown 3 2  from the year ago period on 1 9  higher revenues  While 73 7  of the companies beat earnings estimates  61 1  outperformed on the top line front  data from the report dated Oct 26  2016  Will the Energy Sector Continue to Suffer The energy sector has been a drag on the overall market over the past few quarters and the situation is unlikely to change even in this earnings cycle  Per the latest Earnings Trends report  the general outlook remains bearish as the sector is expected to register a massive 71  year over year decrease in earnings due to a 12 2  decline in revenues  Excluding the impact of the energy sector  the S P 500 Index would witness earnings growth of 5  on the back of 2 8  increase in revenues Crude Performance in Q3Given that oil determines the fate of energy companies  it is of utmost importance to note the pricing movement of the commodity during Q3  Overall  oil prices recovered significantly from the mid February lows  This is undoubtedly favorable for upstream energy firms as commodity price improvement should translate into more exploration and production activities  This is evidenced by the substantial increase in the U S  rig count in recent times In fact  Baker Hughes Inc    NYSE BHI     the company s data issued since 1944 is as an important yardstick for energy service providers in gauging the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry   recently declared the rig count for Sep 2016  In the U S   the total number of rigs increased from the Aug 2016 count owing to a rise in the number of land rigs  This represents the fourth consecutive increase in the U S  monthly rig count The developments are definitely favorable for the upstream business of integrated energy players as these companies are able to sell the commodity at higher prices  However  the crude pricing scenario is weaker than the prior year quarter  Furthermore  the downstream business of these integrated players might be affected by the year over year decline retail gasoline prices  Although the refining businesses were able to buy crude at comparatively lower prices than the prior year  these could not make substantial profits as the selling price of the end products like gasoline was low However  the overall earnings picture will become clearer as we move further ahead  With more companies set to release their financial numbers  we expect a better insight into the performance of the sector  Meanwhile  let s take a look at how these four oil stocks might fare in Q3 when these report their quarterly numbers on Oct 28

last one month period and was the biggest loser among the S P 500 sectors  Additionally  mutual funds related to this sector registered weak returns  According to Morningstar  the equity energy mutual fund posted a one month negative return of 2 9  Against this backdrop  we have selected four energy mutual funds that have a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank  4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell   They have minimum initial investment within  5000 and high expense ratios  Also  these funds have poor three year annualized returns  so dropping these funds from portfolio might be appropriate We expect these funds to underperform their peers in the future  Remember  the goal of the Zacks Mutual Fund Rank is to guide investors to identify potential winners and losers  Unlike most of the fund rating systems  the Zacks Mutual Fund Rank is not just focused on past performance  but also on the likely future success of the fund ICON Energy S  generally invests a bulk portion of its assets in securities of companies from the energy sector  ICENX is non diversifiable in nature  The fund seeks growth of capital for the long run  The fund has 3 year negative return of 11 8   and an expense ratio of 1 42   higher than the category average of 1 40   ICENX sports a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank  4 Ivy Energy A  seeks appreciation of capital  The fund invests a lion s share of its assets in securities of companies from the energy sector  It may also invest in companies  which are engaged in developing products and services to improve energy effectiveness  The fund has 3 year negative return of 7 2   and an expense ratio of 1 49   higher than the category average of 1 40   IEYAX sports a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank  5 Oppenheimer SteelPath MLP Alpha Y  primarily invests a major portion of its assets in

99598,321113,BKR,Crude Output Control Speculation Resurfaces  4 ETFs To Watch,opinion,"After a failed initiative in April  major oil producers are speculated to take another shot at controlling crude production in late September  This led crude prices to register healthy gains on Monday  Moreover  a bright outlook on oil demand in the second half of this year had a positive impact on oil prices 
Rising Output Control Possibilities 
According to a report published in The Wall Street Journal  major producers may consider cutting output to tackle weak global demand and low oil prices  Separately  the president of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries  OPEC   Dr  Mohammed bin Saleh Al Sada  who is also the Minister of Energy and Industry of Qatar  indicated that OPEC members and non OPEC major oil producers including Russia may informally meet at the International Energy Forum in Algeria in late September to work out crude production control  read    
Dr  Al Sada said   OPEC continues to monitor developments closely  and is in constant deliberations with all member states on ways and means to help restore stability and order to the oil market   Russia declined the possibility but hinted at participating in the discussion if prices decline  Russia s Energy Minister Alexander Novak said   A basis for this has yet to develop  considering prices are still at more or less normal levels  If prices will fall then that necessity will most likely arise  
Bright Outlook for Second Half
Dr  Al Sada indicated that the oil market will witness a favorable demand supply condition in the second half of this year on the back of a rebound in global oil demand and controlled output  Moreover  he said that the recent decline in oil prices is short lived and that a steady increase is likely in the second half 
Dr  Al Sada added   Expectation of higher crude oil demand in third and fourth quarters of 2016  coupled with decrease in availability  is leading the analysts to conclude that the current bear market is only temporary and oil price would increase during later part of 2016  
Separately  the recently released U S  Energy Information Administration  EIA  report showed that crude output in the U S  dropped for the first time in four weeks by 55 000 barrels per day  bpd  to 8 460 000 bpd for the week ending Jul 29  The output also plunged around 10 6  from the year ago level  read    
Headwinds Remain
While investors are already concerned about crude oversupply  record oil export from China added to the worries  Data released by China s General Administration of Customs showed that oil export jumped 52 3  year over year in July to a record level of 4 57 million tons  On the other hand  weak demand led China s imports to slump 13  from the year ago level to 2 08 million tons 
Also  Baker Hughes   NYSE BHI   reported that the oil rig count in the U S  rose for the sixth straight week in the week ending Aug 5  The rig count increased by seven units to 381 for the week  Moreover  EIA reported last week that crude inventories increased to 1 4 million barrels for the week ending Aug 3  preceded by an increase of 1 7 million barrels in the week before  read    
ETFs in Focus
Renewed possibilities of crude production control boosted prices of WTI and Brent crude oil  While WTI crude increased 2 8  to  43 02 per barrel on Monday  Brent crude rose 2 5  to and  45 39 a barrel  If Dr  Al Sada s anticipation on the oil market for the second half of this year proves right  then the energy sector should see gains in the coming days  We have highlighted four energy ETFs that may benefit from this encouraging backdrop

99599,321114,BKR,5 Stocks To Watch This Week  ADSK  AMGN  ANTM  BHI  GS,opinion,"Here are the Rest of the Top 10 
Autodesk  NASDAQ ADSK 

Autodesk  dropped hard to start the year and recovered almost as fast with the familiar  V  bottom  The recovery morphed into a consolidation in March it and it moved basically sideways until the Brexit vote in June  Another quick drop and recovery has it back in consolidation  Since the start or August it has been moving higher  and went through the resistance to end the week  The RSI is rising and bullish and the MACD moving higher  Look for continuation to participate to the upside   
Amgen  NASDAQ AMGN 
Amgen  started higher in June and ran up to a top at the start of August  The pullback in a bull flag from there found a bottom and broke to the upside Friday  The RSI is in the bullish zone and rising while the MACD is pulling back  Look for continuation to the upside to participate   
Anthem Inc  NYSE ANTM 

Anthem  rose from a bottom in February to a peak in April  From there it fell to a low in June and then bounced  That was short lived as it fell back again  Since the start of August it has risen against trend support  The RSI is rising back toward the mid line and the MACD is about to cross up  Friday saw a strong move higher  Look for continuation of that to participate to the upside   
Baker Hughes Incorporated  NYSE BHI 

Baker Hughes  finally started higher in April  rising to a peak in the beginning of May  A pullback to the 50 day SA and bounce led it back to resistance in June  Then another pullback bounced to the current level  moving through resistance  The RSI is rising and the MACD is moving higher  Look for continuation to participate to the upside   
Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS 

Goldman Sachs  ran higher off of a bottom in June  it stalled at 164 and pulled back before another leg higher to 164 and now consolidation  It has a RSI that is in the bullish zone and the MACD is crossing up  Look for a push over 164 to participate to the upside   
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad Market Macro picture reviewed Friday which heading into August options expiration sees the Equity markets continuing to look strong but maybe in need of a short term pause 
Elsewhere look for Gold to consolidate in its uptrend while Crude Oil rises  The US Dollar Index seems content to move sideways in broad consolidation while US Treasuries consolidate near their high  The Shanghai Composite and Emerging Markets are both biased to the upside next week 
Volatility looks to remain at abnormally low levels keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETF s SPY  NYSE SPY   iShares Russell 2000  NYSE IWM  and PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1  NASDAQ QQQ   Their charts show that the SPY and IWM may need a pause or retrenchment in the short term  while the QQQ continues to lead  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

99612,321127,BKR,Oil Falls For Fifth Straight Session ,opinion,"Oil futures fell even lower Wednesday following concerns about global economic conditions  the state of the U S  economy  and increased domestic drilling activity   
July WTI Crude fell 96 cents  or about 2   to  47 53  while August Brent Crude dropped  1 20  or 2 4   to  48 63  Wednesday s action marked the fifth straight day of decline for oil futures  negating much of the momentum that had built up over the last month or so 
The oil market has been heading downward since Friday when Baker Hughes   NYSE BHI   announced that the number of rigs drilling in the United States was up for the second straight week  While overall shale production is still expected to decline in July  more rigs in operation is not what an already flooded oil market needs 
Moreover  investors around the world are bracing for the United Kingdom s referendum next week  which will see the country vote on whether or not to stay in the European Union  Until that issue settles itself  concerns about the global economic environment will remain high 
Also contributing to today s commodities action was the Federal Reserve s decision not to increase its interest rate today  The Fed also announced that six members now only expect one rate hike this year  up from one member in the last meeting 
This sent the dollar a bit lower  and although a weak dollar typically boosts oil prices  the fact that it is coming from increased uncertainty surrounding the U S  economy is certainly not good news for oil 
Although today s prices are a long way from the sub  30 barrels we were seeing just a few months ago  the oil market remains extremely volatile ",2016-06-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/oil-falls-for-fifth-straight-session-200136216,200136216

99627,321142,BKR,Baker Hughes  Growth Prospects Bright Despite Macro Risks,opinion,On May 18  2016  we issued an updated research report on one of the major oilfield service companies in the world  Baker Hughes Inc    NYSE BHI   Baker Hughes  strong portfolio of products and services should help it post better than average results over the long term in North America as well as enable it to further expand in the international markets  As the world s third largest oilfield services provider  the company also has a competitive set of technologies  which allow it to increase its activity in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico  GoM  With the termination of the impending merger of Baker Hughes and Halliburton  NYSE HAL   the former has received a sum of  3 5 billion as break up fee  This will strengthen its balance sheet and liquidity as well enable it to pursue a number of value creating options The company is simplifying its organizational structure and operational footprint to generate annual savings of  500 million by the end of 2016  The company also seeks additional opportunities for more extensive structural changes to initiate longer term efficiency improvements However  management is apprehensive about the unfavorable trend among the oilfield service providers of a growing inventory of wells drilled but not completed owing to delay in completions and production deferral  The Canadian market is also expected to remain relatively flat until spring  As a result of the reduction in overall activity in North America  the company projects decreased demand for its well construction product lines  On the international front  profound weakness is expected in some pockets such as Continental Europe  Mexico  Australia  Iraq and the North Sea In light of the termination of the impending merger of Baker Hughes with Halliburton  the former is apparently unorganized and disengaged  Baker Hughes intends to shift away from capital intensive U S  and field level international services  which means that the company s legacy NAM pressure pumping line is unlikely to return to its prior levels  This reduces much of Baker Hughes  control over the U S  onshore recovery and lowers its immediate growth prospects Moreover  crude price has tumbled drastically since Jun 2014 owing to an abundant supply of the commodity in the face of lackluster global demand  On top of that  oil price is expected to remain low in 2016  Owing to weak commodity pricing  most of the drillers have decided to reduce their capital spending in 2016 to nearly half of that in 2015  Hence  Baker Hughes  which supports drilling players in setting up oil wells  is also expected to earn less in 2016 Stocks to ConsiderCurrently  Baker Hughes carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Some better ranked stocks in the oil and gas sector include CVR Refining  LP   NYSE CVRR    Murphy USA Inc    NYSE MUSA   and Braskem S A    NYSE BAK    All these stocks sport a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  ,2016-05-18,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/baker-hughes'-growth-prospects-bright-despite-macro-risks-200130959,200130959
99636,321151,BKR,Oil At 2016 Highs  5 Energy Stocks Making Most Of The Trend,opinion,Oil prices are hovering close to the psychological  50 per barrel mark and we feel the time has come for the long beleaguered sector to come back to life  Since mid 2014  the commodity s price has been plunging primarily due to excess supply of crude in the global market  However  the wheel of fortune is slowly turning for the space which witnessed the 12 year low mark of  26 05 per barrel for West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude in mid February this year  This is remarkable considering the fact that the overall market sentiment usually veers toward profit booking prior to the Memorial Day weekend Rebound in the Cards The upside in this space is mainly driven by lower production from the non OPEC space  The International Energy Agency  IEA   the OECD energy watchdog  is also bullish on the demand growth prospects of the trio   India  China and Russia  Per the agency  the triad consumed about 1 million barrels per day more year over year in the first quarter of 2016 Our bullishness is further compounded by the latest weekly data from the Energy Information Administration  EIA  that revealed a fall in U S  crude stocks as imports dropped and refineries cut output  The optimism was also echoed by the American Petroleum Institute  API    the largest oil industry association in the U S As a result  investors  hopes were rekindled on oil and the commodity  which is showing overall improvement after touching the lowest point in mid February  Also  the domestic oil count stopped the southward march last week when it stopped a steady eight week fall  as revealed by Baker Hughes Inc    NYSE BHI   We feel the correction in rig count is a blessing in disguise for the beleaguered energy space  This is due to the simple fact that over the past decade  the space has seen a mammoth rise in drilling and production related capacities  This resulted in an invariable rise in production levels  However  the correction in rig count clears the path for stability in the space Recovery at the Right TimeThe current change in demand supply dynamics put energy players on radar of investors long awaiting a lift in the fortunes of the space  So long  the sector was ravaged by falling realizations from upstream operations which dragged down the overall picture  The downfall continues to affect the performance of even the largest players in the space like Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa  plc  which recently announced the axing of another 2 200 jobs globally in 2016 Now What Now  investors can only hope that the decline in the production level does not end up being a mirage  After all  the entire diminishing inventory overhang has been a key part of our favorable view of the oil space this year We however did not foresee the unplanned supply disruption out of Nigeria and Canada  but those are temporary in any case and will eventually be back online  But it s reduced volumes from the U S  shale basins purely on economic ground that are likely to be the more enduring cure for the oil market s supply problems  Production declines from the shale basins have proved to be a lot slower than many of us had envisioned  but it s happening nevertheless and the trend is expected to only accelerate in the coming days despite the commodity s recent favorable momentum On a final note Wall Street giant Citigroup Inc    NYSE C   upped the ante by pushing WTI to  61 per barrel by year end 2017 Top Stocks Rallying with CrudeA number of energy stocks saw their prices head north along with an uptrend in the prices of commodities they deal with  Below we highlight five such energy stocks that are gaining  Each of these stocks carries either a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy

   P G falls after disappointing outlook
   June factory orders record unexpected rise
   Dow off 0 7 pct  S P off 0 6 pct  Nasdaq off 1 3 pct
 Updates to early afternoon  changes byline 
 By Ryan Vlastelica
 NEW YORK  Aug 5  Reuters    U S  stocks fell on Wednesday
as weak data and some disappointing outlooks prompted
investors to take profits after a four day rally that pushed
the market to nine month highs 
 Investors paused to assess the sustainability of a rally
that has driven the S P 500 up nearly 48 percent since hitting
a 12 year closing low in early March 
 Earlier on Wednesday  the Institute for Supply
Management s service index fell more than expected in July 
dropping to 46 4  Any reading below 50 indicates contraction
in the service sector  which accounts for about 80 percent of
economic activity in the United States 
 Investors  sentiment also soured after ADP data showed
that private employers cut 371 000 jobs in July  more than
expected  suggesting the labor market remained weak 
  When you get negative data  that s going to cause some
profit taking   said Frank Lesh  a futures analyst at
FuturePath Trading LLC in Chicago   Lately data has been
better than expected and we want to see continued improvement 
but when you see a pause in the improvement  it gives you
anxiety about how strong the recovery could be  
 Despite that  Lesh said that if Friday s July non farm
payroll report comes in better than expected  the markets
 will be right back up again  
 The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 62 80 points  or
0 67 percent  to 9 257 39  The Standard   Poor s 500 Index
fell 6 22 points  or 0 62 percent  to 999 43  The Nasdaq
Composite Index shed 25 34 points  or 1 26 percent  to
1 985 97 
 The top drag on the blue chip Dow average was consumer
products giant Procter   Gamble  which earlier Wednesday said
its first quarter profit may not meet Wall Street s
expectations  P G s stock dove 2 9 percent to  53 84 
 In other earnings news  Dean Foods sank 8 percent to
 19 64 after it also gave a disappointing outlook 
  I think investors are a little rattled about some of the
outlooks that came out this morning  That could be causing
some of the profit taking   said John O Brien  senior vice
president at MKM Partners LLC in Chicago 
 Elsewhere  both Baker Hughes and Transocean fell after
they reported quarterly results that missed expectations 
Baker Hughes  stock lost 7 percent to  39 04  while
Transocean s shares slid 4 1 percent to  77 06 
 Meat supplier Tyson Foods Inc sank 4 2 percent to  10 85
after KeyBanc downgraded the stock to  hold  from  buy  
citing a lack of near term catalysts for the stock  as well as
concerns about the company s chicken division 
 Among Nasdaq stocks  R R  Donnelley   Sons was down 4
percent at  13 88 after the printing services company reported
a sharp drop in second quarter earnings  Shares of network
equipment maker Cisco Systems dropped 1 3 percent to  22 14
ahead of the release of its quarterly results  Cisco s
earnings are expected after the bell 
 In a splash of positive data after the regular trading
session began  the Commerce Department said new orders
received by U S  factories unexpectedly rose in June 
advancing for a third straight month

whose market capitalization has witnessed a sheer drop  exploration and production  E P  companies are the most striking  While these upstream firms are more sensitive to price changes in oil and gas  they also stand to profit greatly from a price increase in the commodities  When investing in such stocks  you ll want to choose companies that are not financially distressed  This is because there is no certainty as to when the energy rally will start  or if the current prices are even sustainable Investors are perturbed owing to the fact that for almost throughout first quarter 2016 crude prices traded significantly below the  40 per barrel level  Most importantly  WTI crude fell to the 12 year low mark of below  27 per barrel in mid February  The low levels were owing to plentiful supplies and lackluster demand  This was aptly echoed by the weekly release of Houston based oilfield services company Baker Hughes Inc    NYSE BHI   that reported the sixth consecutive record fall in U S  rig count What s more  given the absence of major production cuts from OPEC  the effect of booming shale supplies in North America and a stagnant European economy  we do not expect much upside in the commodity s prices in the near term The prevailing trend in the oil and energy sector is well outlined in the Zacks  report  As of Friday  Apr 29  44 7  of the oil and energy companies had reported Q1 earnings  These stocks account for 71 8  of the total market capitalization  Total earnings for these index members plunged 96 8  from the year ago period on a 29 4  decline in revenues Definitely the scenario was unfavorable for the upstream energy players that include oil and gas exploration and production companies  and drilling and oilfield services players  This is because oil price has a positive correlation with the operations of these companies Given the persistent weakness in commodity prices  investors are eager to find out how oil and natural gas stocks will fare this earnings season  Let s take a look at the expected earnings performance of four upstream companies that are scheduled to post Q1 tomorrow  May 4 Cimarex Energy Co    NYSE XEC   has an Earnings ESP of  2 56

company s profit margins under pressure Last quarter  the company delivered a negative surprise of 8 70  owing to the challenges from a steep drop in oil price  Also  the company failed to meet the

Concho Resources  Inc    NYSE CXO   has an Earnings ESP of 0 00  and Zacks Rank  3  Though a favorable Zacks Rank increases the predictive power of ESP  the company s ESP of 0 00  makes surprise prediction difficult  Like any other energy player   primarily involved in exploration  development and production of crude oil   the fate of Concho Resources  business is directly correlated with crude prices  Continued weakness in commodity prices has significantly affected the company s revenues  earnings and cash flows In the preceding three month period  the Midland  TX based upstream player delivered a negative earnings surprise of 275 00  on oil s protracted decline  As far as the earnings surprise history is concerned  the company has a good record  it beat estimates in three of

delivered a positive earnings surprise of 33 91   Moreover  Murphy Oil has undertaken cost saving initiatives which should continue to benefit it in 2016  The company also aims to reduce its total

Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations   

Here are highlights from Tuesday s Analyst Blog  

Oil   Gas Stock Roundup

It was a week where oil futures reached their highest in nearly 6 months and natural gas settled at their best level since Jan 

Though earnings remained front and center  the major headline came from the collapse of the planned tie up between oilfield services behemothsHalliburton Co     NYSE HAL    and Baker Hughes Inc      NYSE BHI    

Overall  it was a good week for the sector  West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude futures rallied 5  to close at  45 92 per barrel  while natural gas prices inched up 2  to  2 178 per million Btu  MMBtu    See the last  Oil   Gas Stock Roundup  here     

Oil prices moved north for a fourth straight week on a continued decline in U S  crude production  Things were further helped by the Baker Hughes report that showed another drop in oil directed rigs   indicating a break in shale drilling activities   to the lowest level since November 2009  A weak U S  dollar also propped up the commodity 

Natural gas also fared well after warmer weather lifted prospects of the commodity s requirement for power burn 

Recap of the Week s Most Important Stories

1  Amid stiff resistance from both U S  and European antitrust agencies  oilfield services providers Halliburton Co  and Baker Hughes Inc  called off their planned merger 

The regulators were of the opinion that if Halliburton merges with Baker Hughes then the oilfield service industry will be dominated by the combined company and Schlumberger Ltd   the largest player  The primary threats to the market include elimination of competition and increasing prices  The proposed  28 billion deal might also impede the innovations in the industry 

Per the terms of the transaction  Halliburton will pay Baker Hughes an agreed upon breakup fee of  3 5 billion 

2  The world s largest publicly traded oil company Exxon Mobil Corp      NYSE XOM    posted first quarter earnings of 43 cents per share that beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 31 cents  A resilient integrated business model enabled the energy behemoth to beat estimates despite the current environment of relentlessly falling commodity prices 

The bottom line  however  deteriorated from  1 17 in the year ago quarter  The impact of sharply lower commodity prices and weaker refining margins were partly offset by strong Chemical results 

Production averaged 4 325 million barrels of oil equivalent per day  MMBOE d   up 1 8  year over year  Liquid production increased 11 5  year over year to 2 538 million barrels per day  Natural gas production was 10 724 MCF d  millions of cubic feet per day   down 1 104 MCF d from the year ago period   See More     

3  U S  energy giant Chevron Corp     NYSE CVX    reported dismal first quarter results as the oil market slump continues to deepen and refining margins weakened  The company reported loss per share of 39 cents  wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate for a loss of 18 cents  Last year  Chevron earned  1 37 per share during the period  Quarterly revenue fell 32  year over year to  23 553 million but was able to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  23 547 million on stable production 

Despite continued pricing pressure  Chevron s production outlook remains one of the most robust in its peer group  with a number of major initiatives scheduled to come online during the next few years  Major start ups during the year include the Chuandongbei Project in China and the Gorgon natural gas project in Australia   See More     

4  Houston based energy major ConocoPhillips    NYSE COP    reported narrower than expected first quarter loss as robust volumes were partially offset by struggling crude prices  Daily production from continuing operations averaged 1 578 million barrels of oil equivalent  MMBOE  in the quarter  up from 1 54 MMBOE in the year ago quarter  after adjusting for dispositions   However  average realized price for oil was  31 47 per barrel  compared with  48 05 in the year earlier quarter 

For 2016  ConocoPhillips has reduced its capital expenditure guidance to  5 7 billion from  6 4 billion  The decrease is mainly attributable to reduced deepwater exploration activity  deferrals and lower costs across the portfolio  The company expects to meet its full year production guidance of about 1 525 MMBOE  For the second quarter  production from continuing operations is expected at 1 500 1 540 MMBOE   See More

 between the U S  and Europe face a serious impasse with  irreconcilable  differences  according to leaked negotiating texts discussing the Transatlantic Free Trade Agreement  The leaked documents  coming from the Dutch chapter of Greenpeace  show that American trade negotiators had pressed their European counterparts to loosen important environmental  consumer protection and other provisions 
The deal  known as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  or TTIP  would cover a huge range of goods and services between the world s largest national economy and the world s largest single market  spanning telecommunications  agricultural products  textiles  intellectual property  financial services and regulatory compatibility  The documents were shared in advance with several European publications  When you consider this latest document leak along with the recent Panama Papers  one thing is starting to stand out  Secrecy doesn t exist in the digital age 
Sports Authority has decided to sell its remaining assets  Rather than attempt to re organize under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection  Sports Authority will hold an auction May 16  If a buyer emerges  some locations could be saved  There are 463 Sports Authority stores in 41 states employing more than 14 500  Sports Authority is  1 1 billion in debt and lost  256 million before taxes in fiscal year 2015  In January  Sports Authority failed to make a  20 million debt payment

Last week I promised more on the old idea of Sell in May and go away  Stock market returns are far worse from May through the end of October  than they are during the rest of the year  So as May starts  history suggests that  based on market performance as a whole  you might be smart to sell your shares now  and not bother with markets again until November  Over the past 15 years  stock markets have performed far better between November of one year and April of the next  than between May and October 
MSCI Asia ex Japan Index  Singapore s STI  the Hang Seng  Malaysia s KLCI  the Shanghai Composite and the S P 500  as well as the MSCI World  all perform significantly better from November 1 to April 30  than from May 1 to October 31 
For example  the MSCI Asia ex Japan posted a negative return of 1 7 percent  on average  during the May November period in 2001 2015  and a 9 0 percent return from November through April  Since 2001  on average the STI has fallen 1 9 percent from May through October  and appreciated by 6 7 percent during the period from November to April 
The biggest difference in performance for the two periods was for the Shanghai Composite  where shares fell by 6 3 percent on average from May through the end of October  but rose by 10 4 percent during the other period 
The S P 500 has a negative 1 4  from May through October and a positive return of 5 1  for November to May  for a difference of 6 5   Over the past 50 years  the average gain for the Dow was less than 1  from May to October  In contrast  the average gain was more than 7  from November to April 
So  the idea was that you sold Friday  and now you can go on vacation until November 1st  Is it really that simple  Well  yes  Since 1950  there have only been 9 years when the DJIA Best Six Months failed to deliver market gains  And if you want to get a bit more specific  there is an extra entry exit strategy  Sy Harding made some minor adjustments to the six month cycle and added MACD as a timing mechanism  MACD stands for moving average convergence divergence  
First  start the bullish cycle on October 16th  which is two weeks earlier  Starting the cycle  a little earlier makes sense because there have been several October bottoms in the S P 500  Second  start the bearish cycle on April 20th  Third  add MACD to time signals near these cycle dates  October 16th and April 20th  
So  you would look for a bullish MACD any time after October 16 for your buy signal  or you would look for a bearish MACD any time after April 20 for your sell signal  The S P 500 crossed its signal line last week on the 26th  As always  momentum indicators and seasonality always take a back seat to price action  The Sell in May idea is playing probabilities  not a guarantee  The other nice thing is that you can take a summer vacation and you don t have to worry about the markets ",2016-05-04,Marvin Clark,https://www.investing.com/analysis/puerto-rico-screwed-200127769,200127769

 and central bank governors from the world s leading economies have gathered in Shanghai to discuss a response to the global economic landscape  Among the many issues facing them is the plunge in commodity prices  market volatility  exchange rates and the slowdown of China s economy  G20 participants will try to agree on a coordinated stimulus program that could stop a global slowdown from turning into something worse 
But meetings of the world s 20 leading economies have a long history of disappointing and analysts see little reason why this one should end differently  German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble was quick to pour some cold water on hopes for extra stimulus saying that the global economy needs reform  not stimulus 
 are not doing enough to stimulate flagging economies  while negative rates may well do more harm than good because potential depositors might prefer stuffing the money under the mattress rather than paying to park it at a bank  But don t assume that will stop central banks trying to stimulate demand and raise inflation  The most likely option  Helicopter money  But what form will that take 
The most likely option is probably a direct monetization of government debt  The state could create infrastructure bonds to finance public works programs and those could be bought directly by its central bank and then cancelled  Instead of adding to the national debt  the bonds would simply be written off

The value of inventories increased  The largest contributors to the upward revision to inventory investment were retail trade and mining  utilities and construction  Investments in new housing jumped  Exports fell  Consumers and businesses both cut back on spending toward the end of the year  and that is not a good sign for an increase in growth

99687,321202,BKR,Did Oil Prices Just Find a Bottom ,opinion,"I want to point out that the digital banking system has made a huge impact on the UAE s economy  I just read an article in the  newspaper  reporting that electronic payments have boosted the UAE s GDP by  3 7 billion in five years  This increase is indicative of a trend of rising card usage across many countries  as you can see in the chart below 
In the same edition of the newspaper  I was interested to read that for the third year in a row  Singapore has been listed as the most expensive city in the world  followed by Zurich and Hong Kong 

According to the article   Falling commodity prices have created deflationary pressures in some countries  but in others  currency weakness caused by these falls has led to spiraling inflation   Light at the End of the Tunnel  The IEA Calls a Bottom in Oil Prices

Despite its relatively small size in population and land mass  the UAE is the world s sixth largest oil producer  following the U S   Saudi Arabia  Russia  China and Canada  Among Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries  OPEC  members  it s the second largest  after Saudi Arabia 
These rankings might very well rise in the coming years  however  as the Middle Eastern country plans to expand production between 30 and 40 percent by 2020  even as Brent crude prices have struggled to crack  40 per barrel 
But on a global scale  oil production is finally dropping and that s constructive for prices  In a report released on Friday  the  writes that  prices might have bottomed out   citing a February decline in both OPEC and non OPEC output and hopes of U S  dollar weakness 
Although I m cautious  the current recovery is in line with oil s seasonality trends for the five  and 15 year periods  which show that prices have risen between March and the beginning of the busy summer travel season 
The PHLX Oil Service Sector Index has gained 4 4 percent since the beginning of the year  while prices have rallied above their 50 day moving average  touching three month highs  As the IEA points out  this rally is being spurred by optimism that OPEC and Russia can agree on a production freeze not a cut  as some people think  A meeting date has yet to be decided upon  however  presumably because Iran announced it will not agree to an output freeze until it reaches its pre sanction market share 
Like Iran  Saudi Arabia has resisted capping production  To plug up the deficit  it s reportedly seeking up to  8 billion from international banks  the first time it has done so in more than a decade  The kingdom is also considering issuing foreign bonds and listing a part of its state oil company  Saudi Arabian Oil  or Aramco 
With WTI up 25 percent in 2016 and 3 percent in March  investor sentiment has improved since October  when it crossed into  panic  territory for the first time since 2011 

U S  Companies Looking for  50 Per Barrel To remain profitable  most U S  producers need oil prices to be above  50 per barrel a level we haven t seen in eight months  In such an environment  U S  oil companies are finally beginning to make meaningful production cuts  with the IEA expecting producers to remove more than half a million barrels per day from the market this year  In December  the monthly year over year change in production turned negative for the first time since September 2011 
The number of North American rigs in operation fell below 400 for the first time since December 2009  according to Baker Hughes  helping to support prices 
Until now  per well productivity has been slow to budge  Years of  100 per barrel oil incentivized companies to develop new ways to extract crude  including fracking  and these technological advancements have greatly increased efficiency  Today  not only can a new well be drilled in record time  it can also  what it could have only five years ago 
What Oil Companies Can Learn from Airlines Highly leveraged companies across the globe have had little choice but to trim their workforces  curb expenditures and let go of undeveloped projects  According to consulting firm AlixPartners  overall capital spending fell 20 percent in 2015  with a further decline of at least 30 percent expected this year 
These adjustments  the most severe since the oil rout in the 1980s  have saved or raised global exploration and production  E P  companies  130 billion  says Deloitte Consulting  But this won t be enough for many companies  Nearly a third of all pure play E P companies worldwide are at high risk of bankruptcy this year 
That s not necessarily a bad thing  A little over a decade ago  the airline industry also found itself in extreme duress  A large percentage of carriers landed in bankruptcy court  and a wave of consolidation swept through the industry  Today  airlines are positing record quarterly profits 
In the past year  we ve already seen some huge mergers and acquisitions in the oil industry think Dutch Royal Shell  LON RDSa  and BP  LON BP   as well as the proposed Halliburton  NYSE HAL  and Baker Hughes Incorporated  NYSE BHI  deal  It s likely we ll see many more in the coming months  In the meantime  short of geopolitical turmoil  a coordinated production cap agreement among OPEC and non OPEC countries might be the only option to firm up prices

99717,321232,BKR,Brent Lowest Since 2004,opinion,"The Pain is Spain will not let Brent crude prices gain  Brent crude prices hit the lowest level since 2004 as uncertainty over Spain s election is raising further concerns about European and global demand  Oil prices continue to fall as rig counts rise and demand expectations fall 
The big drop in Brent crude as concerns about Spain s disputed election could lead to larger economic problems for the Euro Zone  Spain s election is creating uncertainty  Uncertain if Mariano Rajoy will be in power once the socialists will or will not form a coalition  Will the country be ruled by a left wing coalition led by the Spanish Socialist Workers  Party  PSOE   or will there be another election in May  The uncertainty is raising fears that this could be a drag on the Eurpean economy just the way Greece was last summer 
On top of that warm weather that is killing demand in the Northern Hemisphere and is making it hard for oil to find a reason to rally  The U S  oil rig count jumped for the first time in five weeks  by 17 this week to 541  according to driller Baker Hughes  N BHI  raising concerns that the U S  glut may grow larger 
Yet despite the bearish news  the Wall Street Journal reports   money managers grew more bullish on Nymex crude in the week ended Dec  15  just released CFTC data show  Hedge funds  pension funds and others added 56 bets on rising prices and cut 15 224 bets on falling prices  Their net long position gained 19  to 95 754  the largest in three weeks  Prices fell 0 4  in the reporting week on continued fears about the global glut of crude oil  Yet if there is a turn bullish by the funds  it might mean that we could see this market turning the corner 
The good news is that gas prices fell below  2 00 a gallon just before Christmas  Ho Ho Ho  Santa may want to drive this year 
Rig counts for natural gas fell by 17 rigs to 168  This comes as it is possible that we see some temperatures perhaps fall by a little  Perhaps natural gas can recover as the market may start to take cover as it seems that our production is falling and we might see some winter weather after all

99718,321233,BKR,Weather Forecasts Push Gas Prices Up,opinion,"Weather forecasts pushed gas prices up
On Monday  natural gas prices edged up by almost 10  in the US on the weather forecasts that the first week of 2016 may be colder than usually  Last week  gas prices hit the low since March 1999  Will the uptrend correction of natural gas continue 
The US natural gas has lost almost 30  in price since this November partly due to the weaker demand amid abnormally warm weather  The demand for gas for heating fell by 20  in December compared to the last year s level and by 30  compared to the average consumption in 30 years  Meanwhile  the US gas production contracted by the scarce 2  from 2014  Nevertheless  the US companies have increased twofold gas exports to Mexico so there is no critical glut  Market participants assume the gas may fall into deficit in case of the cold snap  The number of gas rigs fell 17 to 168 which is the lowest in 28 years  according to Baker Hughes  N BHI   Power generating companies took advantage of the slumping prices  Given cheaper gas  the reduced the coil purchases and increased gas production to produce electricity by 34  compared to the 30 year average  The net volume of shorts in gas at NYMEX and ICE fell to the lowest since this September  as reported by U S  Commodity Futures Trading Commission  Due to the season factor  the US WTI oil prices may follow the steps of the gas and move upwards which  in its turn  may support the Russian ruble 

On the daily chart  Natgas  D1 is slightly on the rise having rebounded from its 16 year low  The Parabolic indicator gives buy signal while MACD still signals to sell  The Bollinger bands  have widened severely  which may mean higher volatility  RSI has left the oversold zone and is neutral  no divergence  On Tuesday the gas quotes have reached the gap but failed to close it and fell slightly  The bullish momentum may develop in case the gas rises in price to close the entire gap at 2 021  This level may serve the point of entry  The initial risk limit may be placed below the 16 year low  the Parabolic signal and the last fractal low at 1 765  Having opened the pending order we shall move the stop to the next fractal low following the Parabolic signal and Bollinger signals  Thus  we are changing the probable profit loss ratio to the breakeven point  The most risk averse traders may switch to the 4 hour chart after the trade and place there a stop loss moving it in the direction of the trade  If the price meets the stop loss level at 1 765 without reaching the order at 2 021  we recommend cancelling the position  the market sustains internal changes which were not taken into account

99719,321234,BKR,Oil  Strait  No Chaser,opinion,"Oil prices are falling due to oversupply concerns despite the fact that there was a very disturbing incident in the Strait of Hormuz  The U S  military reported that several Iranian rockets were within 1 500 yards of the aircraft carrier USS Harry S  Truman on Saturday on what the U S  military is calling a provocative act  Yet despite that news  oil is falling because the American Petroleum Institute again surprised the market reporting 2 9 million barrels increase in crude oil supply  This flew in the face of market expectations of a million barrel plus decline  Yet it is almost amazing the lack of market response to the news in the Strait of Hormuz which in the past would have moved the market dramatically to the upside 
Consider the fact that the Energy Information Administration says that the Strait of Hormuz is the world s most important choke point with an oil flow of 17 million barrels per day in 2013  about 30  of all seaborne traded oil  Yet with a market focused on a glut of supply and a warm winter  have no fear of an event that could disrupt this supply  It may be because the market perceives that there will be no repercussions against Iran and even if they fire near our ships  there is no chance that the sanctions on the Iranian regime will be lifted 
Then you get into the seven degrees of separation  like if the weather is 7 degrees warmer we will use less natural gas and heating oil and if it is 7 degrees colder  we will use more  Natural gas and heating oil bounced on colder weather forecasts but now there is a chance the weather may be moderating  We saw the impact of warm weather in the API weekly report as distillate supply rose by 2 081 million barrels  Natural gas supply is also above normal despite the fact that the gas dedicated rig count now sits at the lowest recorded level going back to 1987  when Baker Hughes  N BHI  began compiling the figures as reported by Dow Jones  It is because supply is 17  above a year ago and 12  above the five year average 
Dow Jones also reported   China s export of refined products rose 68  year over year in November while imports dropped 21   Still  analysts expect China s crude appetite to remain high as the country continues to take advantage of the low oil prices to fill its strategic reserves and local refiners capitalize on the cheap crude

  The announcement is the latest in an unfolding regional row that escalated with Saudi Arabia s execution of a Shiite cleric over the weekend  Saudi Arabia s embassy in Tehran was ransacked and set on fire Saturday  Saudi Arabia broke off diplomatic ties with Iran in response  followed on Monday by its allies Bahrain and Sudan  and a diplomatic downgrade by the United Arab Emirates  The Strait of Hormuz  which connects the Persian Gulf with the Arabian Sea  carries about 20  of the world s petroleum  and about 35  of the petroleum traded by sea  making it a highly important strategic location 
At almost any other time  an escalating diplomatic conflict between OPEC members Iran and Saudi Arabia would mean a spike in oil prices  even if temporary  but this latest problem saw prices dip slightly yesterday  and today  prices dropped to a 2 week low  That should give us some indication about the strength of the downtrend in oil

EUR USD
The euro dropped below  1 06 on Thursday  following an exclusive report by Reuters that claimed the European Central Bank had been considering a variety of options before the next ECB meeting 
The ECB is expected to decide at the meeting whether to expand its current program of quantitative easing  The bank could also potentially cut interest rates further 
 They expect EUR USD to go to 0 95 over the next 12 months but this level could be reached sooner   said an outlook from Goldman   Until the ECB meeting they expect 1 05  and parity by year end  
One of the options the ECB has been considering is a two tier bank charge on those who seek to keep their money with the ECB  This would help alleviate major charges for commercial banks 
Analysts voiced their concerns about the eurozone s near stagnation  and the need for action at the ECB meeting  On the other side of the pond  the Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates

WTI Oil
Crude oil prices declined in holiday thinned trade on Thursday  amid uncertainty about how quickly the global glut of crude is set to shrink 
Saudi Arabia said earlier this week that it is prepared to use all measures necessary to ensure a stable oil market and that it is ready to cooperate with OPEC and non OPEC producers in order to stabilize prices  Despite this declaration  on Wednesday  Saudi Aramco  the Kingdom s largest oil producer  said it will not cut production in 2016  but will meet customer s demands 
On Wednesday  the U S  Energy Information Administration said crude oil inventories rose by 961 000 barrels last week  below expectations for a gain of 1 2 million barrels  Meanwhile  the same day  industry research group Baker Hughes  N BHI  said that the number of rigs drilling for oil in the U S  declined by 9 to 555 last week  A lower U S  rig count is usually a bullish sign for oil as it signals potentially lower production in the future

99748,321263,BKR,U S  Data Adds To NFP Expectations,opinion,"After the US ISM PMI slipped into contractionary territory yesterday some doubt was cast over the inevitability of a December Fed rate hike  However  the ADP employment out overnight seems to have calmed these fears  Although not a good lead for the all important non farm payrolls  NFP  data due on Friday  ADP employment still beat the expected 190 000 addition of new jobs to add 217 000 new jobs 
Alongside this US Q3 productivity growth was revised up to 2 2   and even more significantly compensation per hour saw a large upward revision as well  Following the revision  unit labour costs have now risen 3  from the previous year  greatly adding to hopes that the increase in jobs and wages will lead to a natural rise in the US inflation rate  Indeed  with US core inflation tracking steadily at 1 9  year on year growth  it would not be unthinkable to see this rise to 2  in 2016 in line with the Fed s desired inflation target  Janet Yellen in her remarks overnight also restated her concerns that if a rate hike were delayed too long there was a real risk of inflation overshoot  which would result in a much faster pace of rate hikes quite possibly resulting in a recession 
Given this positive data ahead of tomorrow s NFP number  the WIRP bond market probability for a December rate hike rose from yesterday s 70  back up to 74   This similarly led to a 0 22  rally in the DXY dollar index  retracing much of yesterday s losses  The Aussie and Kiwi dollars both fell against the USD  with the British pound saw the biggest drop of the G10 currencies losing 0 9   The rising likelihood a Fed rate hike saw gold plumb new lows as it dropped 1 3  to its lowest level since February 2010 
The strong dollar was no help to commodity prices overnight  but none more so than oil  The EIA weekly data dump prompted a 4 4  decline in the WTI oil price  The EIA reported that oil inventories increased by another 1 17 million barrels from the previous week  its tenth straight week of increases  This figure  alongside the exceedingly low expectations for any constructive agreement to come out of tomorrow s OPEC meeting in Vienna seems to have really driven down the price of oil  Saudi Arabia  Iraq and Russia are still producing oil at record rates and there is little hope that this meeting will convince them to cut back  particularly given that Russia is not a member of OPEC so would need to be dealt with separately 
Despite the Baker Hughes  N BHI  drill rig count in the US dropping precipitously  inventories still continue to increase indicating there is still room for more declines in the rig count  There is also little incentive for the big OPEC producers to cut back production until more of a drop in US shale output occurs  Particularly with the prospects for the end of sanctions on Iran that would see a large amount of Iranian supply hitting the markets next year

In testimony before the Joint Economic Committee on Capitol Hill  Yellen said the economy needs to add fewer than 100 000 jobs a month to absorb the losses of those who fell out of the labor market in recent years 
Later on  Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen strongly indicated to the Congress on Thursday afternoon that Fed policymakers are likely to vote to raise interest rates at its meeting in two weeks  barring any major shocks to the global economy  She said   I currently judge that US economic growth is likely to be sufficient over the next year or two to result in further improvement in the labor market

Crude oil surged on Thursday  bouncing off multi year lows amid a sharply weaker dollar  ahead of perhaps the most contentious OPEC meeting in years  Although OPEC is largely expected to leave their production quota unchanged at today s key meeting  the pressure is reportedly building on Saudi Arabia to slash output from near record highs 
Any production cuts could tighten a wide supply demand gulf worldwide that has persisted since OPEC resisted calls to slash output last November  As a result  crude prices have plummeted by more than 40   amid a glut of oversupply on global markets  Iran  meanwhile  is expected to resist any proposal that will force the Gulf state to cap output at 4 million bpd  Iran could ramp up production by as much as 1 million bpd over the next year  as Western Powers continue to ease economic sanctions related to this summer s comprehensive nuclear deal

99751,321266,BKR,Oil Trading Alert  Crude Oil Under  40,opinion,"Trading position  short term  our opinion   Short positions with a stop loss order at  54 12 and initial     target price at  35 72 are justified from the risk reward perspective 
On Friday  crude oil reversed and declined sharply after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries  decision to keep production high weighed on investors  sentiment  Thanks to these circumstances  light crude lost 2 74  and slipped under the barrier of  40 once again  What s next 
The most important event of the previous week was the OPEC s meeting in Vienna  As a reminder  the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries decided to maintain current production levels at around 31 5 million barrels per day  which pushed the price of the commodity to an intraday low of  39 60  Although Friday s Baker Hughes  N BHI  report showed that the number of rigs drilling for oil in the U S  dropped by 10 last week to 545  light crude closed the day slightly above the barrier of  40  What s next  Let s examine charts and find out  charts courtesy of   

In our previous commentary  we wrote the following 

    the commodity remains under its key resistance zone and sell signals generated by the weekly and daily Stochastic Oscillator remain in place  which suggests another attempt to move lower 

Looking at the daily chart  we see that the red declining resistance line  the upper border of the declining trend channel  encouraged oil bears to push the commodity lower  as we had expected   With Friday s downswing  light crude broke below the barrier of  40 once again  which suggests that lower values of the commodity are just around the corner 
How low could crude oil go in the coming days  We believe that the best answer to this question will be the quote from our Oil Trading Alert posted on Thursday 

    we would like to draw your attention to a potential   As you see on the chart  last week s upward move took light crude to slightly above the black dashed resistance line  Despite this improvement  oil bulls didn t manage to push crude oil higher  which showed their weakness and resulted in an invalidation of the small breakout  As a result  light crude extended losses and slipped under  40 yesterday  which suggests that the bearish formation is underway  Therefore  in our opinion  if the commodity declines from here  we may see not only a test of the Aug low of  37 75  but also a fresh 2015 low  around  36 50  where the size of the downward move will correspond to the height of the formation  

Nevertheless  to have a more complete picture of the commodity  let s find out what impact did Friday s decline have on the medium term picture 

On Friday  we wrote 

    crude oil remains in a consolidation  marked wih grey  under the key resistance zone  A potential breakdown under the lower line of the formation could bring not only a test of the Aug low  but also a fresh 2015 low around  35 35  in this area the size of the downward move would correspond to the height of the formation  

As you see on the above chart  crude oil not only broke under the lower border of the consolidation  but also closed the previous week below it  This is a bearish signal  which suggests that our downside target from the previous alert would be in play in the coming week s  
Summing up  crude oil declined sharply and closed the previous week under the lower border of the consolidation  marked on the weekly chart   which suggests that further deterioration is just around the corner  Therefore  short positions  which are already profitable as we opened them when crude oil was trading around  46 69  continue to be justified from the risk reward point of view

99752,321267,BKR,Oil Selloff Reaches Terminal Velocity,opinion,"The full implications of OPEC s failure to cut production have been coming to bear on the oil price and energy stocks  The dramatic selloff in the energy sector seen in the S P 500 overnight seems to have crystallised concern over the future of the energy market 
Currently  this fall in energy prices has developed its own momentum   like inertial motion   and it s difficult to see what will stop it  The weekly EIA release due Wednesday and the Baker Hughes  N BHI  drill rig count due Friday could bring welcome news  But the bloodbath we are seeing in energy stocks seems to imply that the market is looking for defaults  It wants to see companies going out of business before the short positions are ready to start coming out of the market 
Japan
The final number for Q3 GDP in Japan was even better than many were expecting  expanding 0 3  quarter on quarter  QoQ   Furthermore  GDP in Q2 was revised up to  0 1   This is not only significantly better than the initial technical recession that Japan was thought to have entered in Q3  but details of the data are indicating a budding turnaround in the fortunes of the Japanese economy 
Last week s very strong Q3 capex spending number was pointing to a pickup in business spending by Japanese corporates  Business investment increased 0 6  QoQ  indicating Japan may be at a turning point as Japanese corporates are feeling sufficiently confident about the economic outlook that they are prepared to start spending money again 
In the near term this probably marks the end of speculation that the Bank of Japan  BoJ  will step up its monetary easing  The mantle now falls to the government in following through on its promises to lower corporate taxes and improve Japan s business environment 
The general global market selloff had far more bearing on the Japanese markets with a good final GDP number already priced in  but going forward these supportive domestic improvements should help drive a number of stocks up over the coming months 
China
China s record trade balance did fall back to US 54 1 billion in November  driven by a pickup in imports  Imports still contracted 8 7  YoY  However  this was noticeably higher than the past three months and they increased 9 5  MoM as the temporary effects of the National Week in October looked to dissipate from the data 
Key for Australia was the 21 9  YoY increase in the volume of iron ore imports  and the third highest monthly total for iron ore imported this year  Given net exports contributed 1 5  to Australia s relatively decent Q3 GDP number concerns are high that this may be a fleeting contribution  particularly with fears over China s slowing economy particularly high  However  with October and November China s trade data in iron ore imports are clearly not dropping off a cliff and look likely to see a further net exports contribution to Australia s Q4 GDP number 
Clearly  the demanding 7  GDP growth target for 2015 has not yet been eschewed and iron ore imports are still benefitting from China s need to soften the slowdown 

Australia
The economic data out of Australia were also relatively upbeat today despite their inability to stem the selloff in the Aussie dollar or the ASX  The weekly ANZ Roy Morgan consumer confidence number bounced back after the previous week s Paris attack influenced dip  And the NAB Business Conditions held at a strong level of 10 with a rapid acceleration seen in retail  wholesale and transport utilities sectors  This further indicates a steady pickup in the non mining sector and  if net exports manage to hold up in Q4  we re increasingly unlikely to see a rate cut by the Reserve Bank of Australia  RBA  over the coming months 

The ASX replicated the virulent selloff seen in the energy sector in the S P overnight  with the sector as a whole diving 6 2   News that Woodside Petroleum Ltd  AX WPL  had retracted its bid for Oil Search Ltd  AX OSH  only added further fuel to the fire with the takeover premium coming out of the stock price and the stock seeing a massive 15 8  decline  But the pain was felt throughout the sector with Santos Ltd  AX STO  also having a terrible day as it lost 11 8   The big question will be whether they will still be able to hold out against the takeover offer from Middle Eastern private equity company Spectre Group at these price levels 
The strong rally in the US dollar during the past 24 hours and the disaster seen in the oil price has spilled over to other commodities  with iron dropping into the US 30 handle  The materials sectors have similarly seen a serious selloff  losing 3 3   with the two big miners  market caps weighing particularly heavy on the index as a whole  BHP Billiton Ltd  N BHP  dropped 5 1  into the A 17 handle and Rio Tinto PLC  N RIO  lost 4  
The banks were not saved from the selling   three of the big four all lost almost 1  and financials as a whole dropped 0 6

99753,321268,BKR,Oil Prices Rebound After Inventory Drawdown,opinion,"Oil prices are rebounding after a reported drawdown in crude oil inventory and a cut in the dividend by Kinder Morgan that is signaling yet again that energy companies can t take much more pain 
Kinder Morgan Inc  N KMI   the company that was supposed to be immune to falling energy prices  had to cut its full year dividend by a whopping 74 percent and that came just after they had said they were raising it  Yet that was not meant to be after the company made a purchase of a natural gas pipeline company and was downgraded by Moody s  This company was one of the first Master Limited Partnerships that passed most of its profits to the investors to offset tax revenue  Yet even though they abandoned that strategy  the company is carrying a big load of debt  Yet the real story is this a company that is mainly a transportation company and is not immune to the pain that we are seeing in the oil price crash and that means other companies with debt will be at risk 
Oil producers are also at risk and this raises questions about future U S  output  Many U S  shale producers are buried in debt and energy companies are getting crushed which means production will fall

Bloomberg reports that America s oil drillers have sidelined more than half the country s rigs since October as prices have tumbled  The number of active oil rigs in the U S  fell by 10 to 545 last week  the least in more than five years  according to data compiled by Baker Hughes  N BHI  Inc  The drop in rigs is having a major impact on overall production output and is increasing at offshore fields  according to the EIA   While U S  monthly onshore production is expected to continue declining through most of the year  output in the Gulf of Mexico is on track to steadily rise   EIA Administrator Adam Sieminski said in an e mailed statement   Energy companies have cut back on their onshore oil exploration and drilling activities in response to low crude prices  but oil production in the Gulf of Mexico is less sensitive to short term movements in the crude price   Twelve projects are scheduled to come online in the Gulf of Mexico in 2015 and 2016  pushing production up from 1 4 million barrels a day in the fourth quarter of 2014 to 1 7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016  according to the report

99782,321297,BKR,Crude s Coming Collapse  5 Reasons Oil Will Fall To  25 In 2016,opinion,"By Jesse Cohen
Of late  oil market players have been grappling with one key question  are prices of the commodity in the process of bottoming  or will futures see a further collapse to new lows in 2016 

This past Friday  U S  Crude futures ended the week at  40 70 a barrel  while Brent  settled at  44 50  Just 18 months ago  in June 2014  a barrel of oil fetched more than  100 
So far in 2015  U S  and Brent prices are down almost 18   Dating back to June 2014  oil futures have lost approximately 60   That s a heart stopping decline  and there s no reason to believe it s over yet 

Because of 5 bearish factors now dominating the market  I see oil prices falling even further in the coming year  to a range between  25 to  35 a barrel 
1  Global oil production is outpacing demand following a boom in U S  shale oil output and after a decision by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries  OPEC  last year not to cut their supply quota  see chart  below   According to recent estimates    close to record highs  as major producers led by Saudi Arabia focused on defending market share by keeping production high 

2  OPEC supplies are expected to rise further once Iran begins boosting crude production when international sanctions are lifted early next year  following July s nuclear agreement with major Western powers  Tehran wants to double oil exports to 2 3 million barrels a day by the middle of 2016  adding to the glut of oil that has already sent prices tumbling 
3  Worries over high domestic U S  oil supplies  despite a declining rig count  will also pose a bearish risk for prices in the year ahead 
According to industry research group Baker Hughes  N BHI   the number of rigs drilling for oil in the U S  stood at 574 last week  remaining close to the lowest level since June 2010  see chart  below   Over the prior 11 weeks  drillers in the U S  have cut 101 rigs  Ironically  a lower U S  rig count is usually a bullish sign for oil as it signals potentially lower production in the future 

However  U S  oil production has held around  for the past year  close to the highest level since the early 1970s  At the same time  total U S  crude oil inventories stood near levels not seen for this time of year in at least the last 80 years 

4  Adding to the bearish sentiment  ongoing worries over the weakening health of the global economy have fueled concerns that a global supply glut may stick around for longer than anticipated 
Widespread concerns over the soundness of China s sluggish economy and its impact on oil demand will remain a factor  The Asian nation is on track to post its weakest annual growth rate since the global financial crisis in 2015 
China s third quarter GDP growth came in at 6 9   just below the government s 7  target  Industrial production figures  announced this past Wednesday  missed expectations and are clearly slowing  Fixed asset investment has flattened  As analyst Cam Hui points out  China s traditional growth engine powered by industrial exports and infrastructure spending  is decelerating along a number of dimensions  
China s implied oil demand   the weakest growth rate over the last 8 months  The Asian nation is the world s second largest oil consumer after the U S  and has been the driver of strengthening demand 


5  Oil prices will also face headwinds from a stronger U S  dollar once the Federal Reserve starts hiking interest rates and tightening monetary policy  The policy shift  which many anticipate will be announced in December  is expected to boost the dollar and make dollar denominated oil futures contracts more expensive for buyers who use other currencies 
All these factors indicate that a rebalance in supply and demand is distant  insuring that oil prices will stay low for a long time 
Technical analysis further supports this view  After breaking below a trend line dating back to 1999  bearish chart signals show there is no clear support until prices reach the  25 to  30 level 

Based on the numerous fundamental and technical signals currently flashing across the broader economic spectrum  I believe oil prices will continue to spiral lower  likely bottoming at  25 a barrel in 2016 ",2015-11-16,Jesse Cohen/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/do-not-publish-crude’s-coming-collapse:-5-reasons-oil-will-fall-to-$25-271356,271356

On Tuesday  crude oil lost 2 19  as a stronger greenback and worries that weekly reports would show that another build in crude oil inventories weighed on investors  sentiment  In these circumstances  light crude gave up some of Monday s gains and closed the day slightly above  41  Where will the commodity head next 
On Friday  Baker Hughes  N BHI  report showed that the number of rigs drilling for oil in the U S  increased by 2 to 574  This first weekly rise in almost three months fuelled worries that reports would show another build in crude oil inventories and pushed the commodity lower  Additionally  the USD Index extended gains and approached the barrier of 100  making crude oil less attractive for buyers holding other currencies  As a result  light crude hit an intraday low of  40 58  but then rebounded slightly and closed the day slightly above  41  Where will the commodity head next  Let s examine charts and find out  charts courtesy of stockcharts com  

The situation in the medium term hasn t changed much as crude oil is still trading under the previously brken blue zone  reinforced by the blue line   which serves as the nearest important resistance  Additionally  sell signal generated by the Stochastic Oscillator remains in place  supporting oil bears 
Having said that  let s take a closer look at the short term changes 

From this perspective  we see that the black resistance line encouraged oil bears to act  which resulted in a pullback  Taking this fact into account  we believe that our yesterday s commentary is up to date 
    the commodity climbed to the black resistance line  which could be the neck line of a potential head and shoulders formation  If this is the case and crude oil declines from here  we ll see a drop below  40 in the coming days  At this point  it is worth noting that if we see such price action  the current decline will likely accelerate  which will likely translate to a test of the Aug lows 
Nevertheless  taking into account the above mentioned bearish pattern  we may see a decline even to around  35 50  where the size of the downward move will correspond to the height of the formation 
Finishing today s alert  we would like to notice that the daily Stochastic Oscillator generated a buy signal  which may result in another test of the black resistance line in the coming day 
Summing up  the first resistance line triggered a pullback  which increases the probability that the potential head and shoulders formation  marked on the daily chart  is underway  If this is the case  we ll see further deterioration in the coming weeks  even if crude oil moves higher and re tests the black resistance line in the coming day   Therefore  we believe that short positions  which are already profitable as we opened them when crude oil was trading around  46 69  continue to be justified from the risk reward point of view

Technical Developments 
EUR USD bias remains lower beneath previous support turned resistance at 1 0800
GBP USD forming a longer term rounded top pattern  100 day MA at 1 5400 could provide resistance
USD JPY rally pausing  but more upside is favored above 121 50

EUR USD
EUR USD dipped to a fresh 7 month low earlier this week  the lowest level since  Tax Day  in the United States   April 15  before catching a bid midweek and bouncing back modestly  While the short EUR USD trade is undoubtedly becoming crowded  it is supported by both fundamental  monetary policy divergence in favor of the US  and technical  established downtrend  reasons  For this week  a bounce back toward key previous support turned resistance at 1 0800 is possible  but the market should look to fade any near term rallies in favor of the established downtrend

USD CAD rally may be petering out ahead of key 1 3400 50 resistance zone
It s been another lackluster week in the battle for 49th parallel currency supremacy  USD CAD rallied in early November  boosted primarily by better than expected economic data out of the US and weakness in oil  a key Canadian export  but the rally is now showing signs of petering out ahead of the key 1 3400 50 resistance zone 
While most traders are probably keyed in on the daily or hourly  or shorter term   charts  it s worthwhile to occasionally check in on the longer term price action  In the case of USD CAD  a trader who zoomed all the way out to a monthly chart  not shown  would note that the 61 8  Fibonacci retracement of the entire 2002 2007 decline comes in at 1 3460  within a few pips of the high that USD CAD set earlier this year  These long term Fibonacci levels tend to be more reliable than shorter term levels as they take more traders  trading more money  for longer to create 
The North American exchange rate has already pulled back 600 pips from that barrier  but in the grand scheme of things  that may be relatively small potatoes  after all  we re talking about a 7100 pip drop and subsequent 4400 pip rally off the 2007 lows 
More immediately  USD CAD remains in a short term uptrend  though there are some signs that the trend is losing steam  Notably  the MACD and RSI indicators have both flat lined over the last few weeks  showing fading bullish momentum  Intraday traders could opt to give the near term uptrend the benefit of the doubt in the short term  but medium  and longer term traders may want to be more cautious below the critical 1 3460 barrier

Look Ahead  Stocks
We have published a few bullish reports on the stock markets since the middle of this week after noticing how resilient the markets were following last Friday s terror attacks in Paris  From a trading perspective  the reaction of the market is always more important than the news itself and this was yet another example of this bullish market behavior  In addition  the FOMC meeting minutes suggested the Fed is likely to increase rates in December  But the US stocks markets have rallied  thereby shrugging off concerns that the slightly higher rates will hold back economic growth there or in emerging markets  Of course  the Fed did say that further rate rises will be very gradual and dependant on incoming data  So  despite the Fed potentially hiking rates in December  it will still remain dovish  In Europe  the European Central Bank is still very dovish of course and is seriously considering increasing the size and composition of its bond buying program in December  In theory  the euro should continue to move lower  making European exports comparatively competitive  which in turn should help to boost economic growth in the single currency bloc  Meanwhile  the cheaper borrowing costs means individual and business spending could increase  further fuelling growth  wages and eventually inflation in the Eurozone  At least that is what the ECB is hoping to achieve  anyway 
On Friday  the ECB President Mario Draghi said  we will do what we must  and would seek to get inflation back up to target  as quickly as possible   This was enough to send bond yields further into the negative and with the absence of any other sentiment sapping news  investors  confidence grew and they evidently expanded their long equity positions  And who would blame them  After all  yields are universally extremely low  bad news continually gets shrugged off  selling pressures have so far been relatively mild and short  oil prices are low  which is good news for the consumer  and gold and other safe haven assets are falling to name but a few bullish indications  Yield seeking investors are thus left with little choice but to invest in equities which pay decent yields at acceptable levels of risk 
However  there are some headwinds that may cause the markets to fall back next week  including fears about the global economy  In this regard  the latest manufacturing PMI reports from Germany and France in particular  released on Monday  should therefore be monitored closely  On Tuesday the focus will turn to the German Ifo Business Climate  which is a highly regarded survey due to its large sample size and historic correlation with German and Eurozone economic conditions  So  if this shows business confidence is growing once more following the Volkswagen  DE VOWG p  emissions scandal and despite the terror attack threats  then equities should in theory push further higher  Traders may also want to keep an eye on the second estimates of the third quarter GDP in the US and Britain due to be published on Tuesday and Friday  respectively 
Meanwhile the technical picture of the DAX is looking increasingly bullish and as we had anticipated earlier this week  the index has now broken its corrective trend which had been in place since it achieved a record high in April  This is potentially a significantly bullish outcome and effectively invalidates the previously bearish technical picture  So the DAX could potentially go on to not only revisit but break the record high of around 12400 over time  But we are miles away from that level and traders will need to remain focused and not lose sight of the near term trend and resistance levels  First and foremost  the bulls need to tackle the 200 day moving average at 11095 as so far we haven t broken above it on a closing basis  If and when this is put right  the bulls may then aim for the Fibonacci convergence area of 11215 25 where the 61 8  retracement of the drop from the record high meets the 127 2  extension of the most recent downswing  The 161 8  extension comes in at 11410 then there is not much further resistance until the double bottom target and the 78 6  Fibonacci retracement level around 11720 45  So  there s potential for a BIG rally 
The bears meanwhile will want to first and foremost see another rejection of the 200 day moving average and then hope that the index would fall back below the now broken resistance at 11050  If that happens then there is a chance we will see a sizeable move lower  But as things stand  it is the bulls who are in the driving seat heading into next week

Look Ahead  Commodities
Commodity prices were stable since Wednesday  Gold managed to gain for a couple of days  copper halted its decline and oil traded sideways  While gold was underpinned by a slightly weaker dollar due to growing expectations of a so called dovish rate hike from the Fed  copper got a boost in part from zinc  which has rallied sharply after ten Chinese smelters said in a joint statement they would cut output by 500 000 tons next year  reasoning that the current weak prices do not reflect the fundamentals  Commodity giant Glencore  L GLEN  is already reducing copper production  though so far this has had little or no impact on the metal s price  Nevertheless  concerns over China appear to have diminished somewhat  so copper could find a near term base soon  though the long term trend remains decisively bearish   and not just for copper  Indeed we wouldn t be surprised if gold starts melting away once more given the surging equity markets and the rebounding US dollar  But with sentiment being so bearish on gold  the probability that we will see a sharp short squeeze rally is now high  especially if resistance at  1090 breaks 
Meanwhile crude oil has shown signs of stabilization though the bears keep knocking it down each time it tries to break higher  Traders are clearly finding it difficult to decide whether to focus on the short term bearish or the slightly longer term bullish supply and demand factors  As things stand  it looks as though not many people are convinced that we will see a notable destocking in global crude stockpiles anytime soon  even if the latest US oil inventories data shows that the pace of the builds there has slowed down  So  oil prices could fall further before we see a noticeable bounce  though that being said they do look severally oversold in the short term  Baker Hughes  N BHI  will report its latest rig counts data on Friday evening  The number of active rigs has been consistently falling in recent times as oil prices continue to remain depressed  So far  short term speculators have hardly reacted to the falls but essentially it does point to a tighter market in 2016  So we could be very close to the bottom for oil 
Technical outlook  Brent
How low can oil go  Brent has found decent support around the  43 50    44 00 price range following a big drop recently  As can be seen on the chart  a couple of Fibonacci levels converge with the point D of an AB CD move here  So  we have a Bullish Gartley pattern here  which can sometimes pinpoint major lows and highs in the markets  So far this pattern is just about holding and we are yet to see a rally  So  at this stage  the bulls should proceed with extreme caution since they would be going against the underlying bearish trend  But if resistance at the  45 00  45 20 region breaks  then we may see a more aggressive rally at least towards the bearish trends and the 50 day moving average  around  48 00  Supporting the bullish case here is the fact that the Slow Stochastics indicator is at the oversold threshold and potentially about to form a bullish crossover 
Conversely  if oil breaks below the abovementioned Bullish Gartley support  then the next logical target for the bears would be the August low around  42 20  Though there is a possibility for Brent to form a double bottom here  there s greater risk that it could even extend its drop towards the next psychological level at  40 a barrel  Should we get to these levels  the longer term bears would need to be extremely cautious for there is a more significant harmonic price pattern that could provide a floor to prices  a Bullish Butterfly around  39  This formation is the same as the Gartley in that it is constructed by Fibonacci levels  but the point D comes in below the 100  retracement of XA  in this case at the 127 2  extension level  The CD leg is also extended   in this case  by 161 8 per cent times AB  The area around  39 is also where the 261 8  of the BC move resides  thus making it an exhaustion point  But will oil even get to  39 and even if it does  will necessarily form a major base  Indeed  we could simply see a short term bounce  before the trend resumes and oil prices fall further  So treat all these Gartley Butterfly and indeed any other technical patterns with caution  especially when going against the underlying trend

EUR USD
On Friday the euro weakened after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi reiterated that the Central Bank will do what is necessary to ensure that inflation returns rapidly toward the goal of just under 2  
Draghi s comments underlined the ECB s concern that the inflation rate in the 19 nation euro area  currently 0 1   will slip further from its target of just under 2   amid a high degree of economic slack and slumping oil prices 
Policy makers are setting the scene for further stimulus in two weeks  time  weighing the need for an expansion to the 1 1 trillion euro quantitative easing program that started in March 2015  or for measures such as taking the deposit rate further below zero  The ECB s Governing Council will meet in Frankfurt on December 3 for its next monetary policy meeting

Gold
Last week  gold prices ended the week near the lowest level since February 2010 on Friday  as market players prepared for a hike in interest rates by the Federal Reserve next month 
Gold prices fell also in Asia on Monday  with little regional data at hand and investors firmly focused on a likely Federal Reserve rate hike in December

WTI Oil
Oil prices swung between gains and losses in choppy volatile trade on Friday  as investors reacted to the expiration of the December West Texas Intermediate oil contract on 18 of November  Contract expiration often leads to volatile sessions as market participants look to close out positions or reposition their portfolios 
Furthermore industry research group Baker Hughes  N BHI  said late Friday that the number of rigs drilling for oil in the U S  decreased by 10 last week to 564  A lower U S  rig count is usually a bullish sign for oil  as it signals potentially lower production in the future 
But Daniel Ang  an investment analyst said that   Markets are a bit fearful that Iranian oil could come in  and prices are forming a descending triangle pattern  which suggests possible drops in prices in the near term

99789,321304,BKR,Commodity Rout,opinion,"Oil prices are caught up in the commodity rout that has been driven by a rising dollar and concerns about global demand  The dollar is exceeding par against all major currencies on the increasing belief that the Federal Reserve will raise rates in December and fear that the rise in terror attacks will cause many to find safe harbor in U S  backed assets is putting pressure on commodity prices  Still the inability of oil to close below  40 00 a barrel is raising the possibility that we are very close to bottom 
One reason that bottom may be near is rising oil demand  While we keep talking about a global slowdown  actual oil demand is rising  In fact Reuters reports that a resurgence in U S  driving continued with force in September  as motorists logged 259 9 billion road miles  a 4 3 percent bump up from last year and the most in the month s history  according to new data released Friday by the U S  Department of Transportation  The strong September figures contributed to a record breaking year for road miles in the United States  bucking predictions that Americans have lost their appetite for driving as the population ages and the youth migrate more to urban areas  Year to date  drivers have logged 2 36 trillion miles on U S  roads  the highest figure through September  in history and a 3 4 percent jump compared to the same stretch last year  DOT figures show  The year over year percentage increase is the largest since 1997  data shows 
 It s a huge number   said Phil Flynn  an analyst with the Price Futures Group   It shows you that drivers are being inspired by the low prices  It also shows you that the economy may have bottomed out and is on the uptick   With the September 2015 estimates  the series of consecutive monthly mileage increases now stands at 19 months 
The fresh numbers are the latest piece of evidence showing a sustained U S  road revival that has been fueled by a rout in global petroleum prices and a growing U S  economy  The national average price for gasoline on Friday was  2 10 per gallon  down from  2 85 a year ago  according to AAA  the motorists  advocacy organization  Driving activity in the United States is closely watched since the country accounts for about 10 percent of global gasoline demand 
The other issue is whether or not OPEC is going to try to prop up oil prices  Saudi oil minister Ali al Naimi said they will work with other OPEC members and producers to stabilize the market  They had better according to Venezuelan oil minister  Eulogio Del Pino  who is saying that oil could fall into the mid  20 00 a barrel area  They are using this big drop prediction to urge OPEC to cut production at their December 5th OPEC meeting 
The other key to the crude oil market is the dollar that is soaring above par  The U S  dollar is becoming the safe haven in times of terror and because of the odds that the U S  will raise rates  San Francisco Fed John Williams continues to say that there is a strong case for a December lift off 
Yet global demand is on the rise as demand growth figures seem to contradict the doom and gloom forecasts  While the world has an unprecedented glut of oil right now we feel that could change  U S  production is showing more signs of production peaking after the Baker Hughes  N BHI  oil rig count fell by 10 to 564 this week  according to driller Baker Hughes ",2015-11-23,Phil Flynn,https://www.investing.com/analysis/commodity-rout-272257,272257

99816,321331,BKR,FOREX Daily Analysis   October 21  2015,opinion,"The dollar remained lower against the other major currencies on Tuesday  after the release of mixed U S  data fueled further uncertainty over the timing of a U S  rate hike 
The U S  Commerce Department said that housing starts rose 6 5  to 1 206 million units last month from August s total of 1 132 million units  above analysts  expectations  but the report also showed that the number of building permits issued dropped by 5 0  to 1 103 million units from August s total of 1 170 million  below analysts  expectations 
On Wednesday the dollar was steady against the euro  as the previous session s upbeat U S  housing starts data support the greenback 
Meanwhile  the single currency strengthened as investors looked ahead to Thursday s European Central Bank meeting in Malta  amid speculation that it could flag plans to enlarge its stimulus program 
Today investors  focus will be on the U K  data on public sector net borrowing and later on the Bank of Canada announcement of its benchmark interest rate  which outlines economic conditions and the factors affecting the monetary policy decision 

EUR USD
The euro edged higher against the dollar on Tuesday  as investors looked ahead to a European Central Bank meeting later in the week  amid speculation that it could flag plans to enlarge its stimulus program 
The single currency has come under pressure since late last week when ECB governing council member Ewald Nowotny said that additional measures to boost price growth in the euro zone are needed  Data on Friday confirmed that the rate of inflation in the euro area turned negative in September for the first time since the ECB launched its easing program in March  The ECB launched its  60 billion a month asset purchase program to combat persistently low inflation in the euro area and it is set to run until at least September 2016

Gold
Gold futures were little changed on Tuesday after data showed the number of housing starts issued in the U S  rose more than expected in September  while building permits fell more than forecast  painting a mixed picture of the economy and adding to uncertainty over the timing of a U S  rate hike  Later on during the day the gold went up  amid a slightly weaker dollar  one session after tumbling nearly 1  following indications from China that the world s second largest economy could expand this year at its lowest rate in more than a decade  Metal traders continued to digest weak economic data from China when the National Bureau of Statistics reported that Chinese GDP grew by 6 9  in the third quarter  marking the slowest three month period of growth since the height of the Financial Crisis  But gold prices held flat to weaker again in Asia on Wednesday with the focus on the Federal Reserve latest monetary review this month

WTI Oil
Crude futures closed slightly higher on Tuesday  as market players looked ahead to fresh weekly information from this week special OPEC meeting with a host of non OPEC members including Russia  But oil prices fell again on Wednesday  after data showed a larger than expected build in U S  crude inventories last week  fanning worries over global oversupply  even as a slightly weaker dollar provided some support  Oil traders now are focused on today special meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non OPEC members in Vienna  as it may shed further light on the group s position of maintaining production at current levels as prices remain muted  According to industry research group Baker Hughes  N BHI  the number of rigs drilling for oil in the U S  decreased by 10 last week to 595  the seventh straight weekly decline  Over the prior six weeks  drillers had cut 70 rigs  But despite this tighter outlook for North America  output remains robust in other countries

99819,321334,BKR,Oil Prices Still Struggle As Big Oil Forced To Cut To The Quick,opinion,"Cut to the QuickOil prices are still struggling and big oil is being forced to cut to the quick  Today s Wall Street Journal is reporting that even  big oil  is going to have a hard time surviving the pull back in energy prices  The Journal writes that 

 the world s biggest oil companies are struggling to generate enough cash to cover their spending and dividends  despite efforts to slash billions of dollars from their budgets in the face of tumbling oil prices  Spending on new projects  share buybacks and dividends at four of the biggest oil companies known as the super majors   Royal Dutch Shell PLC  L RDSa   BP PLC  L BP   Exxon Mobil Corp  N XOM  and Chevron Corp   N CVX    outstripped cash flow by more than a combined  20 0 billion in the first half of 2015  according to a Wall Street Journal analysis  

The outcome will mean that we will see even more capital spending cuts and more oil projects put on hold  creating a tight oil market in the future  As the Journal says 

 after a decade when high oil prices supported megaprojects and steadily escalating payouts to shareholders  the supermajors have slashed spending by more than  30 billion in recent months  laying off workers and delaying projects  More cuts are expected  

We are seeing  little oil  struggle as U S  oil rig counts fell for the eighth week in a row  Baker Hughes  N BHI  reported that the U S  oil rig count fell by 1 to 594  The total combined count of oil and gas rigs was unchanged at 787  the lowest since April 2002 
This drop in rigs is slowing U S  production and giving rise to U S  imports  The Wall Street Journal focused on this and reported   U S  imports of foreign oil are rising again after a long decline  as the oil bust forces domestic producers to scale back  Less than a year after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries opted to continue production despite plummeting prices  member countries including Saudi Arabia and Iraq are clawing back market share they ceded to oil companies pumping in Texas and North Dakota 
U S  crude imports declined 20  between 2010 and 2014 amid the domestic energy boom  but have recently started to rise again  Total crude oil imports rose for three straight months between April and July  according to the most recently available data from the Energy Information Administration  Imports of light crude grew more rapidly  from 5 6  of total imports in April to 11  in July  On the Gulf Coast  vessels carrying nearly a week s worth of imports waited offshore Friday to unload  according to shipping tracker ClipperData  The slowdown in the nation s shale oil output has pushed up the price of high quality U S  oil relative to global prices  giving U S  refiners a reason to buy from countries such as Nigeria  Until very recently  the boom in U S  shale oil production forced countries that export oil to the U S  to hustle for new customers  Decreased reliance on foreign crude in the past few years has allowed the U S  to be more flexible in its foreign policy and given the U S  more global heft  politicians and analysts have said 
It is just not energy companies but also OPEC that has some changing to do  As I reported last week  the International Monetary Fund is warning OPEC to cut spending or raise taxes or face running out of cash in five years or less  Low oil prices will wipe out an estimated  360 billion from the region this year alone 
Yet oil may get support from the Fed and China  And the Fed can t raise rates and China already has ",2015-10-27,Phil Flynn,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-energy-report-269333,269333
99820,321335,BKR,Oil Price Gurgling Down The Fissure ,opinion,"Asian markets are clearly unwilling to rally past the recent highs they set last Friday ahead of the Fed and Bank of Japan  BoJ  meetings  Volumes were down dramatically across the region  The Nikkei 225 volumes were 20 6  below their 30 day average  while the Hang Seng and the S P ASX 200 were down 31 2  and 17 1  respectively  Traders are largely sitting on the sidelines at the moment 
For markets to rally further we would probably need to see the Fed definitively push their first rate hike out into 2016 in the dot plots and the BoJ step up its monetary stimulus  The former is quite likely  while the latter is a close call  While most markets would probably take the Fed rate hike delay as a positive irrespective of the BoJ decision  Japanese markets could see a noticeable drop if BoJ refuses to act and the USD JPY could push to 118 or even lower 
Commodities have been continuing to weaken during Asian trade  Dalian iron ore futures were down 1 5  at one point  although have pared that back to 1  since  WTI oil has fallen a further 1 6  in Asian trade 
Oil
The WTI oil price has declined 13 4  since 9 October  reaching its lowest level since 10 September  The oil price is now breaking key technical resistance around the US 43 50 level and the question emerging is whether oil is going to pivot back up to US 50 or plummet to re test its August lows below US 40 

White active WTI contract  daily price   green Baker Hughes  N BHI  crude oil drill rig count  weekly 
WTI lost a further 1 7  yesterday to drop back below US 40  This seems to partly be a reaction to the decline in the Baker Hughes drill rig count slowing  as the weekly drill rig count declined from 595 to 594  There does seem to be an interesting correlation between the drill rig count and WTI  Since March  strong declines in the drill rig count have been bullish for the oil price  while the big sell offs in July and August also corresponded to a plateauing and slight uptick in the drill rig count  Undoubtedly  Friday s drill rig count looks set to be a major mover in the oil price  If we see a pickup in the rig count decline  that is likely to be bullish and help break the current downtrend  whereas if it is flat or increasing  prices could be pushed in the US 40 direction 
We have entered the normal refinery maintenance season  which has helped push crude supplies up further with less refineries running to handle the output  This has pushed oil contango  the difference between the December and January WTI contracts  to its widest level in five months 
The big question is whether OPEC and other oil producers can continue to handle prices at these levels  There have been calls from Russia and Venezuela in recent weeks for OPEC and non OPEC producers to meet and agree on cutting production  This week Algeria also backed Venezuela s call for the meeting  Despite the marked drop in US shale oil production  global oil supplies have remained stubbornly high  But now that OPEC nations have been steadily regaining global market share  they may be more inclined to start to trim back their production  The big unknown is how much pain they need to inflict on US shale oil producers before they cut back  but moves on this front could certainly see some upside in the oil price 
ASX
The ASX opened fairly flat on the back of poor US leads  Resources and oil both fared poorly overnight and this continued into Asian trade seeing the materials and energy sectors perform the worst on the index today  Despite the poor performance seen across the Asian region  the ASX has managed to grimly cling on around the 5350 level 
The healthcare sector outperformed all the others by a long shot  Cochlear Ltd  AX COH    1 4    CSL Ltd  AX CSL    1 7    and Sonic Healthcare Ltd  AX SHL   1 7   saw the best performances in the sector

99821,321336,BKR,The Sentence That Sunk A Thousand Currencies,opinion,"A new sentence in the Fed monetary policy statement has put a December rate hike by the Fed back on the table  G10 currencies slid against a resurgent USD  while the worst was left for emerging market  EM  currencies  The Korean won  Indonesian rupiah and Malaysian ringgit saw the heaviest selling in Asia  Equity markets across Asia initially opened positively  but the hawkish Fed statement and strong Japanese industrial production data put in doubt any further expansion of monetary easing by the major central banks in the near term 
Ahead of the meeting  bond market pricing was giving a 4  probability to a rate hike at the October meeting  and markets were clearly positioned for some very dovish commentary from the Fed  Instead  an explicit mention of the necessary developments for a rate hike at the next meeting was made clear in this sentence 
 In determining whether it will be appropriate to raise the target range at its next meeting  the Committee will assess progress  both realized and expected  toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation  
That  next meeting  mention saw currencies drop sharply against the USD  as the DXY dollar index rallied 1 1  
But the other major macro development overnight was the big 6 3  jump in WTI oil  The US Energy Information Administration  EIA  released data that showed refineries were operating at 87 6  of capacity after hitting a low of 86  on 9 October  This has spurred speculation that the usual autumnal refinery maintenance season in September and October is coming to an end and could start processing larger amounts of crude 
This bout of USD strength and oil strength creates some divergent FX forces  particularly for the oil related currencies  The Canadian dollar lost 1  in the wake of the Fed announcement  while the Norwegian krone and the Malaysian ringgit lost 1 7  and 1 2   respectively  All three currencies have weakened considerably as WTI oil steadily declined from its high of US 50 a couple of weeks ago  And yet many of those currencies were rallying ahead of the Fed announcement in the wake of the refinery capacity data 
This now sets these currencies up for some divergence  After being battered by the Fed  they could be set for a turnaround if the oil price continues to see some short term upside  The Baker Hughes  N BHI  oil drill rig count expected on Friday will no doubt have some influence on how oil trades into the end of the week  Nonetheless  WTI oil does look to have found a short term bottom after touching as low as US 42 56 on Tuesday   which the strong 6 3  rally overnight supports  Certainly in this dollar strong oil scenario  going short USD NOK looks compelling 

S P ASX 200
The ASX had a very volatile day as quarterly earnings reports drove some strong sectoral divergence amidst general negativity about the hawkish Fed statement 
Woolworths Ltd  AX WOW  was the instigator of negative sentiment on the ASX today  WOW s earnings results managed to disappoint on all fronts and downgraded their 1H16 guidance  Like for like store sales further decreased  declining 1  from 0 9  the previous quarter  Masters home improvement saw strong sales growth  but unlikely enough to dispel speculation that it should be shut down or sold off  Big W saw like for like sales improve from the deep negative territory of  11 7  to  8 1   but private equity houses will still be very interested in taking it off WOW s hands  WOW s stock rapidly fell 9 7  at the open 
But the negativity spread over to the entire consumer focussed sector as Wesfarmers Ltd  AX WES  saw its stock decline by 5 1   Metcash Ltd  AX MTS  by 9 7  and Dicksmith Fpo  AX DSH  by 6 5  
On the other side of the market  the continued strong growth of Chinese consumption was evident in Blackmores Ltd  AX BKL  outsized performance  At one point the stock touched the  200 mark from a close yesterday of  155 45  Earnings came in strongly above expectations particularly in their sales to China  when they announced a partnership with Bega to begin selling infant formula into China in early 2016  Blackmores  as a high quality vitamins manufacturer  is an excellent example of a  New China  stock  These are the stocks well positioned for a more mature and discerning Chinese consumer  While growth continues to slow in China  elements of the consumer market continue to see outsized growth  Amorepacific  KS 090430  in Korea and Okamoto Industries Inc  T 5122  in Japan have seen similarly strong stock performances with this investment theme  While in the Aussie market  names like Bellamys  AX BAL  and Vitaco Holdings Ltd  AX VIT  have performed well in this  New China  segment and privately held Swisse was recently bought out for  1 7 billion  The big question is  how long will the rally continue for these stocks ",2015-10-29,IG,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-sentence-that-sunk-a-thousand-currencies-269598,269598

In the week ahead  investors will be focusing on Friday s U S  jobs report for October  which could help to provide clarity on the likelihood of a near term interest rate hike

Last week the U S  giant Chevron  N CVX  announced that it was going to cut 10  of its workforce  This represents close to 7 000 jobs  or four times the number of jobs it cut just three months ago  Furthermore  the multinational announced that it has scaled back its long term production target 
The U S  Energy Information Agency  EIA  announced that oil output in the U S  declined by 45 000 barrels per day in August  to 9 32 million bpd  Even though this is close to twice the level recorded in 2011  output has nevertheless been trending downward for the last few months  Knowing that global output currently exceeds demand by 1 million bpd and that output from OPEC members can be expected to remain relatively unchanged  any major rise in oil prices will depend on deeper cuts in the U S  This is why it is important to keep a close eye on this figure  which is published on a weekly basis

99824,321339,BKR,Oil Prices Selling Off After Subpar China Manufacturing PMI,opinion,"Saudi Downgrade and China PMI
Oil prices are selling off after a subpar manufacturing number out of China and reports that Saudi oil production hit a post soviet high  Not even a downgrade of Saudi Arabia s debt market seems to be enough to get the market to believe that an OPEC production cut is in the cards and so the production war continues  A big drop in the U S  oil rig count isn t enough to support oil as the market frets about weak demand against a backdrop of rising Russian output  The mood starts bleak to this week  but we may recover later if we begin to focus on some of the more bullish issues 
Low oil prices and the inability of Saudi Arabia to make enough cuts to its budget has caused rating agency S P to cut its rating of Saudi Arabia s long term foreign debt and local currency ratings by one notch to  A plus A 1   with a continuing a negative outlook  S P said   pronounced negative swing  in Saudi Arabia s fiscal balance prompted the downgrade  S P said that Saudi Arabia s budget surpluses   or money available after all government expenses had been met   averaged about 13  of GDP  This situation  however  has changed rapidly as the price of oil has crashed and in 2015 Saudi Arabia is expected to see a budget deficit equal to 16  of GDP  The downgrade will put further pressure on Saudi Arabia to work on cutting production 
What will make that harder is Russian oil production hit a post Soviet high in October rising 0 4 percent month on month to 10 78 million barrels per day  bpd   The Russians apparently are all in when it comes to maintaining market share  making a production cut a bit more difficult  Russian output hit 45 572 million tons versus 43 961 million in September  or 10 74 million bpd  which was at that time a post Soviet high

Gas rigs  on the other hand  rose by four to 197 and the offshore rig count was 33 last week  down two and down 20 from a year ago  For all rigs  including natural gas  the week s total fell by 12 to 775

99832,321347,BKR,Crude Prices Could Remain Range Bound For Another Year,opinion,"View crude oil fundamentals at face value reveals a product that has overwhelming supply and solid demand  Crude oil stocks are currently at 80 year highs  and are is no sign that they are poised to decline  Rig counts have been declining which has historically been a telltale sign that prices are poised to rally  but production has not been decreasing  The catalyst that will allow prices to move higher are declining production and imports  but a stronger dollar will likely bring headwinds 
Crude oil prices have been trading in a  25 per barrel range for all of 2015  and this range will likely persist for the foreseeable future  Traders are aware that stocks are well above the most recent highs and that the trajectory of petroleum stock declines are subdued  Despite this knowledge prices seem to be support above  40  which could be a function of 10  year over year demand for distillates 
November is maintenance season  where refiners prepare for the winter season and change over production after cranking out large sums of summer grade gasoline  During this period  refiners reduce their draw on crude oil and pull stocks from gasoline and diesel made during the summer  This allows crude oil stocks to build until winter demand kicks in 
Production in the latest month actually increased according to the most recent estimate by the Energy Information administration  According to the EIA  U S  production increased by 48K per day in the week ending October 30  This comes despite a decline in the Baker Hughes  N BHI  drilling index which saw a decline of 6 oil rigs in the latest week which was the 10th straight week of rig count declines  The number of oil rigs are now at the lowest point since mid 2010  If production is increasing  there are at least some producers who believe that  44 dollar crude oil is profitable 
With rigs declining and demand increasing one might believe that prices could have a chance to dent the large surplus of crude oil stocks  Unfortunately  a dollar headwinds could keep prices capped  Since crude oil prices are quoted in U S  dollars  a rise in the greenback makes crude oil more expensive in other currencies  This increase in expense needs to be countered by a decline in prices for demand to remain constant  Friday s stronger than expected jobs report boosted the greenback and higher yields are likely to continue to help the dollar remain in favor  A stronger dollar could continue to cap crude oil prices allowing a  62  37 range to hold for another year ",2015-11-09,David Becker,https://www.investing.com/analysis/crude-prices-could-remain-range-bound-for-another-year-270746,270746
99833,321348,BKR,The Keystone Deception,opinion,"President Obama never had any intention of approving the Keystone Pipeline  In a cruel manner he kept TransCanada waiting for a decision regarding the pipeline while in reality the president was stalling as he lacked the courage to be honest and kill the pipeline because he feared a negative political backlash from unions and the American people all of whom supported the building of the pipeline 
Instead he mislead the American people claiming that his opposition to the pipe was due to its route across the Ogallala Aquifer  He said that Keystone was a threat to the aquifer that provides drinking water to millions of people even though science proved the claim was ridiculous that one pipeline could risk the entire Ogallala Aquifer  Even if you did have a spill from what was going to be one of the most the safe and technologically advanced pipelines built in the U S   it was proven that in the unlikely event of an incident  impacts would be localized to as little as ten feet 
The real issue to killing the pipeline project came to the forefront and that Obama s opposition to oil sands  So the president wasted taxpayer money on a State Department study to buy more time so he did not have to announce his pre determined killing of the pipeline  Even though the report showed that Keystone wouldn t impact carbon emission levels at all  Not only that  it said that most or all of that Canadian oil will likely be produced anyway  But it did not matter because the President is desperate to secure a legacy he really needs and being a green president is what he wants  Yet in the end Obama hid behind Secretary of State John Kerry who said the project is not in the country s national security interest and would not be helpful in global warming talks even though without this project the overall environment is at more risk because all this oil will move via rail tanker cars which is more dangerous than underground pipelines 
In the meantime OPEC countries are meeting at an Asian ministerial energy roundtable in the Qatari capital of Doha and perhaps Saudi Arabia is seeing light at the end of the tunnel  Dow Jones reports   Oil prices may rebound as investments will be durably cut worldwide  Saudi Arabia s deputy oil minister says  Just like expectations in 2008 that prices would rise to  200 a barrel were proved wrong  so the recent assertion that the oil price has shifted to a new low structural equilibrium  will also turn out to have been wrong  
Reuters is reporting that the oil market is expected to become more balanced in 2016 as demand continues to grow  OPEC Secretary General Abdullah al Badri said on Monday ahead of the producer group s policy meeting next month   The expectation is that the market will return to more balance in 2016  We see global oil demand maintaining its recent healthy growth  We see less non OPEC supply  And we see an increase in the demand for OPEC crude   Badri said  according to the text of the speech published on the OPEC website  Most of the oil supply increases in recent years have come from high cost production  Badri said  in a clear reference to supply sources such as U S  shale oil   The market is now taking on board this new reality and gradually resetting itself  as we can see with falling non OPEC supply growth and stronger demand   he said 
The UEA is still doubling down  According to Dow Jones   OPEC won t change its current strategy and cut output despite slumping oil prices  The strategy took shape last year when the group opted not to cut its output to prop up prices  arguing that such Action would only subsidies higher cost competition   When you are the least expensive oil you should be the base producer   oil minister Sohaila Al Mazrouei said at a conference in Abu Dhabi  arguing that higher cost producers like shale oil companies should cut back instead 
This comes as China oil demand continues to stay strong  Dow Jones said that China reported its October crude imports dropped 5 7  from a month earlier but were up 9 4  from a year earlier  The strong annual import growth largely reflects crude inventory build up and high refinery activity taking advantage of the low prices 
U S  oil rig counts continue to fall  The U S  rig count fell for the 10th week in a row dropping 4 rigs from last week to 771  with oil rigs down 6 to 572 and gas rigs up 2 to 199  The U S  rig count is down 1 154 rigs from last year at 1 925  with oil rigs down 996  gas rigs down 157  and miscellaneous rigs down 1 rig  The U S  offshore rig count is 32  down 1 rig from last week and down 21 rigs year over year  The U S  oil rig count dropped by six to 572 in the latest week  the 10th  consecutive week of declines  according to Baker Hughes  N BHI  Inc  There are now about 64  fewer rigs from a peak of 1 609 in October 2014

99844,321359,BKR,Markets Having A Bit Of A Gamble On China s Improvement,opinion,"Asian markets seem to be reacting positively to improved sentiment around China and less US dollar strength  The Chinese PMIs seemed to have eased fears that the economy would collapse while the US nonfarm payrolls  NFP  numbers have pushed back the likely date of a rate rise by the Fed into 2016  This has seen a weakening in the US dollar  particularly benefitting commodities priced in US dollars and commodity exporters like Indonesia whose currency rallied 2 3  today  The drop in the US Baker Hughes  NYSE BHI  oil rig count to its lowest level in five years on Friday was also a boost for oil and oil exporters 
There looks to be a beginning of a  China is not doomed  rally in Hong Kong  which bodes well for the reopening of the mainland stock markets on 8 October  The improved NBS and Caixin PMIs released last Friday seemed to have eased concerns that China was spiralling into financial collapse  The delayed response to China s monetary easing and fiscal spending plans finally seems to be showing up in the data  But the recent catalyst that has driven up a number of stocks in Hong Kong is the announcement to cut taxes on car purchases  lower the down payment on home loans  and support the Macau economy 
These policy changes have been a particular boost to the auto  property and casino sectors in the Hang Seng and Hang Seng China Enterprise Index  HSCEI   Macau related casino stocks surged more than 10  in both Friday and Monday s trade due to news that China would do more to support Macau s economy  China s anti graft campaign have hit the former Portuguese entrepot s economy hard  There is also a huge new Cotai ferry terminal that is due to be finished in 2016  which will help boost tourist numbers  The news similarly saw ASX listed Crown Ltd  ASX CWN  rise 9 8  over the past three days 
The Hang Seng Index was up 0 3  earlier in the day with casino stocks continuing to see strong gains closely followed by energy stocks  The HSCEI was up 0 7  with consumer staples and consumer discretionary sectors both rising over 3  
Japan s markets have seen a boost on the improved outlook for the Chinese economy as well  Fishing  agriculture and forestry related stocks all rallied strongly on the TOPIX today  perhaps indicating some high expectations around the signing of the Trans Pacific Partnership  TPP  agreement today 
The TPP is highly beneficial for Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe s Third Arrow program of productivity increases  It provides him with a fulcrum from which to push back against Japan s entrenched interest groups that have held back reform  Abe has made some major wins against Japan s famously over protected agricultural sector  although he s set for some difficulty in getting these passed 
The Nikkei 225 has surged past the key level of 18 000  rising 1 5   with telcos and energy seeing the strongest performances 
ASX

Oil s good performance also helped boost energy stocks  with the sector rising 0 7   Worley Parsons Ltd  OTC WYGPY  saw some of the biggest gains of the day rising 8   and AWE Ltd  ASX AWE  also performed well rising 3 6  
The banks also supported the index with a strong showing rising 1 1  
The Reserve Bank of Australia  RBA  left rates unchanged at its meeting today as was widely expected  The statement itself was also mostly unchanged  The most significant change was the RBA acknowledging that housing regulations are starting to have an effect 
 Regulatory measures are helping to contain risks that may arise from the housing market  
Despite every economist surveyed stating their expectations for rates to be left on hold  the Aussie dollar rallied 0 5  off the release  Although ongoing concerns about the Australian economy continued with the trade deficit widening to  3 1 billion ahead of estimates for  2 4 billion

On Friday the U S  Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the American economy had created 142 000 jobs in September  a figure that was 50 000 jobs short of analysts  expectations  Furthermore  the new jobs figure for August was revised downward  from 173K to 136K  Even if this was initially seen as negative news for risky assets  their prices were up by the end of the day since investors had concluded that the U S  Federal Reserve will not raise its key interest rate in 2015 
On Friday Baker Hughes  NYSE BHI  reported the largest weekly decline in its active drilling rig count since April  The figure fell from 838 to 809  In comparison  the company had reported close to 2 000 active rigs in October 2014  Clearly U S  producers cannot maintain current production levels with oil selling at US 45 per barrel

99855,321370,BKR,Crude Oil Faces Diverging Fundamentals,opinion,"Oil prices consolidated on Monday as diverging forces kept black gold within a relatively tight range  Conflicting fundamentals are keep prices buoyed  as current inventories within the United States are now at 80 year highs  While demand is strong and U S  production is declining  there seems to be a plethora of producers globally who are willing to fill the void  Last week China released its trade numbers which showed a 17  drop in imports  Hidden within those numbers was the Chinese oil import numbers which shows that the world s second largest economy is stock piling cheap oil  China s crude imports increased in September rising to nearly 28 million metric tons compared to 26 59 metric tons in August  The report issue by the Chinese Customs Department showed a nearly 9  increase month over month to an equivalent of 6 8 million barrels a day 
Imports into China during the first 9 months of the year increased by 8 8  year over year to nearly 250 million tons  At the same time  Chinese refineries in September increased processing rates to a 3 month highs  This allowed additional storage space which assisted in the process of further stockpiling  The latest estimate of inventories in the United States show that stocks of crude oil are at 80 year highs  Production on the other hand continues to slide in the United States  Not only did the EIA report a drop in production  but Baker Hughes  N BHI  confirmed the drop with a reduction in rig count during the latest week  According to Baker Hughes  the oil rig count dropped by 10 to 595  the lowest seen since July of 2010  The company also reported that the combination of natural gas and oil rigs dropped to the lowest level since May 2002  This comes as demand remains solid  According to the EIA  total products demand over the past month increased by 1 2   Gasoline demand over the past month was 9 1 million barrels per day  up by 3 4  year over year  Distillate fuel product  which includes products such as heating oil and diesel increased to 4 0 million barrels per day up by 5 4  year over year and jet fuel demand increased 5 5  year over year 
The current overhand of crude oil supplies is generating a large headwinds for prices that appear to want to move higher  The question that remains for traders is whether the drop in production in the United States will be offset by imports  With demand on the rise  the winter season will also play a large role  Cold weather will drive heating oil demand around the globe  and specifically on the east coast of the United States 
The technical outlook shows that crude oil prices are consolidating  and the tight range makes it difficult to trade  Prices continue to bounce off of support near the 20 day moving average at 46 42  Resistance is seen near the October highs at 50 96  Momentum is flat with the MACD printing near the zero index level  Traders will likely need to wait for a break above resistance or below support to trigger a new move in prices ",2015-10-19,David Becker,https://www.investing.com/analysis/crude-oil-faces-diverging-fundamentals-268552,268552

99891,321406,BKR,Oil Trading Alert  Support Zone Continues To Keep Declines In Check,opinion,"Trading position  short term  our opinion   Short positions with a stop loss order at  54 12 and initial     target price at  35 72 are justified from the risk reward perspective 
Although crude oil moved sharply lower after the market s open  the commodity reversed and rebounded as the combination of a weaker greenback and bullish Baker Hughes  NYSE BHI  report supported the price  As a result  light crude bounced off its key support zone once again  but did this move change anything in the short term picture of the commodity 
Although Friday s data showed that the U S  unemployment rate remained unchanged at 5 1  in the previous month  the U S  Labor Department reported that the economy added 142 000 jobs in September  missing expectations for a 203 000 increase  Additionally  average hourly earnings were flat in September  missing forecasts for a 0 2  rise  These disappointing numbers  raised uncertainty over whether or not the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates before the end of the year  which pushed the US dollar index sharply lower  making crude oil more attractive for buyers holding other currencies  On top of that  Baker Hughes report showed that U S  oil rigs fell by 26 to 614 for the week ending on Sept  25  It marked the fifth straight weekly decline and the sharpest drop since the week ending on April 24  Thanks to these circumstances  light crude bounced off its key support zone once again  but did this move change anything in the short term picture of the commodity  Let s examine charts and find out  charts courtesy of   

From this perspective  we see that crude oil closed another week under the 38 2  Fibonacci retracement and the upper black line  a potential right shoulder of the head and shoulders formation   which suggests that further deterioration is just a matter of time 
Having said that  let s focus on the very short term changes 

In our   we wrote the following 

    the key resistance zone was strong enough to stop further improvement  which resulted in a sharp decline  With this downswing  light crude came back below the previously broken blue support resistance line  invalidating earlier breakout and slipping to the 50 day moving average  Without a doubt these are bearish signals  which suggest lower values of the commodity in the coming days 

Looking at the daily chart  we see that oil bears pushed the commodity lower after the market s open  as we had expected   which resulted in a drop to the blue support zone  As you see on the chart  may times in the past weeks  this key support was strong enough to stop further deterioration and trigger a rebound  On Friday  history repeated itself once again and the commodity bounced off this area  approaching the upper border of the blue declining trend channel  What s next 
Taking into account the fact that the Stochastic Oscillator generated a buy signal  we think that oil bulls will try to push light crude higher in the coming day s   In this case  the initial upside target would be around  46 25  where the blue resistance line is 
Finishing today s alert  please keep in mind that even if the commodity increases from here  we believe that as long as light crude remains under the key resistance zone created by the 38 2  Fibonacci retracement and the previous highs  and reinforced by the bearish evening star formation   further rally is not likely to be seen 
Summing up  crude oil bounced off the blue support zone once again  the upper border of the declining trend channel keeps gains in check  Additionally  light crude closed another week under important medium term resistance levels  which suggests lower values of the commodity in the coming week  This means that the outlook for crude oil remains bearish and short positions continue to be justified from the risk reward point of view 
Very short term outlook  bearish Short term outlook  bearish MT outlook  bearish LT outlook  mixed with bearish bias
Trading position  short term  our opinion   Short positions with a stop loss order at  54 12  yes  that far as the medium term outlook is unlikely to change as long as crude oil stays below the declining medium term resistance line  and initial     target price at  35 72 are justified from the risk reward perspective  We will keep you   our subscribers   informed should anything change ",2015-10-06,Nadia Simmons,https://www.investing.com/analysis/oil-trading-alert:-support-zone-continues-to-keep-declines-in-check-267137,267137

99920,321435,BKR,Oil  Copper Pares ECB Induced Gains  Gold Weak Into Non farm Payrolls,opinion,"Talking Points 
Rally due to European Central Bank s QE expansion quickly subsided before Non farm Payrolls
Oil sensitive to macro  awaits employment data and subsequent  moves
bearish coming up to US data
Gold saw progressive outflows  expects volatility with USD swings
The European Central Bank monetary meeting yesterday eluded to increase the size  composition  and duration of its quantitative easing program  This led to an instantaneous rally in equities and commodities  although momentum quickly subsided and position covering took over ahead of Non farm Payrolls data and a long US weekend 
The Federal Reserve will factor this employment data into the timing of rate lift off when they meet on September 16 17  A good number would affirm sustainable economic growth therefore support an early rate rise and boost the US dollar  leading to a drop in commodity prices 
Copper and aluminum pared the ECB induced gains  after copper closed at the highest since August 10  The metal has lost the most among major commodities so far amid talks of profit taking before a US long weekend and China coming back from holidays next week  There is little fundamental upside prospect for copper at present as it is strongly attached to a slowing Chinese economy  hence prices may react more negatively to any US dollar rally than other commodities 
In recent days  oil has proven to be extremely sensitive to macro events  It joined equities to test the upside after ECB s President Draghi struck a dovish tone yet quickly cooled down to sideways moves in Asia s trade  This completely mirrored the crash to rebound on September 2 upon a multi year low China manufacturing gauge 
Therefore oil prices will take cues from the market s interpretation of Non farm Payrolls today and swing in reverse to subsequent USD moves  A weekly oil rig count by Baker Hughes  NYSE BHI  also contributes to volatility ahead 
Gold stayed flat during Asian session and interests had waned daily ahead of employment data  despite lowered expectations for an early US rate rise  Chances for a September increase had progressively reduced in the past three weeks since China devalued its currency and given recurring equity rout  Hence Non farm Payrolls data is thought to drive the US dollar more than a shift in Fed s decision  as such ensuing gold volatility may be lesser than previously expected 
GOLD TECHNICAL ANALYSIS   Gold dropped below 38 2  Fibo and currently lingers on the lower end of yesterday price band with low volatility  Momentum signals clearly indicate further declines with a firm support level at 23 6  Fibo at 1109 3  Chances for  to climb back above 1132 are slim except for a severe rally  The gold bears may place short term trades ahead

Crude oil prices fell on Monday and continue to drop early on Tuesday as China reported disappointing export and import figures from August with importing goods such as oil getting hit hard  August exports fell 6 1   slightly lower than the 6  expected and imports slumped 14 3   compared to an expected 8 2  drop  The trade surplus came in at  60 24 billion  better than the  48 2 billion seen  Weak imports suggest exports in the coming months aren t likely to improve given that half of China s foreign trade is in importing raw materials and parts from abroad for assembly before exporting them again  In the U S  industry research group  Baker Hughes  NYSE BHI   said late Friday that the number of rigs drilling for oil in the U S  decreased by 13 last week posting the first weekly decline in seven weeks  Oil traders will be focusing on Wednesday s inventory data from the U S  along with economic data from the U S  that could indicate the future direction of the dollar

99954,321469,BKR,Oil Prices Feel The Heat From Rig Romp,opinion,"Oil prices continue to feel the heat from a rise in US rig counts and seasonal weakness but is finding some support near the yearly lows  Oil sank after Baker Hughes  NYSE BHI  said the US oil rig increased by 6 to 670  Of course when those rigs probably started up oil was in a different world as hopes that the worst was over brought out that entrepreneurial spirit  Yet the recent plunge in price should lead to a future drop in oil rigs and U S  oil production will start to slide 
Oil prices are also worried about China and while the Shanghai Composite started strong by closing higher  Chinese exports fell 8 3  from a year earlier and imports were also down by 8 1  
Reuters News reports that the Lundberg survey reports that the average price of a gallon of gasoline in the United States fell 11 cents in the past two weeks  Regular grade gasoline fell to an average price of  2 71 per gallon  according to the biweekly survey dated Aug  7  down 11 cents from the previous survey on July 24  Gasoline is down 81 cents a gallon from the same year ago period  according to the survey  This comes after the Energy Information Administration report that U S  refineries are running at a record high  The EIA says that gross inputs to US refineries exceeded 17 million barrels per day  b d  in each of the past four weeks  a level not previously reached since EIA began publishing weekly data in 1990  The rolling four week average of US gross refinery inputs has been above the previous five year range  2010 14  every week so far this year  The record high gross inputs reflect both higher refinery capacity and higher utilization rates 
Lower crude oil prices and strong demand for petroleum products  primarily gasoline  both in the United States and globally  have led to favorable margins that encourage refinery investment and high refinery runs  Refinery margins are currently supported by high gasoline crack spreads that reached a peak of 66 cents per gallon  gal  on July 8  a level not reached since September 2008 
The EIA say that for the past several years  distillate crack spreads have consistently exceeded those for gasoline  but since May  this trend has reversed  From 2011 to 2014  distillate crack spreads  calculated using Gulf Coast spot prices for Light Louisiana Sweet crude oil  conventional gasoline  and ultra low sulfur distillate  averaged a 24 cents gal premium over gasoline crack spreads  Since May 20  Gulf Coast gasoline crack spreads have averaged 17 cents gal higher than for distillate crack spreads 
Higher demand for gasoline is supporting these margins  Total US motor gasoline product supplied is up 2 9  through the first five months of 2015  and trade press reports indicate that demand is also higher in major world markets such as Europe and India so far this year compared with 2014  Total U S  petroleum product supplied  a proxy for demand  is up 2 5  through the first five months of the year compared with 2014  Much of the refinery output is reaching global markets  as net exports are 19  higher this year through May 
Support is building in congress for a lifting of the US oil export ban  The Wall Street Journal reports that  Big voices in the oil industry and Congress now support a move that would have been unthinkable not long ago  opening the U S  oil industry to exports   Bloomberg Reports that House legislation that would end the 40 year ban on the export of domestic crude oil will receive a floor vote this fall  Rep  Joe Barton  R Texas   the bill s sponsor  told Bloomberg 
The legislation  H R  702   which has 113 co sponsors  including 13 Democrats  has been gaining momentum as booming domestic oil production and low gas prices have led lawmakers to question the need for the policy enacted in the wake of the Arab oil embargo   We ve got green lights in the House all the way   Barton said in a phone interview   The whip  the majority leader  the speaker are all on board to move the bill   While House leadership has committed to bring the bill to a vote  Barton said it remains unclear if the bill will move as stand alone legislation  which he prefers  or as an amendment to broader energy legislation expected to be marked up by the House Energy and Commerce Committee and brought to the floor in September 
 They have committed to support the bill and bring it to a vote   Barton said of House leadership   I have every expectation President Obama will sign it  
The trade prohibition  which applies to most U S  oil exports but not refined products like gasoline and jet fuel  is opposed by oil producers such as ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP  and Marathon Oil Corp  NYSE MRO   House Speaker John Boehner  R Ohio  joined a growing chorus of lawmakers calling for it to end  telling reporters in July doing so would be  a big boost to the economy    America is experiencing an energy boom  and our policy needs to follow suit   he said

99955,321470,BKR,Crude s Carnage To Continue And Break The 2009 Low,opinion,"There has been near capitulation in the commodity markets that closely resembles what happen in 2008  as the back drop of global growth worsens and the US dollar maintains its strength 
Economically driven commodities  such as iron ore and copper  are making multi year lows  Lumber  which is closely related to the U S  housing sector  is retesting current cyclical lows 
Yet  everyone on Wall Street is surprised that crude is re approaching longer term price support of  42 per barrel  just above oil s inflation adjusted price of  41 70  
What was a hedge fund s go to levered carry trade  the unraveling narrative of global demand has made life hard for traders 
Crude trader Andy Hall  who has been referred to as  God  by fellow traders  lost his grace and quickly fallen to Earth  Unable to break the Wall Street frame of mind  Hall s Astenbeck Capital lost  500 million  or 17 percent on trades that went sour  and that was just in July 
In February  after calling crude s cycle low  rebound  and then subsequent lower low  I wrote 
 A bottom in crude will not likely begin until fundamentals mingle with price action  Inventory builds of 5  6  10 million barrels per week will not help the case for higher prices  and oil companies could be forced to further slash rigs  jobs and CAPEX  And considering the deteriorating economic data  more so in the US  2009 s low could be retested  
Fundamentals have not changed at all  U S  oil production is still extremely high  The Energy Information Administration  EIA  reported that the week ending on July 31  oil production rose 52 000 barrels to 9 465 million barrels per day  which is a 12 percent increase from last year s corresponding time frame 

The Baker Hughes  NYSE BHI  rig count has fallen tremendously from the 2014 highs  but a large portion of those rigs going offline were unproductive  The industry is operating with the lowest rig count since 2010  yet U S  field production is the highest it has been since 1985 
In the past two weeks  rigs have been coming back online  Cash strapped shale companies need all the revenue they can muster  Today  two barrels of crude need to be pumped just to equal the revenue of one barrel pumped back last November  The ongoing production is the only way the majority of these shale producers can stay afloat 
The U S  shale industry is a bubble made possible by none other than the Federal Reserve  With their quasi monetary policy experiment  the ultra low rate policy  known as ZIRP  allowed shale companies to issue debt almost at will 
When the Fed announced their quantitative program for the thrice time in 2012  energy production in the U S  exploded higher  Instead of going through the proper financing channels  these shale producers went into the high yield market and issued debt  lots of it 
Nearly the whole industry s debt to EBITDA  pick your favorite metric  is atrocious  Around the turn of the year  when crude first shocked Wall Street  credit spreads gaped to over 1 000 bps  almost double high yield market spread  The financial media pundits promised it was just noise  However  as crude begins to retest price support  spreads once again have widened to 1 000 bps 
It will get worse  The last act of desperation  oilfield service giants Schlumberger and Halliburton  NYSE HAL  are looking for new revenue streams  and for some odd reason they want to take on the role of lenders ahead of a potential industry credit crunch 
As reported by Reuters  the two industry giants look to offer lending to cash stricken companies and  essentially  take stake in wells  In some cases  up front costs could be provided while well performance is tied into repayment  or potentially lack thereof  Make no mistake  what happen to gold producers following the retraction of gold prices will take place in the oil industry 
Companies will have to continue to slash operating expenses and deeper cuts in CAPEX could take place just to survive  Expect large integrated oil companies to devour assets as consolidation takes place 
On a market technician s viewpoint  if fundamentals do not shape up quick with support from consumption economies  like the U S  and China  crude could break 2009 s low of  33 20 per barrel I also expect the dollar to continue to rise  increasing deflationary pressure throughout 2016 
Price support is currently  42 02  just  2 22 per barrel less from where it is trading today  2008 s high of  147 27 per barrel creates a  V  shaped support and resistance price channel  which will likely hold prices 
If prices break through this key support level  selling could amplify if there is no catalyst to bring prices back north  A  demand  zone   an area where confirmed buying took place   between  38 34 and  34 04 will be the last line of defense for crude prices 
A close below this level  and a target of  27 14 per barrel is initiated ",2015-08-11,Chris Lemieux,https://www.investing.com/analysis/crude's-carnage-to-continue-and-break-the-2009-lowhere-has-been-near-cap-261311,261311
99956,321471,BKR,Better Times Ahead For Oil  If You Can Believe It,opinion,"Things will get better because they can t get worse  We re at or near the bottom  Better times ahead 
But you d never know that based on oil prices or the news  WTI dropped more than 3 percent on August 11  hovering near prices not seen for more than six years  since the dark days of 2009  The commentary is universally bearish  Everyone from analysts to oil company CEOs are saying what you see is what you get for the foreseeable future  Comparisons to the great price collapse of 1986 and the 15 year nuclear winter that followed are again making headlines  It s not awful  it s worse 
Numerous challenges exist  Every day there s yet another reason why oil prices will never increase or economic conditions improve  Iran  China  Greece  Global inventories  OPEC overproduction  Rising North American rig counts  Carbon taxes  Corporate tax increases  Royalty reviews  No pipelines  The news is so depressing  more are saying this downturn is the worst ever  although there is significant evidence to the contrary 
This is not new  What the industry has always done is extrapolate  whatever happened yesterday will continue  If things are good  they always will be  If it is bad  it will remain so forever  After 36 years of writing about the always volatile oilpatch  the only constant is the herd is usually wrong  regardless of the direction it is headed 

There are two buckets of information essential to reaching a reasoned independent analysis  Bad news first 
  The modern oil industry has never operated without Saudi Arabian or OPEC supply management  When prices went too low  the Saudis would always withdraw output to stabilize markets  In 1986  the Saudis shut in over 5 million barrels per day to get crude back to US 18  Today the Saudis claim to seek market share  not price  OPEC production in July was reported at 31 5 million barrels per day  b d   1 5 million above its June 5 quota of 30 million b d  This is about 2 3 million b d above stated OPEC internal demand for 2015  The specter of Iran increasing production  if its nuclear inspection agreement is ratified  weighs heavily on market sentiment 
  Commodity prices as a group   oil  potash  iron ore  coffee  and copper   are at lows unseen since early this century  This is made worse by a strong U S  dollar  Hedge funds specializing in commodities are losing money and shrinking as profits become more elusive  The futures market for oil is very bearish  WTI five years out for September 2020 was only US 61 80 on August 7  reflecting the fact that nobody figures the price of oil is going anywhere and no speculative investors are taking risks 
  Future oil demand is in doubt for three reasons 
1  China  the world s second largest economy  has serious financial problems  the long term impact of which are as yet  unknown  For years  the mantra was China s growth would power demand for oil and other commodities  The party is over  China s stock market problems are in the news  while enormous and unsustainable internal debt should be 
2  Governments in most western countries unquestioningly link oil consumption with climate change and are taking steps to ensure consumers use less  We re told daily the future of mankind depends on using less oil 
3  Western government economic stimulus via near zero interest rates and quantitative easing have run their course and can no longer stimulate meaningful economic growth  This affects commodity demand and price 
  The replacement cost of tomorrow s barrels seems unknown  Current production is thought to be impervious to price  Because of legacy investments  output is rising in the oilsands and the Gulf of Mexico  Very little oil has been shut in because cash operating costs are at or below current prices  Thanks to aggressive drilling  Saudi Arabia is able to sustain record output  123 rigs drilling in July 2015  up 50 percent from July 2012 according to Baker Hughes  NYSE BHI    Based on bad data or miraculous geology  U S  shale output is reported to still be rising despite a 60 percent reduction in the number of rigs drilling for oil  The Baker Hughes U S  oil drilling rig count was up only 52 rigs to 670 on August 7 from a multi year low  Yet somehow this is proof U S  shale production will not experience any material declines soon 

  The Canadian political climate is depressing but hopefully not hazardous  Alberta s 20 percent corporate tax increase on July 1 resulted in over  1 3 billion in Q2 book losses by only three large producers  Canadian Natural Resources Limited  TO CNQ   Imperial Oil Limited  TO IMO  and Suncor Energy Inc  NYSE SU   Billions more will follow  While the losses are largely non cash for now  the optics are awful  The federal election has opposition parties claiming a lack of carbon taxes and environmental protection legislation are the reasons no pipelines have been approved  In Alberta  the outcome of the pending royalty review and a new environmental policy appropriate for a 21st century NDP government are not confidence builders 
Hide the sharp objects  This is a big batch of misery for today s battered oilpatch  But there are also some positive aspects 
  With the exception of oilsands mines  all reservoirs yield less oil tomorrow than today  Typical decline rates for the best conventional reservoirs is 3 to 5 percent per year and the output of most shale oil wells falls 50 percent or more in the first year  At 4 percent globally  this is 3 8 million b d at current world oil production of 96 million b d  Announced capital expenditure cuts are estimated at US 180 billion over the next few years  This will have a meaningful impact on future supplies  The International Energy Agency  IEA  estimates average annual investment on new crude output from 2010 to 2013 was US 320 billion  If the recent Capex cuts are over three years  it equates to an annual investment decline of about 20 percent  this rises to 50 percent if the cutbacks occur over the next 15 months  Regardless of why current output remains high  the global oil and supply demand curves simply must and will cross in the not to distant future 

  Comparisons of the current situation to the mid 1980s remain ludicrous  When oil prices collapsed in 1986 and remained low in real terms for 15 years  world oil supply exceeded demand by about 14 million b d  This was nearly 25 percent of world demand of 60 million b d  The current surplus of supply over demand is about 3 million b d  or 3 percent  The IEA reports Q2 production was 96 million b d but demand will reach 95 million b d in Q4 of this year and 96 4 million b d in Q4 2016  Depending on production increases  the surplus will fall to 1 million b d then zero  This is nothing like the situation in the mid 1980s and to suggest otherwise is uniformed and irresponsible 
  Rig counts are rising in the U S  and Canada because they must  The rise is not meaningful compared to historic levels but are a reminder of several factors  oil companies must drill to stay in business  cost and technical efficiencies always emerge when they become essential  and every reservoir and the economics of its development are different  In the U S   how putting 42 of 981 laid down drilling rigs back to work will sustain or increase 4 million b d of shale oil production is difficult to conceive 
  Canada is the fifth largest hydrocarbon producing jurisdiction in the world  on a barrel of oil equivalent basis  The oil industry is a major driver of the Canadian economy and a big reason why North America remains a global economic island in terms of its long term energy costs  People will figure this out  including voters in the October 19 federal election 
  The next market turn will be dramatic and it will be up because it can t go down  The current mantra is  for the first time in recent history and without supply management  see above   somehow crude oil is the only commodity that will trade in a narrow and predictable band when supply and demand reach equilibrium  Every other commodity without the supply management that oil has enjoyed for over four decades is very volatile 
There is likely no good news in the short term  the next couple of months  that is  Prices may go lower again based on market sentiment  Keep the faith 
In the medium term the next six months  hopefully there will be growing stability and confidence if federal and provincial politicians don t do anything really awful 
But the long term looks good  The herd is wrong again and global oil supply and demand will prove it ",2015-08-13,OilPrice.com,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/better-times-ahead-for-oil,-if-you-can-believe-it-261517",261517

Copper lost 1 percent Asian noon time and rivaled oil as the day s biggest commodity loser  after a sixth weekly decline at  0 2 percent  China copper importers typically buy in US dollar to sell to domestic market in yuan without foreign exchange hedge  Although copper import activity largely paused during the currency moves last week  buyers will now absorb the shock and demand may grow weary 
Gold steadied after Friday s reversal from its monthly peak  as China revealed it had added 1 1 percent to gold reserve in July  While currency devaluation faded  bearish calls on gold re emerged as the US dollar is back in favour ahead of the Federal Reserve s September rate meeting  The Fed s minutes of its last meeting will be released on Wednesday 
 GOLD TECHNICAL ANALYSIS   Gold s peak and subsequent reversal late last week coincided with a downturn in momentum signals  Gold is now biased to the downside with a weak support level at 5 day moving average at 1113 36  The bears may watch out for opportunity to short gold at rallies toward last week s high at 1126 63 

 COPPER TECHNICAL ANALYSIS   The daily chart shows copper on another day of sideways movement capped between 20 day moving average at 2 386 and a floor at last week low of 2 292  There is still no signal for a resumption of downtrend since it was disrupted in early August  As momentum indicators remain rather flat  this correction period in copper may prolong and limit bearish trades 

 CRUDE OIL TECHNICAL ANALYSIS   Today WTI oil paused ahead of yesterday fresh multi year low at 41 60  Its downtrend signal remains firm so this support will be the level to watch in the next few sessions  With momentum signals already below their lower bound of the usual range  upcoming declines may materialize rather gradually  Resistance level is found at 5 day moving average at 43 13 ",2015-08-17,Dailyfx,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/oil-at-fresh-low-on-persistent-supply,-dollar-pressures-commodities-261831",261831

99961,321476,BKR,Is This The Best Play In U S  Oil ,opinion,"E P companies have added 30 horizontal rigs in the Permian basin since the end of June  Most analysts didn t notice  Figure1  

Figure 1  Tight oil horizontal rig counts since January 1  2015 
Source  Baker Hughes  NYSE BHI    Labyrinth Consulting Services  Inc  click image to enlarge 
Rig counts in most active plays are stabilizing after falling more than 50  since November but companies are adding rigs in the Permian like there s a boom going on  Last week the total U S  rig count was unchanged but 7 new horizontal rigs were added in the Permian  In fact  rigs were added in each of the last 7 weeks there 
There have been a lot of silly pronouncements since oil prices collapsed about how rig counts don t matter anymore  Pad drilling and extraterrestrial advances in rig efficiency have made rig counts a meaningless measure  Also  the backlog of deferred completions allow companies to add production without adding new rigs  So we are told  But rig counts matter because they show where capital is going  When a rig contract is signed  major cash follows and usually  for a long period of time 
When capital in the oil business is scarce  a counter flow of 30 new rigs into one play says a great deal about how company executives view that play  30 new rigs in the Permian basin means more than  200 million in capital expenditures if all the rigs are released after drilling just one well and no further spending occurs as a result of the drilling 
Since rig counts began falling in November 2014  there have always been more rigs in the Permian than in any other tight oil or shale gas play  Figure 2  

Figure 2  Tight oil and shale gas rig counts as of August 14  2015  Source  Baker Hughes   Labyrinth Consulting Services  Inc 
 click image to enlarge 
More rigs have also been released in that play than in any other  Still  there are more than twice as many rigs drilling in the Permian as there are in the Eagle Ford Shale  and almost three times as many as there are in the Bakken play 
Rig count is how company executives vote on the plays 
We may hear great things about the potential of the Utica Shale but it s in the lower third for rigs and  therefore  capital  Studies proclaim that the Barnett and Fayetteville core areas are commercial at current gas prices but almost no one wants to put rigs there and spend money  Even the mighty Marcellus is a distant fourth in rig count behind the Permian  Eagle Ford and Bakken 
There is a reason and it is profit or the perception of profit and rig count is how we know the score 
For plays like the Eagle Ford and the Bakken  the best leases were taken long ago  If you don t have a position  the only way to get one is to buy or join someone else at a premium  e g   Devon and Encana in the Eagle Ford  
But the Permian is different  It is an old producing basin whose glory days were decades ago until tight oil technology came along  As a result  the land situation is complex and fragmented and there is usually a way to get in on a lease or a play with a good landman and enough money 
There are multiple pay horizons in the Permian whereas  in the Eagle Ford and Bakken there is basically only one pay zone  In a comprehensive study done in 2000  Shirley Dutton of the Bureau of Economic Geology identified 32 different oil plays from 1 339 significant reservoirs in the Permian basin and each reservoir with cumulative production greater than 1 million barrels of oil 
The Bakken and Eagle Ford are dominated by a dozen or so substantial public companies but in the Permian  there are hundreds of operators  many of whom are small and privately held  and some that are without access to the major capital required to be a shale player  To put it bluntly  the Permian is a great place for tight oil have nots to find a home  Deals can be made in the Permian 
How Good Is the Permian Basin Anyway 
EOG Resources  NYSE EOG  and Pioneer Natural Resources Company  NYSE PXD  have strong positions in the Permian basin  Eagle Ford Shale and other shale plays  Their CEOs have very different views on how good the Permian basin is 
EOG CEO Bill Thomas spoke in May 2014 at the Sanford C  Bernstein Strategic Decisions Conference about the Permian basin 
  the Permian is a great place to drill wells  But it s not the play quality  the rock quality and the technical aspects of the play are not nearly as strong as Eagle Ford or the Bakken  And it will not be able to maintain this dramatic growth rate that we have had historically in the country  And it will not be able to replace an Eagle Ford or a Bakken  

Pioneer CEO Scott Sheffield spoke about the Permian basin in August 2013 at the Unconventional Resources Technology Conference  URTeC  in Denver  The Spraberry Wolfcamp could possibly become the largest oil and gas discovery in the world  
So  how good is the Permian  anyway 
The horizontal plays in the Permian basin are not shale plays  They are purely conventional sandstone reservoirs that were discovered decades ago and are now being exploited using horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing 
The recent rig additions in the Permian basin are directed chiefly at the Trend Area and Bone Spring plays  Figure 3  

Figure 3  Permian basin recent rig additions by play for the 6 weeks ending August 14  2015

The Trend Area is located in the eastern Midland sub basin of the greater Permian basin  and the Bone Spring play is located in the western Delaware sub basin  Figure 4

I studied the Bone Spring and Trend Area plays by evaluating well performance for the major operators in each play  I used standard decline curve analysis to determine estimated ultimate recovery  EUR  by operator for wells with first production in 2012  2013 and 2014 
My analysis suggests that Bill Thomas has the more accurate assessment of the Permian basin based on reserves and economics for these two leading plays  In other words  it s not as good as the Eagle Ford or Bakken but it s a pretty good place to have a position for when oil prices are higher 
The average well EUR for the major operators in the Bone Spring play is 205 000 barrels of oil equivalent  boe  and  in the Trend Area  140 000 boe  Costs are comparable to the Eagle Ford Shale and there  the break even EUR is 350 000 boe at  70 barrel WTI oil price  full cost economics but not including land   The difference is that  in the Eagle Ford  there are significant areas with EUR greater than 350 000 boe  Fewer than 1  of Bone Spring wells and no Trend Area wells meet this criterion 

Bone Spring Evaluation
In the Bone Spring play  I evaluated wells by Concho  Devon  Cimarex  EOG  Mewbourne and Yates  Results are summarized in Table 1 

Table 1  Bone Spring EUR  estimated ultimate recovery  summary table showing oil  gas and barrels

Concho had the best average well performance followed closely by EOG  and Yates had the worst  Overall  well performance was fairly consistent among the various operators with weighted average EUR only varying 12  above and below the mean by the highest and lowest performing company 
Average well performance improved about 40  in 2014 compared to 2012 and  for Concho  Devon and EOG  average well performance improved by about 70  
The decline curve trend matches were generally excellent for the Bone Springs  Figure 5  providing a high level of confidence in the EUR values shown in Table 1

Trend Area Evaluation
In the Trend Area play  I evaluated wells by Apache  NYSE APA   Energen  Encana  Laredo  and Pioneer  Horizontal drilling in the Trend Area does not have as much history as in the Bone Springs so only 2013 and 2014 data were available to evaluate and  for some operators  there was only 2014 data  Results are summarized in Table 2

Encana had the best average well performance and Pioneer had the worst  Overall  well performance was less consistent for Trend Area operators than for Bone Spring operators with weighted average EUR varying about 25  above and below the mean by the highest and lowest performing company 

Apache s average well performance improved about 27  in 2014 compared to 2013  and Pioneer s wells improved 15   Laredo s average well performance decreased by 26  The decline curve trend matches were generally fair for the Trend Area  as shown in Figure 6  providing only a moderate level of confidence in the EUR values shown in Table 2

 The best places to find oil are in places where it s already been found  
 recently published average well EUR for the Bone Spring play as 676 boe  If you believe that number  there is no mystery about why companies are adding rigs in the Permian  Let s assume for now that I am closer to the truth than Simmons  they don t explain the source of that EUR  
Neither the Bone Springs nor the Trend Area are commercial unless oil prices return to  100 per barrel using full cost economics  Even using phony shale half cycle economics  prices have to be much higher than anyone s forecast for the next several years Here are the players who have contracted rigs in the last few months

Most of the companies are relatively small independents whose sole business is the Permian basin  Many don t have access to enough capital to compete in the real shale plays  Or maybe they were never really sold on shale  and are more comfortable with a good old fashioned sandstone reservoir  But  if you re selling a prospect that has horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing  it sounds enough like a shale play to attract some capital 
Of the larger independents  Oxy  Concho and Apache are Permian focused companies  The others Pioneer  Devon  EOG and XTO are companies with relatively strong balance sheets and diverse unconventional portfolios that are able to bet on the future 
The Permian basin probably has the lowest risk of all the tight oil plays because its reservoirs are purely conventional and there are multiple stacked pay intervals all charged with oil because the basin s petroleum system is among the best in the world 
The Permian basin has been a large scale enhanced oil recovery  EOR  project since I began my career in the oil business almost 40 years ago  The basin is blessed with more than 1000 high quality reservoirs and cursed because most of them have limited lateral continuity  For all the oil that s been found  there is an undrained reservoir volume a stone s throw from wherever you are  Horizontal drilling may be the holy grail to unlock those tens of billions of barrels that are stranded in real reservoir rock and not in a source rock like shale 
Perhaps that is Scott Sheffield s vision for the Permian basin 
If you ve bet your company on unconventional plays and the plays are not economic today  there are really only two choices  go out of business or double down on the opportunities you have and hope that higher prices will save you  The Permian  where the reservoir is not shale  may end up being the best tight oil play out there for the long term ",2015-08-19,OilPrice.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-this-the-best-play-in-u.s.-oil-262122,262122

99992,321507,BKR,Rude Awakening For Those Who Ignored The Energy Markets  Warning Signs ,opinion,"Back in February  numerous equity investors refused to believe that a crude oil recovery was likely to be unsustainable  Many viewed this as a buying opportunity   just as they did in 2011 when such  bottom fishing  strategy worked   Look at the declines in oil rigs   many argued   US crude production is about to dive  Even some in the energy business were convinced that crude oil recovery is coming  and we will be back at  70 bbl in no time  It was wishful thinking 
There is no question that North American production of crude oil is stalling  However  for now  it remains massively elevated relative to last year 


 More importantly  many fail to understand just how flexible US crude production has become   the time to bring capacity on off line has shrunk dramatically  Furthermore  a great deal of production in the US is now profitable at  60 bbl and even lower as rig efficiency rises  Many view this as unsustainable because new exploration is halted and existing wells are being reused  But there is enough staying power here to continue flooding the markets for some time to come 


 The ability to bring capacity back online quickly is the reason we saw US rig count unexpectedly increase last week  This creates a natural near term cap on crude prices  above which production can rise quickly 

 To add to the market s woes  the Iran deal threatens to bring materially more crude into the market in 2016  while immediately releasing a great deal of stored crude the nation currently holds 

 Moreover  the Saudis are ramping production to record levels  as the OPEC members are left to fend for themselves  The Saudis will attempt to recover some of the lost revenue with higher volumes 

 Crude prices in the US fell below  50 bbl in response to some of these developments  So much for the  recovery  

 All of a sudden  as investors realize that crude oil price recovery could take years  energy firms  particularly those focused on exploration and production  upstream   don t look that attractive  The chart below shows the relative declines of the overall energy sector as well as the upstream companies  shares over the past year  down 29  and 51  respectively  

 And even those who were betting on the M A activity providing support to share prices are having second thoughts  now that the Baker Hughes  NYSE BHI  acquisition by Halliburton  NYSE HAL  may face challenges 

 To make matters worse  many energy firms continued to borrow as prices declined  With no recovery in sight  credit markets are becoming much less forgiving  In traded credit markets  for example  we see spreads widening out again   with oil services and equipment getting hit particularly hard 

 The US energy industry is undergoing its most challenging period in decades  and for many firms  the worst is yet to come ",2015-07-26,Sober Look,https://www.investing.com/analysis/rude-awakening-for-those-who-ignored-the-energy-markets'-warning-signs-259450,259450

99994,321509,BKR,Pessimism Amongst Oil Traders Reaches 5 Year High,opinion,"With oil prices hitting their lowest levels since March  a renewed sense of gloom has washed over oil markets  and with it  fears over deeper trouble for U S  shale companies are spreading 
After hitting  43 per barrel in March  oil prices jumped to  60 per barrel by May and then stayed around that level for almost two months  raising confidence that a rebound was underway  albeit at a slow pace  A few companies  including EOG Resources  NYSE EOG   Pioneer Resources  Occidental Petroleum  NYSE OXY   and Diamondback Energy  suggested that they were considering stepping up rig counts and drilling activity this year on the heels of stronger oil prices  Having weathered the worst  drillers had cut costs and planned on bouncing back with gusto 
But the optimism is a thing of the past  WTI dipped below  48 per barrel on July 27  not far from the March lows  The low oil prices will likely force a fresh round of layoffs across the shale patch  Halliburton  NYSE HAL  and Baker Hughes  NYSE BHI  have  27 000 jobs combined  twice as much as they originally announced in February  according to the Wall Street Journal  Months ago job cuts were centered on rig workers and other blue collar jobs at drilling sites  but now the layoffs are moving up the food chain  hitting engineers and scientists  Usually that is something companies try hard to avoid  for fear of losing irreplaceable talent 

The renewed downturn is also sparking pessimism among oil traders  In recent weeks speculators have taken the most bearish position on oil in years  Net long positions on oil   betting that crude prices will rise    by 28 percent for the week ending on July 21  The ratio of long to short positions for hedge funds dropped to 1 7 to 1  down from 4 to 1 over the past three months  In fact  net long positions are at their since 2010  In other words  speculators are the most pessimistic about oil prices than they have been at any point in the last five years 
With hedging positions expiring  more companies will lose their protection and suffer from low prices  And unlike earlier this year when banks and equity markets were eager to provide cash injections into battered shale companies  betting on a rebound  financial lifelines are not as generous or as accessible as they were just a few months ago  New loans are coming with onerous interest rates  For some of the weakest companies  access to credit could soon be cut off entirely 

If traders are right and oil prices do not rebound soon  more oil companies could be in trouble  On July 15  Milagro Oil   Gas  a small oil company based in Houston  announced that it has  for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection  On the same day  fellow Houston driller Sabine Oil   Gas also filed for bankruptcy 
Even the oil majors are making big time cutbacks  From the largest oil companies alone  more than  on new oil projects have been cancelled or suspended  according to a new Wood Mackenzie report  Those 46 projects account for 20 billion barrels of oil reserves  Many of the projects are large scale offshore projects located in the Gulf of Mexico and off the coast of West Africa  but also high cost onshore fields  such as Canada s oil sands  These projects require large upfront costs  require complex engineering  and take years to develop 

Royal Dutch Shell  LONDON RDSa  is expected to  fresh spending cuts this week  slashing several billion dollars off of its  33 billion spending plan released in April 
Deferring projects today makes sense as oil companies try to plug deep holes in their balance sheets  But it also raises the question over available supplies over the long term  Cancelling projects now will  create a substantial hole in the industry s investment pipeline   the Wood Mackenzie report

99997,321512,BKR,4 Key Signs Low Oil Prices Are Here To Stay,opinion,"Though the price of oil managed to climb back to  60 a barrel from a low of  40  it has now fallen back under  50  Will oil prices recover as quickly this time around  Four key financial and economic factors indicate that a recovery is not in the cards anytime soon 
1  Job Cuts  Energy firms like Halliburton  NYSE HAL   Baker Hughes  NYSE BHI   Chevron  NYSE CVX  and ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP  are announcing layoffs and making plans for jobs cuts later this fall  Idling wells  postponing projects  and laying off contract site workers are all appropriate responses to a short term drop   and firms made these cuts almost immediately after OPEC s decision to cut prices in November 2014  This time around  however  the layoffs are hitting geologists  engineers  and corporate headquarters  meaning cuts are hitting the strategic and long term plans of the company  Chevron plans on eliminating 1 500 jobs worldwide along with an additional 600 contractor positions  Oil service companies Halliburton and Baker Hughes recently announced that they actually cut double the number of jobs they had previously anticipated cutting  and ConocoPhillips plans to lay off personnel this fall  These are not just signs of a temporary scale down in operations but rather serious corporate belt tightening designed to cut costs for the long term 
2  Iranian Oil  The ink on the nuclear deal is barely dry  but stored Iranian oil has already left the Persian Gulf for African customers  Although Iran s oil industry will take significant investment and time to return to full export capacity  the expectation of growing Iranian oil exports on top of an already overwhelmed market will continue to depress oil prices  especially from speculation  Even if American oil production continues its incremental decline  the constant trickle of news about foreign investment in Iran s oil industry will keep speculator oil prices depressed well past Iran s planned oil and gas investment showcase in December  2015 
3  Loans and Credit Lines  Wall Street banks are pressuring oil companies to raise more equity or make serious changes to free up additional cash now  all in anticipation of the biannual reevaluation of credit lines and loans coming in October 2015  Even large firms like Chesapeake Energy  NYSE CHK  must face up to this reality  Chesapeake recently announced it would eliminate its annual dividend  This move freed up  240 million but also sent share prices tumbling to 12 year lows  This kind of pressure from banks is a significant departure and indicates that those controlling the purse strings don t have much confidence in oil prices generating profits for oil companies 
4  Saudi Arabian Refineries  This oil giant does not seem to care what the price of oil is  It just keeps on pumping  selling  and more importantly  refining away  Saudi crude oil production rates remain at record levels  but the real sign that low oil prices are here to stay is the growth of Saudi Arabia s domestic refining sector  Rather than simply export all that low priced crude oil at low market value  Saudi Arabia is keeping significant amounts of its expanded crude production at home to refine into gasoline  diesel  and petrochemicals   all at its new facilities inside the Kingdom  Cheap oil is a boon for the refining industry  and Saudi Arabia is now well positioned to take advantage of that  Given the extent of its investment in downstream facilities  the Kingdom views refining as a long term moneymaker ",2015-07-30,"Ellen R.

99999,321514,BKR,Commodities Hit By Demand Jitters After Soft China Trade Data,opinion,"Talking Points 
Gold halted decline post Non farm Payrolls
Oil fell as U S  producers added rigs
Copper hit fresh low on concerns of China demand slowdown
China trade data was released on Saturday with an all around slump in trade surplus  imports and exports  This deepened threats that demand from China may slow down in the foreseeable future sent commodities prices down together with commodity currencies  China is the world s largest consumer in copper and gold  and presently  the biggest crude oil importer 
Gold halted its week long decline in the US session  as investors took profit on long USD bets after Non farm Payrolls  NFP  data  The solid NFP and Average Hourly Earnings further affirmed projections for a September rate hike  The upside of gold remains capped  however  as zero yield gold will likely lose out to yielding assets as interest rates  normalize   or returning to higher levels before a cycle of quantitative easing 
Gold held steady in morning Asia trade at the smallest drop among other major commodities  still weighed down by China data 
Copper hit a fresh six year low at its opening in the Asian morning  and has since recovered modestly to scale down the loss to 0 28 percent  Prices of other industrial metals also dropped 
An oversupply in copper and uncertain demand from China heightened its bearish outlook  Copper stockpiles in Shanghai jumped 11 percent last week  Statistics from the U S  Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed that investors put on the most bearish bets since April 2013 
Oil prices declined on a fourth day as U S  producers continued to add rigs amid a global supply gut  Baker Hughes  NYSE BHI  rig count presented a third weekly increase with 6 extra rigs  Weaker demand growth and oversupply continues to push oil prices downward and prolong a bear market for oil 
GOLD TECHNICAL ANALYSIS   Gold extended the upside today with further recovery indicated by momentum signals  The 1071 1109 range still captured daily price action  however  The gold bears may look to sell rallies up to the upper bound of 1109 8 or 20 day moving average at 1103 5  A break of the 20 day moving average would be an early sign of a rebound and that prices have bottomed out  otherwise  gold prices will likely remain in a sideways fashion

In general  judging from overnight swap quotes  the first since 2006 rate hike seems more likely  The chance Fed raises the rate at the regular meeting September  17 increased to 52   It is not that high so the growth in dollar price was originally restrained and then the expansion stopped  A higher rate may add to American companies  debt burden  Consequently  this factor has a negative impact on stocks 
S P 500 lost 1 2  last week   at the moment it is traded 1  higher year to date  The aggregate P E  share price to earnings per share  ratio is 16 6   above the 14 7 10 year median value  To be noted  Nvidia graphic card producer shares gained 12 4  due to a good corporate report and the growing demand from expensive gaming computer builders  The American stocks trade volume on Friday was 4  below the weekly average  making 6 7bln shares  No important macroeconomic statistics are expected in the US today  A Fed representative will speak today at 15 00 CET

100030,321545,BKR,Demand Faltering As Supplies Build,opinion,"Welcome back from what I hope was a happy and healthy 4th of July weekend  The market has certainly been shocked out of its doldrums over the past several sessions starting with Thursday mornings US jobs data  While the headline number of 223 K was virtually spot on expectation and the rate was actually lower by one tenth at a reading of 5 3 the number was effectively taken as a negative based on the participation rate plummeting by 3 tenths to 62 6   It is interesting because no one really paid much attention to the participation rate  at least not with this type of vigor   in the past  It really shouldn t have the negative effect that it has been spun into  though the Greeks sitting on the precipice of disaster most assuredly had something to do with the exaggeration of any negative bias 
China continues to show a slowing economy with more negative data having been released and their stock market opening down substantially  This comes on the heels of the aggressive central bank action just a week ago  While China does have a plenty of room for further action with here interest rates at 4 85   it is concerning that the last intervention appears to have had little stabilizing effect  The concern from an energy perspective is that the greatest purchaser of commodities for the past 10 years maybe not able to keep up with that level of demand 
Bearish sentiment is starting to creep in from the demand side with both China slowing and the Greek crisis  Further bearish sentiment is being found on the supply side  Baker Hughes  NYSE BHI  reported on Friday that 13 rigs in the US went back on line  That is following over 20  weeks of declines in rig count  possibly meaning that we could see the shift back to larger supplies as these rigs begin producing  For the past five weeks we have seen WTI crude supplies show less than expected builds and even draws in supplies  We can start to look for some evidence of increased production in the next few inventory meetings 
With crude having finally broken out of its range to the downside we now need to look for support areas below  While there could be some psychological support at the 50 dollar price  look for a retest at some point of the 48 71 low from mid March 
Natural gas continues to struggle to find any sustained rally though has not really sold off much either  While it continues to show signs of strength  the rallies are muted with little follow through  With the dip in crude related products  there could be some renewed interest in natural gas as they two different fuel sources rarely move in tandem  Potential demand question in the WTI can be a positive as natural gas sometimes finds more diligent buyers who are overly concerned with being long the crude

Gold has held above its three month low and gained up to 0 25 percent in Asia trade so far as risks from China and Greece weighed on market sentiment and lowered expectation for higher US interest rates  A decline in the  Index today has also helped to put in a floor for prices  The rebound is a long way from erasing a 0 7 percent decline recorded throughout this week however  Appetite for gold as a safe asset may fade as Chinese equities continue to recover and Greek negotiations progress  All eyes are now on an EU summit on Sunday where officials will discuss Greece s latest bailout proposals

 ZeroHedge  About a month ago  China ran into a small problem 
The country s  world beating  equity bubble   which has served as a wonderful distraction from China s decelerating economy and bursting property bubble   suddenly collapsed 
Starting earlier this year and accelerating into June  when the CDSC channeled its inner Ronald McDonald and cancelled the series  data out of China suggested that semi literate farmers  housewives  and famously  banana vendors  were opening millions of new stock trading accounts each and every month 
Subsequently  analysts began to take a hard look at margin lending  which eventually rose to CNY 2 2 trillion and touched a record 18  of the SHCOMP free float market cap on July 3

The banks have agreed to plead guilty to felony charges of conspiring to manipulate the price of U S  dollars and euros exchanged in the foreign currency exchange spot market  The behavior of these banks is offensive  and signals a Wall Street culture in which several big banks broke the law even after years of strong criticism and increased regulation following the economic crisis

100035,321550,BKR,Crude Oil  Best Performing Commodity Of 2015 So Far,opinion,"Can we really be halfway through the year  That s what my calendar tells me  which means it s time for the 2015 commodities halftime report 
The periodic table of commodity returns  consistently one of our most popular pieces  has been updated to reflect the first half of 2015 

As an asset class  commodities continue to be a challenging space for investors  as they ve faced many headwinds lately  including lackluster purchasing managers  index  PMI  numbers and a strong U S  dollar 

Crude Pulls off Coup but Faces Strong Downward Pressure
The widest expansion this year was made by none other than crude oil  the worst performing commodity of 2014  As of June 30  oil posted gains of over 11 percent  rising to  59 47 per barrel  After falling more than 50 percent since last summer  though  it had nowhere else to go but up  That oil claimed the top spot just highlights the reality that commodities are in a slump right now  
Case in point  This week  West Texas Intermediate  WTI  retreated to  50 per barrel  putting it back in the red for the year  This move was largely in response to Greece s debt dilemma  China s slowdown and weakening PMI numbers  After the JPMorgan  NYSE JPM  Global Manufacturing and Services PMI was released  showing a continued downtrend in manufacturing activity  oil almost immediately dropped  4  The lifting of sanctions on Iran  if approved by Congress  could also place downward pressure on WTI  with some analysts seeing it returning to the  40s range 
As the 800 pound commodity gorilla  China greatly contributes to the performance of oil  Its own PMI reading remains below the key 50 threshold  indicating that its manufacturing sector is in contraction mode  This has a huge effect on the consumption of oil and other important commodities 
The good news is that the projected crude price for the remainder of 2015 should be high enough to support continued production in drilling areas such as the Bakken  Eagle Ford and Permian basins  according to the Energy Information Administration  EIA   The oil rig count  as reported by Baker Hughes  NYSE BHI   has advanced for the third consecutive week  after 29 straight weeks of declines  
King Corn Pops to the Top
We all know that corn is in practically everything we eat and drink  from soda to bread to salad dressing  It s fed to livestock and poultry and used to make ethanol  plastic  glue and more  The grain is so ingrained in our lives that the U S  government subsidizes it to the tune of  4 5 billion a year 
For this reason and more  American farmers favor corn  In 2013  a record amount of it was grown and sent to market  which resulted in a price decline of 40 percent  That year  it was the worst performing commodity 
Since then  corn has found its footing and  as of June 30  returned 4 28 percent 
Zinc Is Flying off Car Lots
Sought for its anti corrosive properties  zinc is staging a comeback and is set to make its longest run of gains in over a year  according to Mineweb 

The reason  Accelerating automobile sales in Europe  Zinc can be found in most car parts  from tires to door handles  and because it can store six times more energy per pound than more conventional battery systems  the metal is also used in electric vehicles 
The European Automobile Manufacturers Association reports that demand for new vehicles is up 14 percent year over year in June  its largest increase since December 2009  New car registrations in most European markets are seeing double digit growth  with Portugal  Spain  Ireland and the Czech Republic leading the pack 
Gold Demand in China Sparkles
In a much anticipated announcement  China broke its six year silence on the amount of gold its central bank holds  And although the number jumped nearly 60 percent from 1 054 tonnes in 2009 to 1 658 tonnes  it underwhelmed the market  as many analysts had expected almost double the amount  Bullion fell to a fresh five year low on Friday  while stock in Barrick Gold  NYSE ABX   the world s largest producer  plunged to a level not seen since the Bush Administration the elder Bush  that is 
But other news out of China  the largest purchaser of gold  suggests that the yellow metal is still very much on consumers  minds  Just released gold withdrawal numbers from the Shanghai Gold Exchange  SGE  came in at 1 180 tonnes a huge amount setting a new record for withdrawals in the first half period and leading many analysts to predict a new annual record 

Gold demand in China normally cools around this time before picking up momentum in anticipation of the Chinese New Year  That demand has held up so well is a good sign for the second half of the year 

Morningstar Ratings are based on risk adjusted return 
The Morningstar Rating for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three   five  and ten year Morningstar Rating metrics  Past performance does not guarantee future results  For each fund with at least a three year history  Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating based on a Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund s monthly performance  including the effects of sales charges  loads  and redemption fees   placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance  The top 10  of funds in each category receive 5 stars  the next 22 5  receive 4 stars  the next 35  receive 3 stars  the next 22 5  receive 2 stars and the bottom 10  receive 1 star   Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately  which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages  
Gold  precious metals  and precious minerals funds may be susceptible to adverse economic  political or regulatory developments due to concentrating in a single theme  The prices of gold  precious metals  and precious minerals are subject to substantial price fluctuations over short periods of time and may be affected by unpredicted international monetary and political policies  We suggest investing no more than 5  to 10  of your portfolio in these sectors

100066,321581,BKR,Oil Above  60 As Greek Hope Rises,opinion,"Oil prices rose in early European trading Monday as investors grew optimistic over Greek debt negotiations  though persistent oversupply worries remained a factor for oil markets

Eurozone leaders will try to reach an agreement on Greece s bailout at an emergency meeting today  Failure to reach an agreement could put Greece on the road to bankruptcy and exit from the euro  officials have warned in recent days  Any major currency swings as a fallout of the debt talks would impact commodities prices  including oil 
Meanwhile  excess oil production continues to pressure oil prices 
The Atlantic Basin remains flush with unsold oil cargoes despite strong summer demand  resulting in some of the weakest prices in years  which is a worrying sign for the market in the fall season  Morgan Stanley s Adam Longson said in a report 
Around 10 million barrels of mostly Nigerian crude and crude of other similar grades is lingering offshore West Africa  he said   Some cargoes are taking more than 3 months to find buyers  and current loading programs are not selling well   Longson added 
Market observers are also keeping an eye on when U S  oil production will show signs of significant declines due to low oil prices  The U S  oil rig count fell by four to 631 in the latest week  according to Baker Hughes  NYSE BHI   marking the 28th straight week of declines

100067,321582,BKR,Baker Hughes Counting Rigs For A Push Higher,opinion,"Baker Hughes  NYSE BHI  does pretty much anything and everything related to drilling for oil and gas anywhere  They are involved everywhere  That is why they are the ones that count the active rigs  Since they are somehow involved with everyone  they have an accurate count  And those who follow the count have seen it plummet over the last 12 months 
Baker Hughes stock price also did some plummeting  but not nearly as bad as more oil sensitive stocks  It showed up on our radar at the start of April as a possible reversal candidate  From the chart below  you can see it did break out and run higher through April  only to pullback 

That pullback has continued until Monday  but now it might be time to dip your toes back into the stock  The stock closed last week back at the falling trend support  was resistance in April  that it launched above nearly 3 months ago  And what happened  Both Friday and Monday printed bottoming candlesticks and the price is moving higher Tuesday  confirming a reversal 
The RSI is also turned back higher and rising  while the MACD is trying to level and turn higher as well  With a higher low in place  you could use the falling trend line as a stop  giving a great reward to risk ratio  even if it only gets to the top of the Bollinger Bands  near 66

100069,321584,BKR,China Rate Cut Does Little For Energy Demand,opinion,"In what appears to be a fairly dramatic move  China cut its lending rate and cut the reserve capital that banks must hold in an effort to reinvigorate their lagging economy  This is the first time that China has moved on both measures at the same time  possibly a signal that their aggressiveness in easing should clear the way for further cuts throughout the year  particularly if there is little reward from this action 
To be fair  the Chinese interest rate picture has room for this type of intervention with the overnight rate now at 4 85   Theoretically  this should have an affect on the demand for commodities  though most likely it will be balanced out by the US bias towards near future tightening  
On Friday data on rig counts was release by Baker Hughes  NYSE BHI   showing 3 rigs went offline last week  This data is continuing to be monitored to attempt to ascertain when the bottom is in from a production standpoint here in the US  While the rig count declines have slowed by the least in weeks  overall they are still shrinking  This would seem to indicate that even though demand is relatively high  it is not necessarily enough to support full production out of the US  
Of other interest to the energy complex is that the US showed record high exports for the month of May for condensate  an ultra light crude that is legal for export  While it is currently not legal for the US to export its WTI crude for the most part  this could lead to further discussion about any change to the landscape of global crude oil trade rather significantly  
Natural gas remains stuck in neutral as any rallies have been cut off either technically or through diminishing fundamentals  Last week did show a third week in row of less than expected builds in inventories which put the surplus significantly lower than it was last year  However  this alone has not been enough to catapult the commodity out of the range it has been mired in for several weeks now  between 2 70 and 3 00  Utilizing writing of options to bring in some premium for the right risk profile could be advisable in an effort to earn some premium while waiting out the sideways action  Disclosure  Trading commodity futures and options involves substantial risk of loss and may not be suitable for all investors ",2015-06-29,Tory Enerson,https://www.investing.com/analysis/china-rate-cut-does-little-for-demand-256611,256611

100071,321586,BKR,Oil  Is That A Downward Breakthrough ,opinion,"After close to three months in a range of  56 to  62 per barrel  WTI crude is tradingon Monday under  55  This week we will be watching to see if a downward breakthrough from this range will materialize  It should be noted that even if commodities were traded brieflyon Friday  there was no official close due to Independence Day in the United States 

This recent drop in crude prices was spurred by Baker Hughes  NYSE BHI   announcement that the number of active drilling rigs in the U S  had increased for the first time since December  However  the change was only from 859 to 862

The loonie recently lost some ground  For various reasons  it has fallen by close to 3  over the last two weeks  The end result is that the change in prices for fuel  paid for in Canadian dollars  has eroded our purchasing power  Our currency should also be watched closely over the next few weeks  since fuel prices in Canadian dollars could be impacted by another even larger depreciation

100094,321609,BKR,Crude Oil Searching for Direction,opinion,"The WTI crude market continues to remain tethered to the 60 dollar price level trading slightly lower throughout the holiday session and into the US morning markets  The Memorial Day holiday was uneventful from a market perspective as participation was very limited  as expected  Today s session does feature a glut of market data that could have significant impact on price discovery across the commodity spectrum  Durable goods and housing data should speak to the demand factor as continued optimism needs to be verified by economic data 
The 60 dollar price magnet of late has led to many US producers ramping their production back up according to Goldman Sachs  As shale production comes back online due to better pricing and modified production cost structures  we could find that renewed focus on supplies may once again drive the price discovery  As the decline in price forced many shale producers to reduce their online rigs  Fridays Baker Hughes  NYSE BHI  rig count data showed only one new rig going offline  This slowing trend appears to be the precursor to a fundamental shift that could bring more of the significant US sidelined rigs back into the fray 
In other supply side news  it seems that the China National Petroleum Corp  CNPC  has made a major discovery of a new  untapped source of crude that could  once developed  change the landscape of Chinese import export ratios  With China being the largest energy importer globally  any change in her foreign dependence could have an impact on demand side price discovery  though this fundamental factor most certainly won t be felt in the market until further out in the future 
Traders are looking for a litany of different information to gauge when and where the price discovery will move next  As with any market  the coiling tighter pricing begs for a break out in one direction or another  Analysis of fundamental developments is the most important factor  though when the fundamentals become stagnate  many traders will start to look to relationships across commodity sectors for possible indications of future market direction  These inter commodity relationships can be tentative at best  warranting a warning in getting to fixated to the tick for tick nature  Consider how fickle the relationship between the US dollar and crude oil pricing can be  Currently we are seeing  due to lack of individual and new fundamentals  an inverse correlation drive pricing  when the dollar rises the crude sells off   While this can be helpful in the moment  it is difficult to divine any real market direction based on this fleeting phenomenon 
Natural gas has somewhat unexpectedly declined over the long weekend  seemingly in a reaction of the past several weeks attempts at a significant rally  With the market currently trading in the mid 2 80s  it would seem likely that further follow through to the upside could be had following today s option expiration and rollover to the July contract  Natural gas tends to march to its own fundamental beat as weather and seasonal influences play a much larger role in its pricing and can  therefore  rend itself almost completely form the direction of the energy complex as a whole  Midterm pricing should  following this test to the downside  find new life to the upside once the natural pressure of expiration is in the rear view mirror ",2015-05-26,Tory Enerson,https://www.investing.com/analysis/crude-oil-searching-for-direction-252938,252938

For US energy prices the market continues to focus on the important Baker Hughes  NYSE BHI  rig count data that on Friday showed another 13 rigs were taken off line  This comes on the heels of last week s only 1 rig count decline that left some thinking that the bottom was in with respect to US shale production contraction  The market did  however  take this data in stride and remains within the recent tight range with the WTI continuing to hover around 60 dollars 
Russia continues to plead its case to the global market as her oil minister urged other sovereignties to be wary of raising production based on the recent resiliency of the price action  This comes just a few days before the meeting with OPEC where it is widely held that the Federation  Russia  will attempt to persuade OPEC to reduce  or at least freeze  their production  It is also widely assumed that this request will fall on deaf ears as OPEC and  more specifically the Saudis  have consistently stated there will be no cuts lest it be a global unilateral effort  Fundamentally the market would seem to have to wait until the June 5th decision from OPEC is made official before finding and impetus for a breakout in either direction 
The natural gas contract made its possibly final gasp to the downside in the early morning hours trading down to 2 60 before rebounding sharply into positive territory at 2 65  Last week s better than expected build in inventories and a colder than expected front across the central US have left the contract somewhat deflated after the recent surge above 3 dollars  Traders are looking for a reason to buy at these near historic levels as the market seems to be poised for an eventual sharp trade higher  though currently downward pressure is winning the price discovery battle

OPEC announced that it will not be changing its production quotas  keeping them at 30 million barrels per day  The latest figures show that member countries have been producing 31 5 million barrels per day  so they are falling short of full compliance  Production by cartel members has reached its highest level in close to three years 


OPEC has decided not to give up any market share to non OPEC countries  this was also the message it delivered after its last meeting  Given how energy markets responded on Friday  we can safely assume that prices were already fully reflecting OPEC s position

Fiserv  NASDAQ FISV 
Fiserv  FISV  has been a strong stock  moving higher since May last year  Since February though it has consolidated in a symmetrical triangle pattern centered around 79  The price recently fell through the 50 day SMA and has since recovered  Other touches and recoveries at that measure have yielded substantial moves higher  The RSI has held in the bullish range thus far and is pointing higher  while the MACD is about to cross up 
Interactive Brokers Group Inc  NASDAQ IBKR 
Interactive Brokers  IBKR  moved higher out of consolidation in September with a couple of stair steps of consolidation recently  The latest pulled back through the 50 day SMA  a catalyst in the past for this name as well  Now it is at resistance and has support for a break higher from the RSI which is rising and has remained in the bullish zone  and the MACD which crossed up on Friday

Up Next  Bonus Idea

After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad Market Macro picture reviewed Friday which  heading into the last week of April  sees the equity indexes looking strong on the weekly timeframes and a bit mixed on the short term view 
Elsewhere look for Gold to continue lower while Crude Oil rises towards a major character change area  The US Dollar Index looks to continue to consolidate the large move higher while US Treasuries are biased lower in the short term in their uptrend  The Shanghai Composite and Emerging Markets are biased to the upside with risk of the Chinese market becoming overheated at any point 
Volatility looks to remain subdued keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETF s ARCA SPY  ARCA IWM and NASDAQ QQQ  Their charts all look higher ion the weekly timeframe but on the daily timeframe the QQQ may be a bit stretched while the IWM and SPY test resistance but with some strength  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

100130,321645,BKR,Oil  Once Insatiable Levels ,opinion,"We all remember when oil prices reached  once upon a time  high levels  But prices have been falling for nearly a year now and it was only during the last month that we observed how the uptrend led to diverging opinions among analysts as to whether this period is over or is it only a correction where oil will drop again  The relentless price war really caused many changes in the market in terms of supply  demand  and the way in which the common trader looks at trading oil  Unlike what we saw last month when it was safe to say that traders do not know how to behave with the black gold  today we can see a movement which is a bit more technical and less based on fundamental data  Yet  the question remains   should I sell or should I buy  There is no doubt that this is indeed a very difficult question to which the right answer will definitely be worth a lot of money  It would involve a number of factors on which one must look at to get the answer  Last week we saw how oil prices surged 1 8  to a price of 59 6 dollars per barrel  The price jumped by 25  last month due to assessments about a slowdown in U S  manufacturing  This is the sharpest monthly leap since May 2009  According to OPEC  oil production rates in the U S  would rise in the second quarter of 2015 to an average of 13 65 million barrels per day  This increase would already brake in the following quarter  and from there  it s a long way down  The decline in oil production is a direct result of the decrease in rigs and oil wells  According to data of the information society in the field of oil Baker Hughes  NYSE BHI   the number of rigs and active oil wells last counted May 1st in the United States shrank to 905  and is expected to fall further during 2015  Via a technical view we can see how oil reached closer to the 23 6  fibs level on a weekly chart  which is around  60 a barrel  And as we saw earlier  it is now not only a matter of a fundamental data but technical as well  So the 38 2    68 9  level seems like a reasonable 1st target price to place  
For most traders we know how the market tend to react based on fibs levels so that 50    76 2  would be the 2nd target to place   Although we can see how technical it is to get the black gold back on the truck  that does not necessarily mean this will be the case  The main concern remaining at this point is the fact that with the increase of oil prices during this past month  many investors may like to cut on losses and will close their long positions   which could cause another sharp drop on the prices that were just starting to stabilize to around  55 a barrel after dropping over 60  during the past months 
So  once more  should I buy or should I sell 
Personally  until oil reaches the 38 2  fibs level  I buy ",2015-05-04,Roni Stern,https://www.investing.com/analysis/oil:-once-insatiable-levels-250571,250571
100131,321646,BKR,Crude Rally About To Sputter  ,opinion,"There is a distinct possibility that the recent oil rally is about to run out of steam  We have two potential issues on the horizon for crude markets  1  The physical oil market seems to be facing challenges resulting in a disconnect from the futures market  We ve seen this movie before  and it doesn t end well 
    Tens of millions of barrels are struggling to find buyers in Europe with traders of West African  Azeri and North Sea crude blaming poor demand  The deep disconnect between the oil futures and physical markets looks similar to the events of June 2014 when the physical market weakness became a precursor for a futures price crash   Being large physical buyers of crude we have a direct pulse of the market and feel immediately when it is well supplied  as is happening now   Dario Scaffardi  executive vice resident and general manager of independent Italian refiner Saras  told Reuters   In the short term  futures prices do not necessarily reflect accurately the physical market    via  MarathonWealth   GreekFire23 

2  While US oil rig count continues to decline     the recent price increases have been sufficient to bring some rigs back online  US oil production has stopped growing but so far it is  and remains significantly above last year s levels

100132,321647,BKR,Americans Take 3 Trillion Mile Road Trip As Dollar Corrects ,opinion,"The busy summer travel season is at our doorstep and with that comes stronger fuel demand 
Back in March I shared the fact that Americans drove a record 3 05 trillion miles on U S  highways in January 2015 for the 12 month period  with even more expected this year  Now the International Air Transport Association  IATA  revealed that international passenger traffic in March  from the same time a year ago  Except for Africa  every region around the globe recorded year over year increases in air traffic  Last week  West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude oil prices reached a 2015 high  rising above  60 before cooling to just below that  It marked the eighth straight week of gains  Investment banking advisory firm Evercore makes the case that the recent oil recovery is closely following the average trajectory of six previous cycles between 1986 and 2009  Although no one can predict the future with full certainty  this is indeed constructive for prices as well as the industry  Because oil remains in oversupply  the recent rally owes a lot to currency moves  The U S  dollar  which has weighed heavily on commodities for around nine months  declined to its lowest point since mid January  We might be seeing a dollar reset  which should finally give oil not to mention gold  copper and other important commodities much needed breathing room  The oil rig count continued to drop in April and is now at a five year low  According to Baker Hughes  976 rigs were still operating at the end of the month  down 11 percent from 1 100 in March and 47 percent from 1 835 in April 2014  Eleven closed last week alone  This spectacular plunge has had the obvious effect of curbing output and helping oil begin its recovery from a low of  44 per barrel in January  Production appears to have peaked in mid March at 9 42 million barrels per day and is now showing signs of rolling over  As I ve mentioned before  price reversals have historically occurred between six and nine months following a drop in the rig count  The number of rigs operating peaked in October and oil started to bottom in January  Even though domestic oil inventories still stand at near record levels according to the Department of Energy s  they re at their highest level for this time of year in at least 80 years the rate at which storage facilities are being filled is beginning to slow  For the first time since November 2014  stockpiles declined at Cushing  Oklahoma  the nation s largest storage facility and the pricing point for WTI  
China Continues to Stimulate Its Economy with Weak PMI Trend
Like oil  select industrial metals are making a welcome resurgence  Both zinc and copper have risen above their 50 day moving averages  with copper staging its strongest rally in about a decade  Besides the dollar depreciation  much of this growth derives from the hope that manufacturing in China  the world s biggest purchaser of copper  is set to pick up  The HSBC China Manufacturing PMI fell for the second consecutive month in April to 48 9  which indicates contraction in the manufacturing sector  But global investors and commodity traders are optimistic that China s central bank will launch a fresh round of fiscal stimulus to spur purchasing and manufacturing  I ve observed in the past that the Asian country is quick to respond to economic indicators such as the purchasing managers  index  Because of its ubiquity in building construction  electronic products and transportation equipment  copper is a useful barometer of economic growth  Several mining companies that have exposure to the red metal are performing well year to date  Colorado based Newmont Mining Corporation  NYSE NEM  is up 38 percent for the year  Australia based Northern Star Resources Ltd  ASX NST   40 percent

100133,321648,BKR,Is The Rally Done ,opinion,"The recent rally in the crude markets appears to be running out of steam as the price action is once again trading just below 60 dollars in the WTI contract  The petroleum energy markets always seem over shoot their fair pricing and this could be the set up of a good example of that possibility  While there have been some bullish developments in shifting supply data  global unrest and reduced rig counts in the US  the overwhelming global supply of crude has not changed much  Consider that the major consumers like China have been using the depressed price to shore up their strategic supplies coupled with speculation that they are close to full if not already full  and you can see that once that pipeline is shut down  some rather large supplies will be left untouched 
The rally has also borne the weight of significant hedgers returning to the market driving the price higher as consumers worry that the return to 75 dollar  or more  crude prices could nullify the recent windfall their respective business have been enjoying with the previous 50  percent declines in product costs 
This analysis juxtaposed against a tightening price discovery the highs for the year could certainly be the beginning of a correction to the correction  A key factor that could push that car over the cliff could come today if Baker Hughes   NYSE BHI  US rig count release shows any indication of rigs coming back into use following this rally 
Yesterdays soft economic data for the US indicted to market participants that any rate hike talk should be relegated to  at the earliest  late 2015 and more likely early 2016  This sent the dollar lower and the indices sharply higher to all time highs  a sentiment that has continued throughout the evening session and into the US open  Confidence and manufacturing data could continue that staggering rally  though it is hard to determine exactly what the market  equity indices  would favor more currently  good economic data or bad economic data leaving easy money on the table longer  The commodities markets seem to be rending themselves from this equation to some extent at these elevated  relatively  prices 
The natural gas report yesterday showed 111 BCF  just under the expectations and it was off to the races to test the 3 00 handle getting as high as 3 02 before leveling off  This has been an expected turn of events with the reaction from here being more difficult to ascertain  Fundamentally  not much has changed in the weather  demand  or supplies  However  the technical reversal from the lows was a very strong indicator lending credence to the idea that this market is trading more technically than fundamentally  If that is truly the case  then the target of 3 25 to 3 30 above would make sense as the price discovery attempts to close the gap it left back in December of 2014

100134,321649,BKR,Opportune Time for Oil And Gas Exposure ,opinion,"Capitalizing on the panicked sell off in junior oil and gas stocks may prove to be a smart move now  as oil prices have recovered some 50  since crashing to  42 barrel WTIC in March  whereas many juniors still trade at relatively low levels   While some experts are still bearish awaiting their earlier forecast of a final drop below  40  others expect oil to recover to  75 in the near term as this level represents global marginal cost of production  Investment banker Angelo Damaskos  Principal Adviser of the Junior Oils Trust  admonished recently 

 The longer oil trades below that price level  we lose supply not only from the North American shale industry  but also from the longer term producing projects  the Canadian tar sands and the Brazilian offshore basins  The oil price has recovered by 20 25  from January s lows but remains 50  lower than last year s highs  As a result  there has been a dramatic drop in income and earnings  which has been met with big cutbacks in capital expenditure  capex  and development drilling  The length of time oil trades below  75 bbl is a clue to how strong the recovery might be once a supply demand balance is again achieved    

 On the other side  dark clouds are put into perspective  In its latest strategy report  OPEC forecasts an oil price at  76 in 2025 in its most optimistic scenario and does not expect oil prices to consistently trade at  100 again in the next decade   The days of oil fetching  100 a barrel are over for the foreseeable future   Qatar s veteran former Energy Minister Abdullah Al Attiyahsaid said  predicting that prices will settle at between  60 70   Last Friday  May 15   Reuters reported Venezuela eying at  100 oil price and dealing with OPEC to boost prices as  it s in the best interest of Venezuela and OPEC for the price of oil to stabilize at 100 dollars in the medium term   said Nicolas Maduro  President of Venezuela   We re currently working on a deal that hopefully can materialize in June regarding an announcement between OPEC and some of the most important oil producers in the world to finish stabilizing the market in the second half of the year   Maduro said after a meeting with Qatar s emir   The International Energy Agency  IEA   and others  indicate oil demand will remain steady and project a slight growth in 2015  Assuming global economic growth has stabilized  demand for oil should remain firm  whereas current low prices may further stimulate demand and buying activity     In consideration of the massive drop of active oil and gas rigs in the US  drilling costs have nosedived accordingly  This represents best time to bring online new production wells  if one speculates demand to remain robust     Latest data from Baker Hughes  NYSE BHI  showed on Friday that the number of US rigs actively drilling for oil fell for its 23rd week in a row  down by 8 rigs for the week to 660     Gas rigs were up by 2 totaling 223 this week     For all US rigs actively drilling for oil and natural gas  the number fell by 6 rigs to 888  the count is down 973 rigs from last year  Myra Saefing from Marketwatch computed      When oil prices crashed in 2008 2009 by 77  from  145 to  34  the number of active US rigs collapsed by 50  from around 2 000 to 1 000 rigs     When oil prices crashed in 2014 2015 by 61  from  107 to  42  the number of active US rigs collapsed also by 50   from same levels   This indicates that some producers may think that the current oil correction is not over yet and should fall to  25 to provide a similar 77  correction like 2008 2009  However  if it turns out that oil prices have ended the correction already  producers are caught on the wrong foot and are likely to come back more aggressive as it was the case in 2009 2010  when doubling their rigs in snatches  Keith Schaefer from oilandgas investments com recently chatted on chat ceo ca 

 It s intriguing to me how all the surprises in the energy market in 2015 have been bullish  Global demand around the world for oil is higher than anyone expected at these lower prices  Another one is the drill rig count in the US   nobody thought the producers would have that much discipline to drop that many rigs that fast  

The rig count   a proxy for activity in the industry   is down 58  since a peak of 1 609 rigs in October  Paul Ausick said on May 9 

 In less than 5 months  the country lost more than half of all its oil rigs  While the number is remarkable  even more remarkable is the speed with which the spigot has been turned off  We may be about to find out how quickly that spigot can be turned back on  

Looking at the impressive rebound of oil prices since March  he interprets this as  the strongest signal yet to producers that demand is returning  and as demand returns so will production   Phil Flynn from Price Futures Group said on May 15 

 As the rig count cut slaughter continues we will see it impact output more and more over the coming weeks and months  

The tide is already turning in the futures market  according to Paul Ausick 

 Hedge funds   under the Managed Money heading in the Commodity Futures Trading Commission  CFTC  Commitments of Traders report   increased their long positions by about 1 500 contracts last week and reduced their short positions by about 7 500 contracts  The decreases reflect changes due to the May 5 settlement date  Managed Money holds 340 604 long positions  compared with 74 294 short positions  Among the producers themselves  short positions outnumber longs  398 478 to 233 630  But the number of new long positions last week was double the number of new shorts  Positions among swaps dealers show 360 469 shorts versus 196 807 longs  Swaps dealers increased their short positions by a total of nearly 17 000 contracts last week  

This appears to be an opportune time to build positions in oil and gas developers and producers  whereas ample focus can be put on companies active in the US and reporting in Canadian dollar  Geoffrey Smith from Fortune recalled last month 

 When a commodity price collapses  it s only natural to see a shakeout among the companies that produce it  The weak go the wall and the strong salvage from the wreckage what they think will make them stronger  

Such statements serve well to look for oil and gas developers  as well as producers  in the red and on the way becoming profitable again with higher prices  and or ready to be swallowed by seniors for peanuts at such low price levels as today   Link to above chart  15 min  delayed   

 The proposed takeover of BG Group  LONDON BG  Plc by Royal Dutch Shell  LONDON RDSa  illustrates the opportunity available to cash rich companies  Shell  like other supermajor  integrated companies  has been suffering from declining reserve life and insufficient production replacement for years  Its 2014 reserves replacement ratio was 49   of which only 17  came from exploration  Meanwhile  its 2014 reserves life index declined to 11 years from 12 3 years in 2013  In the present environment  it is cheaper to buy proven reserves than pursue expensive and risky exploration  British Gas carries substantial debt and had to take huge write downs as a result of the price drop because many of its assets have been impaired  Nevertheless  BG offers Shell very large proven reserves and production in a global portfolio  as well as attractive development projects in emerging regions such as Australia and Brazil  Shell got BG at a very attractive price  and this deal sorts out its declining reserves problem  Shell also gains a much larger global presence and will likely realize savings deriving from the elimination of duplicated functions  Shell expects the oil price to recover to  90 bbl by 2018  So the industry is fairly bullish on long term oil prices  and we expect the pace of M A to accelerate

 Despite the drilling permission  the stock market is not really euphoric yet  The stock rose slightly from 28 to 29 50 euro  However  the stock declined during the week  Maybe the skepticism is still big because the company  like the rest of the industry  is still struggling with the oil price decline since last year  in which time the price halved  The first quarter of this year saw a substantial drop in Shell s profits  The operating profit decreased more than half to 3 2 billion USD  However  this is still 2 5 billion USD more than analysts calculated and expected  The energy giant still has ambitious plans  In this year alone  the company has sold assets worth more than 2 billion USD  In April  the take over of BG Group for 47 billion GBP was announced  By that  a stronger company shall evolve

Data released by the EIA indicates that supply has once again expanded  as U S  commercial inventories have reached their highest level in 80 years  With oil production averaging 9 5 mb d during the week ending February 27  inventories increased by 10 3 million barrels  Further adding to the 444 4 million barrel reserve  crude imports increased by 89K when compared to the previous week 
However  shifts from both global supply and demand indicators have prevented substantial movements to the downside  Libyan oilfield production has been placed in a precarious situation as the actions of militants have heightened concerns over the area s ability to maintain output levels  Furthermore  Baker Hughes  NYSE BHI  latest rig count reveals a combined deficit of 73 active rigs in Canada and the United States 
From a demand perspective  Saudi Arabia raised the price of light oil for April delivery sent to the U S  by  1 00 b and to Asia by  1 40 b  The price increase was announced by Saudi Aramco  the state owned oil conglomerate and bears weight as Saudi Arabia is the world s larger exporter of crude and the largest producer among OPEC nations  The move aligns with OPEC s February report  in which the group forecasted a rise in demand to 1 17 mb d in 2015  up from 0 96 mb d in 2014  The organization also expects supply to slow by 0 20 mb d to a level of 0 85 mb d

100166,321681,BKR,U S  Rig Count Falls Again,opinion,"Even if the price of WTI crude was relatively unchanged on the week  Brent slipped 3   We can nevertheless say that the volatility seen in energy prices over the last few months appears to be gradually dissipating 

On Friday we learned that the number of active oil rigs in the U S  had fallen for a 13th consecutive week  According to the website of Baker Hughes  NYSE BHI   the company has shut down 64 rigs  Since October  the number of active rigs in the U S  is down by over a third  These recent cuts will have a major impact on profits in the energy sector 


The value of the Canadian USD CAD  which plays a large role in the cost of fuel supplies in Canada  fell sharply on Friday in response to the release of strong U S  employment data  Investors now believe that the U S  Federal Reserve may raise rates faster than previously thought 


With energy prices consolidating over the last month and the U S  dollar gaining ground against our own  we believe that it is a good time to budget part of your fuel expanses for next year 

Have a good week

100167,321682,BKR,Thoughts On The Current Oil Market ,opinion,"Crude oil slid into a definitive bear market starting 2H  14  Since most of the oil companies  majors as well as E Ps  based their budget  growth  and strategy trajectory on   50 oil price scenario even for the most conservative  the current    45 WTI price environment has created a crisis situation for many oil and gas producers 
WTI 6 Month Chart
The immediate oil industry response has been reflected abundantly in rig count  Oil rig count has dropped drastically  particularly in the high cost basins such as Permian in W  Texas   New Mexico and problematic transport regions such as the land locked Bakken in N  Dakota  Montana  For example  according to the latest Baker Hughes  NYSE BHI  data  the number of rigs in the once red hot Bakken fell to double digit levels for the first time in at least four years  down 50  from the most recent high in October  2014  Likewise  oil rigs drilling the the Permian Basin also plunged  50  from November  2014 
We probably already learned the main contributors to the steep drop in oil prices include stagnant demand and global economy  rising production  and oil inventories  from U S  shale  and a strong US dollar depressing all commodities priced in dollar  I personally believe these macro economic factors are unlikely to change that much as to lift oil out of the bear market in the next 12 months  Nevertheless  I m going to discuss my views on some other popular oil market related topics 
Saudi Arabia
A decision and or announcement from the Kingdom to cut its production would certainly give an immediate boost to oil s price  However  my observation is that Saudi is dead serious about protecting its market share  and unlikely to cut its production   To illustrate  Taiwan s news media reported that in late 2014  Saudi sent a group of delegates courting one of the two refineries petrochem plants in Taiwan which was the first ever in over 40 years  According to EIA    which explains why Saudi never sent delegates visiting such a small client before  This only demonstrated how Saudi is hunkering down to secure every bit of its market share   In addition  Saudi would never want to repeat the history of cutting production  propping up oil price just to give rise to Canadian Oil sands  Russia and U S  Shale  Another psychological factor  if Saudi has hung in this long watching oil falling from  100 to  50  a production cut at this stage would only show weakness by the Kingdom in deviating from their initial resolve  Remember  Saudi is one of the oil producing countries that has seen  10 oil before  as opposed to the U S  Shale Industry s total shock at  50 oil   
Wells Drilled but Not Completed
Wells that operators do not want to produce at current low oil prices  Well backlogs have sparked some concern that holding back completions until oil prices rise would simply cause a production surge in the future  leading to another oil price plunge  For example  Platts  EOG Resources  NYSE EOG  sees a backlog of about 350 wells this year and Anadarko  APC  says 125 wells  Continental Resources  CLR  said it had deferred completions in the Bakken by 25  in Q1  while Chesapeake  CHK  will have about 100 wells in its Eagle Ford Shale inventory  Unlike rig count  well backlog is not a statistic tracked by anyone on a regular basis  Platts cited estimates of 1 400 2 000  fracklog  wells in the U S  However  I think this  fracklog  seems more like a  spin  by E Ps  and Wall Street  to frame a better story for capex and or production cuts of 2015  rather than something of a material impact   A lot of small and mid E Ps typically cannot afford to remain so  strategic  as they need cash just to stay afloat to fund operations and interest expense  See  E P Funding Crisis  section below   Furthermore  the steep decline production curve  a characteristic of oil Shale  suggests the production impact from these wells most likely would not be significant and long enough as to bring about another oil bear market once oil prices recover  E P Funding Crisis The long good days of  100 oil have spoiled many E Ps into reckless spending and leverage  Oil falling to 6 year low has put some E Ps in jeopardy  Reuters is reporting that JPMorgan  NYSE JPM  has been shopping the entire Whiting Petroleum  NYSE WLL   the biggest oil producer in Bakken  to potential buyers but they re scared off by  5 6 billion in debt  Whiting piled up debt after the acquisition of Kodiak Oil   Gas last year  Quicksilver Resources  a natural gas weighted producer  filed Chapter 11 on March 17 following Dune Energy and BPZ Resources   I think this  funding crisis  is individual company based instead of an industry wide tsunami  There are 100  publicly traded mid to small E Ps and E P MLPs in North America  Many risky and high levered companies were able to hide under the high oil price in the past  This time around  the higher break even point of Shale Oil dictates only the strong will survive  So now is the time for some industry consolidation to weed out  sour apples   In the end  bigger  smarter and healthier companies will remain  which is a good thing for investors and the U S  energy industry as a whole in the long run Dividend Cut by ExxonMobil   A couple of weeks ago  CNBC had a segment talking about earnings per share vs  dividend per share and concluded that some of the bigger oil companies such as Hess  NYSE HES   ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP   and BP Plc  NYSE BP  may need to cut dividends as earnings fall short of dividend  ExxonMobil  NYSE XOM  name was also verbally discussed in this particular CNBC segment   Frankly  I think it is plausible Hess  ConocoPhillips and BP will be cutting dividends due to lower oil prices   revenue  however  XOM has never  ever cut dividends since the stock was  5  so I doubt the oil major would break tradition this time  After all  XOM is sitting on  4 7 Bn cash and  53 Bn in Current Assets  as of 12 31 2014    In fact  I see XOM stock more a dividend play rather than energy  so I don t quite get Buffett s rationale of dumping all of his XOM holdings while still keeping IBM  NYSE IBM   Merit of The Integrated Model  Oil price plunge has also brought about the age old debate over oil majors such as ExxonMobil  XOM  and Chevron  NYSE CVX  keeping the integrated model  Upstream   Downstream  instead of spinning off the refining business like Marathon  MRO  and ConocoPhillips  COP  did  Sure  when oil prices are high  upstream  exploration   production  makes all the money while downstream  i e  refining   marketing  drags  But nothing lasts forever  when oil prices gone bust  like now   downstream actually serves as a natural hedge for the Upstream arm of the integrated model  This is one reason integrates like XOM and CVX should fare better in the current oil price environment than E Ps  and why hedging position strategy is far more important for the pure E Ps   As I indicated before  shifting away from the integrated model is a short sighted move blinded by Wall Street talk of  unlocking shareholder value   banks get hefty fees and shares in a spin off IPO   Marathon and ConocoPhillips would certainly be a lot better off if they still have the steady cashflow from their old refining business to fall back on ",2015-03-24,EconMatters,https://www.investing.com/analysis/thoughts-on-the-current-oil-market-245980,245980
100168,321683,BKR,Counting Rigs With Baker Hughes,opinion,"Baker Hughes  NYSE BHI  watches the oil sector closely  It services a ton of offshore oil rigs with parts analytics and what not  So they know what s going on  They also put out a count of active rigs on a weekly basis  That count fell off a cliff  recently  but has started to slow as of their last measure  Perhaps a right sizing has occurred 
But perhaps more interesting is what s going on with Baker Hughes  stock price  The chart below shows the price action since October 2014  A few things stand out 

First  notice the falling trend resistance  It has been in place since mid November  Touching it for the third time  it is from a series of higher lows  But it is also stalling about the same distance above the 200 day SMA each time  That s what I find most interesting  From early 2013  the price had been above the 200 day SMA  except for a few minor breaks underneath  And when it was above it  the price moved from around 45 to 75  It likes to go higher when above the 200 day SMA 
So the key seems to be a hold above the 200 day SMA  Could this be the time it does so  The momentum indicators are on board  Both are bullish and rising  A move over the February high at 65 would give the stock a good kick ",2015-04-01,Gregory W.

100169,321684,BKR,WTI  3 Reasons For This Week s Rally,opinion,"More than two months ago  we commented on oil s stealth  bull market  and concluded that   a rejection at 53 50 would point toward more consolidation around 50 00 in the short term  though the staggering scope of the rally suggests it s unlikely that oil will resume its previous downtrend at the same pace any time soon   As it turns out  the same  10 range from roughly  44 to  54  has now held for more than a quarter of a year  though the 14  rally over the last four days has put that range in jeopardy 
From a fundamental perspective  there are a couple of bullish catalysts driving oil higher 
1  A Pause in the Dollar Uptrend
A big component of the recent weakness in oil prices has been the strength in the dollar  With the dollar index pausing below the psychologically significant 100 00 level over the last month or so  the supply and demand in the global oil market have been driving trade  A breakdown below 50 day MA support at 96 00 in the dollar index could prompt a bullish breakout above 54 00 in WTI 
2  Delayed Expectations of New Supply from Iran 
On Friday  the US and Iran agreed to the framework for a nuclear deal that could lead to more oil exports from Iran  While this could eventually serve as a headwind for oil prices  it s important to note that there are still logistical hurdles to approving the deal  and even then  it would still take upwards of a year for Iran to create the infrastructure to start exporting large amounts of oil 
3  The Continued Drop in Rig Counts
Finally  we are seeing a clear economic response to the precipitous drop in oil prices  The Baker Hughes  NYSE BHI  rig count data dropped by 11 rigs to 802 total oil rigs in the US  marking the 17th consecutive weekly decline  Of course  oil companies tend to shut down their least productive rigs first  so much of the US oil production will continue to flow in the short term  but the decrease in supply will eventually push prices back up 
Technical View  WTI
As we noted above  WTI is testing the top of its range at 54 00  a level that also marks the 100 day MA  Given the previous rejections at this key level  bullish traders will remain understandably cautious below  54  but if we see a break and close above that barrier  a move up to the next level of previous resistance at  58 could definitely be in play next  Both the MACD and RSI indicators are at their highest levels since the downtrend began nine months ago  further bolstering the bullish case  Of course  just as we noted two months ago   a rejection at  54 00  would point toward more consolidation around 50 00 in the short term  though the staggering scope of the rally suggests it s unlikely that oil will resume its previous downtrend at the same pace any time soon   In that case  we may have the opportunity to reiterate the same analysis again in another two months

100170,321685,BKR,Top Trade Ideas For The Week Of April 13  2015  The Rest,opinion,"Here are the Rest of the Top 10 
TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation  NYSE AMTD  
TD Ameritrade  AMTD  continues to trend higher  making a series of higher lows  As it sets up at resistance  it has support for a break through to the upside from a rising and bullish RSI and a MACD that is about to cross up 
Baker Hughes  NYSE BHI  
Baker Hughes  BHI  broke a downtrending resistance line to start last week  it retested the break out and held  moving higher to end the week  Now it is at the November high and looking good with a Golden Cross to print Monday  The RSI is bullish and rising while the MACD is also moving higher  both supporting the upside 
Bristol Myers Squibb Company  NYSE BMY 
Bristol Myers Squibb  BMY  ran to a new all time high in late March before a pullback  The stock consolidated at support until it started back higher on Friday  The RSI is moving back higher after a pullback  That pullback held in the bullish zone  while the MACD is about to turn back higher 
Red Hat Inc  NYSE RHT  
Red Hat  RHT  broke above a symmetrical triangle after reporting earnings  The peak was nearly a perfect move out of the triangle  and it is now consolidating over support  The RSI is strong in the bullish zone while the MACD has pulled back a bit from the high  After 6 narrow range days Friday was a bit wider and to the upside 
Yum  Brands  NYSE YUM 
Yum  Brands  YUM  had a strong run higher through February filling the gap from last July  It pulled back after that but has bounced back in mid March  Now it has touched and reversed under 81 twice but is rising toward it again  All through this the RSI has held in the bullish zone  and is pointing higher now  while the MACD has pulled back  but is turning toward a possible cross up 

After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad  picture reviewed Friday which  heading into April Options Expiration  sees the equity markets have gained some strength 
Elsewhere look for Gold to continue higher in the short term while Crude Oil moves in its consolidation zone  The US Dollar Index is moving higher again while US Treasuries are biased lower in the short term  The Shanghai Composite and Emerging Markets are both biased to the upside with the Chinese market looking overheated again 
Volatility looks to remain subdued keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETF s SPY  IWM and QQQ  despite the moves higher this week  Their charts also look good for more upside with the IWM steady and the QQQ and SPY with some short term hurdles to overcome  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

100171,321686,BKR,Finding Value In Declining Commodity Prices,opinion,"I m going to begin with a bit of good news  Below is our China Region Fund  As you can see  not only has it broken above its 50  and 200 day moving averages  but it s also trading at four year highs  And since this chart was created early last week  the fund has climbed even higher  to  9 53 as of this writing  As I mentioned last week  USCOX has benefited from the continued rally in the Shanghai Composite Index through our holdings in the Morgan Stanley  China A Share Fund  NYSE CAF  and a closed end fund  The Shanghai Composite is up 87 percent year over year and is currently at a seven year high  So what s the deal with Chinese equities right now  After all  China s economic growth for the first quarter of the year cooled to a six year low of 7 percent  The market surge is mostly attributable to monetary easing and government policy changes such as housing stimulus and modernization of the country s financial structure  But there s more at work 
Saving Big on Commodities Slump
Also contributing to the bull run is the plunge in commodity prices since last June  brought on by both the strong U S  dollarx and a slowing global economy  Such market conditions have obviously been a challenge for those involved in the production of raw materials and natural resources  But they ve been a windfall for net import countries  China included  Most of the beneficiaries are Asian and Eastern European nations excluding Russia  whose economy largely depends on revenue generated from oil exports  Besides Russia  the biggest losers have been Latin American countries  huge exporters of some of the hardest hit resources crude oil  sugar  soybeans and coffee  As the world s largest importer of natural resources  China saves an estimated  600 million a day on its oil import bill  That s a staggering  200 billion a year  Low oil prices  in fact  should help boost GDP growth in the entire Asia Pacific region between 0 25 and 0 5 percent  according to Rajiv Biswas  economist at consulting firm IHS Inc  Low oil prices are also helping many businesses and companies such as American Airlines Group  NASDAQ AAL  keep more capital in their coffers  For every  1 change in oil  American saves about  105 million per month in jet fuel costs  according to airline research analyst Helane Becker of financial services firm Cowen Group  Amazingly enough  precious metals are the best performing commodities sub sector so far this year  having collectively lost 2 5 percent  Of the 29 resources featured in the chart above  only red meat is in the black  Whereas many of these commodities are facing oversupply issues  the cattle industry as well as barbeque purveyors are currently struggling with a brisket shortage  which have driven the wholesale price of the popular cut of meat up 60 percent from last year  Several barbeque joints here in San Antonio  in fact  have fallen victim this year to what the media are calling  the brisket bandit   who s made off with thousands of dollars  worth of meat  both raw and smoked 
Platinum and palladium are fundamentally undervalued right now  and demand for both metals is expected to pick up this year  Low prices should spur platinum jewelry demand in China  while an increase in automobile sales in the U S   eurozone and China should help palladium   Palladium is used in the production of catalytic converters   
Start of Mergers and Acquisitions
The challenging crude oil environment has prompted the first of what will likely be a new wave of oil and gas company mergers and acquisitions  M As  similar to what we last saw in the late 1990s  If you recall  Exxon merged with Mobil  NYSE XOM  in an  80 billion deal  BP  NYSE BP  tied the knot with Amoco and Chevron  NYSE CVX  bought Texaco  The current cycle kicked off last November when titan Halliburton  NYSE HAL  agreed to purchase Baker Hughes  NYSE BHI  for  35 billion  Now  for double that price in cash and stock  Royal Dutch Shell  LONDON RDSa  Royal Dutch Shell A  NYSE RDSa  plans to gobble up UK based BG Group  LONDON BG  in the biggest deal since the Exxon Mobil merger  The combined companies will become the world s largest producer of liquefied natural gas  LNG   Shell s oil and gas reserves will grow 25 percent and give the company huge exposure to proven oilfields in Australia and Brazil  As is normally the case  the company being acquired sees a spike in share price  and BG is no exception  this week alone  its stock has risen more than 30 percent  It s doubtful we ll see a deal this round as massive as Exxon Mobil  but we expect more to occur among the junior to mid tier producers and explorers  Disclosure  Please consider carefully a fund s investment objectives  risks  charges and expenses  Foreign and emerging market investing involves special risks such as currency fluctuation and less public disclosure  as well as economic and political risk  By investing in a specific geographic region  a regional fund s returns and share price may be more volatile than those of a less concentrated portfolio  The Shanghai Composite Index  SSE  LONDON SSE   is an index of all stocks that trade on the Shanghai Stock Exchange  Fund portfolios are actively managed  and holdings may change daily  Holdings are reported as of the most recent quarter end  Holdings in the China Region Fund as a percentage of net assets as of 3 31 2015  American Airlines 0 00   Baker Hughes 0 00   BG Group 0 00   BP PLC 0 00   Canaccord Genuity Group Inc  0 00   Chevron Corp   NYSE CVX  0 00   Exxon Mobil Corp  NYSE XOM   0 00   Halliburton 0 00   IHS Inc  0 00   Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS  China A Share Fund 0 00   Royal Dutch Shell PLC 0 00   All opinions expressed and data provided are subject to change without notice  Some of these opinions may not be appropriate to every investor ",2015-04-13,Frank Holmes,https://www.investing.com/analysis/finding-value-in-declining-commodity-prices-248253,248253
100199,321714,BKR,Market Bulls Beware   Winter Is Coming,opinion,"Sometimes being a value investor  amid overvalued  and ever more so  markets  feels a bit like being a Stark in Westeros  The analogy will be lost on you if you do not follow Game of Thrones  but the Starks hold the largest of the sub kingdoms in Westeros  This kingdom also happens to be the coldest  and the sober Starks are always reminding people that  Winter is coming  
I should observe that winter in Westeros is a much more serious affair than it is around here  it comes at odd intervals but can last for years  So being prepared for winter is really important  However  getting people to prepare for winter during the long  summer  is very difficult 
Sound familiar  The thing to keep in mind is that the Starks are always right  eventually  and they re the ones who come through the winter in the best shape  Such is the case with value investors   Some people might prefer calling value investors who are bearish on stocks right now  Chicken Littles  but I prefer being compared to Ned Stark  thanks  Although both of them have been known to lose their heads on occasion  
Fortunately  it does not appear that winter is coming to the U S  very soon  Friday s Employment report was strong  despite the beginnings of downsizing in the oil and gas extraction businesses  The chart below shows the Baker Hughes  NYSE BHI  oil and gas rig count  which is falling at a rate every bit as fast as it did in the credit crisis 

Yet  the U S  economy as a whole generated 267 000 new jobs last month  which was above expectations  It is unlikely that this pace will continue  since the extraction  and related industry  jobs will be a drag  But in 2008  this happened when every other industry was being squeezed  and in the current case other industries are being squeezed by the strong dollar  but only mildly so 
I think this will actually serve to increase the labor force participation rate  which has been in a downtrend for a long time   because laid off oil workers will still be in the labor force looking for work  while other jobs will be getting filled by  sometimes  discouraged workers coming off the sidelines  So we may well see the Unemployment Rate rise even as jobs growth remains reasonable  even if less robust than the most recent figures 
Winter  though  is still coming 
In the near term  winter is coming to Europe  Unusually  it is moving from the south to the north because Greece appears to be finally heading for the denouement that has been utterly unavoidable from the beginning  I wrote this in June 2012  and I wasn t the only one saying such things   the only real question has been how long it would take before the Greeks decided they d had enough of sacrifice to hold together the Eurozone for the elites  

Greece will still leave the Euro  Government or no government  austerity or no austerity   the fiscal math simply doesn t make sense unless Europe wants to pay for Greece forever  In principle  the Greeks can dig themselves out of trouble if they work harder  retire later  pay more taxes  and receive fewer government services  I do believe that people can change  and a society can change  under pressure of crisis  Remember Rosie the Riveter  But the question is whether they can change  whether they will change  do they even want to change  if the benefit of the change flows not to Greece s people but to the behemoth European institutions that have lent money to Greece 
If a person declares bankruptcy  and the judge declares that he must pay all of his wages for the next thirty years  after deducting enough for food and shelter  to the creditors do you think that person is going to go looking for a 60 hour workweek 

Am I sure that Greece is going to leave the Euro in a week  or a month  or a year  Not at all  The institutional self preservation meme is very strong and I am always amazed at how long it takes obvious imperatives to actually happen  1  But I am quite confident that Greece will eventually leave the Euro  and it does seem as if parties on all sides of the negotiating table are coming to that conclusion as well 
One question that authorities have had to come to peace with first was whether Grexit is really Armageddon   that default and an exit from the Euro is not bad for Greece  at least when compared to a multi year depression 
And it s probably not even horrible for Europe  or the world at large  at least compared to the credit crisis  despite all protestations that this would be  Lehman squared   Again  this is old news and as I lay out the reasoning  there is no reason to repeat myself 
But it won t be a positive thing  And it is likely to bring on  winter   economically  Helpfully  the world s central banks not only remain in easing mode but are increasing the dovishness of their stance  with the ECB foremost among the central banks that are priming the pumps again  M2 money growth in the Eurozone was up to 4 5  y y in December  latest data available   with the highest quarter over quarter growth rate  8 3   annualized  in money since the end of 2008 
Meanwhile the Fed  while it is no longer adding to reserves  is still watching the money supply grow at 6  y y with no good way to stop it  For all the talk about the FOMC hiking rates by mid year  I think the probable rise in the Unemployment Rate discussed above  plus the weak inflation readings  with the notable exception of Median CPI   plus the fact that all other central banks are easing and likely to continue doing so  plus the probability of turbulence in Europe  makes it very unlikely that this Committee  with a very dovish makeup  will be tightening any time soon 
The likely onset of some winter will not help hold down inflation  however  Upward pressures remain  and the fact that the ECB is now running the pumps makes higher prices more likely  Yes  we care about money supply growth in Europe  the chart below shows the M2 growth of the US and Europe combined  against core CPI in the US  The fit is actually better than with US CPI alone 

Now  some markets are priced for winter and some are not  We think that real interest rates in Europe are far too low compared to real rates in the US  and stock prices in the US are too high compared to stock prices in Europe  The first chart below shows the spread of 10 year real rates in the US minus Europe  showing US yields are high compared to European yields   the second chart shows the ratio of the S P 500 to the Eurostoxx 50 


You can see in the latter chart that the out performance of the S P has proceeded since 2009  while the under performance of US inflation linked bonds has only happened since 2012  so these are not simply two ways of looking at the same trade  In both cases  these deviations are quite extreme  But the European economy and the US economy are not completely independent of one another  weak European growth affects US corporate entities and vice versa  and as I suggest above the growth of European money supply tends to affect US inflation as well  We think that  institutional  investors should buy TIPS and sell European linkers  and also buy European stocks against US stocks  By doing both of these things  the exposure to currency flows or general trends in global equity market pricing is lessened   Institutional investors interested in how we would weight such a trade should contact us  
 1  As another example  take the shrinking of Wall Street  It was obvious after 2008 that it had to happen  only recently  however  as banks and dealers have been forced to become more and more like utilities have we started to see layoffs while stocks are rising  which is very unusual  But Wall Street defended the bloated structures of the past for more than six years ",2015-02-10,Michael Ashton,https://www.investing.com/analysis/winter-is-coming-241519,241519

As we progress into 2015 many investors are in the process of tallying up their winners and losers and deciding on this year s allocations  This can be a healthy exercise  but not without out its potential pitfalls  The natural inclination for most investors  us included  is to sell the losers  and replace them with managers that have had much stronger performance  This is true on a macro level as well  as investors rethink strategies and asset classes that have underperformed recently and are drawn to those with superior recent returns  Unfortunately       be a losing strategy  by the time a manager  asset class or strategy has become attractive it is typically in the late stages of its outperformance and vice versa  This certainly makes allocating and re allocating a much more anxiety producing task 

So what is the answer  Investors tend to feel the need to do something  and often it s the wrong thing  As we ve repeatedly pointed out in the past  the key isn t necessarily reacting to recent performance  but instead understanding what drives the returns of your managers  asset classes  and strategies  This leaves an investor with a solid foundation for determining whether a manager or strategy performed as expected  deviations from this expectation  not absolute return levels  should then drive re allocation decisions 

Liquid Alts Corner



Managed futures funds continued to have very strong performance  averaging nearly 4  during the month and bringing their one year return to over 15   As would be expected given the struggling equity markets  bear market funds also had solid performance  However  the longer term performance has still been abysmal  annualizing at nearly  24  over the last five years  Long short equity was the worst performing group  losing 1 40  during the month 



Multialternative started the year off with a strong month of flows  gaining over  1 billion in new assets during January  The largest contributor was the Principal Global Multi Strategy Fund which saw nearly  500 million come into the fund during the month  Managed futures also had a strong month  gaining  800 million in assets  which wasn t surprising given the strategy s recent positive performance  up more than 15  over the last 12 months   AQR and Natixis saw the biggest flows  each bringing in more than  200 million in assets  While the long short category showed flat flows and market neutral more than  1 billion in negative flows  these numbers are somewhat misleading as they are dominated by what appear to be shifts between PIMCO funds  Specifically  the PIMCO Worldwide Fundamental Advantage Absolute Return Strategy Fund  market neutral  saw more than  800 million leave  while the PIMCO Worldwide Long Short Fundamental Strategy Fund  long short equity  had a similar amount come into the fund  The MainStay Marketfield Fund continued to shed assets  losing nearly  900 million during January

 Man Group Buys NewSmith Equities Manager

Man Group Plc  the world s largest publicly traded hedge fund manager  agreed to buy the equities management business of NewSmith to expand in Tokyo and London 

Man Group  which manages  72 3 billion  plans to complete the deal in the second quarter  it said in a statement on Friday  London based NewSmith  with  1 2 billion of funds under management  is 40 percent owned by Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Holdings Inc   Japan s fourth biggest bank by market value  which said it supports the deal in a separate statement

 Some Hedge Funds Seeing Value in Energy Stocks

Investing in energy in recent months has required a strong stomach  The price of a barrel of crude oil  after trading around  100 in June  fell to about  43 in January  putting pressure on a range of oil and gas companies and funds that invested heavily in energy stocks  The filings show Mr  Buffett s Berkshire Hathaway sold its 41 million shares of Exxon Mobil  NYSE XOM  during the fourth quarter  while Greenlight Capital  David Einhorn s hedge fund  sold its entire two million share stake in the British oil giant BP  Barry Rosenstein s Jana Partners sold its 3 4 million shares in the Apache  NYSE APA  Corporation  NYSE APA  the oil and gas company 

To some hedge fund managers  the rout apparently provided an opportunity for bottom fishing  Mr  Loeb s Third Point acquired five million shares of Phillips 66  NYSE PSX   a stake worth  384 5 million as of Tuesday  Omega Advisors  meanwhile  acquired 2 1 million shares of Laredo Petroleum and 652 500 shares of Sanchez Energy Corporation  But at the same time  Omega sold about 29 percent of its big stake in SandRidge Energy  ending the quarter with 32 2 million shares 

ValueAct Capital  an activist hedge fund  acquired big new positions in Halliburton and Baker Hughes  NYSE BHI   two oil field services companies that agreed to a  34 6 billion merger in November  The two stakes  each worth more than  900 million  could make ValueAct a forceful advocate for the deal  which will be subject to shareholder votes in March

100203,321718,BKR,The Daily Shot  Diverging Developments In Oil Markets Vs  Energy Shares ,opinion,"Let s take a look at the recent developments in the US energy markets and the seemingly contradictory reaction by equity investors  First of all  while we continue to see significant declines in the US rig count  both oil and gas      
     American crude oil production remains at record levels and still rising  It s going to take time for this momentum to turn 
Part of the reason is the increasing productivity of new rigs in the US 
Moreover  outside the US some major oil producing nations such as Russia and Iraq   desperate for hard currency   will maximize production in the months to come  Global production will therefore continue to rise  The second key development has been a relatively steep crude oil futures curve  contango  
 This is encouraging crude investors to store oil  The arb involves buying spot crude  simultaneously selling forward  and storing for delivery at a future date  Profit   Forward Price   Spot Price   Storage Cost   Financing Cost   If the arb persists  the trade can be rolled  That s why this past week we saw the largest spike in volume of crude in storage 
Moreover  the absolute levels of crude in storage are now at the highest level in some 80 years 
As a result  analysts expect Cushing  OK  the WTI crude delivery storage hub  to run out of storage soon 
Crude in storage is on the rise outside the US as well  As an example  Iran just launched a huge floating oil storage unit in the Persian Gulf  built by Samsung   This facility stores 2 2 million barrels of crude 
The most important development in 2014 of course was the historic shift in the crude oil production cost curve  capping crude prices at  75  80 bbl for some years to come 
Now  with these production fundamentals in place  rapidly growing amounts of crude in storage  and longer term prices capped way below milti year averages  why are energy firms  shares still relatively expensive  For example  over the past couple of years spot crude oil is down 45   while the energy component of the S P 500 is up 2   via SPDR Energy Select Sector Fund  ARCA XLE   

And forward P E ratios are more than double the historical averages   these are some of the most expensive large cap shares in the market 

Equity markets seem to be betting on a quick decline in production and sufficient recovery in crude prices to return the energy industry to stronger profitability in the nearterm  There is also the view that some energy firms will remain resilient due to their midstream operations   storage  transport  and refining  And we ve all heard talk of consolidation and M A activity in the space which may also support share prices     A number of analysts have turned constructive on the sector 
Furthermore  from the technical perspective many portfolio managers have been heavily underweight the energy sector for months and some believe that the eventual rebalancing will drive up share prices  These are all solid arguments  However given the current lofty valuations  if we don t see a major improvement in crude prices in the next few months  energy shares may take another leg down  One can see this nervousness in the credit markets as HY energy credits remain near historical wides to the rest of the market  chart below   For those who wish to jump in at these levels  be prepared for significant volatility and deleveraging in the energy sector 
                                                                          ",2015-02-22,Sober Look,https://www.investing.com/analysis/diverging-developments-in-oil-markets-vs.-energy-shares-242670,242670

100205,321720,BKR,Oil And Gas Stock Roundup  Chevron Exits Romania  Repsol Gets Approval ,opinion,"It was a week where oil prices suffered their first loss in a month though natural gas rallied on encouraging weather forecasts  On the news front  Chevron  NYSE CVX  has decided to pull out of its shale gas operations in Romania  while Spain s Repsol  MADRID REP   got shareholder approval from Canada s Talisman Energy  TO TLM   to buy the latter for  13 billion 
Overall  it was a mixed week for the sector  While West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude futures were down 4 6  to close at  50 34 per barrel  Natural Gas prices jumped around 5 2  to  2 95 per million Btu  MMBtu    See the last  Oil   Gas Stock Roundup  here    
Oil prices fell for the first time in 4 weeks  spooked by the U S  Energy Department s latest inventory release  The federal government s EIA report revealed that crude stockpiles recorded another massive build  the sixth in a row  At 425 64 million barrels  current crude supplies are up 17 5  from the year ago period and is at the highest level during this time of the year in at least 80 years  Investors were further discouraged by the Baker Hughes  NYSE BHI  report that showed a relatively modest drop in oil directed rigs  indicating a brake in the rapidly declining shale drilling activities 
Meanwhile  natural gas fared much better on expectations of cranked up heating demand with forecasts of frigid weather across the key U S  markets during the next few days 
Recap of the Week s Most Important Stories
1  San Ramon  CA based energy giant Chevron Corp  NYSE CVX   said that it is getting out of the shale gas business in Romania  citing poor exploration economics and environmental issues  As part of the exit decision  the American behemoth has also relinquished its three other concessions in Romania 
With this  Chevron has ended its European shale gas quest and will instead turn its focus to home soil  The company has already halted its shale gas exploration project in Poland following the abandonment of agreements in Lithuania and Ukraine 
2  Spanish oil producer Repsol S A  has received approval from the shareholders of struggling Canadian energy explorer Talisman Energy Inc  to acquire the latter for about  13 billion  More than 99  of Talisman shareholders voted in favor of the transaction  which had already been approved by the boards of both the companies 
The transaction   agreed on late last year and likely to be completed in the second quarter   will result in a combined entity with production capacity of 680 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day  MBOE D  and refining capacity of 1 MBOE D  The merger will create a global E P company  which would be better positioned to fully exploit Talisman s large  undeveloped resource base 
3  Independent energy explorer EOG Resources Inc  NYSE EOG  fell prey to lower oil prices and reported weak fourth quarter 2014 earnings  notwithstanding improving production from its U S  onshore assets  In the quarter  EOG s total volume rose 14 7  from the year earlier level to 56 1 million barrels of oil equivalent  primarily driven by significant contribution from the company s South Texas Eagle Ford  along with North Dakota Bakken and Delaware Basin 
Looking to stem the rot from plunging oil prices  EOG has pegged its 2015 capital budget at  4 9  5 1 billion  down 40  from last year s level  Further  the company plans to restrict its expenses to the highest return assets  the Eagle Ford  Delaware Basin and Bakken plays   See More    
4  North American energy firm Williams Companies  NYSE WMB  reported weak fourth quarter 2014 adjusted earnings from continuing operations  A significant increase in operating and maintenance cost along with a weak performance by the company s largest income generating business segment   Williams Partners   hampered the results 
Moreover  Williams Companies lowered its 2015 cash dividend guidance to  2 38 per share from the prior projection of  2 46  For 2015 through 2017  the company revised its dividend hike expectation down from 15  to 10  15   The assumption of weak oil and gas prices has weighed on management s dividend growth guidance   See More    
5  Marathon Oil Corp  NYSE MRO    a leading oil and natural gas exploration and production  E P  firm   reported weak fourth quarter 2014 earnings  Considerably low crude oil realizations and condensate prices along with higher exploration expenses hurt the results 
Marathon Oil projects capital spending of  3 521 million in 2015  a 20  reduction from the earlier guidance  The company further added that nearly 70  of the capex will be directed toward its three core U S  resource plays   See More    
Price Performance 
The following table shows the price movement of the major oil and gas players over the past week and during the last 6 months 


Refiner Tesoro Corp  NYSE TSO  was the week s best performer among the market heavyweights  adding 11 9  to its stock price  The widening spread between the U S  and the global crude benchmarks is good news for domestic downstream players like Tesoro as it will improve their margins  On the other hand  the biggest loser was offshore driller Transocean Ltd  NYSE RIG    which fell 14 1  during the period after its latest fleet report showed two more idled rigs 
Over the last 6 months  Tesoro was again the chief beneficiary on the bourses with its shares advancing 41 2   Investors have rewarded the company for its continued focus on shareholder returns  Similarly  Transocean was the laggard  as it witnessed a 56 6  price decline over the same time frame on the back of rig oversupply that has led the industry into a cyclical downturn 
What s Next in the Energy World 
Apart from the usual releases in this week   the U S  government data on oil and natural gas   market participants will be closely tracking a series of crucial economic reports  including those on housing  consumer confidence  durable orders and inflation with the crucial GDP report rounding off the list ",2015-02-25,Zacks Investment Research,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/oil---gas-stock-roundup:-chevron-exits-romania,-talisman-shareholders-ok-242999",242999

GBP USD bulls suffered a big setback last week when they were unable to maintain Wednesday s break above the 23 6  Fibonacci retracement at 1 5480  Thursday s large Bearish Engulfing Candle  showed a near term shift from buying to selling pressure and suggests that rates may dip further heading into this week  While they re still bullish on an absolute basis  both the MACD and Slow Stochastics are showing signs of potentially rolling over back to the downside  so a deeper retracement toward 1 5300 or lower would not be surprising early this week  On the other hand  a recovery back above the 1 5480 would put the bulls back in control 
 A Bearish Engulfing candle is formed when the candle breaks above the high of the previous time period before sellers step in and push rates down to close below the low of the previous time period  It indicates that the sellers have wrested control of the market from the buyers

USD JPY

USD JPY continued to consolidate in its recent range last week
MACD and Slow Stochastics show balanced  two way trade
Near term resistance sits up at 120 50  with support at 118 25
Given the lack of market movement over the last week  we ve reproduced the previous report s analysis nearly verbatim  USDJPY continued its slow  consolidative trading conditions around the 119 00 handle last week  As it stands  bulls and bears are in an almost perfect equilibrium  with neither side able to make any progress for the last few months now  Not surprisingly  the secondary indicators are showing balanced  two way trade  providing little guidance on what to expect moving forward  In these types of markets  the best strategy for traders is generally to take their cue from the market   a break above 120 50 resistance could signal a bullish breakout  while a drop below last week s low at 118 25 would point to a deeper pullback

USD CAD

USD CAD bounced around in the mid 1 20s last week
MACD continues to pull back toward the  0  level as the previous bullish momentum evaporates
Break from near term consolidation pattern could signal next trend in the North American pair
USD CAD is our currency pair in play this week due to a number of high impact economic reports out of the US and Canada  including Friday s dueling employment reports  see  Data Highlights  below for more   Last week  the pair bounced around in its recent range in the mid 1 20s  but this week s deluge of economic data could take rates out of the near term sideways range  A break below support at 1 2350 could open the door for a deeper retracement toward 1 2185  while a bullish breakout could target 1 2800 or higher in the coming weeks

AUD Shouldn t Expect Any Help from the RBA
It s going to be such an eventful week for the Australian dollar that it may set the tone for weeks to come  There is a deluge of economic data due from Australia  China and the US  as well the constant threat of the storm clouds hanging over Europe  The most important event for the Australian dollar however  will be Tuesday s monetary policy meeting at the Reserve Bank of Australia  RBA  
To Cut or Not to Cut
There is even more uncertainty surrounding this week s policy meeting than there was in the days prior to the RBA s meeting in February  At that meeting the RBA decided to move the official cash rate for the first time since July 2007  It was a line ball decision that could have easily resulted in the bank remaining on hold  as opposed to lobbing 25bps off the cash rate  Inevitably  the RBA decided that the Australian economy required more stimulus and the benefits of a lower OCR outweighed the threat of a bubble in residential property prices 
This time around the RBA must decide if even more stimulus is needed in light of some soft economic data and heightened concern about Australia s growth and inflation outlooks  One of the most concerning pieces of economic data was Australia s labor market report for January  Australia s unemployment rate unexpectedly jumped to 6 4  in January  expected 6 2   from 6 1  in December as 28 1K full time jobs disappeared  Despite the possibility that this data was somewhat distorted by statistical volatility  it was still enough to spark calls for back to back interest rate cuts 
However  as the shock of the employment numbers began to wear off  the market slowly began to discount the idea that the RBA would loosen policy further in March  That was until the release of Australia s private capital expenditure figures for last quarter  Private capital expenditure fell 2 2  last quarter  missing an expected 1 6  drop  and investment intentions for the year also underwhelmed expectations 
Not a Question of If  but When
Even prior to this deluge of disappointing economic data the RBA s own quarterly report indicated that it was anticipating the need for further monetary policy loosening  despite a lower Australian dollar and some reservations about the diminishing effectiveness of lower interest rates  So  it s really not a question of if the RBA will cut another 25bps off the official cash rate  but when  After last week s disappointing CAPEX figures  the market is pricing in just over a 50  chance of lower interest rates in March  at least according to the OIS market  Most market commentators  including FOREX com  are a little more confident that the RBA will cut the official cash rate to 2 00  on Tuesday 
What Does this Mean for the Australian Dollar 
The uncertainty regarding the outcome of this week s policy meeting at the RBA means that we may see some big moves in the Australian dollar on the back of the bank s decision  no matter what it decides  As we have previously stated  we put a higher probability on the RBA cutting the OFC than leaving it unchanged  which may keep AUD USD on the back foot 
There is the possibility that the RBA may maintain an almost neutral bias and cut interest rates to 2 00  due to the diminishing ability of further policy loosening to effectively support growth and inflation outcomes  Yet  this would be dangerous for the bank s outlook for an even weaker Australian dollar  as it may place a matching floor on AUD weakness  The most effective strategy would be for the RBA to adopt at least a slight easing bias if it cuts interest rates  keeping the door open for further AUD downside  In the event it does this  AUDUSD may break out of its medium term upward trend and begin a push towards its 5 5 year low around 0 7625 
Other Economic Data to Watch When Trading AUDUSD

Look Ahead  Equities
This week saw some of the major European and US stock indices rally to fresh unchartered territories while others hit multi year highs  In the US  the Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen laid the groundwork for a gradual rate hiking cycle  although at the same time made it clear that there won t be any rate rises in the next couple of meetings  This kept both the dollar and stock market bulls happy  Sentiment was also lifted by news Greece s bailout program was finally extended and after the release of some stronger than expected Eurozone data  What s more  it has been a decent earnings season in Europe so far too  We are now about two thirds of the way into Europe s earnings season  According to Reuters  some 55  of companies here have met or beaten profit forecasts  The overall quarterly earnings are expected to grow by 19 5   which  if correct  would be Europe s best season in 3 5 years  Indeed  as we have been going on about it for some time now  it is the European markets where we are likely to see most of the action in the coming weeks  The ECB s recent introduction of QE is the primary reason for our bullish view on the European markets  If the US is anything to go by then the European stock markets have a lot of catching up to do as the ECB s actions push bond yields further lower and  in some cases  into the negative territory  Yield seeking investors are being left with little choice but to invest into the stock markets as the returns on other investments are simply too low or come with undesirably high risks  But we have also seen the release of some decent economic data from the single currency block in recent times and if this trend continues next week then we could see further gains in the European stock markets 
As we have already published some bullish reports on the FTSE 100  CAC 40  DAX and DJ Euro Stoxx 50 recently  our featured chart for this week is the IBEX 35 index  Below we have two charts of the Spanish benchmark index  both displaying clear bullish patterns  The monthly chart shows that the IBEX has been in an upward trend since bottoming out in 2012  In recent months  the index has consolidated in a relatively tight range below the 11200 handle  suggesting that it may be gearing up for a potential breakout towards the long term 61 8  Fibonacci retracement level of the downswing from the 2007 crash  around 12160  On the daily chart  one can see that it has recently broken above its main moving averages and also a bearish trend line  The breakout was confirmed once the prior high around 10745 was cleared  area circled on the chart   It has since been moving higher and is now not too far off that 11200 handle  A decisive break through this level could target 11750 60  This is where the 127 2 and 161 8 per cent Fibonacci extension levels of the last two downswings converge  From there  it may pullback a little bit on profit taking before potentially pushing higher again towards that long term 61 8  Fibonacci level  see the monthly chart   Meanwhile a potentially bearish scenario would be if the index fails to crack this 11200 yet again  But the bulls will only be concerned if the index also goes on to break support at 10930  If it does  then it may push back towards 10745 before deciding on its next move

Look Ahead  Commodities
As we went to press on Friday afternoon  crude oil was trading higher  at a good  61 a barrel  Brent was also higher on the week but WTI was down as it hovered around the  49 level  The price differential between these two oil contracts had therefore grown to  12  the widest since January 2014  The widening of the price gap in part reflects the fact that the US oil output has continued to grow relentlessly despite the much weaker prices recently  This has helped to push crude stockpiles to repeated all time highs  which more or less confirms that the market is still oversupplied  As the Energy Information Administration s  EIA  latest data shows  crude inventories grew by some 8 4 million barrels last week  This was the seventh consecutive weekly increase  stocks have grown by more than 50 million barrels during this time  pushing the total to 434 1 million barrels  However there was some good news as both gasoline and distillate stocks decreased sharply last week  by a good 3 1 and 2 7 million barrels respectively  This actually caused WTI oil prices to recover somewhat in mid week and prevented a larger decline for the week as a whole  Meanwhile  the current economic conditions do not point to a marked improvement in oil demand  so any notable recovery that we may see will mostly be due to the supply side of the equation  On this front  Baker Hughes  NYSE BHI   rig count data  released on Fridays  and the usual weekly inventories reports  on Tuesdays and Wednesdays  will be among the best indicators about the future production levels  Last week  the falls in rig counts were noticeably lower compared to recent times  If this trend continues then WTI may struggle to recover much further than it already has  as nothing has been done about the supply glut in the short term which continues to exert strong downward pressure on prices 
In contrast  Brent looks more constructive  There seems to be some disquiet among the OPEC after Nigeria s oil minister  Diezani Alison Madueke  who is also the current president of the OPEC  recently said that further price volatility would make it  highly likely that I will have to call an extraordinary meeting of OPEC in the next six weeks or so   This has increased speculation that the cartel may after all cut back its production quota and thus concede some market share to shale producers  However if this is dismissed  Brent could potentially fall back significantly as investors price out the probability of a production cut 
The daily chart of Brent shows a potentially technical bullish development following this week s rally off the  58 50  59 00 support area  As can be seen  this area was previously resistance and it also corresponds with the 23 6  Fibonacci retracement level of the recent upswing  As this is a particularly shallow retracement level  it points to potentially large gains next week IF resistance around  63 00 breaks  However if the bears win this particular battle then we may see a sizeable pullback towards some of the support levels shown on the chart  with the first such level being the 38 2  retracement at just above  56  Meanwhile the chart of WTI shows a completely different picture  After creating a triple top reversal pattern early last week at  54 00  it has generally traded lower  Though it has found some support around  48 75  the short term bias would only turn bullish upon a decisive break above resistance at  51

Global Data Highlights
Monday  March 2  2015
1 45 GMT HSBC Chinese Final Manufacturing PMI  February 
There was a bit of good news from the Flash reading of this release which showed a jump back above the 50 level  indicating that there was growth in the sector  The previous two months had fallen below 50  so the fear of a slowdown for the Asian Giant was becoming justified  If this final release can maintain the positive correlation  the Chinese freakout may have to wait for another release that doesn t live up to expectations 
10 00 GMT Eurozone Flash Consumer Price Index  February 
A strange thing has happened in inflation over the last week or so as it hasn t been as bad as originally assumed in many parts of the world  The most vital for this release was German CPI this past week that rose 0 1  YoY when negative figures were expected  If that momentum can carry over to the Eurozone  the EUR may find some strength despite it being one of the more despised currencies by investors 
Tuesday  March 3  2015
1 30 GMT Japanese Labor Cash Earnings  January 
Much like the Average Hourly Earnings over in the US  this release has gained more attention for its inflationary impact  If people are making more money  they will typically have and spend more of that disposable income  which drives prices higher and leads to inflation  Since Japan has been stuck in a deflationary trap for much of the last couple decades  any signs of positive inflation are valued  Consensus is looking for a 0 6  increase which would be in line with typical readings over the past year 
4 30 GMT Reserve Bank of Australia s Interest Rate Decision and Statement
This will likely be the big market mover on this day as a majority of traders and analysts expect them to cut interest rates by 25 basis points  The AUD may lose some luster leading up to this release which opens up the possibility of a  buy the rumor  sell the news  dynamic  but in reverse  As more traders catch wind of the increased expectation of a cut  they could drive the AUD down  but if the RBA actually does what everyone anticipates  there may be no more AUD sellers to jump aboard leading to some profit taking and a rise in the AUD  Also  if they don t cut rates  a blistering rally may unfold 
Tentative New Zealand Global Dairy Trade Price Index
Milk prices have increased for five straight releases of this bi monthly report  and the NZD has rallied as a result  If the trend can continue  there may be no reason for the NZD to go anywhere but up  but if the RBA is indicating that future concerns for the region are imminent  cuts rates  and GDT misses  the NZD could fall significantly 
Wednesday  March 4  2015
9 30 GMT Markit UK Services PMI  February 
Just like most developed economies  the UK is highly dependent upon the service sector for jobs and economic might  Consensus is expecting another decent number well above the 50 level as it has been since the beginning of 2013  Therefore there may not be much fanfare surrounding this event  but if it fails to achieve that preconceived level   
13 15 GMT ADP US Employment Change  February 
This is one of the most anticipated pre NFP releases there are as it gives a very good indication to the direction of the all important employment indicator  It s no big secret that US employment has been super strong of late  so the market may be looking for any cracks in the foundation of a continued run  If ADP doesn t produce at least 200k or more  the USD could take a beating as investors prepare for a less than stellar NFP 
15 00 GMT Bank of Canada s Interest Rate Decision and Statement
BoC Governor Steven Poloz spoke this past week about  reinventing central banking  in Ontario and in his speech he mentioned that  insurance from the interest rate cut buys us some time to see how the economy actually responds   Previous to that statement  most pundits expected the BoC to cut rates again  just like they did the previous month  However  now there is a little doubt creeping in as it appears Poloz is willing to observe the effects of his initial rate cut before taking action again  This could be a boost to the CAD which has been decimated over the past month against most other currencies 
15 00 GMT ISM US Non Manufacturing PMI  February 
This is another widely followed report due to its relationship with NFP being released at the end of the week  The service sector is easily the largest provider of jobs for US citizens and the employment subcomponent of this release gives a good clue as to how NFP will turn out  If both ADP and this employment subcomponent indicate that there is a lull in hiring  anticipation of a bad NFP report could become the norm 
Thursday  March 5  2015
12 00 GMT Bank of England s Interest Rate Decision
Most likely the BoE will do absolutely nothing with their interest rate as the Monetary Policy Committee has turned more neutral than hawkish of late  However  UK economic data continues to be non alarming  which opens up the slight possibility the MPC could switch back to slightly hawkish  However  the only way we find that out is when the votes are released  which isn t with this decision  Remote as it may be for any changes to be made  we still need to pay attention to this decision as the chance of an interest rate hike would be an extremely important market moving event 
12 45 GMT European Central Bank s Interest Rate Decision  Statement  and Press Conference
The legwork for the ECB was done last month as ECB President Mario Draghi introduced the Quantitative Easing program and drove the EUR USD down below 1 11  Therefore  there may not be much to say that hasn t already been said at this meeting  The more likely outcome would be that Draghi talks about the good the QE program could bring and the positive effects they may already be experiencing because of it  If Draghi delivers that message  there may be some room to rally in EUR crosses as they have been beaten down over the last month 
Friday  March 6  2015
13 30 GMT US Non Farm Payroll  Unemployment Rate  and Average Hourly Earnings
Everything else almost feels like noise leading up to the sound when it comes to this release at the end of the week  Attention being paid to this employment number almost seems to be increasing as the years have passed  and for good reason  Last month s NFP release was ridiculously good as not only did the headline number beat expectation  previous figures were revised up  and average hourly earnings jumped too  The only blemish was the unemployment rate that went up 0 1   but that was largely because more people entered in to the job searching arena  There have now been 11 straight months of 200k  results  and consensus is expecting the 12th to happen this time around  No matter the result though  this release is bound to have an outsized impact on the market immediately as well as future implications of interest rates for the Federal Reserve down the road ",2015-03-01,Matthew Weller,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-week-ahead:-aud-shouldn’t-expect-any-help-from-the-rba-243408,243408

The Markets



Stocks plunged on Monday  dragged lower by a panic selloff in the energy sector as the price of oil charted new multi year lows  The Energy sector ETF  SPDR Energy Select Sector Fund  ARCA XLE   shed 4 05   breaking below the lows set back in October  The intermediate term trend of the sector remains negative  as suggested by the direction of the 50 day moving average  Next zone of significant support is apparent between  73 and  76  essentially forming the range from which the sector ETF broke out from in 2013  longer term implications for the sector may hinge on whether or not this range of support holds  The weakness in the sector is not all that surprising at this time of year  Recall that the period of seasonal weakness attributed to tax loss selling runs between December 5th and December 15th  on average  With Energy stocks firmly in the red for the year  the sector was the most vulnerable for declines in this end of year portfolio reallocation period  The sector is also at the time of year when the period of seasonal weakness peaks  on average    Energy is the weakest sector of the market between September 15th and December 7th  on average  the sector subsequently picks up momentum into the end of the year as investors accumulate the depressed shares  With all of this in mind  weakness over the days ahead may provide an ideal buying opportunity for a rebound bounce into year end  particularly if the range of support mentioned remains unbroken  The sector has averaged a gain 1 43  between December 18th and December 31st  outperforming the market over the short period  The sector enters a period of seasonal strength in mid to late January  running through to May 





The weakness in the Energy sector had a significant impact on the Canadian equity market  which saw the TSX Composite decline by over 3  at the session low  the benchmark subsequently rebounded into the close  ending lower by 2 28   enough for the worst one day decline since June of 2013  The bearish head and shoulders setup  identified in a previous report  remains in play  downside target of the negative pattern points to the October low around 13 700  Similar to the energy sector  the TSX Composite seasonally rebounds into the end of the year  outperforming US counterparts as the benchmark enters its period of seasonal strength that runs between December 18th and March 7th  on average  The benchmark has yet to chart a bottoming pattern following a break of the longer term trend in September  Support below the October low can be derived at 12 900  the level from which the benchmark broke out of in October of 2013  Look for possible buying opportunities in the Canadian benchmark once tax loss selling pressures fade into the latter half of the month 





On a day when losses seemed more widespread than gains  the number of NYSE listed stocks that charted new 52 week highs jumped over 65   compared to the session prior  Of course  the number of stocks that charted new 52 week lows was also elevated  surging over 120  compared to the previous day  Not only do these diverging statistics suggest indecision  they suggest rotation as investors shift from one area of the market to another as investors seek to rebalance portfolios into the end of the year    Health Care and Financials are two sectors that are seeing inflows as energy stocks are liquidated  Both the Health Care and Financial sectors remain seasonally strong into the new year 





Sentiment on Monday  as gauged by the put call ratio  ended bearish at 1 04

100246,321761,BKR,Markets Zig Zag  Bulls Will See A Base  Bears Will See A Top,opinion,"The markets continues to zig zag in 2015 
The S P 500 has now made its sixth 3 5  move since the end of December  Last week saw a reversal of the previous week s downtrend as investors became hopeful that Greece   Ukraine would move toward more positive resolutions and the bounce in Energy prices would remove any land mines from equity  bond and loan portfolios  While Greece  Ukraine and Energy dominate the headlines and are currently dictating the major swings in the market  under the surface  there are interesting gains and losses among equity sectors and sub sectors  Being a beneficiary of lower oil prices and US dollar based revenues is helping Consumer Discretionary  Retail  Housing   Autos  to outperform 
The Materials sector has also started to gain led by Miners  Chemical   Container Packaging companies who both benefit from lower energy inputs  On the flip side  interest rate sensitive sectors such as Utilities   REITs have started to see profit taking as the strengthening U S  economy causes Fed rate hike angst  Whether or not the first rate hike occurs in June or in 2016  it would seem that interest rate sensitive stocks  as well as bonds  will be playing defense in the markets as they justify every strong U S  economic data point 

Another look at the zig zags 
 The equity market is carving out a high volatility pattern  since December  SPX has lost 5   gained 6   lost 5   gained 4   lost 4   gained 4   lost 4  and now gained nearly 5   We haven t seen this degree of indecision in more than 3 years  In the past  this pattern has meant that the market is either in the process of changing trend  in this case  from up to down  or it is in a long period of consolidation  There s no clear way to know which one  In the late 1990s  a long consolidation period within a trading range of about 10  happened in 1994  1996  1997 and 1999  We haven t seen this pattern recently  but it s hardly unusual

Less than 2 500 kilometers away in Eastern Ukraine  tensions are escalating  In Brussels and other European capitals  the fear of Vladimir Putin is becoming palpable  The mood has changed in a matter of weeks from one of hand wringing impotence over Ukraine to one of foreboding  The anxiety is encapsulated in the sudden rush to Moscow by Angela Merkel and Fran ois Hollande  To senior figures closely involved in the diplomacy and policy making over Ukraine  the Franco German peace bid is less a hopeful sign of a breakthrough than an act of despair   There s nothing new in their plan  just an attempt to stop a massacre   said one senior official  Carl Bildt  the former Swedish foreign minister  said a war between Russia and the west was now quite conceivable  A senior diplomat in Brussels  echoing the broad EU view  said arming the Ukrainians would mean war with Russia  a war that Putin would win  Announcing the surprise mission to Kiev and Moscow  Hollande sounded grave and solemn  The Ukraine crisis  he said  started with differences  which became a conflict  which became a war  and which now risked becoming  total war

Crude Oil reversed hard last week  short covering or real discount buying 
Oil rallied sharply this week with WTI crude gaining 7 2   This was the biggest weekly increase since February 2011  Even with a nearly 9  pullback on Wednesday  it ended the week up almost 20  from the 29 Jan low  Brent settled 9 1  higher  While the recent wave of 2015 capex cuts from the majors was cited as a positive  the bigger tailwind was chalked up to falling U S  oil rig counts  On Friday  Baker Hughes reported that the U S  oil rig count fell 83 to 1 140  the lowest level since December 2011 and down nearly 30  since October 
However  there was a lot of skepticism about the read through for production  BofA Merrill Lynch pointed out that there have yet to be meaningful rig count declines at the key Bakken  Eagle Ford and Permian plays  It also said that given the low and lagged sensitivity of supply to price  a much bigger price decline is necessary to curtail production and balance the market  Similarly  Morgan Stanley highlighted the fact that much of the drop in the oil rig count has come in low yield vertical directional rigs  Citi noted that the oil story is much more complicated than a single data series and still bearish given that U S  crude production continues to rise and inventories continue to balloon  The inventory dynamic remained in focus as the EIA reported that crude oil supplies ended last week at their highest level in about 80 years 
Even with the excitement over the plunge in rig counts  U S  production will grow by a million barrels in 2015 over 2014 
As a result Houston  we will still have an inventory problem 
In order to fully grasp the magnitude of the recent builds in crude oil inventories  we would note that over the last four weeks total stockpiles have increased by 30 667 million barrels  The chart below shows the rolling four week changes in U S  crude oil inventories going back to 1983  As shown  at no other point in the last 32 years have crude oil inventories seen a bigger increase over a four week period

 Oil demand is notoriously insensitive to price in the short term but cumulatively and substantially sensitive as a few years pass  The Saudis are obviously expecting that these low prices will turn off U S  fracking  and I m sure they are right  Almost no new drilling programs will be initiated at current prices except by the financially desperate and the irrationally impatient  and in three years over 80  of all production from current wells will be gone 
Thus  in a few months  six to nine   I believe oil supply is likely to drop to a new equilibrium  probably in the  30 to  50 per barrel range  For the following few years  U S  fracking costs will determine the global oil balance  At each level  as prices rise more  fracking production will gear up  U S  fracking is unique in oil industry history in the speed with which it can turn on and off  In five to eight years  depending on global GDP growth and how quickly prices recover  U S  fracking production will start to peak out and the full cost of an incremental barrel of traditional oil will become  once again  the main input into price  This is believed to be about  80 today and rising  In five to eight years it is likely to be  100 to  150 in my opinion  U S  fracking reserves that are available up to  120 a barrel are probably only equal to about one year of current global demand  This is absolutely not another Saudi Arabia

As mentioned  someone pulled a big plug out of Utility stocks on Friday 
Bond prices fell sharply on Friday as yields surged  Chart 5 shows the 20 Year Treasury Bond iShares  ARCA TLT  falling sharply in heavier trading  That made utilities the day s weakest stock group  and the only sector to end the week in the red   Chart 6 shows the Utilities Sector SPDR  NYSE XLU  tumbling 4  on Friday in heavy trading  Its relative strength line  top of chart  also fell sharply  The XLU broke its 50 day average for the first time in four months  Utilities compete with bonds for yield  and are hurt when rates jump  REITs  which are also hurt by rising rates  lost  3  on Friday 
Also something to watch  the ever flattening yield curve made a sharp reversal last week  The trend is still toward flattening but keep an eye for a permanent reversal which would help bank stocks and other spread investors 

As mentioned earlier  Consumer Discretionary is now driving the market 
There s been much said and written about rapidly declining crude oil prices  WTIC   But one thing makes perfect sense to me  When American consumers save TONS of money when filling up at the pump  they tend to spend it elsewhere  It s simply what we like to do   SPEND  So it s not too surprising to me that many consumer discretionary companies are beginning to see huge benefits in terms of price appreciation 
Another sector that is now populating the all time high lists is Aerospace and Defense 
Their performance should not be surprising given the profit surges at their Airline customers 

Still one of the most conflicting items in the financial markets is between Equities and Junk Bonds 
I mention high yield credit often in the weekly note because typically the markets move in tandem and thus one can help predict the direction of the other  But since the middle of 2015  this correlation has been broken  I still believe the two must converge but the question is how  Will Stocks fall  Junk rise or a bit of both  Maybe Junk found its low in December on the heels of the Energy price break  If so  this could be a top asset for 2015  especially with the overall strength in the U S  economic data  Here is a good chart showing the divergence from the team at Leuthold   The Leuthold Group 
One reason that High Yield could win is because its bonds still have a POSITIVE yield  unlike Finland 
Finland became the first government to auction five year notes at a negative yield in the history of the euro area as investors took advantage of the European Central Bank s planned sovereign bond purchases  Finland s average yield of minus 0 017 percent in an auction of September 2020 bonds compares with a low of 0 04 percent for Germany and 0 025 percent for Austria  according to data compiled by Bloomberg  The northernmost euro member raised 1 billion euros   1 1 billion   selling 0 375 percent securities  with bids exceeding supply by 1 7 times  the Helsinki based Treasury said on its Bloomberg page 
Actually  now 35  of Europe government debt now has negative yields   Schuldensuehner  Why investors buy bonds w  negative yields and pay for lending money 
And as global investors look for positive returns  a New York City hotel sets a new price record 
 New York s Baccarat Hotel has yet to check in a single guest  but it is about to become the most highly valued hotel in the U S  after a Chinese insurer agreed to buy it for more than  230 million  Sunshine Insurance Group Co  is paying real estate mogul Barry Sternlicht s firm and a partner more than  2 million a room for the Midtown Manhattan property  according to people familiar with the matter  One person said the valuation beats the previous record set by the Plaza Hotel  the New York landmark that was sold in 2012 to India s Sahara Group for  2 04 million a room  according to hotel data tracker STR Analytics 
The Baccarat is the latest trophy property to wind up in the hands of Chinese investors in recent months as buyers take advantage of new rules allowing them to invest more easily abroad  Real estate brokers and analysts said Chinese companies see luxury hotels  especially in major global capitals  as long term investments that can provide steady income in a period of low interest rates
Even fine art set a new price record last week 
 A colorful painting of two Tahitian women by Paul Gauguin has reportedly been sold by a Swiss family foundation to a group of state museums in Qatar for nearly  300 million  a record sum for a single work of art  The price would best the roughly  250 million that Qatar paid three years ago for Paul Cezanne s  The Card Players   and underscores the purchasing power and ambitions of the nation

100301,321816,BKR,Baker Hughes Looks Like A Winner,opinion,"Baker Hughes Incorporated  NYSE BHI   does a lot of stuff for Oil and Gas companies  What it is is not really that important  Just know that if people are drilling for anything they win  It is a large cap company and the chart is ready to move in the short run  But it also looks good from a longer perspective  Take a look 

The daily chart above shows the rising trend since January and most recently the move higher from that trend in mid April  That move has been consolidating in a bullish flag and targets a move to 76 on a break higher that looks to be beginning  But the stock looks great technically from a longer term perspective as well  The Monthly chart below shows it in the midst of a bearish Deep Crab  that has a Potential Reversal Zone  PRZ  at 131 87 above  That is a long way up  It is hard to get too excited about the prospect of that move with resistance at 81 and 90 higher  But keeping with the mosaic view of technical analysis the 3 Box Reversal Point and Figure Chart carries a price objective of 91  I can get a lot more excited about a potential move from 70 to 91  when the short term chart shows a catalyst to start and the longer views are pointing higher 
Trade Plan 
I bought the stock just under 70 and collared it with a July 70 67 5 Put Spread and July 75 Call for free  The company reports July 18th before the market opens  the same day that the options expire  On a run higher I will adjust it up

100372,321887,BKR,Low Oil Prices Lead To Economic Peak Oil,opinion,We have all heard the story about oil supply supposedly rising and falling for geological reasons  But what if the story is a little different from this oil production rises and falls for economic reasons  If this is the issue  it doesn t really matter how much oil is in the ground  What matters is if economic conditions are  right  for continued and rising extraction  I have shown in previous posts that oil prices that are too high are a problem for oil importers while oil prices that are too low are a problem for oil exporters  As a result  oil prices need to be in a   or we have serious problems of one sort or another  As long as the price of oil keeps rising  there is at least some chance the amount of oil extracted each year will keep rising  because more oil resources will become economic to extract  The real problem arises when oil price falls back from a price level it has held  as it has done recently  and as it did back in July 2008  Then there is a real chance that investment will become non economic  and because of this  oil production will fall Figure 1  World crude oil price and production  based on monthly EIA data The corresponding price in late April is approximately  100 barrel  so is even lower yet  Oil prices play multiple roles  1  High oil prices encourage extraction from more difficult locations  because the higher cost covers the additional extraction costs  2  High oil prices allow exporters to have adequate money to pacify their populations  even if their oil exports have been declining  as they have been for many exporters  3  High oil prices allow funds for investment in new oil fields  as old ones deplete  4  High oil prices tend to put oil importing countries into recession  because it raises the costs of goods and services produced  without raising the salaries of the workers  In fact  there is evidence that high oil prices lower wages  both directly and through lower workforce participation   5  High oil prices make countries that use large amounts of oil less competitive with countries that use less fuel in general  and less oil in particular  When oil prices decline  it is evidence that Items 4 and 5 above are outweighing Items 1  2  and 3  This tips the scale in the direction of a fall in oil production Debt also affects oil prices  As long as investors have faith that businesses can make money  despite high oil prices  they will continue to borrow to expand their businesses  This additional debt helps drive up demand for goods and services of all kinds  including oil  so oil prices rise  Also  if consumers are able to borrow increasing amounts of money  this also drives up demand for goods that use oil  such as cars  But once the debt bubble bursts  it is easy for oil prices fall very far  very fast  as they did in 2008 If we look at the 2008 situation  oil limits were very much behind the overall problem  even though most people do not recognize this connection  It was the fact that oil limits eventually led to credit limits that caused the system  including oil prices  to crash as it did  High oil prices led to debt defaults and bank write offs  and eventually led to a huge credit contraction in economies of the developed world  This credit contraction affected not just oil demand  but demand for other energy products as well The problems of the 2008 period were never really solved  the lack of growth in world oil supply remains  and this lack of growth in world oil supply continues to hold back world economic growth  particularly in developed countries  We recently have not been feeling the effects as much  because with deficit spending  the problems have largely moved from the private sector to the government sector The situation remains a tinderbox  however  The financial situation is propped up by ultra low interest rates  continued government deficit spending  and   In a finite world  debt growth cannot continue indefinitely  But if debt growth permanently stops  and switches to contraction  we would end up in an even worse financial mess than in 2008  In fact  such a change would very likely to would lead to a contraction of    proportions In this post  I will explain some of these issues further The Rise and Fall of Oil Prices in 2008In Figure 1  near the top of this post   a person can see huge swings in oil prices  with virtually no change in oil production  If the scale on oil production is modified as in Figure 2 below  a person can see that indeed  oil prices and oil production do to some extent vary together Figure 2  World crude oil production and Brent oil prices  based on monthly EIA data  with different scale for oil production If we look at world oil production and price between January 1998 and July 2008 on an X Y graph  we see that as long as oil demand stayed below 71 million barrels a day  oil price stayed low  Figure 3  below   But once demand started to push above that level  oil price started to rise rapidly  with little increase in production  It was as if a brick wall on oil supply had been hit  No matter how much the oil price rose  virtually no more production was available Figure 3  X Y graph of world of monthly world oil production and price data  based on the EIA data shown in Figures 1 and 2 If we look at an X Y graph of the non OPEC portion of oil supply  we see that the situation was even worse for the non OPEC portion  Figure 4  below   The amount of oil that could be produced at a given price had actually begun to fall back  While in 2003 and 2004  non OPEC had been able to produce 42 million barrels a day for only  30 barrel  by 2008  non OPEC could not reach 42 million barrels a day  no matter how high the price  It looked as though non OPEC had hit  peak oil  production  Geological limits appeared to have the upper hand  Figure 4  X Y graph of world of non OPEC world oil production and price data  based on EIA data  Fortunately  during this period OPEC was able to raise its production somewhat  in response to higher prices  as illustrated in Figure 5  below  Between July 2007 and July 2008  it was able to raise oil production by 2 1 million barrels a day  in response to a  56 dollar a barrel increase in price in a one year time period   The small increase in response to a huge price rise suggests that  was not nearly as great as claimed  however   Figure 5  X Y Graph of OPEC oil production and price  based on EIA data What brought about the collapse in oil prices in July 2008  I believe it was ultimately a financial limit that was reached that eventually worked its way to the credit markets  Once the credit markets were affected  individuals and businesses were not able to borrow as much  and it was this lack of credit that cut back demand for many types of products  including oil The way this cutback in credit came about was as follows  Oil prices had been rising for a very long time since about 2003  affecting the inflation rate in food and fuel prices  The Federal Reserve Open Market Committee tried  unsuccessfully  to get oil prices down by raising target interest rates  I describe this in an article published in the journal Energy called   Oil Supply Limits and the Continuing Financial Crisis   available here or here  The combination of high oil prices and higher interest rates led to falling housing prices starting in 2006  big oops for the Federal Reserve   and debt defaults  particularly among the most vulnerable  those with sub price mortgages   As early as 2007  large banks had large debt write offs  lowering their appetite for more debt of questionable quality  Total US household mortgage debt reached its maximum point on June 30  2008  and began to fall the following quarter Figure 6  US Mortgage Debt Outstanding  based on Federal Reserve Z1 Report By July 2008  the financial problems of consumers in response to high oil prices and falling housing prices had transferred to other credit markets as well  Revolving credit outstanding  mostly credit card debt   hit a maximum in July 2008  and has not recovered  Figure 7 below    July 2008 is exactly the same month as oil prices began to fall   Non revolving credit  such as auto loans  hit a maximum in the same month  Figure 7  US Revolving Debt Outstanding  mostly credit card debt  based on monthly data of the Federal Reserve  Credit issues kept getting worse  The Federal takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac took place in September 2008  as did the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers  By late 2008  cutbacks in credit had spread to businesses including all sectors of the energy industry  I wrote an article on December 1  2008  documenting that credit issues led to lower prices not only for oil  but for coal  natural gas  nuclear  and renewables as well  The reason why a cutback in credit availability is a problem is because it is very difficult to buy a new car or home  or to finance a new business operation  if credit isn t available  In fact  the amount a business or family can spend depends on the sum of their income during a period  plus the amount of additional debt they take on during that period  If the amount of debt outstanding is going down  then  for example  old credit card debt is being paid down faster than new credit card is being added  and the amount currently spent is lower  The Federal Government tried to fix the situation by running larger deficits  Figure 8   starting the very next quarter after oil prices hit a peak and started declining   Figure 8  US Federal Debt  from Federal Reserve Z 1 Report   Excludes debt owed to Social Security and other Federal programs   Oil prices rose again starting in 2009 as demand outside the US  Europe  and Japan continued to grow  By 2011  high oil prices were back  The economies of US  Europe and Japan did not bounce back to the kind of economic growth most expected  because at high oil prices  their products were not competitive in a world marketplace that relied on an energy mix that was slanted more toward coal  which is cheaper   and also offered lower wages  In 2013  world oil supply is still constrained  It is easy to get the idea from news reports that everything is rosy  but the story presented to us is painted to look much better than it really is  Production from existing sites is constantly depleting  In order to replace declining production  huge investment must be made in new productive capacity  It is as if oil producers must keep running  just to stay in place  Part of the problem is that the cost of new capacity keeps escalating  I have called this the Investment Sinkhole Problem  The Financial Times describes the problem as   Cash flow has historically financed much investment  Now we read    Many naive people believe Saudi Arabia s stories about their  productive capacity  of 12 5 million barrels a day  but their maximum crude and condensate production in recent years has been only been 10 040 000  according to the EIA  Their recent production has been only a little over 9 million barrels a day in recent months  according to  Iraq is supposed to be the great hope for future oil production  yet it increasingly seems to be   Russia is now the largest oil producer in the world  with a little over 10 0 million barrels a day of crude and condensate production    Gas condensate production is the real driver behind the  recent  growth  Crude oil output is falling and organic growth currently is impossible   What we tend to hear a lot about is US tight oil possibilities  Figure 9    Figure 9  US crude oil production  based on EIA data  2012 data estimated based on partial year data  Tight oil split is author s estimate based on state distribution of oil supply increases  Admittedly  tight oil production has ramped up quickly  But it is an expensive technology  that requires a high oil price  and lots upfront investment  There is evidence that such oil is concentrated in  sweet spots  and these get tapped out quickly  In North Dakota  the earliest area for US tight oil extraction  rig count is down from 203 at the beginning of June  2012  to 176 at April 19  2013  according to   Lynn Helms  Director of the North Dakota Department of Mineral Services    Rapidly escalating costs have consumed capital spending budgets faster than many companies anticipated and uncertainty surrounding future federal policies on hydraulic fracturing is impacting capital investment decisions   Meanwhile     perhaps because of weather  perhaps because of other issues as well  The ramp up in US crude oil production amounted to 812 000 barrels a day in 2012 very small in comparison to world crude oil needs  World oil production  shown in Figures 1 and 2  is barely affected  In a world with 7 billion people  most of whom would like vehicles  the amount of oil supply being added is tiny  In 2013  the financial problems of the United States  the Euro zone  and Japan haven t gone away  Current high oil prices make the big oil importing countries less competitive  It is hard to compete with countries with lower average fuel costs  thanks a mix that it much heavier on coal  and lighter on oil  A graph of oil consumption shows that oil is increasingly going to the Rest of the World  rather than the US  EU  and Japan  Figure 10    Figure 10  Oil consumption by part of the world  based on EIA data  2012 world consumption data estimated based on world  all liquids  production amounts  The countries that see little growth in oil consumption are the same ones struggling with low economic growth  Low economic growth makes debt very difficult to repay  Governments are tempted to add more debt  to try to fix their problems  Tackling government debt problems in 2013 tends to bring recession back  The big problem when oil prices rise is that workers  discretionary income is squeezed  because their wages don t rise at the same time  This problem can somewhat be offset by deficit spending of governments for programs to help the unemployed  and for stimulus  Once taxes are raised  or benefits are cut  the old problem of lower discretionary income for workers reappears  Thus  the recession that governments so cleverly found a way around previously  re emerges  In 2005  there was a very sharp impact to oil prices when high oil prices indirectly affected the credit system  This time  a big issue is rising government taxes and lower benefits  These are staggered in their implementation  so the effect feeds in more slowly  Greece and Spain started their cut backs early  The US raised Social Security taxes by 2  of wages  as of January 1  2013  Later it added sequester cuts  All of these effects feed in slowly  and add up  With respect to debt  in 2013 we are rapidly approaching the time when this time truly is different  There has been a great deal in the press about a  in their book  This Time Is Different  I think Rienhart and Rogoff  as well as economists in general  have missed an issue that is much more basic  In a finite world  debt  like anything else  cannot keep growing  The economy  whether economists realize it or not  depends on physical resources  and these are in limited supply  One piece of evidence with respect to the limited supply of oil is the fact that the cost of its extraction keeps rising  This means that fewer resources are available to be used for making other goods and services  I show in my paper    that lower economic growth rates make debt harder to repay  Reinhart and Rogoff seem to confirm this relationship works in practice  In their NBER paper      they make the observation   It is notable that the non defaulters  by and large  are all hugely successful growth stories   They did not seem to understand why  though   The 2007 2009 recession partially brought the level of debt down  outside the government sector  Government debt has been ramping up rapidly because tax revenues are down and benefits are up  Figure 8    Figure 11  US Debt by Sector  based on Federal Reserve Z 1 data   Amounts shown exclude government debt that is not publicly held   Government debt helps take the place of  missing  debt from other sectors  at least in theory   Now government debt is above acceptable levels  US debt is around 100  of GDP  and growing each quarter  Without rapid economic growth  only a small portion of the debt that remains can be repaid  If increases in taxes cutback in benefits leave more without work  a new round of debt defaults can be expected  Student loans are particularly at risk  Business loans maybe a problem as well  especially in discretionary industries  Government debt is likely to be a problem  especially for states and municipalities  Banks may again have financial problems  especially if they have exposure to debt from other countries  or student loans  I am not certain what will happen to the huge amount of US government debt  if ever stops  The same might be said of the debt of all of the other countries doing quantitative easing  Who will buy the debt  And at what interest rate  If the interest rate rises  there will be a huge problem  because suddenly loans of all types will have higher interest rates  Governments will need higher taxes yet  to pay their debts  It will be hard to sell cars with higher interest rates on debt  Home prices will likely drop  because fewer people can afford to buy homes with higher interest rates  I showed in Reaching Debt Limits what a big difference increases in household debt can make to per capita income  Figure 12    Figure 12  Per capita wages  excluding government wages  similar to Figure 5  Also  the sum of per capita wages and the increase in household debt  also on a per capita basis  and also increased to 2012  level using the CPI Urban  Amounts from US BEA Table 2 1 and Federal Reserve Z1 Report  If debt starts long term contraction  we will truly have a mess on our hands  Businesses will have a hard time investing  Individuals will have a hard time buying big ticket items  like cars  furniture  and houses  Demand for all types of goods and services will fall  I showed in my post Why Malthus Got His Forecast Wrong that increasing debt was what allowed rapid growth in fossil fuel use  If debt stops growing and starts shrinking  we will get to see the reverse of this phenomenon  What is Ahead  Lower oil prices indicate that demand is declining   The cost of extraction is not lower   Lower oil demand seems to be related to poorer earnings reports for the first quarter of 2013  which in turn is at least partly related to the increase in US Social Security taxes withheld  starting January 1  2013  Nothing will necessarily happen quickly  but by next quarter s earnings reports  some of the  sequester  cuts will be added to the cuts  Businesses with poor earnings are likely to lay off workers  and those workers will file for unemployment benefits  Gradually  we will see increasing evidence of recession  It is not clear that this time will necessarily lead to the  all time  switch to long term debt contraction  but it will bring us one step closer  at least in US  and probably in Europe and Japan as well  Oil supply may not drop very much  very quickly  If we are lucky  demand will bounce back and bring prices back up  as in 2009 2010  But with all of the debt problems around the world  it is possible that a contagion will begin  and defaults in one country will spread to other countries  This is what is truly frightening ,2013-04-22,Gail Tverberg,https://www.investing.com/analysis/low-oil-prices-lead-to-economic-peak-oil-163873,163873

100399,321914,BKR,The Hype Over Natural Gas,opinion,We keep hearing about the many benefits of natural gas    how burning it releases less CO2 than oil or coal  and how it burns with few impurities  so that it lacks the pollution problems of coal  We also hear about the possibilities of releasing huge amounts of new natural gas supplies  through the fracking of shale gas  Reported reserves for natural gas also seem to be quite high  especially in the Middle East and the Former Soviet Union Lead Time RequiredBut I think that people who are counting on natural gas to solve the world s energy problems are  counting their chickens before they are hatched   Natural gas is a fuel that requires a lot of infrastructure in order for anything to  happen   As a result  it needs a lot of up front investment  and several years time delay  It also needs changes on the consumption side  requiring further investment  that will allow this natural gas to be used  If the cost is higher than competing fuels  this becomes a problem as well In many ways  natural gas consumption is captive to other things that are happening in the economy  an economy that is industrializing rapidly will easily be able to consume more natural gas  but an economy in decline will find it hard to scrape together funds for new ways of doing what was done previously  now with natural gas  Increased use of renewables seems to call for additional use of natural gas for balancing  but even this is not certain  because in many parts of the world  natural gas is a high priced imported fuel  Political instability  often linked to high oil and food prices  creates a poor atmosphere for new Liquefied Natural Gas  LNG  facilities  no matter how attractive the pricing may seem to be In the U S   we have already  hit the wall  on how much natural gas can be absorbed into the system or used to offset imports  U S  natural gas production has been flat since November 2011  based on EIA data  Figure 1  below  Even with this level of production  and a large shift in electricity production from coal to natural gas  natural gas is still on the edge of  maxing out  its storage system before winter hits  Figure 2  below  World Natural Gas ProductionThe past isn t the future  but it does give a little bit of understanding regarding what the underlying trends are World natural gas production consumption  Figure 3  has been increasing  recently averaging about 2 7  a year  If we compare natural gas to other energy sources  it has been second to coal in terms of the amount by which it has contributed to the total increase in world energy supplies in the last five years  Figure 4   This comparison is made by converting all amounts to  barrels of oil equivalent   and computing the increase between 2006 and 2011 In order for natural gas to be an energy savior for the world  natural gas consumption would need to increase far more than 2 7  per year  and outdistance the increase in coal consumption each year  While a modest increase from past patterns is quite possible  I don t expect a miracle from natural gas Natural Gas  What s Changed The basic thing that has changed is that fracking now permits extraction of shale gas  in addition to other types of gas   if other conditions are met as well Selling price is high enough  probably higher than for other types of natural gas produced Water is available for frackingGovernments permit frackingInfrastructure is available to handle the fracked gasEven before the discovery of shale gas  reported world natural gas reserves were quite high relative to natural gas production  63 6 times 2011 production  according to BP   Reserves might theoretically be even higher  with additional shale gas discoveries In addition  the use of Liquified Natural Gas  LNG  for export is also increasing  making it possible to ship previously  stranded  natural gas  such as that in Alaska  This further increases the amount of natural gas available to world markets What s Stopping Greater Natural Gas Usage 1  Price Competition From CoalOne major use for natural gas is making electricity  If locally produced coal is available  it likely will produce electricity more cheaply than natural gas  The reason shale gas recently could be sold for electricity production in the United States is because the selling price for natural gas dropped below the equivalent price for coal  The  catch  was that shale gas producers were losing money at this price  and have since dropped back their production   If the natural gas price increases enough for shale gas to be profitable  electricity production will again move back toward coal Many other parts of the world also have coal available  acting as a cap on the amount of fracked natural gas likely to be produced  A carbon tax might change this within an individual country  but those without such a tax will continue to prefer the lower price product 2  Growing Internal Natural Gas Use Cuts Into ExportsThis is basically the Exportland model issue  raised by Jeffrey Brown with respect to oil  but for natural gas  If we look at Africa s natural gas production  consumption  and exports  this is what we see In Africa   mostly northern Africa  which exports to Europe and Israel   consumption has been rising fast enough that exports have leveled off and show signs of declining 3  Political InstabilityOften  countries with large natural gas resources are ones with large oil resources as well  If oil production starts to drop off  and as a result oil export revenue drops off  a country is likely to experience political instability  A good example of this is Egypt No matter how much natural gas Egypt may have  it would not make sense for a company to put in an LNG train or more pipeline export capability  because the political situation is not stable enough  Egypt needs oil exports to fund its social programs  The smaller funding amount available from natural gas exports is not enough to make up that gap  so it is hard to see natural gas making up the gap  even if it were available in significant quantity Iran is a country with large natural gas reserves  It is reportedly looking into extracting natural gas for export  Again  we have a political stability issue  Here we have an international sanctions issue as well 4   Need The Natural Gas For Myself Later  ViewA country  such as Egypt or the United States or Britain  that has been  burned  by declining oil production may think twice about exporting natural gas  Even if the country doesn t need it now  there is a possibility that vehicles using natural gas could be implemented later  in their own country  thus helping to alleviate the oil shortage  Also  there are risks and costs involved with fracking  that they may not choose to incur  if the benefit is to go to exporters 5  Cost Of Investment For Additional Natural Gas ConsumptionIn order to use more natural gas  considerable investment is needed  New pipelines likely need to be added  Homeowners and businesses may need to purchase gas fired furnaces to raise demand  If it is decided to use natural gas vehicles  there is a need for the new vehicles themselves  plus service stations and people trained to fix the new vehicles  Additional natural gas storage may be needed as well  Additional industrial production is difficult to add  unless wages are low enough that the product being sold will be competitive on the world market Existing  pushes  toward better insulation have the effect of reducing the amount of natural gas used for heating homes and businesses  so work in the opposite direction  So do new techniques for making nitrogen based fertilizer using coal  rather than using natural gas 6  Touchy Balance Between Supply And ConsumptionIf additional production is added  but additional uses are not  we have already seen what happens in the United States  Storage facilities get overly full  the price of natural gas drops to unacceptably low levels  and operators scramble to cut back production The required balance between production and consumption is very  touchy   It can be thrown off by only a few percent change in production or consumption  Thus an unusually warm winter  as the United States experienced last year  played a role in the overly full storage problem  A ramp up of production of only a few percent can also cause an out of balance situation  Unless a developer has multiple buyers for its gas  or a  take or pay  long term contract  it risks the possibility that the gas that is has developed will not be wanted at an adequate price 7  Huge Upfront Investment RequirementsThere are multiple requirements for investing in new shale gas developments  Each individual well costs literally millions of dollars to drill and frack  The cost will not be paid back for several years  or perhaps ever  if the selling price is not high enough   so debt financing is generally needed  If fracking is done  a good supply of water is needed  This is likely to be a problem in dry countries such as China  There is a need for trained personnel  drilling rigs of the right type  and adequate pipelines to put the new gas into  While these things are available in the United States  it likely will take years to develop adequate supplies of them elsewhere  All of the legislation that regulates drilling and enables pipeline building  needs to be in place as well  Laws need to be friendly to fracking  as well Growth In Exports To DateExports grew as a percentage of natural gas use through about 2007 or 2008 In recent years  natural gas exports have fallen slightly as a percentage of total gas extracted  Thus  if world natural gas supplies have risen by an average of 2 7  per year for the past five years  exports available for import have risen a little less rapidly than the 2 7  per year increase  A major ramp up in export capability would be needed to change this trend While we hear a lot about the rise in exports using LNG  its use does not seem to be adding to the overall percentage of natural gas exported  Instead  there has been a shift in the type of export capacity being added  There are still a few pipelines being added  such as the Nord Stream pipline  from Russia to Germany   but these are increasingly the exception The Shale Gas Pricing DebateExactly what price is needed for shale gas to be profitable is subject to debate  Shale gas requires the payment of huge up front costs  Once they are drilled and  fracked   they will produce for a long period  Company models assume that they will last as long as 40 years  but geologist Arthur Berman of The Oil Drum claims substantial numbers are closed down in as few as six years  because they are not producing enough natural gas to justify their ongoing costs  There is also a question as to whether the best locations are drilled first Logically a person would expect shale gas to be quite a bit more expensive to produce than other natural gas because it is trapped in much smaller pores  and much more force is required to extracted it  In terms of the resource triangle that I sometimes show  Figure 8  below   it epitomizes the low quality  hard to extract resource near the bottom of the triangle that is available in abundance  We usually start at the top of the resource triangle  and extract the easiest and cheapest to extract first Berman claims that prices  8 68 or higher per million Btu are needed for profitability of Haynesville Shale  and nearly as high prices are needed to justify drilling other US shale plays  The current US price is about  3 50 per million Btu  so to be profitable  the price would need to be more than double the current US price  Prices for natural gas in Europe are much higher  averaging  11 08 per million Btu in September 2012  but shale gas extraction costs may be higher there as well The U S  Energy Information Administration admits it doesn t know how the economics will work out  and gives a range of projected prices  It is clear from the actions of the natural gas industry that current prices are a problem  According to Baker Hughes  the number of drilling rigs engaged in natural gas drilling has dropped from 936 one year ago to 422  for the week ended October 12  2012 Backup For RenewablesOne area where natural gas excels is as a back up for intermittent renewable energy  since it can ramp up and down quickly  So this is one area where a person might expect growth  Such a possibility is not certain  though 1  How much will intermittent renewables continue to ramp up  Governments are getting poorer  and have less funds available to subsidize them  They do not compete well on when they go head to head with fossil fuels  nuclear  and hydroelectric 2  When intermittent renewables are subsidized with feed in tariffs  and requirements that wind power be given priority over fossil fuels  it can provide such an unlevel playing field that it is difficult for natural gas to be profitable  This is especially the case in locations where natural gas is already higher priced than coal The Societal  Recipe  ProblemOur economy is built of many interdependent parts  Each business is added  taking into account what businesses already are in place  and what laws are in effect  Because of the way the economy currently operates  it uses a certain proportion of oil  a certain proportion of natural gas  and more or less fixed proportions of other types of energy  The number of people employed tends to vary  too  with the size of the economy  with a larger economy demanding more employees Proportions of businesses and energy use can of course change over time  In fact  there is some flexibility built in  In particular  in the U S   we have a surplus of natural gas electricity generating units  installed in the hope that they would be used more than they really are  and the energy traded long distance  But there is less flexibility elsewhere  The cars most people drive use gasoline  and the only way to cut back is to drive less  Our furnaces use a particular fuel  and apart from adjusting the temperature setting  or adding insulation  it is hard to make a change in this  We only make major changes when it comes time to sell a car  replace a furnace  or add a new factory Not Enough Cheap OilIn my view  the major issue the world has been dealing with in recent years is an inadequate supply of cheap oil  High priced oil tends to constrict the economy  because it causes consumers to cut back on discretionary spending  People in discretionary industries are laid off  and they tend to also spend less  and sometimes default on their loans  Governments find themselves in financial difficulty when they collect fewer taxes and need to pay out more in benefits  While this issue is still a problem in the U S   the government has been able to cover up this effect up in several ways  ultra low interest rates  a huge amount of deficit spending  and  quantitive easing    The effect is still there  and pushing us toward the  fiscal cliff  The one sure way to ramp up natural gas usage is for the economy as a whole to grow  If this happens  natural gas usage will grow for two reasons   1  The larger economy will use more gas  and  2  the growth in the economy will add more opportunities for new businesses  and these new businesses will have the opportunity to utilize more natural gas  if the price is competitive I have compared the situation with respect to limited oil supply as being similar to that of a baker  who is trying to bake a batch of cookies that calls for two cups of flour  but who has only one cup of flour  The baker is able to make only half a batch  Half of the other ingredients will go unused as well  because the batch is small To me  discovering that we have more natural gas than we had before  is analogous to the baker discovering that instead of having a dozen eggs in his refrigerator  there are actually two dozen in his refrigerator  In fact  he finds he can even go and buy more eggs  if he is willing to pay double the price he is accustomed to paying  But the eggs really do not fix the missing cup of flour problem  unless someone can find a way to change eggs into flour very cheaply Basic Energy TypesTo me  the most basic forms of energy resources are  1  coal and  2  oil  Both can be transported easily  if it is possible to extract them  Natural gas is very much harder to transport and store  so it is in many ways less useful  It can be made work in combination with oil and coal  because the use of coal and oil make it possible to build pipelines and make devices to provide compression to the gas  With coal and oil  it is also possible to make and maintain electric transmission lines to transport electricity made with natural gas I sometimes talk about renewable energy being a  fossil fuel extender   because they hopefully make fossil fuels  go farther   In some ways  I think natural gas is an extender for oil and coal  It is hard to imagine a society powered only by natural gas  because of the difficulties in using it  and the major changes required to use it exclusively In the earliest days  natural gas was simply a  waste product  of oil extraction  It was  flared  to get rid of it  In many parts of the world  natural gas is still flared  because the effort it takes to collect it  transport it  and make it into a useful product is still too high The hope that natural gas will be the world s energy savior depends on our ability to make this former waste product into a product that will replace oil and coal  But unless we can put together an economy that needs and uses it  most of it probably will be left in the ground  The supposedly very high reserves will do us no good About Gail Tverberg My name is Gail Tverberg  I am an actuary interested in finite world issues    oil

100458,321973,BKR,Is the US Close To Becoming A Net Oil Exporter ,opinion,Countries trade crude oil and oil products back and forth  When all of these transactions are netted out  is the US close to becoming a  net  oil exporter With the recent increase in oil production  perhaps even exceeding that of Russia on a  barrels per day  basis   a person might think that US oil production problems are behind us  If we look at the data  though  it is very clear that the US is still a long way from becoming a net oil exporter There are several reasons for confusion  One is the fact that excess refinery capacity can lead to the ability to export both gasoline and diesel  even though the United States continues to import large amounts of crude oil  Another is that tight oil  extracted through  fracking   is growing from a small base  but can t necessarily ramp up very far  very quickly  Another source of confusion is with respect to how different types of liquids should be combined for comparison purposes In this post  I would like to explain why the idea that the US is about to become a net oil exporter is simply a myth  1  On what basis does the US Energy Information Administration  EIA  make forecasts of oil and other energy supplies When the EIA makes forecasts of oil and other supplies  as in its recently issued   it looks at future consumption and future supplies in terms of the amount of energy supplied in Btus  In doing this calculation  oil is combined with natural gas liquids  Biofuels  which in the case of the US are almost entirely corn ethanol  are treated separately  as part of  renewables     It seems to me that the EIA s approach is about the only reasonable way of making comparisons  since it is energy value  and not volume  barrels of oil per day   that is important  Furthermore  if we are talking about oil imports and exports  we want to know about oil  perhaps including natural gas liquids  which are sort of like oil  by itself  Biofuels are a separate issue    2  Where are we now  relative to being an oil exporter  On a Btu basis  the US imported 58  of the oil it consumed in 2011  This percentage is down from a high of 67  in 2005 and 2006  but it is still very high Figure 1  US oil imports as a percentage of the oil consumed in the US   calculated using EIA Btu amounts for oil and natural gas liquids  If the US wants to become an oil exporter  it must first get its imports down from 58  to 0   and then ramp up production by enough to have oil to export as well    3  What does the US Energy Information Administration  EIA  forecast regarding oil imports exports    In EIA s   EIA gives the following forecast to 2035   2010 and prior data are actual amounts   Figure 2  Comparison of forecast oil production  AEO Figure 12  and forecast oil consumption  AEO Figure 8   based on EIA s AEO 2012 Early Release We can use the forecast in Figure 2 to create a graph similar to Figure 1  but with the EIA s forecast included  Such a graph is shown as Figure 3 below Figure 3  AEO 2012 Forecast of Percentage of Oil Btus ImportedThis graph indicates that while percentage of oil imported will drop a little  from 58  down to about 50  or 51    the United States will not become an oil exporter before 2035 4  How about if we make our own forecast regarding when we will become a net oil exporter  based on how consumption and production have been trending recently Yes  we can do this  I do this in Figure 4  below Figure 4  US oil production and consumption  based on recent trends  Historical data form EIA  Trends selected by author Based on this approach  if the US could keep up the current trend  we would become an oil exporter in 2028  which is 16 years from now  This result is better than the EIA s forecast  but is still a long ways away    5  Isn t the production of tight oil  obtained by  fracking   doing very well    Yes  it is  According to the    a graph of tight oil production by play is as shown in Figure 5  below  Tight oil is the oil that is typically extracted by horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing  It comes from shale and other very low permeability rocks  Figure 5  Tight oil production by play  from the EIA s publication   This Week in Petroleum   March 14  2012 This graphic indicates that tight oil provided about 850 000 barrels a day of oil  as of November 2011  The United States  lets say 18 5 million barrels a day  The 850 000 barrels a day of tight oil amounts to a little less than 5  of the 18 5 million barrels a day we consume  so is only a small fraction of what we use today  If we look at a graph of recent US crude oil production by area  this is what it looks like Figure 6  US crude oil production by area  based on EIA data Bakken tight oil is in North Dakota  which corresponds to the purple area in Figure 6 above  The Eagle Ford play  as well as some of the smaller plays  are in Texas  which is shown in red  At the same time these two sources of production increased  deepwater production decreased  so the total increase in US crude oil production was less than the increase in tight oil production We have a long term problem with declining oil production on older fields  illustrated in Figure 6   so we can expect that such declines will continue  As a result  whatever new production we gain from tight oil or other new sources is likely to be offset by declines elsewhere  It is only to the extent that new production is greater than these declines that overall US production will rise 6  Can t we just keep ramping up the tight oil production  by drilling more We can probably ramp up production by drilling some more wells  but at some point we start running into limits of suitable horizontal drilling rigs and of trained workers  Figure 7  EIA exhibit of rig counts by orientation  based on Baker Hughes data  Exhibit from This Week in Petroleum  March 14  2012    The figure above shows that there has been a big shift in use of drilling rigs from gas to oil   shows that as of April 13  2012  32  of drilling rigs  vertical and horizontal combined  were gas and 68  were oil  At some point not too far in the future  we end up being maxed out on how many horizontal drilling rigs can reasonably be transferred from gas to oil  More horizontal drilling rigs can be built  but this takes time and investment capital    One characteristic of wells in tight formations is that production starts out very high  and then drops off quickly  Because of this  it is necessary to keep drilling new wells  or total production in an area is likely to drop off very quickly  New fracking techniques may help make the drop off problem less severe  but it is hard to imagine that it will go away completely  If we want production to keep rising  this means that we are likely to need more and more horizontal drilling rigs  more and more fracking equipment  and more and more capital  These considerations help put a lid on how quickly and how high production can be ramped up    7  How much tight oil does the EIA forecast can be extracted  Figure 8  The brown layer on top represents the EIA s forecast of future tight oil production  Graph by EIA  from AEO 2012 The EIA forecasts that tight oil will max out at 1 325 000 barrels a day in 2030  The EIA does not have a good track record of foreseeing changes before they happen  and the chart above shows production already at 850 000 barrels a day  Suppose the US really produces five times as much as the EIA forecasts  or 6 625 000 barrels a day  This increase will still not be enough to cause the US to become a net oil exporter  especially if other sources of oil continue to decline   This is not to say that I think that production can really be ramped up this much  We would likely run into a number of bottlenecks before reaching this volume drilling rigs  workers  fracking equipment  capital  etc  8  Haven t we been reading about exporting gasoline and other oil products recently  Does t that mean we are becoming a net oil exporter Yes  indeed  we are exporting gasoline and other oil products to a greater extent than we have in the past But we continue to import crude oil  so  on balance  we are still a net oil importer 1What has happened is that we have continued to add to our refinery capacity Figure 9  Operable crude oil refinery capacity  Chart by EIA At the same time  we have reduced our own need for gasoline and other products  One of the ways we have done this is by ramping up corn ethanol production  We are now producing so much ethanol that we are export some of it  Figure 10  below  Figure 10  US Biofuels  nearly all ethanol  production and consumption  based on EIA data The other way consumption has been reduced by reducing the miles driven per capita  Figure 11  below  Figure 11  US miles driven per capita  calculated by dividing Federal Highway Administration estimates of vehicle miles traveled  both cars and trucks  by US population The peak year for vehicle miles traveled per person was the year ended January 2006   All of the data in the chart is for years ended January 20xx   Since then  per capita vehicle miles driven have dropped each year  and are now 7 2  below their peak Total miles driven for the entire US population has also dropped  The peak year for total vehicle miles driven was the year ended January  2008 There may be other changes that affected oil use  but I don t have data for them  For example  transferring heavy industry offshore would tend to reduce oil use  an increase in average miles per gallon for vehicles on the road would also tend to reduce oil use The net effect of all of the changes is that US oil consumption is down significantly since its high point in 2005  Figure 12  below shows an enlarged view of recent oil consumption Figure 12  Recent US oil consumption  in Btus  Amounts graphed are the same as are shown in Figure 4 above Acomparison of Figures 9 and 12 shows that refinery capacity was increasing at the same time that US oil consumption was decreasing  If we have more refinery space than we need  refiners can import crude oil  refine it  and sell the products as exports  That is pretty much what has been happening recently A few things have happened in the past few years that have made US refinery capacity especially attractive 1  The US has a good supply of  complex  refineries that can process heavy sour crude oil  There is relatively more heavy sour crude being produced now  than previously  raising demand for these refineries 2  The US has a low price for natural gas  compared to the rest of the world  Natural gas is used in refining heavy  sour crude oil  so our cost of refining has been relatively lower than other locations with similar facilities 3  The amount of sulfur that is permitted in diesel and other fuel is being regulated in the US and elsewhere  to control pollution  If a country wants to have at least some fuel that meets international regulations  it now needs to find a refinery with complex capacity to remove the sulphur from its crude oil  Many countries do not have such refineries of their own  For example  Mexico sends us oil to refine  and we send oil products back to Mexico 9  Why do I keep reading so much about  barrels of liquids   when talking about US oil supply  The US government likes to talk about  barrels of liquids  because comparisons with other countries are more favorable on this basis than they are using Btus  or considering crude oil only  If we look at a breakdown of US  liquids  production through 2011  this is what we see  I noted above that US oil consumption is approximately 18 5 million barrels a day  If  liquids production is about 10 million barrels a day  shown in Figure 13 above   then a comparison of production on this basis would leave a shortfall of  only  a little more than 8 million barrels a day  So even on this basis  we are still a long way from being a net oil exporter    The problem in making a comparison on a volume  barrels per day  basis is that very dissimilar liquids are being combined   Both NGPLs  natural gas plant liquids  and  other liquids   mostly ethanol  have only 60  to 70  of the energy content of crude oil  It is doubtful that  refinery gain  adds much energy content at all  The EIA has made adjustments for differences in energy values in its calculations on a Btu basis    For those interested in finding data on a Btu basis  the  section of EIA reports gives data on this basis  They are also available  with a lag  in   Note 1  It is easy to confuse  net oil exporter  with  net oil product exporter   We can think of net oil exports as the combination of the following four items a  Crude oil importsb  Crude oil exports  virtually zero in the case of the US c  Oil product imports  like gasoline and diesel d  Oil product exports  like gasoline and diesel Net product exports reflect only the combination of Items c and d  omitting consideration of Items a and b In 2011  the US became a net oil product exporter  This means that when Items c and d were combined  in other words  omitting consideration of crude oil imports   we exported more oil products than we imported  This situation can happen very easily  if we are importing a lot of crude oil  and have excess

100487,322002,BKR,Why Oil Markets Will Stay Bullish,opinion,The US Energy Dept s 29 February report on world oil market trends carried baleful news for the gung ho fraternity who want to bomb Iran s nuclear installations The report outlined that OPEC spare oil production capacity dropped 33  in the first two months of this year compared with same period of 2011  The 12 OPEC member states had an average 2 5 million barrels a day spare capacity during January and February  down from 3 7 Mbd a year earlier  This spare capacity of 2 5 Mbd is very close to what Iran was exporting until late 2011  following a year average 2 6 Mbd in 2010  Since the fall of 2011 and for reasons only partly related to sanctions  its oil output is falling and Iran s net exports may now stand at only 2 2 Mbd today  Some sources suggest even less than that  and one of the reasons is  good old depletion  These figures could make it look like world demand can be satisfied if OPEC s spare capacity   nearly all of it Saudi   could be brought on line  but the US Energy Dept report held even worse news It showed that global oil consumption averaged 3 Mbd more than global output  when Iran is excluded from the calculation  and around 500 000 b d more when Iran is included  Inventory draws and refinery output changes make up the difference   for the moment   but supply is very tight DISAPPEARING OILThe Energy Dept report underlined a basic real world fact  the bulk of oil price increase through January and February is due to tight supply and global demand for imports where declining US and European oil demand is more than compensated by rising Chinese  Indian and even Japanese import demand  Iran sanctions are imagined  by some  to have had a powerful role in driving up prices  but the uncomfortable reality is they played a much less significant role  because world oil supply is faltering but import demand is not US enthusiasm for Iran bombing can only weaken  aided or pushed also by Vladimir Putin s total hostility to any military action against Iran  India s refusal to play sanctions  and China s more than ambiguous  less than enthusiastic stance on sanctions Supply side hope is heavily focused on Saudi Arabia because outside KSA the closet of spare capacity is nearly empty  The Saudis  right on cue  have multiplied announcements of expanded oil E P drilling  The facts are that using Baker Hughes data  KSA had 49 rigs operating in January  compared with 48 in December  and as many as 57 in August 2007  This was the most recent  possibly final peak of drilling activity in the Kingdom  At the time  and ever since  the official Saudi line is that it both intends to  and is capable of raising oil production capacity   and possibly output   to 12 5 Mbd Current production is a claimed 9 8 Mbd  down from its short lived  more than 10  peak of a claimed 10 04 Mbd in November 2011  Conversely  Saudi oil consumption runs at an exorbitant 32 8 barrels per capita each year and is now around 2 4 Mbd  making the Kingdom only just able to beat Russia into second place by net exports  and unable to match Russia s total oil production of about 10 25 Mbd Elsewhere in the oil pumping world  especially in the Middle East  the Maghreb  West Africa and East Africa production slowdowns and cuts are legion  Libyan supplies  which were  rebounding  from their near zero during the NATO bombing campaign  have slowed their recovery pace  and remain about 460 000 b d lower than the 1 6 Mbd of January 2011 before the uprising began  Yemen and Syria  which are in close to permanent uprising and have totally destabilized economies  have taken another 600 000 b d out of global supply  while the North Sudan South Sudan conflict and ongoing but low level conflict in Nigeria s delta region have shut out at least another 500 000 b d DEATH OF THE BIG EXPORTERSProducer country decisions are always driven by a mix of different factors   from political and economic to geological and industrial  The current top six net exporters Saudi Arabia  Russia  Iran  UAE  Venezuela and Norway  account for at least a half of world net oil exports  Looking at the Top 6 we find at least three are in straight long term production decline  due to depletion  Their net oil exports will almost certainly go on falling  rapidly for Norway  slower for Iran and Venezuela  Apart from UAE which has a small margin for raising net export supply  the key factor for Russia and KSA is that rising domestic oil demand will likely swamp any impacts from production growth and cut net exports Earlier in the first decade  around 2005  the split of factors tending to erode global net export capacity   or actually eroding it   was domestic oil demand growth in all of these exporter countries  Today  along with production losses not only through depletion  but also through shifting investment to gas production raising in the case of Russia  Iran and Norway  the Top 6 group shows an average annual decline rate for net oil export capacity of well above 3 3   Worse  this background decline rate for net export capacity will rise  and for reasons that are all bad for oil importers Depletion loss is now at least as important as domestic oil demand growth or shifts in energy strategy and investment in cutting net export capacity of the big exporters  Production decline is also coming for Russia  despite Putin s boasting that his country will maintain oil output at  over 10 Mbd for decades  but today s emerging global oil export picture  as the IEA shows in many reports  is above all fragmented  More smaller exporters are taking the place of the flagging giants  but their combined oil export capacity is unable to match the lost export capacity of the shrinking giants The hunt for new production capacity is therefore viral  explaining the Scramble for Africa by the world s oil majors and the NOCs of Emerging countries  and also the majors  policy shift to gas  Cheap shale gas and stranded gas  they are betting  could allow and enable GTL gas to oil conversion to produce synthetic oil perhaps cheaper than depending on increasingly expensive  hard to extract oil  This may be so  and it also might not  GTL plants are massively expensive  at capex costs around  25 000 per barrel day capacity  In turn this shifts hopes towards more reasonable but still high cost condenate gas feedstock refining like the proposed Darwin Clean Fuels 60 000 b d refinery costed at about  550 million  with upstream condensate from Australia s giant offshore stranded gas fields Our concern is the outlook for oil in the near term future  In the period to 2017  the mix of factors above could easily produce a 1970s style oil shock  this time with at least tacit support from international oil and energy companies  all of them facing huge capex needs  The number of players who need and want higher prices is a lot larger than Goldman Sachs  analysts and traders hunched over their palystation trading consoles  and Iran s unsmiling mullahs  ,2012-03-04,Andrew MacKillop,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-oil-markets-will-stay-bullish-115800,115800
100490,322005,BKR,Forget The CPI  Use This Index and Profit From This Sector,opinion, Most Americans in 2011 experienced a day to day inflation rate of 7 2 percent more than two times the official estimate released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics      AEIRThe American Institute For Economic Research  AIER  has done investors and consumers an important service  They have compiled an index that actually reflects the way we live  eschewing the government s  hedonic quality adjustments   that s when they basically say   Well  yes  dresses cost more this year  but since the buttons are of better quality  we adjust that increase downward   or the  owners  equivalent rent  in lieu of home prices  and all the other little tricks of the trade that too often render the CPI the equivalent of the punch line of the old accountant joke   4   4  How much do you want it to be  The CPI is used to determine Cost of Living Adjustments and other yardsticks that determine how and when people living on a fixed income get an increase  It affects other interest rates as well as banks  willingness to lend at reasonable rates or pay their depositors a fair rate  The problem is  while I imagine the Bureau of Labor Statistics tries to measure things right  it probably doesn t measure the right things Take a senior couple living on a fixed income  they typify the consumers who most clearly need a realistic cost of living adjustment from the Social Security they paid into over their lifetimes  or their company pensions  or the CDs  bonds and preferreds they buy for a little extra income boost  And the CPI often understates real inflation and keeps all these savings rates artificially depressed On the other hand  the CPI measures a lot of things many people buy only occasionally  Using our senior couple as an example  they may not drive as much as they used to  Maybe they only put 8 000 miles a year on their car instead of the 15 000 they might have more typically driven when traveling on business or taking more frequent road trips  etc  It seems reasonable they might keep their car for ten years instead of five  Yet the CPI measures the cost of automobiles as if they were an annual purchase  This same couple might have their home fully paid for   Owners  equivalent rent  isn t their issue  Their appliances work every bit as well as they did five years ago so they aren t likely to rush out and buy new ones  Yet the CPI treats appliances and furniture as if we all are in a mad dash to replace the contents of our home rather more frequently than we really are The EPI developed by AEIR  on the other hand  reflects basic economic change that we all see every day  Here s a chart that shows the rate of increase in the CPI over the past quarter century  The green line shows the EPI  presenting a very different picture  the picture every American feels in their wallet and knows in their heart to be reflective of our daily living   All charts courtesy of AEIR  What makes these two indexes different  According to the BLS   the CPI represents all goods and services purchased for consumption by the reference population  BLS has classified all expenditure items into more than 200 categories  arranged into eight major groups  Major groups and examples of categories in each are as follows   FOOD AND BEVERAGES  breakfast cereal  milk  coffee  chicken  wine  full service meals  snacks   HOUSING  rent of primary residence  owners  equivalent rent  fuel oil  bedroom furniture   APPAREL  men s shirts and sweaters  women s dresses  jewelry   TRANSPORTATION  new vehicles  airline fares  gasoline  motor vehicle insurance   MEDICAL CARE  prescription drugs and medical supplies  physicians  services  eyeglasses and eye care  hospital services   RECREATION  televisions  toys  pets and pet products  sports equipment  admissions    EDUCATION AND COMMUNICATION  college tuition  postage  telephone services  computer software and accessories    OTHER GOODS AND SERVICES  tobacco and smoking products  haircuts and other personal services  funeral expenses   However  When reporting CPI  the BLS typically excludes food  beverages  and energy  under  Transportation   because they are too volatile  What      If food and gas are skyrocketing  why exclude them just because they re volatile  This is where we live and that is what we spend money on  The fact that computers and software  items we might purchase once a year or less  have declined in value doesn t help one bit if every meal and every gas fill up are breaking the bank  Yet the BLS website goes on to say   The CPI measures inflation as experienced by consumers in their day to day living expenses  How does this square with the fact that EPI shows what we all suspected when we saw the dollars flying out of our wallets and purses   that the cost of living in 2011 was more than double what the BLS claims it to be  Even a cursory glance at the chart below tells the story  You cannot simply exclude food and the means to transport yourself from Point A to Point B and hope to have anything akin to an accurate picture Every day we spend money on food  drink  and transportation  Other items  not so much For instance  the price of smoking cigarettes and using other tobacco products has soared 600  in 25 years  but with fewer and fewer of us smoking  most Americans   personal  everyday price index doesn t go up at all because of this  But the energy we use to heat or cool our homes  keep the lights on at night  power our TVs and computers  and transport ourselves to work and back affect every single one of us  And those costs have skyrocketed over the years and average between 14 and 20  of the average household s total budget As consumers  if we are serious about reducing our expenses  we will attempt to rein in the every single day expenses that make up a huge portion of our total living expenses  Which is more important   the fact that a new refrigerator costs only  50 more than our old one  but has more gee gaws and so is considered  flat  in price by the CPI  or the  500 a month it costs to heat our home in winter or the  60 and rising cost it takes to fill a 15 gallon tank with gasoline a couple times a week As investors  the path is clear  As long as the CPI depresses cost of living adjustments  the government saves hugely on payouts to retirees  meaning you don t want to count on Social Security to honestly reflect what your daily living reality is  You need to invest in something that pays better than  flat  year on year  You could turn to bonds  except that bonds reflect the CPI in other  albeit more subtle ways  If there is no inflation   the government told us so   then there is no demand for a greater return from fixed income investments On the other hand  our current government actions to demonize one of Mother Nature s many wondrous gifts to us   the  storage batteries  placed around the earth in the form of oil  gas  and coal reserves   has led directly to the current shortages and high prices for these fuels  Add in the possibility of world turmoil  which causes large users of these fuels  such as utilities and transportation companies  to contract to hoard reliable supplies  and you create the Perfect Storm for higher fuel prices While I don t want this discussion to degenerate into a political debate from those with entrenched positions on either side  I think we can all agree that among these  we must include billions of dollars to subsidize pie in the sky technologies as yet unproven that promise  green  energy even if the energy in is greater than the energy out  We must also include the decision to force Canadian oil sands fuels to be diverted to China so our political class can pander to a part of its base that would rather freeze in the dark with no access   horreurs    to their iPhone or iPad than allow a pipeline to deliver that precious resource to Americans  And the clever decision to  allow drilling  in the Gulf of Mexico but extend the permitting process interminably so no one can actually drill is political genius  if economic suicide to those of us now encumbered by the results of these follies Since I see no return to common sense on the immediate horizon  may I suggest you look where that conclusion leads  international drilling companies that will continue finding oil and gas for China  India  Russia  Brazil  Indonesia and the rest of the emerging world  if not for or in the US  This means companies based in the US but contracting to more enlightened governments as well as those based elsewhere In our own portfolios  Seadrill  SDRL   Norway  and Schlumberger  SLB   France and the US  are good examples  Though I would wait for a pullback to add to our own positions in either  we own SDRL at 24 and SLB at 68  after you perform your own due diligence you may wish to take a pilot position even at these levels  Other players I like include Noble Energy  NBL  and Delek Group  DGRLY PK  which  through its subsidiaries  are jointly developing the massive and aptly named Leviathan field off Israeli waters in the Mediterranean  I think the latter is well priced right now  Less attractive to me right now  but at a lower price compelling  would be Baker Hughes  BHI   Halliburton  HAL   and  also in our portfolio  Weatherford Intl  WFT  and Atwood Oceanics  ATW   North Atlantic Drilling  NATDF PK  could be a great one if they get the government tax liability case negotiated to a successful conclusion For those who d rather buy the producers  all are well priced today but on pullbacks we ll be buyers of Exxon  XOM   Total  TOT   Chevron  CVX   Conoco  COP   Imperial Oil  IMO   Cenovus  CVE   and Repsol  REPYY PK  THE FINE PRINT

100491,322006,BKR,Why US Natural Gas Prices Are So Low   Are Changes Needed ,opinion,US natural gas prices are at record lows about where they were in 1976  and at the low points in the 1990s  in today s dollars  Figure 1  Figure 1  US wellhead natural gas prices based on EIA data  adjusted to January 2012 price levels using US CPI All Urban Price data There are several reasons why US natural gas prices are so low Our pricing system is based on short term supply and demand  and storage facilities are limited  It is very easy for supply to overwhelm the system  and prices to drop very low in response  if there is a mismatch US demand for natural gas has been fairly flat for the last 10 years  regardless of price  Of the four major uses for natural gas   1 residential heating  hot water  and cooking    2 commercial heating  hot water  and cooking   3  industrial demand  and  4  electricity   only electrical use has been growing Supply does not drop very quickly  even if prices fall  because producers need to continue to extract natural gas in order to repay loans and to comply with use it or lose it lease terms Besides variability  there are a number of other problems with depending on short term supply and demand for pricing Today s prices appear to be far below the cost of production for some providers  leading to the likelihood of a shakeout Unless price levels are higher and more stable  it is not clear that natural gas supply will grow over the next 10 or 20 years  making long term investment in new uses  for example  vehicular use    and pipelines to underserved areas  questionable Natural gas prices in the US are much lower than prices elsewhere in the world  Figure 2  below   This means that there is likely to be strong demand for US exports of natural gas  most likely as Liquefied Natural Gas  LNG   competing with internal US uses Figure 2  Natural gas prices in the United States  Europe  and Japan  based on World Bank Commodity Price Data  pink sheet Ramping up natural gas production is now very much of interest  even if new sources of demand are not available  becauseOil prices are high and some believe that natural gas can act as a substitute  andNatural gas seems to produce less CO2 than coal or oil It is not clear that the current natural gas pricing approach is up to handling this mismatch between supply and demand   In many ways  natural gas is a drill it as you need it product  and our current market free for all does not recognize this  Perhaps we should be considering a different method of regulating natural gas  since in many ways natural gas is essential  It is needed for balancing wind and solar PV  and for allowing us to continue to continue to heat our homes and businesses with natural gas    gas was regulated to produce a reasonable rate of return for providers  Perhaps something closer to this approach needs to be used again today If price is regulated  the amount to be drilled would need to be regulated as well  probably on a month to month basis  Higher prices would probably be needed under the new system to provide funds for more storage and for maintenance of pipelines  and to assure that US needs could compete with demand for LNG from overseas markets  I am doubtful that such a method of regulation would be feasible or would be politically acceptable  however In this post  I will explain these issues further Why natural gas prices are so low I see four reasons why natural gas prices are so low 1  Storage is too full  Our immediate problem now is that storage facilities are too full for this time of year  leaving little space for additional natural gas supply to be added during summer months  This year s warm winter contributed to this over supply of natural gas because the winter s draw down from storage was lower than expected Figure 3  March 22 figure by the US Energy Information Administration showing actual natural gas in storage  red  compared to expected range 2  Little growth in historical uses  One of the underlying reasons why there is a mismatch between supply and demand is the fact that since 1997  US natural gas consumption has remained close to flat  regardless of price  Figure 4  below   With very low prices in 2011  consumption rose by 2 2  in 2011 compared to 2010 Figure 4  US natural gas consumption by end use  based on EIA data Natural gas prices recently have been low enough to compete with coal prices  Even at these low price levels  there has been little increase in industrial demand  and no effect on residential and commercial usage  for heating of buildings  hot water  and cooking  Industrial demand used to be the largest source of natural gas use  but this has been trending downward  Part of this downward trend is likely related to    Part may be related to spiking natural gas prices  as well   Residential and commercial use has not been growing because furnaces have been becoming more efficient  and because more attention is being paid to insulation and other conservation measures Figure 5  US dry gas supply  divided between US produced and net imports 3  Supply doesn t drop quickly  Natural gas supply  Figure 5  above  does not drop very quickly when prices drop too low because long lead times and large investment is needed to bring supply on line  Natural gas producers have debt to service and are often faced with    leases  so are hesitant to stop  for fear of not being able to make use of their investment  A   so the producer does not feel the effect as quickly as otherwise  and take appropriate action Profitability of individual wells is based on estimates of long term future production and future costs things which are not at all certain  Some small producers may not even be aware of how unprofitable current prices really are There is also the issue of large oil and gas companies having difficulty  replacing their oil reserves   and needing natural gas reserves to substitute for oil reserves  These   even if the cost would seem to be far too high  given recent prices  These willing buyers allow production to keep expanding  creating a greater over supply situation before a shake out occurs It might be noted that supply  Figure 5  is actually not rising very quickly  but given the slow rise in demand  2 2  in 2011   it is overwhelming the system  In 2011  US production of dry natural gas increased by 7 8  over 2010  but this increase is partly offset by an offset by a decrease in imports When net imports are included  US dry gas supply for 2011 is up by 3 9  over 2010  The low growth in natural gas demand in 2011  plus the warm winter extending into 2012  has been enough to produce very low natural gas prices 4  New demand doesn t ramp up quickly  It takes time to find investors for new uses for natural gas  As I will discuss in later sections  there also needs to be reasonable assurance that natural gas will be available for a fairly long period at an acceptable price level  before investors are willing to invest  With our current pricing system  I am not certain that these criteria are met Natural Gas Supply Depends on a Sufficiently High Long Term PriceThere has been a lot of discussion about how much shale gas supply will be available in the new few decades  What people seem to lose sight of is the fact that the amount that will be available depends on price  If the US can maintain a high price for natural gas  say  above  10 per thousand cubic feet  mcf    then a fairly large amount of natural gas may be available  But if price remains in the low  2 mcf range  or is highly variable  a drop in natural gas supply seems likely  probably in the next year or two  Companies will either not want to invest  or will invest for export to foreign markets  where prices can be relied on  Drilling rigs are already being repurposed for oil production  rather than natural gas production Figure 6  Natural gas drilling rigs as percentage of oil and gas drilling rigs  based on EIA s compilation of Baker Hughes data   a major shale gas producer  talks about trying to pull back as quickly as possible from unprofitable production  at current prices   that shale gas producers who are not able to subsidize natural gas production with profits from  liquids  need a price of  5 to  9 mcf to earn a minimum level of profitability Figure 7  Graphic published by EIA showing recent shale gas production Gas producers have natural gas reserves on their books  but these too  depend on the available price for natural gas  If the prices is too low  these resources may never be developed  especially if the gas is a stand alone product  not produced with  liquids   Building New Sources of Demand Depends on Having a Stable Long Term SupplyThere are several new sources of demand that could be added  such as natural gas vehicles  or gas to liquid plants  or pipelines to underserved parts of the country that now use oil for heating  Large investment of these types don t make sense unless there is a reasonable likelihood that increased natural gas supply will be available for 20 or more years  and as we just noted  such a supply is not likely to be available unless natural gas prices rise and remain high 1 While there have been technology improvements  there is little evidence that they bring the cost of production down to today s low prices for shale gas producers that do not have high  liquids  content in the mix they extract Of course  the flip side of the need for higher price for production is that demand for the new products will be lower with a high natural gas price  This is true both for new products  and existing uses  like electricity  The recent rise in the use of natural gas for electricity occurred in part because natural gas became competitive with coal pricing  If natural gas prices rise  electrical demand for natural gas is likely to stop rising  and may even fall Need for a Different Pricing Supply MechanismBoth producers and consumers have gotten the message that we have an energy problem  without a good understanding of what that energy problem is  Suppliers are working hard to ramp up natural gas supply  At the same time consumers and industrial users are trying to conserve Vaclav Smil in talks about transitions from one fuel to another taking 30 to 50 years  We are trying to rush the process with natural gas and renewables  producing a partial transition in only a few years  It is hard to move a system at faster than its normal speed  Even a small mis step with natural gas can lead to very low prices  and no place to put the new supply  Besides temporary over supply  temporary shortages can also be expected to become more common  if we try to rush the transition  and do not add adequate new storage  Natural gas is a system that has a lot of  month to month variability in demand  because it is used for heating and cooling  If the weather is unusually warm or cold  it is quite easy for the current system to run into outages  For example   for heating in Europe this winter   in cold weather in 2011  I wonder whether new natural gas vehicles will be added  and we will find that there are gaps in fuel for these vehicles  in some parts of the country  when the weather is unusually hot or cold I am not sure if any system of determining prices and supply will work very well  given the stresses we are placing on the system  The current system of determining prices on a short term supply and demand basis produces a lot of fluctuations  and as I have shown  does not regulate the system well  I am raising the question of whether another system might work better because the stresses on the system would appear to be likely to get worse  not better  in the years ahead One possibility would be to go to more of a regulated natural gas system  where the amount drilled each month is set by a central authority  and prices are set based on a fair rate of return  I don t know whether this is even feasible at this late stage  with ownership of different parts of the system so disaggregated  and cost levels varying greatly for different types of providers I suppose hidden in the back of my mind is a fear that the natural gas system  like the oil system  will start behaving so badly in terms of pricing and demand allocation that the government will decide to intervene  President Obama s new  gives the Energy Department broad powers if problems arise that are deemed to create a national emergency  These powers would seem to include determining who gets what in terms of supply  Trying to transition quickly from one energy system to another is untrod ground  I am not sure I have a good pricing solution  Perhaps someone else does Note  1  Having high natural gas prices is helpful in assuring long term natural gas production  but such prices are still not a guarantee of long term production  There are many interactions with the rest of the system  For example  if there are high oil prices and high food prices  there may be civil unrest which disturbs natural gas production  Or imported parts  necessary for further drilling may not be available  Or there may be general financial problems  that prevent getting loans needed for further production  Or it may turn out that shale gas wells do not continue to produce as much gas as hoped  for as long as hoped  and the wells are no longer profitable  even at the higher prices ,2012-03-25,Gail

100492,322007,BKR,This Explosive Growth Stock Just Went on Sale,opinion,Despite what any financial academic or index fund advocate tells you  the market isn t perfectly rational  If it were  then it would be impossible to identify a stock that is meaningfully undervalued    There would literally be no way for an active stock picker to beat the market    other than blind luck    But  as I was saying    that s not the case  The market is good  but it s not perfect    it makes mistakes    And we should all be thankful for that  Otherwise  there d never be any exceptional buys  You can t get ahead by paying full price all the time  And we only get to buy stocks at attractive discounts of 50  or more because the market goofs up from time to time    That said  I think the market is making a big mistake with Patterson UTI Energy  Nasdaq  PTEN  right now  Here s the story      Patterson UTI is a leading provider of land based contract drilling services  The company also assists with other critical tasks such as hydraulic fracturing and well cementing  The firm has a large fleet of 350 drilling rigs at its disposal  which are dispatched all across North America    Demand for drilling rigs tends to rise and fall along with the peaks and valleys of oil and gas prices    Like most of the companies in the energy drilling space  the company got hammered in 2008 when oil prices nosedived from around  150 to  40 a barrel    The company s drilling business was essentially cut in half over that difficult stretch  The stock followed suit  plunging from a high of  37 a share to a low in the single digits    But Patterson made a remarkable comeback in 2011  The company caters mainly to small  and medium sized independent producers    and those customers ramped up their drilling activity in a big way last year    The company started the year with 194 rigs working in the field and ended with 232  Aside from the stronger fleet utilization  customers were also willing to pay higher rates  In fact  each of the firm s rigs raked in an average of  21 980 for every day on the job in the fourth quarter    up from  19 090 a year earlier    All told  the company boosted drilling revenue 70  in 2011  rebounding from  1 0 billion to  1 7 billion  More important  net income zoomed 175  to reach  322 million  or  2 06 a share    And there s been even more progress thus far in 2012  As of February  the active rig count has risen to 240  About half of those are locked up under long term contracts that will throw off  1 8 billion in guaranteed future revenue  Those fixed contracts should help insulate against any temporary decline in onshore drilling rates    Yet despite triple digit growth rates and insulation from falling rates  PTEN shares have still retreated from  34 to  18    Much of the decline can be traced back to weak natural gas prices  which have slowed activity in places such as Louisiana s Haynesville Shale  But investors are missing the point  Customers aren t cutting back    they re just shifting the focus from gas directed drilling to oil directed drilling    The natural gas rig count has fallen consistently for several weeks  but the oil rig count has exploded  Back in 2009  there were fewer than 200 rigs drilling for oil in the U S  By this time last year  that number had quadrupled to 800    Right now  there are about 1 272 rigs working in places such as the Bakken Shale    the highest since Baker Hughes  NYSE  BHI  started tracking this statistic a quarter century ago    So these rigs aren t idle  they have just moved to wetter plays with better economics    Risks to Consider  Of course  with investing nothing is 100  certain  Any sustained drop in oil prices could bite into exploration and production expenditures and thus drilling activity  Patterson still has many outdated rigs that will need to be retired and replaced  The regulatory environment for hydraulic fracturing is also still something of a wild card    But with shares trading close to their 52 week low  PTEN may be approaching its bottom  And with the company trading at just seven times earnings and at a PEG ratio of  30    now could be a good time to gain exposure to this fast growing energy company ,2012-03-28,StreetAuthority,https://www.investing.com/analysis/this-explosive-growth-stock-just-went-on-sale-118449,118449

100520,322035,BKR,Investing In The Natural Gas Revolution,opinion,In our May 2010 report entitled  Investing In The Natural Gas Revolution  we concluded that there would long lasting strong global demand for natural gas for three main reasons 1  New technological innovations allowing for the extraction of natural gas from previously inaccessible locations   in particular reserves trapped in underground shale basins   have significantly increased the world s supply of natural gas  This additional supply  and the accompanying drop in prices  will continue to stimulate demand for natural gas for the foreseeable future 2  The development of liquefied natural gas is connecting countries with previously stranded natural gas reserves to major natural gas producing countries 3  Natural gas is less polluting than either coal or oil  This is especially the case when compared with coal  its main competitor in the electricity sector We also argued that the expansion and modernization of the natural gas related infrastructure required to keep pace with growing demand would translate into a long term bull market for equipment and services providers active in this sector  This includes equipment and services related to the exploration  development and distribution of natural gas The advantages of investing in the natural gas revolution via equipment and service providers While the significant increase in reserves will stimulate demand for natural gas in the longer term  waiting for supply to catch up with demand means squeezed profit margins for natural gas producers  particularly those based in North America where prices have dropped the most  In contrast  equipment and service providers are already benefiting from the infrastructure that is being built to tap and eventually absorb the new supply  as well as to keep pace with growing demand over the longer term Unlike natural gas producers  equipment and service providers are not required to make significant upfront capital investments to get production going before being able to earn a return on their investments  This requirement exposes natural gas producers to the risk that once gas production is up and running  the host country will significantly increase royalties or  in a worst case scenario  completely renege on its contract obligations  Equipment and service providers tend to get paid sooner and a more regular basis  which allows them to limit their losses should the business environment take a turn for the worse Recent developments support our main investment thesis1  The world s estimated reserves of natural gas continues to surgeThe U S  Energy Information Administration published a report last April analyzing 48 shale gas basins in 32 countries  The shale gas reserves identified in these countries alone is estimated to be 190 trillion cubic meters 1 which would increase the world s technically recoverable reserves by 40   This study does not take into account possible reserves in the Soviet Union and the Middle East where huge reserves of conventional gas will make investment in shale gas unlikely for many years to come 2  Global infrastructure needsThe International Energy Agency estimates that meeting growing global demand for natural gas will require that  9 5 trillion be invested in natural gas related infrastructure between 2010 and 2035  This is a significant increase from its prior estimate of  5 5 trillion for the period of 2007 to 2035 3  Nuclear power s loss  natural gas  gainIn the wake of the nuclear catastrophe in Japan  nuclear power faces unprecedented regulatory and political scrutiny  In the most extreme cases  some countries have even decided to abandon their nuclear programs altogether  The German Parliament voted to close all the country s nuclear power plants by 2022 The Swiss Parliament voted to phase out nuclear power out by 2034 Belgium set a target for abandoning nuclear powerby 2025 Opposition to the building of plants has also hardened in areas of India where the government is planning to build nuclear power plants  Violent protests near the port of Jaitapur on India s west coast left one fishermen dead and three others injured last April Even before the nuclear disaster in Japan  the nuclear power renaissance was already under pressure in the developed world  Many nuclear proposals in the U S   for example  had been scrapped for financial reasons  According to the Council on Foreign Relations   building a nuclear power plant ranges anywhere from  5 billion to  12 billion  with construction times estimated at between six and ten years  The lower end estimate alone is almost double the cost and the construction time of building a coal or gas plant 4  The Continuing U S  Natural Gas RevolutionAt the start of the last decade  the United States experienced a surge in the construction of liquefied natural gas import terminals over fears its natural gas reserves were in terminal decline  These fears could not have been more wrong  Today  these terminals are sitting idle and the worries now center on finding buyers for the country s surplus of gas One area where this surplus is being deployed is in the electricity sector  Due to the growing regulatory and environmental resistance to coal  utilities have been moving steadily towards natural gas  Between 2000 and 2010  coal s share of U S  electricity production dropped from 52  to 45   while gas  share increased from 16  to 24  This influx of supply and drop in prices has also been a boon for both consumers  who benefit from lower heating and electricity costs and manufacturers who are heavy users of natural gas  Indeed  Dow Chemical and other companies in the same sector are building large facilities in the U S  to take advantage of the cheap supply  This is a radical change from early 2000 when the chemical industry was shutting down U S  plants and shifting production overseas due to the high cost of natural gas at the time  France s Vellore  Mannesmann Holdings Inc   one of the world s largest makers of steel tubes for the energy market  has recently decided to build a  650 million plant in Ohio in order to profit from America s energy renaissance The oil and gas extraction sector is one of the few good news stories on the U S  job front  with employment having increased by over 20  since 2005  These figures do not include the indirect jobs created by the influx of money into the regions where production is located The Interstate Natural Gas Association of America forecasts that by 2035 the US will need to spend  205 billion  in 2010 dollars  on new gas pipelines  processing facilities and gathering systems in order to meet growing demand for natural gas 5  China jumps on the natural gas bandwagonChina is aiming for natural gas to account for 10  of its energy consumption by 2020  up from its current 4  12 China s demand for natural gas has risen by more than 20  annually since 2004  If current trends hold  China will be Asia s largest consumer of natural gas by 2015  according to the International Energy Agency The U S  Energy Information Administration reported that China s reserves could hold 36 1 trillion cubic meters of shale gas an amount equal to 12 times the country s proven conventional gas reserves This figure is even higher than America s estimated shale gas reserves of 24 4 trillion cubic meters This provides China an opportunity to not only improve its energy security  but to also cut back on air pollution by reducing its reliance on coal  China has cited the importance of acquiring expertise in shale gas exploration and production in its 2011 2015 five year plan In order to keep pace with its growing demand for natural gas  China plans to build 300 000 kilometers of natural gas pipelines over the next 12 years  As of the end of 2009  China had 36 000 kilometers of gas pipelines in place 6  Israel s potential game changing discovery of new natural gas reservesIsraelis have always complained that they live in the only part of the Middle East with no significant energy reserves  In December 2010  a huge natural gas discovery made inside Israel s territorial waters put an end to these complaints  Analysts believe the discovery could provide Israel with anywhere from 50 to 200 years of gas reserves at current levels of consumption  Israel currently imports 40  of its gas needs from Egypt  Deteriorating relations between the two countries and the recent cutoff of gas supplies due to the sabotage of the pipeline on the Egyptian side of the border means that this discovery could not have come at a more opportune time for Israel 7  The Canadian government tilts away from coal  leaving natural gas to fill the voidThe government has proposed that  effective July 1  2015  all new coal plants  including ones that are being refurbished  be forced to limit their discharge of carbon dioxide and other pollutants to the emission levels of high efficiency natural gas fired power plants Coal power plants would in theory only be able to meet certain of these targets by capturing the carbon dioxide and sequestering it underground   a process that is still largely unproven  Once a coal plant reached 45 years in age  it would be forced to shut down if it was unable to comply with the emission requirements If enacted  these regulations would effectively destroy coal s growth prospects in Canada for the foreseeable future  setting the stage for natural gas to fill the void Investment RecapWe feel that equipment and service providers active in the natural gas sector are best positioned to benefit from the recent developments mentioned above  Companies in this market include Halliburton  Baker Hughes and Schlumberger  which provide drilling and other related services to the gas and oil sectorsGE  Siemens and Caterpillar  which manufacture natural gas fired turbinesAir Products   Chemicals  which produces liquefied natural gas processing technologyVallourec of France and Indian based Welspun Gujarat Stahl Rohren  which build natural gas pipelinesENN Energy of China  Gujarat State Petronet of India and America s El Paso Pipeline Partners which are in the natural gas delivery and storage businessNational Oilwell Varco  which is a manufacturer of large mechanical components for land and offshore drilling rigsOver the long term  we are also bullish North American natural gas producers once their reserves have been connected to the global markets Given the lack of LNG export facilities in North America  the discovery of huge quantities of huge new reserves cannot be sold abroad  As a result the price of natural gas is much cheaper in North America than it is in Asia and Europe This price differential should narrow once projects to export gas in the form of liquefied natural gas plants are completed in sufficient numbers  There are at least 6 LNG export projects on the drawing board for North America  including several in the United States that were originally built to import natural gas  In Canada  the Kitimat  B C   project led by Apache Corp  has been approved by the National Energy Board  Royal Dutch Shell is also considering building a liquefied natural gas export terminal in British Colombia 22 Many companies  which are heavy users of natural gas  are against the idea of exports because they fear it would eventually lead to significant increases in the price of natural gas in the U SFor a more in depth analysis on the growing global demand for natural gas

106737,328252,BKR,Better Buy  Baker Hughes vs  Core Laboratories N V ,news,"Oil and natural gas prices are low today  and that s been a major headwind for energy companies  which in turn is bad for energy services companies like Baker Hughes  NYSE BKR  and Core Laboratories  NYSE CLB   That s because energy producers tend to pull back on spending when energy prices are low 
However  there s more to know if you are considering these two key industry players  And at the end of the day  one looks a little bit better positioned for 2020 than the other right now  But you don t need to rush in and buy either name at this point  so take your time and understand what s going on  Here s a quick primer 
1  Similar  but different
The first thing to understand about Baker Hughes and Core Labs is that they both serve the energy industry  but they do that in different ways  Core Labs is largely an asset light business that uses technology to help its customers find and extract oil and natural gas more efficiently  It does this by offering high tech data processing services to exploration and production companies around the world  The model affords the company impressive operating margins  which were recently in the mid teens  

Baker Hughes  meanwhile  does some stuff with data  but it s more about building physical assets that energy companies use  What sets it apart from its peers on this front is that its suite of products spans the entire energy landscape  including the upstream  drilling   midstream  pipelines   and downstream  refining and chemicals  spaces  Like Core Labs  it operates on a global scale  Its operating margins have been in the low  to mid single digits of late  more on this below  
There s no win or lose takeaway here  but it s important for investors to understand that this pair serve the same industry in vastly different ways 
2  Strong foundations
Baker Hughes and Core Labs are also on close to equal footing when it comes to their balance sheets  Financial debt to equity for Baker Hughes is a very reasonable 0 25 times  even though that s higher than the 0 15 times at Core Labs  Both companies cover their interest expenses by more than six times  and have debt to EBITDA ratios of around 2 5 times  If you had to give one company an edge here  it would be Core Labs  but the difference is really not that material    both are financially strong companies  
3  Getting better  getting worse
Baker Hughes just turned in a pretty solid year  with revenue up roughly 4   Two of its four divisions turned in growth  and two shrunk a little  However  all four saw year over year order growth in 2019  Still  the company painted a mixed picture for 2020 outlook during its fourth quarter 2019 conference call  So don t go in expecting a standout year 
But that s only half of the picture here  
Baker Hughes merged its business with General Electric s  NYSE GE  energy industry operations a few years ago  The deal got off to a rocky start  with a bit of red ink as the two companies tried to integrate the combined business  Management has been working to get back on track  with a key goal being improving profitability  It has been achieving its aim  and gotten the company back into the black 
It s worth noting that its operating margin has steadily improved since the GE merger  To ensure that investors are rewarded for its ongoing success  Baker Hughes has paid a  0 72 per share annual dividend for two years running  That provides a 3 3  yield today  and with strong cash generation  there s no particular reason to expect this payment to be at risk in 2020  
That highlights a key difference in the outlook here  Core Labs just announced an over 50  cut in its dividend because it expects 2020 to be a difficult year  The big problem is the onshore U S  market  where demand has been falling off because low oil and gas prices have led to a pullback in drilling activity  Although that s part of the reason for Baker Hughes  mixed outlook for 2020 as well  Core Labs is obviously pretty worried about its business in the States  It cited the need to increase its financial flexibility when it announced the dividend cut  For all of 2019  Core Labs  revenue was down 9   so it looks like it does  indeed  have more to worry about than Baker Hughes right now  
4  No need to move fast
On the whole  Baker Hughes appears to be in a better position today than Core Labs  Its business is improving rather than faltering  as appears to be the case at Core Labs  That s also apparent in Wall Street s view of the two companies  with Baker Hughes down around 7  over the past year and Core Labs off by a painful 45  or so  

CLB data by YCharts
The thing is  both companies will continue to feel the effect of low oil and natural gas prices  especially in the U S  space  That s a trend that isn t likely to change until there s a sustained uptick in the price of oil  Investors really don t need to rush in  And before you start thinking that Core Labs is a value play here  its forward P E ratio of nearly 21 times is slightly higher than Baker Hughes  roughly 19 5 times figure  Add in the poor outlook for 2020  and Core Labs doesn t look like much of a bargain  
That said  there s a not so minor wrinkle with Baker Hughes  General Electric owns a huge slug of the shares  around 37    which it ultimately wants to get rid of  Since investors know those shares are likely to hit the market at some point  GE s ownership is likely to remain a headwind to any stock advance    if the stock heads higher GE might flood the market with shares and push the price right back down  Core Labs doesn t have that negative sitting over it  but that doesn t really offset the visual provided by a massive dividend cut  
Better  but maybe better to wait
If you are looking at Baker Hughes and Core Labs right now  Baker Hughes appears to be better positioned for the year ahead  While it is warning that 2020 will be filled will challenges  Core Labs  decision to cut its dividend to preserve cash suggests that it is battening down the hatches in preparation for a really bad year 
That said  even though Baker Hughes appears to be the better option  most investors should probably wait until GE s stake in the company is notably lower than it is today before jumping aboard  It s not that Baker Hughes is a bad company    it is  in fact  doing a very good job of setting itself up for better days  The problem is that investors are likely to keep a lid on the stock so long as it knows GE is looking to get rid of its 36  ownership position ",2020-02-04,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pqhbt,2074578
