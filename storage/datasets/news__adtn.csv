of a trade deal between the United States and China as both sides agreed to ease the bilateral tensions and pave the way for an early settlement of trade disputes  The on again  off again negotiations are likely to get a boost when high level officials meet in October for a mutually agreeable solution  As the industry awaits the end of the lingering uncertainty related to the 15 month old trade war  latent threats persisted with lawmakers continuing to pile pressure on the authorities to curb Chinese infiltration in the domestic telecommunications network    In a complete reversal to his earlier view  President Trump hinted that trade negotiations with the communist nation are likely to be reached sooner than expected after criticizing its unfair trade practices at the United Nations General Assembly forum  The usual tirade was probably aimed to put pressure on China to reduce the trade barriers  but it threatened to derail the talks yet again after it drew sharp response from the Far East  With both the countries seeking a profitable solution to the crisis on domestic compulsions  they can hardly afford any slip ups and the stakes are too high to reach an early resolution   Meanwhile  a bipartisan group of lawmakers have released draft legislation to get rid of low priced telecommunications equipment manufactured by Huawei  ZTE  HK 0763  and other Chinese firms by proposing to offer  1 billion to small and rural carriers with less than 2 million subscribers  The move is in sync with the new FCC program dubbed  Find it  Fix it  Fund it  to provide rural telecom carriers adequate funds to self assess networks and identify  suspect equipment  that could siphon off data  Initially  FCC intends to allow the equipment to stay within the network after being quarantined  but plans to rip and replace it in the long term  The FCC is reportedly planning to bring regulatory changes to make the initiative a compliance issue for rural telecom firms Regarding

Phase One  deal between the United States and China withered on uncertainty regarding the venue and the date for signing the proposed agreement  The partial trade accord is anticipated to ease the bilateral tensions created by the prolonged trade war  However  reported demand by the communist nation to roll back the existing U S  tariffs raised speculations about a probable signing of an agreement in mid November between President Trump and his Chinese counterpart  In addition  lower than expected earnings and relatively soft outlook from hitherto declared results have triggered uncertainty within the beleaguered sector Although the sudden push for tariff rollback is not expected to derail the trade negotiations  both the countries have been unable to reach a consensus regarding the venue of the meeting  with a European location appearing to be a preferred choice at the moment  While both sides remain intent to reach an agreement at the earliest on domestic compulsions  it appears that the trade war has been rather a  two steps forward  three steps backward  affair  This  in turn  has largely dragged the sector down despite the fact that the S P is

from Thursday s Analyst Blog  Telecom Stock Roundup  Sprint  Adtran  Arista and MoreIn the past five trading days  telecom stocks witnessed a roller coaster ride as optimism about the  Phase One  deal between the United States and China withered on uncertainty regarding the venue and the date for signing the proposed agreement  The partial trade accord is anticipated to ease the bilateral tensions created by the prolonged trade war  However  reported demand by the communist nation to roll back the existing U S  tariffs raised speculations about a probable signing of an agreement in mid November between President Trump and his Chinese counterpart  In addition  lower than expected earnings and relatively soft outlook from hitherto declared results have triggered uncertainty within the beleaguered sector Although the sudden push for tariff rollback is not expected to derail the trade negotiations  both the countries have been unable to reach a consensus regarding the venue of the meeting  with a European location appearing to be a preferred choice at the moment  While both sides remain intent to reach an agreement at the earliest on domestic compulsions  it appears that the trade war has been rather a  two steps forward  three steps backward  affair  This  in turn  has largely dragged the sector down despite the fact that the S P is hovering around record high territories backed by broad based expectations of a trade settlement  solid jobs report and healthy payroll gains Meanwhile  China has launched 5G commercial services across the country as three leading state run telecom players  namely China Mobile  China Unicom and China Telecom rolled out 5G data services in 50 cities  Although the communist nation appears to be a late entrant in the 5G

  NYSE T    Ciena Corporation   NYSE CIEN    ADTRAN  Inc    NASDAQ ADTN    Zayo Group Holdings  Inc    NYSE ZAYO   and AT T Inc   NYSE T   Here are highlights from Thursday s Analyst Blog Telecom Stock Roundup  ATUS  CIEN  ADTN   MoreIn the past five trading days  telecom stocks flattered to deceive as an initial uptrend was replaced by a steady decline  as the Trump administration decided to up the ante against China  buoyed by the self declared victory against Mexico  The stocks went on an initial flurry as the U S  government dropped plans to impose 5  tariff on all Mexican goods after its Mexican counterpart promised to step up measures to stem the flow of illegal immigrants  However  the Sino U S  trade war continued to brew with no visible respite in the near term as both countries remained firm in their positions   Riding on the success of the coercive tools employed against Mexico  Trump asserted in his usual rhetoric that the United States would look forward to imposing higher tariffs on additional import items to bring the communist nation back to the negotiating table  Although a meeting between the two state heads is likely to take place at the G20 summit  any probable solution is unlikely to be reached in a one off interaction  China has even warned that it is ready to fight a prolonged tariff war and would retaliate if the United States goes ahead with a fresh tariff regime Meanwhile  the technology warfare between the two nations  with Huawei at the centerstage  took a fresh turn as the White House Office of Management and Budget informed the Congress that it would abide by a two year deadline to ban federal contracts of companies that continue to deal with the Chinese smartphone manufacturer  Despite a cumbersome process that involves third party suppliers and contractors  it pledged to enforce the multifaceted push against Huawei to safeguard national interests   The industry suffered another blow when attorneys from 10 states filed lawsuits to prevent the proposed merger of T Mobile US and Sprint on grounds that it would lead to a monopolistic market  The lawsuits are likely to further delay the merger that is already stuck in regulatory clearance  leading to uncertainty within the sector  However  the industry had something to cheer about when the Federal Communications Commission gave a legal greenlight to leading carriers to create tools to block suspected spam calls on behalf of their subscribers  The purported move is likely to offer subscribers peace of mind against alleged robocallers that recorded about 4 7 billion calls alone in May 2019   Regarding company specific news  acquisitions  earnings  strategic deals and footprint expansion primarily took the center stage over the past five trading

7378,228893,ADTN,ECB Hints At Rate Cut  Will Fed Follow Suit  Likely Gainers,opinion,A global economic slowdown looks more inevitable as central banks across the world head for dovish monetary policies  The European Central Bank  ECB  has given a strong signal for more stimulus including a likely rate cut  Central banks of China and Australia are pursuing soft monetary stances  Back in the United States  the Fed has also opted for monetary easing instead of the aggressive stance seen in 2018 Fed might signal a possible reduction in market interest rate anytime soon during its two day policy meeting  which started on Jun 18  Fed Chair Jerome Powell is expected to announce the decision at 2 p m  EST on Jun 19 ECB Proposes for More StimulusOn Jun 18  speaking at the ECB Forum in Sintra  Portugal  ECB chairman Mario Draghi gave a strong signal that if economic condition of the Eurozone deteriorates  the ECB will inject more stimulus either in the form of interest rate cut or further asset purchase   In the absence of improvement  such that the sustained return of inflation to our aim is threatened  additional stimulus will be required   Draghi stated Per ECB  trade conflict between the United States and China  a possible spat with Eurozone regrading auto tariffs  and geopolitical crisis in the Middle East and other oil exporting countries have taken toll on Eurozone s export and manufacturing sector  These two are the main growth promoting sectors of the Eurozone economies  Notably  the ECB is maintaining its soft monetary approach since the sovereign debt crisis of 2011 Fed s Policy Meeting in FocusThe Federal Reserve started its two day policy meeting on Jun 18  Notably  on Jun 4  Fed chairman Jerome Powell indicated that a rate cut was likely this year although he refrained from specifying dates  Possibility of a rate cut after the June meeting is very low However  market participants will be more interested in Powell s speech scheduled Wednesday afternoon  His statement is likely to reveal much about the central bank s future policy stance  Per CME FedWatch  at present  84 3  responders are expecting the first rate cut in July  Moreover  probability of a second rate cut in September is 65  and a third one in December is 51  Fed is possibly facing a dilemma  Reduction of interest rate for three times in 2019 after raising it for four times in 2018 will make Fed s policy prescriptions highly vulnerable  Such a drastic change in policies may not bode well  Also  with the current benchmark rate of 2 25  2 5   Fed has limited ability to reduce interest rate to a large extent In case of future economic shock  trade conflict is very much alive   which will spike the unemployment rate  Fed will not be able to raise inflation rate to its target level  Ultimately  it may have to resort to negative interest rate like Eurozone and Japan  which will simply impose tax on bank deposits Effect on Stock MarketsIn June  Wall Street rebounded after a month long volatile trading  following indications from Jerome Powell of a possible cut in benchmark interest rate  All three major stock indexes    the Dow  the S P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite    have gained more than 6  so far this month Despite little progress on the U S  China trade war front  impressive performance of U S  stocks hinges on a possible rate cut by the Fed  Meanwhile  President Donald desperately wants the central bank to roll back its 1  rate hike in 2018  Trump acquiesced the Fed that had it not opted for rate hike  U S  GDP would grew 1 5  more in 2018 and the Dow 30 index will be up by another10 000 points Likely GainersThe signal for a possible rate cut by the Fed anytime soon will certainly bolster confidence of market participants on risky assets like equities  A cut in benchmark lending rate will lower borrowing costs for corporations and individuals  Low cost of capital is likely to inject more investment in the economy as well as in the stock market Consequently  stocks with strong growth potential  which have performed well even during the market mayhem of May  are likely to gain the most  Shares of eHealth Inc    NASDAQ EHTH    Rent A Center Inc    NASDAQ RCII    Strategic Education Inc    NASDAQ STRA    Great Lakes Dredge   Dock Corp    NASDAQ GLDD    ADTRAN Inc    NASDAQ ADTN   and Ciena Corp    NYSE CIEN   are likely to

7391,228906,ADTN,Telecom Stock Roundup  Verizon AT T TV Strategies  Qualcomm s Patent Deal   More,opinion,In the past five trading days  telecom stocks witnessed a remarkable turnaround as the Trump administration allowed domestic firms to continue trade with Chinese telecom equipment manufacturer Huawei for 90 days  The strategic move harbored hopes of a progress in bilateral trade negotiations that went on a tailspin due to proposed tariffs and counter tariffs  The short term reprieve also offered an opportunity to re draw the supply chain mechanism and reduce dependency on Huawei to avert a possible future backlash  However  latent fears related to the execution of a mutually agreeable trade deal remained a potent threat that partially disrupted the uptrend near the end of the past week    The U S  Department of Commerce seemingly fired a double barrel gun when it offered an extension to domestic firms to continue trade with Huawei till Nov 19 on one hand and added a fresh list of 46 Huawei affiliates to the Entity List on the other  These included global R D and innovation centers of the Chinese telecom major as the U S  government aimed to stifle the company from extending its market dominance as 5G deployments across the globe pick up pace  Meanwhile  the stop gap arrangement provided a much needed boost to the beleaguered industry that battled trade uncertainty with continued tariff war   The Trump administration has also remained non committal about the proposed tariffs that are likely to be effective Sep 1  Notably  the U S  government had earlier decided to impose 10  tariff on  300 billion of Chinese imports from next month before Trump opted to delay taxing about 60  of the items from the list until Dec 15  These included cellphones  video game consoles  computer monitors  some clothing and footwear items that formed a sizeable portion of the consumer shopping basket  The strategic decision was aimed to offer some respite to the retailers and enable them to stockpile things for the back to school and holiday season  The two back to back rollbacks seem to hint that the U S  consumers are feeling the tariff pinch  offering hopes of a possible patch up at a later date Although the two warring countries are expected to resume their trade negotiations in September  tense undercurrents related to Huawei continued to linger  An escalation of the trade conflict is in the cards as the communist nation has threatened to deal fire with fire     Regarding company specific news  media strategies  patent deals  product launches and
