Prepared Remarks 
OperatorGood day  ladies and gentlemen  and welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2019  Hess Corporation Conference Call  My name is Liz  and I will be your operator for today   Operator Instructions   I would now like to turn the conference over to Jay Wilson  Vice President of Investor Relations  Please proceed Jay R  Wilson    Vice President  Investor RelationsThank you  Liz  Good morning  everyone  and thank you for participating in our fourth quarter earnings conference call  Our earnings release was issued this morning and appears on our website    Today s conference call contains projections and other forward looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities Laws These statements are subject to known and unknown risk and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied in such statements  These risks include those set forth in the Risk Factors section of Hess  annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC  Also on today s conference call  we may discuss certain non GAAP financial measures  A reconciliation of the differences between these non GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website As usual  with me today are John Hess  Chief Executive Officer  Greg Hill  Chief Operating Officer  and John Rielly  Chief Financial Officer  I ll now turn the call over to John Hess John B  Hess    Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Jay  Welcome everyone to our fourth quarter conference call  I will review our continued progress in executing our strategy  Then Greg Hill will discuss our operating performance  and then  John Rielly will review our financial results  We had an outstanding year in terms of operational performance and continued execution of our long term strategy  achieving a number of important milestones and delivering higher production and lower capital and exploratory expenditures than our original guidance  With Guyana and the Bakken as our growth engines and Malaysia and the deepwater Gulf of Mexico as our cash engines  our portfolio is on track to deliver increasing and strong financial returns  visible and low risk production growth and industry leading cash flow growth It is important to note that both Guyana and the Bakken will become significant cash generators over the next several years  as we have stated in our investor presentations where we provide our financial outlook through 2025  Our portfolio is positioned to generate approximately 20  compound annual cash flow growth and more than 10  compound annual production growth and our portfolio breakeven is projected to decrease to below  40 per barrel Brent by 2025 As our free cash flow grows  we will prioritize return of capital to shareholders  both in terms of dividends and opportunistic share repurchases  Another key element of our strategy is maintaining a strong balance sheet and liquidity position and managing risk  We ended the year with more than  1 5 billion in cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet and have hedged 150 000 barrels of oil per day in 2020 using put options with 130 000 barrels per day at  55 per barrel WTI and 20 000 barrels per day at  60 per barrel Brent With outstanding execution throughout our portfolio  we were able to reduce our full year 2019 capital and exploratory expenditures to  2 74 billion  down approximately  115  Phonetic  million from our original guidance  We have kept our 2020 capital and exploratory budget to  3 billion in line with the guidance we provided at our December 2018 Investor Day  During the fourth quarter  we closed the previously announced transaction in which Hess Midstream converted to an Up C corporate structure and acquired Hess Infrastructure Partners As a result of the transaction  we received approximately  300 million in cash and owned 47  of Hess Midstream  Turning to Guyana  where Hess has a 30  interest in the Stabroek Block and ExxonMobil is the operator  2019 was an outstanding year in terms of both exploration and developments  On December 20th  the Liza Phase 1 development achieved first production and is expected to reach its full capacity of 120 000 gross barrels of oil per day in the coming months We recognize this pivotal moment in Guyana s history and are committed to working collaboratively with the government  our partners and the people of Guyana to build a safe and sustainable industry that fulfills the promise of shared prosperity  The Liza Unity floating production storage and offloading vessel or FPSO is under construction for the second phase of Liza Development  It is expected to start production in Guyana by mid 2022 with a production capacity of 220 000 gross barrels of oil per day Front end engineering design for a third FPSO  the Prosperity  is under way to develop the Payara field pending government approvals and project sanctioning  Production from Payara could start as early as 2023 reaching an estimated 220 000 gross barrels of oil per day  From an exploration perspective  2019  was a banner year with five new discoveries at Hamaira  Tilapia  Yellowtail  Tripletail and Mako On Monday  we announced an increase in the estimate of gross discovered recoverable resources for the Stabroek Block to more than 8 billion barrels of oil equivalent  We continue to see multibillion barrels of exploration potential remaining  We also announced a significant oil discovery at Uaru  marking the 16th discovery on the Stabroek Block  The Uaru discovery will be incremental to the new resources estimate Turning to the Bakken  our largest operated asset  Our team had a very strong year  Full year net production in 2019 for the Bakken averaged 152 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day  well above our original guidance range of 135 000 to 145 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and nearly 30  higher than 2018  Our Bakken performance showed the benefits of our successful transition to plug and perf completions  As a result  net oil production for 2019 was up 22  compared to 2018 and we are on track for Bakken production to average approximately 200 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2021 In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico  our successful oil discovery last quarter at Esox will be brought online next month as a low cost tie back to the Tubular Bells production facilities  Hess is the operator and holds a 57 14  interest  Now turning to our 2019 financial results for the fourth quarter  Our adjusted net loss was  180 million compared to adjusted net loss of  77 million in the fourth quarter of 2018  primarily reflecting the effects of lower realized prices Full year 2019 net production was 290 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day  excluding Libya  17  higher than the pro forma 248 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day produced in 2018 In 2020  our net production is forecast to average between 330 000 and 335 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day  excluding Libya  Bakken net production is forecast to average approximately 180 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2020  As we continue to execute our strategy  our Board  our leadership team and each of our employees will be guided by our long standing commitment to sustainability in terms of safety  protecting the environment and making a positive impact on the communities where we operate We are gratified to have been recognized by a number of third party organizations for the quality of our environmental  social and governance performance and disclosure  most recently achieving leadership status in CDP s global climate analysis for the 11th consecutive year  In summary  we are proud of our 2019 performance and look forward to continuing this momentum into 2020 and future years as we execute our differentiated long term strategy With increasing cash margins and production volumes  our cash flow through 2025 is projected to grow at a rate that outpaces our industry peers and most companies in the S P 500  As our portfolio generates increasing cash flow  the majority will be deployed toward increased return of capital to our shareholders through dividend increases and opportunistic share repurchases I will now turn the call over to Greg for an operational update Gregory P  Hill    President and Chief Operating OfficerThanks  John  2019 marked another year of exceptional performance and strategic execution  In particular  I would like to call out three major operational highlights from 2019  First  we beat our guidance for both production and for capital and exploratory expenditures  Our 2019 net production averaged 290 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day excluding Libya  which was above our original guidance of between 270 000 and 280 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and also above our most recent guidance of approximately 285 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day At the same time  our 2019 capital and exploratory expenditures were  2 74 billion  approximately  150  Phonetic  million below our original guidance  Second  we continued our extraordinary run of success on the 6 6 million acres Stabroek Block in Guyana with five discoveries with the start of production from the Liza Phase 1 development in December  ahead of schedule and under budget and with the sanction of the Liza Phase II development which is on track for first oil by mid 2022 Third  in the Bakken  we successfully completed our transition to plug and perf completions while driving down drilling and completion costs  Our plug and perf transition has on average delivered a 15  uplift in IP180 production  and at the same time  we reduced our drilling and completion costs from an average of approximately  7 5 million per well in the fourth quarter of 2018 to approximately  6 5 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 By the end of 2020  we expect our D C costs will approach  6 million per well  Proved reserves at the end of 2019 stood at 1 197 billion barrels of oil equivalent  Net proved reserve additions and revisions in 2019 totaled 121 million barrels of oil equivalent including negative net price revisions of 35 million barrels of oil equivalent  resulting in an overall 2019 production replacement ratio of 104   The majority of the additions were in the Bakken and Guyana Now turning to production  In the fourth quarter of 2019  Companywide net production averaged 316 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day excluding Libya  above our guidance of approximately 300 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day  driven by strong performance across the portfolio and in particular the Bakken For the full year 2020  we forecast net production to average between 330 000 and 335 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day excluding Libya  which is a 15  increase from 2019  In the first quarter of 2020  we forecast net production to average between 320 000 and 325 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day  In the Bakken  fourth quarter net production averaged 174 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day  an increase of approximately 38  above the year ago quarter and above our guidance of 165 000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day For the full year 2019  Bakken net production averaged 152 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day above our original guidance of between 135 000 and 145 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and our most recent full year guidance of 150 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day These results reflect the strong performance of our plug and perf completions and the quality of our acreage position  For the full year of 2020  we forecast Bakken net production to average approximately 180 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day  which is approximately 18  higher than 2019 Our full year forecast reflects the impact of a 45 day planned shutdown of the Tioga Gas plant in the third quarter  During the shutdown  we will perform a turnaround and tie in the plant expansion project  which will increase capacity from 250 million cubic feet per day to 400 million cubic feet per day In 2020  we expect to drill approximately 170 wells and bring approximately 175 new wells online  compared with 160 wells drilled and 156 wells brought online in 2019  In the first quarter of 2020  we expect Bakken net production to average approximately 170 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day Our first quarter 2020 forecast reflects lower planned activity levels due to seasonally difficult winter weather conditions where we expect to bring on line approximately 30 new wells compared with 59 in the fourth quarter of 2019  Net production will increase in the Bakken throughout the year growing to approximately 200 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day by the end of 2020  As discussed previously  we plan to drop our rig count from six rigs in 2020 to four in 2021  At this level of activity  we expect to hold production relatively flat for at least five years and generate approximately  750 million of free cash flow annually at  55 per barrel WTI Moving to the offshore  in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico  net production averaged 70 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the fourth quarter and 66 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the full year 2019 in line with our guidance  Our focused exploration program in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico yielded an oil discovery in the fourth quarter at the Esox 1 well in Mississippi  Canyon A dual completion was successfully run in the subsea installations under way  which will tie back to the Tubular Bells production facility  We expect to achieve first oil in February  Esox 1 is a high return cash generative tieback opportunity that was well executed  The timeframe from discovery to first oil is expected to be less than four months  In 2020  we forecast net production from our deepwater Gulf of Mexico assets to average approximately 65 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day This includes extended planned maintenance shutdowns in the second quarter  At the Malaysia Thailand Joint Development Area in the Gulf of Thailand where Hess has a 50  interest  net production averaged 36 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the fourth quarter and 35 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the full year of 2019 At the North Malay Basin  also in the Gulf of Thailand where Hess is a operator and has a 50  interest  net production averaged 28 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the fourth quarter and for the full year 2019  Combined net production from our JDA and North Malay Basin assets is forecast to average approximately 60 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the full year 2020 Turning to Guyana  where Hess has a 30  interest in the Stabroek Block and ExxonMobil is the operator  in December  we announced a 15th discovery on the block at the Mako 1 well located approximately six miles southeast of the Liza Field  Mako 1 drilled in 5 315 feet of water  encountered approximately 164 feet of high quality oil bearing sandstone reservoir On Monday  we announced another significant oil discovery at Uaru  which is located approximately ten miles northeast of the Liza Field  The Uaru one well drilled in 6 342 feet of water encountered approximately 94 feet of high quality oil bearing sandstone reservoir The well was drilled in a down dip location on a large stratigraphic trap  Further appraisal and testing is planned  Based on the 15 discoveries  through year end 2019  the estimate of gross discovered recoverable resources for the Stabroek Block has been increased to more than 8 billion barrels of oil equivalent  up from more than 5 billion barrels of oil equivalent only one year ago The Uaru discovery is incremental to this new resource estimate  The continuing growth of the resource base on the block has been truly remarkable  Looking forward  after the Noble Tom Madden completes the evaluation of the Uaru discovery  the drillship will move to development drilling for Liza Phase 2  The Stena Carron is currently engaged on a well test at the Yellowtail discovery after which it will drill and test the Yellowtail 2 appraisal well After completing the evaluation program for Mako 1  the Noble Don Taylor will next drill and test the Longtail 2 appraisal well  Finally the Noble Bob Douglas will continue drilling development wells  As announced on Monday  the operator intends to bring in a fifth drillship later this year  We expect the first half of 2020 will be dominated by appraisal activities primarily in the greater Turbot area  In the second half of the year  we plan to drill several new exploration wells  including some that will test the emerging deeper plays on the Stabroek Block Turning now to our Guyana developments  On December 20th  production commenced from Liza Phase 1 development less than five years after the discovery of hydrocarbons and well ahead of the industry average for deepwater developments  The project also came in under budget  At sanction  Liza Phase 1 was budgeted at  4 4 billion growth including the purchase of the FPSO We now expect the gross cost for the development to be approximately  3 5 billion or 21  below the sanctioned estimate  Liza Phase 1 production continues to ramp up  Current gross production is approximately 75 000 barrels of oil per day from three of the five producers available at start up  Production is expected to reach the FPSO s capacity of 120 000 barrels of oil per day in the coming months For the full year 2020  we forecast our net production to average approximately 25 000 barrels of oil per day  The Liza Phase 2 development is progressingTo plan  On January 13th  the hole for the Liza Unity FPSO which will have a capacity of 220 000 barrels of oil per day arrived at the Keppel yard in Singapore Construction of all 13 deck  Phonetic  modules is currently under way  Meanwhile in Guyana  installation of subsea flow lines and equipment is under way and development drilling is expected to begin next month  We continue to forecast first oil by mid 2022  Pending government approvals and project sanctioning  a third development at Payara is planned to utilize an FPSO with a gross production capacity of 220 000 barrels of oil per day with first oil as early as 2023 Together with Hammerhead  discoveries on the southeast portion of the block including Turbot  Yellowtail  Longtail  Pluma  Tilapia and Tripletail will underpin future FPSOs In closing  our execution continues to be strong  The Bakken is on a capital efficient growth trajectory  Our offshore assets in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and Malaysia continue to generate significant free cash flow and Guyana continues to get bigger and better  all of which positions us to deliver industry leading returns  material free cash flow generation and significant shareholder value I will now turn the call over to John Rielly John P  Rielly    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Greg  In my remarks today  I will compare results from the fourth quarter of 2019 to the third quarter of 2019  We incurred a net loss of  222 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to a net loss of  212 million in the third quarter of 2019  On an adjusted basis  which excludes items affecting comparability of earnings between periods  we incurred a net loss of  180 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to a net loss of  105 million in the previous quarter For E P  on an adjusted basis  E P incurred a net loss of  124 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to a net loss of  41 million in the previous quarter  The changes in the after tax components of adjusted E P results between the fourth quarter and third quarter of 2019 were as follows  Higher exploration cost reduced results by  56 million  Lower realized selling prices reduced results by  13 million  All other items reduced results by  14 million for an overall reduction in fourth quarter results of  83 million For Midstream  on an adjusted basis  the Midstream segment had net income of  49 million in the fourth quarter of 2019  compared to  39 million in the previous quarter  reflecting higher throughput volumes  Midstream EBITDA on an adjusted basis and before noncontrolling interest amounted to  157 million in the fourth quarter of 2019  compared to  134 million in the previous quarter For corporate  on an adjusted basis  after tax corporate and interest expenses were  105 million in the fourth quarter of 2019  compared to  103 million in the previous quarter  Now turning to our financial position  at quarter end  excluding Midstream  cash and cash equivalents were  1 540 billion and total liquidity was  5 4 billion  including available committed credit facilities  while debt and finance lease obligations totaled  5 640 billion In December 2019  Hess Midstream completed its previously announced acquisition of Hess Infrastructure Partners with the conversion to an Up C corporate structure and incentive distribution right simplification  As consideration for the transaction  we received additional shares and approximately  300 million in cash  We now own approximately 134 million shares of Hess Midstream or approximately 47  In the fourth quarter of 2019  net cash provided from operating activities was  286 million or  550 million before changes in working capital and items affecting comparability  while cash outlays for capital expenditures were  825 million in the fourth quarter  Changes in working capital reduced cash flows from operating activities by  234 million in the fourth quarter  primarily reflecting premiums paid for crude oil hedging contracts For calendar year 2020  our crude oil hedge positions consist of WTI put options with a notional amount of 130 000 barrels of oil per day that have an average monthly floor price of  55 per barrel and Brent put options with a notional amount of 20 000 barrels of oil per day that have an average monthly floor price of  60 per barrel Now turning to guidance  first for exploration and production  we project E P cash costs excluding Libya to be in the range of  11 50 to  12 50 per barrel of oil equivalent for the first quarter and for the full year of 2020  DD A expense excluding Libya is forecast to be in the range of  16 50 to  17 50 per barrel of oil equivalent for the first quarter and for the full year of 2020 This results in projected total E P unit operating costs  excluding Libya to be in the range of  28 to  30 per barrel of oil equivalent for the first quarter and for the full year of 2020  As guided earlier  capital and exploratory expenditures in 2020 are expected to be  3 billion  Exploration expenses excluding dry hole costs are expected to be in the range of  50 million to  55 million in the first quarter  with full year 2020 guidance expected to be in the range of  210 million to  220 million The Midstream tariff is projected to be in the range of  225 million to  235 million in the first quarter  with full year 2020 guidance expected to be in the range of  940 million to  965 million  E P tax expense excluding Libya is expected to be in the range of  15 million to  20 million for the first quarter and in the range of  80 million to  90 million for the full year 2020 As highlighted earlier  we have purchased crude oil hedge positions for calendar year 2020  We expect non cash option premium amortization which will be reflected in our realized selling prices to reduce our results by approximately  70 million per quarter Now turning to Midstream  we anticipate net income attributable to Hess from the Midstream segment to be in the range of  45 million to  55 million in the first quarter and full year 2020 guidance is expected to be in the range of  205 million to  215 million  For corporate  corporate expenses are estimated to be in the range of  30 million to  35 million in the first quarter and full year 2020 guidance is expected to be in the range of  115 million to  125 million Interest expense is estimated to be in the range of  85 million to  90 million for the first quarter with the full year 2020 guidance expected to be  350 million to  360 million  The increase from 2019 is due to seizing interest capitalization at the Liza Field  which commenced production in December 2019 This concludes my remarks  we will be happy to answer any questions  I will now turn the call over to the operator Questions and Answers Operator Operator Instructions   Your first question comes from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America Doug Leggate    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystThanks  Good morning everybody John B  Hess    Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  Doug Doug Leggate    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystGuys  it looks like the market doesn t like the guidance too much  So I wonder if you could talk a little bit about the cadence of what s going on with downtime through the course of the year  Greg  you touched on Tioga  but I wonder    and obviously  you ve given us a first quarter run rate for the Bakken  but can you kind of walk us through how does that progresses through the year because clearly 174 000 in fourth quarter and now 180 000 average for the full year  looks a little soft and maybe touch on the Gulf of Mexico planned downtime as well Gregory P  Hill    President and Chief Operating OfficerYeah  Thanks  Doug  So  as we mentioned  we do have the turnaround at the Tioga Gas plant  It s going to be about 45 days and we re going to turn it around and also tie in the gas plant expansion as we mentioned  Now that s not going to have much of an impact  if any on oil  It s going to be primarily gas and the net effect of that is about 6 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day If I turn   Doug Leggate    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystFor the year Greg  or for the quarter Gregory P  Hill    President and Chief Operating OfficerFor the year  yeah  for the year  thanks Doug  And then if I turn to the Gulf of Mexico  we have two major shut downs in the second quarter  one at Conger and one at Llano  both of which are down for 30 days  We also have Penn State down for about eight days in the second quarter So the net impact of that on the quarter is about 13 000 barrels a day Doug Leggate    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystOkay  that starts to make a bit more sense and I appreciate the emphasis that oil doesn t get    gets hit  thank you for that  So my follow up is not to be too predictable is obviously on Guyana and I know we have the Exxon Analyst Day on March 5th  so to the extent you can share  it seems that the appraisal activity focused around Turbot is probably I m guessing is to define what the scale of that development is going to look like over time  You previously defined it as a major development hub  But we also know that Hammerhead has been passed to the development team for Exxon So I m just wondering if you can kind of walk us through your current thought on the timing of the scale of that 2025 run rate  and John Rielly  how does that    how does that impact the 2018 guidance you gave us of a run rate  3 billion capital program  and I ll leave it there  Thanks Gregory P  Hill    President and Chief Operating OfficerYeah  Thanks  Doug  I think  you know  as we ve spoken before you re right  I mean Hammerhead has been passed off to the development team  that notionally right now is about 140 000 barrels of oil capacity kind of vessel and then as you mentioned  all of the appraisal activities that are ongoing  really what I call on the eastern seaboard between Turbot and Liza are really trying to understand how many vessels will it take to evacuate all of that oil  which is substantial along that Eastern Seaboard  So clearly vessel five is going to be in that area and probably several vessels after that  but we re trying to figure all that out  how many vessels will it take and obviously the fifth vessel will be a large one  it will be in the 220 class like the others are But specific timing of the number of vessels and timing of the ones after five  that s really what we re working on and that s kind of the heavy lift for this year  Doug to really understand that John P  Rielly    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerAnd then Doug as far as our capital program  as we laid out on our Investor Day  we had  3 billion this year  We do have if you see from the Investor Day a little bit more next year as we move on with these developments  And then as we ve talked about  it is an approximate  3 billion and right now  there is no change to that number We ve got a nice cadence going to Exxon  as an aside  has been doing a fantastic job on the execution of Phase 1 and now Phase 2 is    the execution is going along well and so it s    they re doing a great job for Guyana and for the    for the partners  So what we re seeing from our capital program is that  that  3 billion is a good number Right now as Greg said  we re unsure of FPSOs beyond the five and we ll see that  but again  that will be much later in the profile of our    of our timing of free cash flow  because as you remember  once Phase 2 comes on  it s a big inflection point for us from a free cash flow standpoint  So any FPSOs  be it 6  7 or something beyond that  will be in a good period for us  when we re generating a lot of free cash flow Doug Leggate    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystI appreciate that guys  and I ll see you in a couple of weeks  Thank you Gregory P  Hill    President and Chief Operating OfficerOkay  Thank you OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Ryan Todd with Simmons Energy Ryan Todd    Simmons Energy    AnalystGreat  thanks  Maybe one follow up initially on Guyana  Can you talk about on the upwards revision to the resource estimate 8 billion barrels  Was all that based on the inclusion of incremental discoveries since the last estimate or was there any component driven by upward revision that estimates a prior discoveries  maybe just can you talk about the primary drivers of what you continue to see as the significant upward pressure on resource Gregory P  Hill    President and Chief Operating OfficerNo  I think the absolute grand majority of that was all new discoveries  So it s just continuing to add to this extraordinary success rate  five in 2019 and already another one in 2020 with more to come Ryan Todd    Simmons Energy    AnalystGreat  thanks  And then maybe a follow up in the Bakken  I mean  the Bakken continues to exceed expectations in terms of productivity and also impressive cost  can you talk about some of the drivers of what you re seeing in terms of the strong Bakken production and maybe you highlighted actual and targeted reductions of well cost for the Bakken in 2020  What are the drivers  and what are you seeing there in terms of costs in the basin Gregory P  Hill    President and Chief Operating OfficerYeah  So let me start with costs first  As I mentioned in my opening remarks  I m really proud of the team and their ability to drive cost down with lean manufacturing  So if you think about our journey in 2019  we started at 7 5  in the fourth quarter of 2018  7 3  in Q1  7  in Q2  6 7  in Q3 and 6 5  in Q4 So that s an amazing cost reduction over 12 months  driven primarily by lean manufacturing  but also technology  And then as we look forward to next year  obviously that flattens out a bit  part of lean manufacturing  but we still think we ll be at 6  by the end of the year  The biggest driver on that is going to be again technology and lean  but we also are seeing some softness in the sand costs and also pressure pumping  So we ve built some of that into our cost estimates for next year Regarding the productivity  really a function of where we re drilling  but also the plug and perf coming in very well  So on average  our IP180 were up 15   But if you look at certain areas of the field  particularly in the southern part of the field  we ve outperformed that 15  in those areas and those are very good prolific areas of the Bakken  And as we look forward to our 2020 program  again  it s a 175 wells  be very similar EURs kind of in the 1 mboe  Phonetic  to 1 2 mboe  Phonetic  range  IP180s in the 110 mboe  Phonetic  to 120 mboe  Phonetic  range and IRRs at 60 mboe  Phonetic   well above 75  So again a very strong program in 2020 Ryan Todd    Simmons Energy    AnalystGreat  Thanks  Greg  Very helpful OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Roger Read with Wells Fargo Roger Read    Wells Fargo Securities    AnalystYeah  Thanks  good morning  Maybe just to follow up on the Bakken question  and this may be premature  but given that you re continuing to see improvements  as we think about holding flat at 200 000 a day  kind of end of this year onwards  any reason at this point or any optimism to think about that costing less or maybe not taking quite four rigs as we go forward or do we just need to balance that as you kind of move from    as you mentioned the premium spots to maybe the next tier down that s incorporated in the outlook Gregory P  Hill    President and Chief Operating OfficerYeah  I think    I think it s a balance as you said  So we re pretty confident that we can hold it flat at the 200 range for at least five years and probably longer  And as you mentioned  as technology improvements continue to occur  as costs potentially continue to come down  obviously that plateau will be extended even longer  And I will mention that in our tier 2 acreage  we are doing a lot of trials on profit loading  on number of entry points on spacing  So we are not    we are not decided yet in some of those areas exactly what that s going to be So the assumption going forward is none of that s built in  So I m very optimistic that that will get much better as we go forward  as we learn in those areas Roger Read    Wells Fargo Securities    AnalystYeah  And it certainly has not been a static environment so far  right  One other question and it s got two parts  I apologize for doing it that way  but it s some of the push back we ve gotten post results here  one is the hedging program  so I ll just kind of put the question up to you of why hedge The second part is we did see debt go up in the quarter  it looks like mostly that was to take care of the Midstream side of things  but I was wondering if you could clarify on those two points for us John P  Rielly    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSure  Roger  And let me do the second one first  just quick  The debt that went up was related to Midstream and the completion of the transaction that we spoke about the acquisition of Hess Infrastructure Partners and the conversion to the Up C  That was the debt  So it s just purely Midstream debt that is non recourse to Hess  As far as the hedging  Roger  you know the price we have that from our Investor Day there with Bakken getting up to 200 000 barrels a day and bringing on Phase 2 So what we do is  we look at it year by year and we put these hedges on for insurance just to ensure that we can fund that investment program because of the returns that that program will drive for us  So we re getting closer and closer Phase 2 right is mid 2022  We just want to finish this Guyana program  execute it  continue to execute that and as Greg said  continue to execute our six rig program  which will drop to four rigs  the following year And so we just put hedges on for insurance purposes and hopefully we don t use them Roger Read    Wells Fargo Securities    AnalystI appreciate it  Thank you OperatorYour next question comes from Jeanine Wai with Barclays Jeanine Wai    Barclays    AnalystHi  good morning everyone Gregory P  Hill    President and Chief Operating OfficerGood morning Jeanine Wai    Barclays    AnalystI guess my two questions are on capex and Guyana  The first one is  it looks like total E P capex for the quarter came in a little bit higher than expected  And I believe some of that might be related to Guyana  So can you provide any color on that and any implications for Phase 2 that it may imply John B  Hess    Chief Executive OfficerIt did come in for the quarter  very small amount  again  we just went out with an approximately  850 million  came in at  876 million  as Greg mentioned  with the Bakken  we did get a little bit more completions in the Bakken  So a little bit is in the Bakken  a little bit of it is in acceleration in Guyana and the rest of it is kind of just through the portfolio  really small numbers  Again  we were just given approximate amounts  So there is no implication on that going forward  We have the  3 billion capital that we set  We are going up approximately  300 million in Guyana next year versus 2019 And again  we laid that out for the continuation of Phase 1   400 million for Phase 2 and then the rest of it for Phase 3 and future developments Jeanine Wai    Barclays    AnalystOkay  great  That s really helpful  Thank you for that  My second question on Guyana  can you comment on any of the recent news headlines about the potential for a contract renegotiation John B  Hess    Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Most of the news that you hear is not from reliable sources  neither the current government or opposition government  I think they both have been pretty clear that they re going to honor the PSC  So I think that s the real takeaway you should have Jeanine Wai    Barclays    AnalystOkay  great  thank you for taking my questions John B  Hess    Chief Executive OfficerPleasure OperatorYour next question comes from the line of David Deckelbaum with Cowen David Deckelbaum    Cowen    AnalystGood morning  everyone  Thanks for taking my questions John B  Hess    Chief Executive OfficerThanks David Deckelbaum    Cowen    AnalystJust wanted to ask you  you talked about having the first tanker loading attributed to Hess or allocated to Hess in March with 1 million barrels  how do you see the listings or tanker loadings progressing throughout the year  Should we always be thinking about the same sort of capacity and what kind of cadence are you expecting throughout the year John B  Hess    Chief Executive OfficerSo the cadence can move around a little bit from that on how they get allocated  but here there s a general rule of thumb  It will be 1 million barrels each lift and for us  as you heard Greg gave the guidance on Guyana that it s 25 000 barrels a day for the year  If you multiply that by 365  you re getting just about 9 million    a little over 9 million barrels  So we expect just from a forecast standpoint to have nine lifts this year I can t exactly be specific which quarters that will be coming in  Our first lift  you re right is expected in early March David Deckelbaum    Cowen    AnalystOkay  I appreciate that  But it does sound like your net sales amount is approximating your production guidance for the year  So that s   John B  Hess    Chief Executive OfficerThat is correct  Quarter by quarter  you could get some under overlifts  but right  for the full year the sales should approximate the production amount David Deckelbaum    Cowen    AnalystGot it  And then just to revisit some of the Bakken guidance  I know that it s difficult to forecast with lumpiness around the quarters  but the expectation is that you d be exiting  20 at approximately that 200 000 equivalent target John B  Hess    Chief Executive OfficerYeah  We ll achieve that sometime in the fourth quarter David Deckelbaum    Cowen    AnalystOkay  And then the    in the third quarter with the Tioga turnaround and expansion  how is it that oil volumes are not impacted there from a logistical perspective John B  Hess    Chief Executive OfficerWell  again  there are separate systems  right  so you can    the gas is separated on the pad from the oil and it goes through a separate system  So you can still produce the oil  but obviously that gas goes through the plant  So that s where the impact is going to be  So we ll do some local flaring on the pads and some flaring at the gas plant as well during that 45 day shutdown But the oil will largely stay on David Deckelbaum    Cowen    AnalystOkay  Then I guess as a total program  you d still be under the regulations for flaring at the state level John B  Hess    Chief Executive OfficerYes  yes  There will be some restrictions that we ll have to deal with  but of course  you can get some dispensation for things like turnarounds  etc  So   David Deckelbaum    Cowen    AnalystAll right  I appreciate the color on that  Thank you  guys OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy Advisors Michael A Hall    Heikkinen Energy Advisors    AnalystThanks  good morning  Just curious  a little bit of an accounting question  I guess  on the Guyana volumes  the 25 000 a day  does that include cost barrel recoveries  If so  how much  if not  how should we think about that for 2020 John P  Rielly    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerIt does include that  It s just part of the normal production sharing contract that cost recovery barrels are included as part of our production and the partner s production  specifically   Michael A Hall    Heikkinen Energy Advisors    AnalystAnd do you have an estimate of how much of that is cost recovery by chance John P  Rielly    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerI could walk you may be through it a little bit more in detail after the call  but the contract is out there that you can see  but the way it basically works is on the revenue then 75  of the revenue goes for cost recovery for the contractors  So that s how you can factor  And then you go into profit share after that Michael A Hall    Heikkinen Energy Advisors    AnalystOkay  Yeah  I just want to make sure we are calibrating right  And then  I was curious on I guess the Gulf of Mexico  the capital on the 2020 plan  I think we backed into around  350 million or so relative to 2018 Analyst Day  you talked about annual average capital of  150 million to sustain 65 mboe a day  So I m just trying to wind those two things up and should we be    yeah  how do we reconcile those two things John P  Rielly    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerI just want to make sure we re on the same page with the numbers  So in our release that we went out for 2020  the Gulf of Mexico capital will be approximately  135 million for this year  That s what we re spending from a production aspect of it  Last year  we did have a higher amount  It was approximately  290 million and that is because we were running full year  we had two rigs running for Stampede which will be coming off contract here basically in the second quarter So there s lower Gulf of Mexico spend  And so  as you know  we will be tying in Esox which again helps and keeps us at that 65 000 barrels a day that we ve talked about Gregory P  Hill    President and Chief Operating OfficerAnd then as we did mentioned going forward  you can expect about  150 million to  200 million of capex per annum for infill and tieback wells  So  and this is our objective in the short term to medium term to maintain the goal for about 65 000 barrels a day and we ve been very successful doing that  If you look at Conger 10 that was about 6 000 barrels a day  Penn State 6  about 14 000 barrels a day  Llano 5 about eight and Esox is anticipated to be a very good well We see four to six more things that we d like to drill in the next couple of years in our expectation of keeping those hubs full  Then beyond that  of course  it will be greenfield  So we ll drill a greenfield exploration well probably one a year on average over the next several years  again trying to maintain that production or potentially even growing it with the new hub Michael A Hall    Heikkinen Energy Advisors    AnalystOkay  Yeah  I guess  that s helpful  And I guess to maybe make sure I m thinking about the numbers right here  I mean I was trying to connect  1 73 billion of total US Capital for the release  with the  1 375 billion in the Bakken and the remainder being in the Gulf of Mexico  with    I m assuming some of that being for exploration  So I guess what is being spent in the US  outside of the Bakken and the Gulf of Mexico  if anything  and how would you break out the  1 73 billion between the Bakken and the Gulf of Mexico John B  Hess    Chief Executive OfficerSeems like     Speech Overlap  Michael A Hall    Heikkinen Energy Advisors    AnalystSo that doesn t all add up John B  Hess    Chief Executive OfficerSo let s say so  you have  1 730 billion you re saying in the US  right  so we have  1 730 billion back out to Bakken  which is a  1 375 billion right in production  and you re going to back out  1 35 billion for the Gulf of Mexico  right  So then  the rest of that amount is in exploration  that can be wells being drilled or seismic being spent  So that approximate  200 million that you have left relates to exploration Michael A Hall    Heikkinen Energy Advisors    AnalystSure  Okay  And that exploration is all in the Gulf John B  Hess    Chief Executive OfficerIn the Gulf  correct  that US piece  correct Michael A Hall    Heikkinen Energy Advisors    AnalystOkay  thank you OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng with Scotiabank Paul Cheng    Scotiabank    AnalystHey guys  good morning Gregory P  Hill    President and Chief Operating OfficerGood morning Paul Cheng    Scotiabank    AnalystI have to apologize that I joined late  so my questions have already been answered  just let me know  so I will just look at the transcript  On    John I think two quick question for you on the    on the accounting  the hedging premium amortization  the  17  Phonetic  million a quarter is that a pre tax and after tax and also from an accounting standpoint since in Guyana you have the government willing to pick up the income tax  So when you guys report it  are you going to report that the corresponding tax as a gross up and then that you report it also the tax or that you just don t report any tax at all  How is the accounting treatment going to be Gregory P  Hill    President and Chief Operating OfficerOkay  so first on the hedges  it is pre tax and post tax  So that will be the same amount  because we have a valuation allowance against our net operating losses in the US  So that will be the same number  In Guyana  we do pay taxes  it s in the entitlement of our contracts  So the taxes are embedded in our entitlement effectively reducing our entitlement and therefore what we do then with our entitlement for financial reporting purposes is disaggregate that and then show the tax and gross it up from relating to that I can walk you through that more after the call but that is how we are doing that Paul Cheng    Scotiabank    AnalystYeah  Because I think that s how Apache have done in Egypt  I just wanted to make sure that that s the same methodology  because that s how we are modeling right now Gregory P  Hill    President and Chief Operating OfficerYes  that is how it would work and happy to discuss that further  We can do that Paul Cheng    Scotiabank    AnalystOkay  And Greg when I m looking at your production guidance  that seems conservative  Is there any area that maybe we have a bit or more of the upside Gregory P  Hill    President and Chief Operating OfficerI think you probably missed the start of the call  where we kind of went through the shutdowns  again Tioga Gas Plant down 45 days  and then a heavy maintenance period in the Gulf of Mexico  where we have two of our big assets down 30 days in the second quarter  So that s really kind of what reduced our normal capacity of our production was those two shutdowns Paul Cheng    Scotiabank    AnalystOkay  I will read the transcript  And then a final one  have you guys booked any additional reserve related to the Liza one last year John B  Hess    Chief Executive OfficerWe booked a minor amount for the wells that we were drilled here  Again a rule of thumb  as you know  Paul  probably  we ve got a third of the reserves on the books right now for Phase 1 and then as we get the dynamic data  see how the injection goes we ll begin to pick up additional reserves Paul Cheng    Scotiabank    AnalystOkay  thank you OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James Pavel Molchanov    Raymond James   Associates    AnalystGuys  thanks for taking the question  So this year  after five years you will begin to drill on a brand new exploration block in Guyana and given your experience on Stabroek  I m curious what kind of expectation should we be thinking about in terms of pre drill estimates and the geology of this new acreage that you re going to be getting under way John B  Hess    Chief Executive OfficerNo  I think you re referring to the Kaieteur Block  which is outboard of Stabroek which we have a 15  interest in Exxon  the operator  See very similar play types that exist on the    on the Liza block are on the Stabroek Block  And in fact we ll spud our first well  a well called Tanager this year on that block  So stay tuned Pavel Molchanov    Raymond James   Associates    AnalystOkay  all right  fair enough  And a question about Hess Midstream  So now that the Bakken is very close to  if not reaching plateau what s going to be the dropdown model for the MLP  if the underlying production is essentially flat lining John B  Hess    Chief Executive OfficerSo for Hess Midstream now  it s not an MLP in all the assets in North Dakota that have been acquired by the Midstream because we completed that transaction in the fourth quarter  So they have    now have all the gathering facility there in the Tioga gas plant  So from the old dropdown model that won t be happening going forward  So what you do have here is this growth that we have  So in the Bakken  obviously as we re going from 180 000 to 200 000 barrels a day  We re going to  they re going to pick up that growth that Hess Midstream will be picking up that Then as you know  the flaring regulations get tighter and tighter as we move on in North Dakota  And so what Hess Midstream is doing now is  they completed the LM4 plant and so picked up additional gas processing capacity there  We re doing the expansion of the Tioga gas plant and so that s going up to 400 million cubic feet a day and it is looking to pickup third party business as these flaring regulations get tighter and tighter and we are in a good infrastructure position and in a good position to pick up that So there s a lot of growth going from there  and they will look for other opportunities up there in North Dakota Pavel Molchanov    Raymond James   Associates    AnalystAll right  I appreciate it guys OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs Brian Singer    Goldman Sachs    AnalystThank you  Good morning John B  Hess    Chief Executive OfficerGood morning Brian Singer    Goldman Sachs    AnalystCan you talk about the benefits and risks of in Guyana of co developments of FPSOs and how discussions and plans with the operator are evolving if at all as you ramp up the first FPSO and you gain greater insight into the reservoir and processes  How on the table is this  when you look out to FPSOs  3  4  5  or beyond Gregory P  Hill    President and Chief Operating OfficerNo  I think I think Brian  the current strategy which we agree with is the design one  build many  because you can get such leverage of learnings as you go from vessel one to two to three  right  Now  what is likely going to happen is the time frame between those vessels will begin to collapse So from a cadence to maybe one a year  maybe becomes every nine months or potentially even every six months as we get out in time  That s what those synergies will do for you So that s what we really see  we don t really see doubling or tripling up because that s very inefficient  but rather design one  build many but continue to collapse the timeframe based on efficiencies John B  Hess    Chief Executive OfficerYeah  And just to embellish on that  it s really a phased approach to be capital efficient  ExxonMobil has done a great job of optimizing the development  lowering the costs  the learnings from ship one help us in ship two and that will continue in ship three  So we re really looking at a phased approach  but as Greg said  maybe with more compression of the timeframe  And I just want to remind everyone  the 8 billion barrels of oil equivalent we talked about  we ve had 16 successes  So it s basically 500 million per discovery and that s world class  And it s got very low cost  very high returns and ExxonMobil is doing a great job moving the project forward Brian Singer    Goldman Sachs    AnalystGreat  thanks  And then  John  in your opening comments you talked about free cash flow over time going to dividend increases and opportunistic share repurchase  Is there any change in the timing of when you would expect to consider that  is that still when you get more in different cash flow mode post or with the start up of Phase 2 in Guyana or is that something that we could see earlier or later than that John B  Hess    Chief Executive OfficerNo  I would say right now stick with our guidance that it s going to be timed with Phase 2 coming online when again that is the big inflection point for us from a free cash flow and earnings standpoint Gregory P  Hill    President and Chief Operating OfficerAnd the priority will be on increasing the dividend as the first call Brian Singer    Goldman Sachs    AnalystGreat  thank you OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Vin Lovaglio with Mizuho Securities  Mr  Lovaglio  your phone may be on mute Paul Sankey    Mizuho Securities    AnalystHi  sorry  it s Paul Sankey here  Can you hear me John P  Rielly    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  we can hear you  Paul Paul Sankey    Mizuho Securities    AnalystYeah  Sorry about that  I got myself on mute  As we put a note on the ESG and oil and gas and you tested very  very well in terms of certainly your disclosures  Can you talk a little bit about some of the areas where you think you can still get better and I m specifically thinking about flaring  And beyond that  could you talk about the impact of Guyana and how that will change some of the metrics that you do such a great job of disclosing  Thanks John B  Hess    Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Paul  Obviously  ESG sustainability is a core value for the Company  We ve been doing a sustainability report for 22 years  We re honored and proud to be an industry leader  We want to make sure we continue that leadership role as we look at our flaring  let s say in the Bakken  we re ahead of the state limits and we have a program in place to continue that and we re looking at updating our sustainability efforts in terms of the environment and we ll be coming out with some new targets within the year for the next five years So that s a work in progress  but we always want to stay ahead of the regulations  And in terms of Guyana  the gas is basically reinjected and again ExxonMobil does a great job minimizing the flaring in start up  etc  but the majority of gas is reinjected  so there s really not an issue there  And one of the things we re going to be looking at in Guyana is how can we help the country going forward in social responsibility  which is something that s very important to our Company and our Board and every employee Paul Sankey    Mizuho Securities    AnalystGot it  John  Thanks very much for that  And then a follow up on the previous hedging question totally different subject  How do you expect that hedging program that is sort of changed around a little bit over time has    I wonder how you expect Guyana to affect that going forward and whether or not you have a different hedging strategy  let s say in perhaps five years  time  Thanks John B  Hess    Chief Executive OfficerSure  I mean we do look at it  Paul  year to year and make our decisions on our hedging requirements and right now  obviously with the investment still going in for Guyana until we get to that Phase 2  we wanted to put a significant amount of insurance on to ensure we fund that  As we move forward and we get to more free cash flow  we ll still be obviously have a heavy oil portion in our portfolio  we ll will make those decisions year to year and we could make some different decisions at that point in time Paul Sankey    Mizuho Securities    AnalystThank you  guys Operator Operator Closing Remarks Duration  64 minutesCall participants Jay R  Wilson

Prepared Remarks 
OperatorGood day  ladies and gentlemen  and welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2019 Hess Midstream Partners  Conference Call  My name is Dillon  and I ll be your operator for today   Operator Instructions   Later  we will conduct a question and answer session   Operator Instructions   I would now like to turn the conference over to Jennifer Gordon  Vice President of Investor Relations  Please proceed

the Risk Factor section of Hess Midstream s filings with the SEC  Also on today s conference call  we may discuss certain non GAAP financial measures  A reconciliation of the differences between these non GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the earnings release  With me today are John Gatling  President and Chief Operating Officer  and Jonathan Stein  Chief Financial Officer I ll now turn the call over to John Gatling John A  Gatling    President and Chief Operating OfficerThanks  Jennifer  Good afternoon  everyone  and welcome to Hess Midstream s fourth quarter 2019 conference call  Today  I ll review our operating performance and highlights as we continue to execute our strategy  provide additional details regarding our 2020 plans and discuss Hess Corporation s latest results and outlook for the Bakken  Jonathan will then review our financial results 2019 was a year of strong performance and strategic execution for Hess Midstream  We delivered year on year double digit percentage increases in volumes across all of our systems  realized significant EBITDA growth and completed the acquisition of Hess Infrastructure Partners  eliminating IDR payments and converting to an Up C corporate structure as part of the transaction We entered 2020 as a large scale  full service midstream Company  well positioned for visible adjusted EBITDA growth and increasing free cash flow generation with a platform that provides opportunity for broad investor participation  Also in 2019  we made substantial investments to further expand our strategically positioned infrastructure  including significantly increasing our total gas processing capacity  acquiring Hess  water business and completing a series of key Hess Midstream led gathering and compression projects  which were all delivered on time and on budget In partnership with Targa Resources  we started up the Little Missouri 4 gas plant in mid year  expanding our base and processing footprint  complementing our full fractionation capability at the Tioga Gas Plant  LM4 increased our total nameplate processing capacity by 100 million cubic feet per day  or an increase of 40  to 350 million cubic feet per day  And our capacity is continuing to grow with the in progress expansion of TGP  taking Hess Midstream s total Bakken processing capacity to 500 million cubic foot per day Complementing our strategic projects  we also continue to expand our gathering systems to accommodate growth from Hess and third party customers  And late in 2019  put our first Hess Midstream operated saltwater disposal well in service  In addition to our organic growth investments  in early 2019  we partnered with HIP to acquire Summit s Tioga oil  gas and water gathering systems  adding to the acquisitions and JV investments that HESM and HIP have made over the past couple of years Our targeted investments to expand our system footprint  combined with consistent and reliable operating performance enabled us to deliver strong volume growth in 2019  In the fourth quarter of 2019  we completed our volume ramp through the LM4 gas plant  albeit at a slower pace than anticipated During the quarter  we also progressively backfilled TGP  though  we did experience minor delays integrating some new third party volumes  Gas processing volumes averaged 308 million cubic foot per day in the quarter or approximately 90  of nameplate capacity  an increase of approximately 20  over the third quarter and 30  over the second quarter  which was prior to the start up of LM4 For full year 2019  gas processing volumes averaged 260 million cubic foot per day  a 12  increase over the prior year  For our crude oil business  fourth quarter 2019 crude terminaling volumes were 148 000 barrels of oil per day  a 14  increase over the third quarter  primarily driven by increasing Hess production  as Hess brought on 59 new wells online in the quarter  For full year 2019  crude terminaling volumes averaged 131 000 barrels of oil per day  a 30  increase over the prior year  Water gathering volumes were 50 000 barrels of water per day in the fourth quarter of 2019  and an 11  increase over the third quarter  driven by Hess  growing production and continued expansion of the water system For full year 2019  water gathering volumes averaged 100    averaged 41 000 barrels of water per day  an increase of 64   increased over prior year  Now turning to Hess upstream highlights  Earlier today  Hess reported fourth quarter 2019 production from the Bakken of 174 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day  an increase of approximately 38  over the year ago quarter  For full year 2019  Hess net Bakken production averaged 152 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day  reflecting the strong performance of the plug and perf completions and the quality of Hess  acreage position For full year 2020  Hess forecasts Bakken net production to average approximately 180 000 barrels of oil per day or 18  above full year 2019  In 2020  Hess expects to drill approximately 170 wells and bring online 175 compared to 160 wells drilled and 156 wells brought online in 2019  In the first quarter of 2020  Hess expects net production to average 170 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day  reflecting lower activity levels due to seasonally difficult winter weather conditions  Hess expects to bring online approximately 30 new wells compared to the 59 in the fourth quarter of 2019 Hess  which has already hedged a substantial portion of its 2020 crude oil production  expects to operate six rigs in the Bakken through 2020 and anticipates net production to increase throughout the year  approaching 200 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day by the end of 2020  which is a key driver of volume growth for Hess Midstream  Now turning to Hess Midstream guidance  Hess Midstream s project planning execution in 2019 laid an excellent foundation for another year of strong throughput and financial growth in 2020  driven primarily by the full year of LM4 operations and Hess  continued production growth For 2020  we re reaffirming our previously provided guidance  We expect gas gathering volumes to average between 300 million cubic foot per day and 310 million cubic foot per day and gas processing volumes to average between 285 million cubic foot per day and 295 million cubic foot per day  This guidance incorporates the previously announced 45 day TGP maintenance turnaround  which is planned to commence in the third quarter  reducing our annual gas gathering and processing volumes by approximately 30 million cubic foot per day First quarter 2020 gas volumes are anticipated to be relatively flat compared to fourth quarter 2019  primarily due to seasonal winter weather conditions  We continue to progress backfilling TGP and as we integrate incremental third party volumes  we expect to realize further volume growth in the second quarter  We continue to expect third parties to comprise approximately 30  of our total gas gathering and processing volumes  underlying our advantage infrastructure position in the basin  Turning to our crude oil assets  We anticipate continued growth in 2020  driven by increasing Hess production and a stable third party outlook For full year 2020  crude oil gathering volumes are expected to average between 125 000 and 130 000 barrels of oil per day  an increase of approximately 10  compared to 2019  And we anticipate crude terminaling volumes to average between 150 000 and 160 000 barrels of oil per day  an increase of approximately 18  compared to 2019  Third party throughputs are expected to remain at approximately 15  of our total crude oil volumes  First quarter crude oil volumes are expected to be approximately flat with the fourth quarter  reflecting lower planned activity levels due to seasonal winter weather  Turning to our water assets  We continue to expand our gathering footprint in 2020  which will bring more volumes into the system as Hess  production grows We anticipate 2020 water gathering volumes to average between 55 000 and 65 000 barrels of water per day  an increase of 46  over full year 2019  demonstrating the growth potential of these assets  First quarter water volumes are expected to be modestly up from the fourth quarter as we continue our infrastructure build out  For full year 2020  volume increases I ve described is a key driver to the expected 32  increase in adjusted EBITDA from 2019  from the midpoint of our 2020 guidance    to the midpoint of our 2020 guidance  Looking to the longer term  in this morning s press release  we provided our MVCs for 2022  illustrating the implied growth in system throughputs and our capacity continues to expand Turning to Hess Midstream s capital program  Our 2020 capital guidance remains unchanged  comprising approximately  335 million of expansion capital and  15 million of maintenance capital  We plan to invest approximately  155 million in gas processing  which includes the 150 million cubic foot per day expansion of TGP  This increase will take Hess Midstream s overall Bakken gas production capacity to 500 million cubic foot per day Expansion activities progressed in the fourth quarter of 2019  as we continue to advance civil construction and fabrication activities  We expect to begin major construction    major facility construction in 2020  The project is on pace to be completed by mid 2021  In 2020  we also plan to invest  60 million in gas compression and  120 million in oil  gas and water pipelines and well pad interconnects for Hess and third party customers In addition to our capital investment program  we continue to evaluate business development opportunities to further strengthen our portfolio and deliver competitive returns to our shareholders  In summary  for 2020  we continue to remain focused on executing our strategy and leveraging the new Hess Midstream structure to drive long term and sustainable growth I ll now turn the call over to Jonathan to review our financial results Jonathan C  Stein    Chief Financial OfficerThanks  John  and good afternoon  everyone  As John described  we are proud with the progress we ve made in 2019 on executing our strategy  The closing of the HIP acquisition and associated debt transactions in mid December were significant milestones for us  and and we entered 2020 well positioned for significant adjusted EBITDA growth and increasing free cash flow generation  while maintaining conservative leverage without the need for funding from the equity capital market to deliver our current plan With the midpoint of our 2020 guidance representing expected increases relative to our 2019 results of 40  in net income  32  in adjusted EBITDA and 88  in free cash flow defined as adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures  we truly have differentiated financial metrics  Hess Midstream has a track record of shareholder value creation to consistent delivery of our financial metrics  Since our IPO  we have delivered our targeted 15  annualized growth in our distribution per unit  And as we described  with the announced HIP transaction  we are maintaining our commitment to our targeted 15  annualized distribution per share growth through 2021 Consistent with that commitment  on January 27th  we announced our fourth quarter distribution that increased 3 6  quarter on quarter and 15  year on year  The distribution will be paid on February 14th to holders as of the February 6th record date  Turning to our results  I will compare results from the fourth quarter to the third quarter  For comparability and consistent with the closing of the transaction in the fourth quarter  all prior period results have been restated for the acquisition of HIP For the fourth quarter 2019  net income was  75 million compared to  87 million for the third quarter  Fourth quarter net income included approximately  26 million of costs related to our acquisition of HIP  Adjusted EBITDA  excluding the transaction costs for the fourth quarter was  158 million compared to  136 million for the third quarter The change in adjusted EBITDA relative to the third quarter was primarily attributable to the following  Our total revenues increased by greater than 15  quarter on quarter  including  revenues for our gathering segment increased by approximately  14 million  primarily driven by increasing Hess production Revenues for our processing segment increased by approximately  13 million  primarily driven by the ramp up of the LM4 gas processing plant and the continued backfill of TGP  And revenues for our terminaling segment increased by approximately  2 million  primarily driven by increasing Hess production  Total operating expenses including G A but excluding depreciation and amortization  pass through and transaction costs  were higher  decreasing adjusted EBITDA by approximately  6 million  including higher seasonal maintenance activity during the period of approximately  3 million and higher seasonal overhead of approximately  3 million LM4 processing fees  net of our proportional share of earnings and depreciation reduced adjusted EBITDA by approximately  1 million  resulting in fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA of  158 million  a 16  increase relative to the third quarter  Fourth quarter 2019 maintenance capital expenditures were approximately  2 million and net interest  excluding amortization of deferred finance costs was  16 million  The result was that distributable cash flow was approximately  140 million for the fourth quarter of 2019  covering our distribution by approximately 1 2 times Expansion capital expenditures in the fourth quarter were  107 million  At quarter end  debt was  1 8 billion  representing approximately three times leverage on a 2019 basis  Turning to our recalculation process  At the end of 2019  we completed our nomination process with Hess and updated our tariff rates for 2020 and all forward years As for cycles  the nomination process considered changes in actual and forecasted volumes and capex to maintain our contractual targeted return on capital deployed  Tariffs increased in 2020  primarily from recovering reduced revenues from lower volumes and generating incremental revenues on higher capex during 2019  as a result of the delay in LM4  which we had proactively integrated into our contract structure In our earnings release  we have also provided MVCs for the years 2020 through 2022  For 2022  MVCs were newly established  providing line of sight to potential long term growth in system throughput  For example  our 2022 MVCs for gas processing imply an approximate 18  annualized growth rate in nominated volumes from our actual 2019 volumes  Together with our gas gathering volumes  these gas assets comprised approximately 70  of our revenues  Our updated MVCs provide a solid baseline to our volume growth and are a key indicator of our financial strength beyond 2021 Turning to 2020  in the first quarter  we expect net income to be approximately  110 million to  120 million and adjusted EBITDA to be approximately  175 million to  185 million  an approximate 14  increase in EBITDA at the midpoint  relative to the fourth quarter  First quarter maintenance capital expenditures and net interest  excluding amortization of deferred finance costs are expected to be approximately  30 million  resulting in an expected DCF of approximately  145 million to  155 million  delivering distribution coverage at the midpoint of the range of approximately 1 2 times Relative to our fourth quarter 2019 results  the expected increase in adjusted EBITDA is primarily driven by higher tariff rates and seasonally lower opex  Looking through the rest of 2020  we expect to achieve our 15  distribution growth target with approximately 1 2 times distribution coverage  with approximately 85  of our expected revenues protected by MVCs and maintaining an adjusted EBITDA margin  consistent with our historical margin of greater than 75  As John described  we anticipate commencing a maintenance turnaround at TGP in the third quarter  during which time  we will incur higher operating expenses and maintenance capital and receive lower volumes and revenues  resulting in lower distribution coverage during the period of the turnaround  The turnaround is expected to last 45 days and has been fully incorporated into our 2020 volume and financial guidance already As a reminder  Hess Midstream will receive MVC payments during the turnaround  For 2020  overall  we are reaffirming our financial guidance  Full year net income is expected to be in the range of  440 million to  480 million  Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of  710 million to  750 million  which represents at the midpoint an approximate 32  increase over our 2019 results This annual EBITDA increase is primarily driven by higher annual volumes and MVCs  as well as higher tariff rates  driven by the annual inflation escalator  and the rate redetermination process offset by higher opex  primarily from the planned TGP turnaround  Maintenance capital and cash interest are projected to total approximately  110 million for the full year 2020 Distributable cash flow for 2020 is expected to be in the range of  600 million to  640 million  Putting it all together  we are well positioned for continued and sustainable growth  Compared to 2019 results  our 2020 guidance represents expected increases of 45  in net income  32  in adjusted EBITDA and 88  in free cash flow  Even with our continued gas processing and compression investment  we expect free cash flow of approximately  380 million at the midpoint of our 2020 adjusted EBITDA and capex guidance Looking forward to 2021  we expect approximately 25  annualized growth in adjusted EBITDA relative to 2019 and approximately 75  free cash flow conversion  funding both our expansion capex and distributions with DCF  Longer term  our updated MVCs highlight the continued organic growth we expect to continue in 2022 We have transitioned to a structure that is more attractive for broad investor participation and it highlights Hess Midstream s unique proposition of industry leading growth  best in class contract structure  strong free cash flow generation and conservative balance sheet This concludes my remarks  We ll be happy to answer any questions I will now turn the call over to the operator Questions and Answers Operator Operator Instructions   Your first question comes from the line of Phil Stuart from Scotiabank  Please proceed Philip Stuart    Scotiabank    AnalystGood morning  guys  Appreciate the commentary and the update on the 2022 MVCs  I wonder if we could start off with kind of the  120 million in ongoing or sustaining capex that you all identified kind of in the 2020 budget  As you look out to 2021 and 2022  as Hess starts to ramp down activity and kind of get into that maintenance mode  how do you see that bucket of capex trending kind of in the outer years Does it decline materially  or does it kind of sustain in that kind of  120 million range Jonathan C  Stein    Chief Financial OfficerYeah  So  I think the way to think about our run rate in terms of expansion capital going forward is that as we look forward  we ll be ramping up the compression expansion projects and TGP expansion primarily completed in 2020 and into 2021  So then based on that  we ll be able to achieve our growth targets based on lower ongoing capital  which is basically the    think of that  120 million  which is Hess and third party interconnects representing our ongoing capital  Together with  if you look at this year maintenance capital of  15 million  that gets you to total ongoing capital of about  135 million So without giving a specific number  certainly  if you look historically  our ongoing capital has been together with maintenance in that kind of range  For comparison  our annual depreciation has been approximately  150 million  So that s also consistent with that level of ongoing capex  So  you can kind of think of that level of where we are  kind of going forward looking at that bucket  plus maintenance and then certainly comparing it to our depreciation gives you some feel of what we expect going forward Philip Stuart    Scotiabank    AnalystGreat  I appreciate the commentary there  And then on TGP  do you have an estimate of how much capex is that project will include for 2021  understanding there is still a lot of moving pieces there  But just kind of curious if you can identify how much capex there is associated with that project kind of currently planned for 2021 John A  Gatling    President and Chief Operating OfficerYeah  So  we re not providing any real direction on 2021 capex for the expansion  but a significant portion of the facility construction work will be completed this year with some activities continuing into 2021  I would say the material amount of spend for the project will be primarily in 2020  but there will be some residual spend in 2021 as we kind of wrap up activities Philip Stuart    Scotiabank    AnalystOkay  Great  That makes sense  And then  I wonder if we could maybe step back a bit and talk about kind of the distribution policy  Post 2021  obviously  you all have laid out a good plan of 15  kind of annual growth through 2021  But just kind of thinking 2022 and beyond  assuming no major third party acquisitions  how should we think about what the governors are to distribution growth kind of beyond 2021 I m thinking about it in terms of obviously understanding that you guys probably want to maintain 1 2 times distribution coverage    at least 1 2 times  But also in terms of leverage  I guess  as I look at it  it seems like net debt to EBITDA is going to be improving kind of throughout 2021  kind of maybe getting close to that 2 5 times range  Is that 2 5 times range kind of a comfortable spot for you all longer term  as we think about potential governors to distribution growth  I know you ve set the three times target but just kind of curious how you guys are thinking about things longer term Jonathan C  Stein    Chief Financial OfficerSure  So as we look at how we ve always set our distribution growth  it s been a level that we can deliver consistently and with the transaction on new platform  that isn t changing  So  our 2022 DPS growth will be at a level that s consistent with both our organic growth and also our financial targets and metrics  including the ones you mentioned So starting on the organic growth side  if you look at our MVCs  they provide some transparency to our organic growth there with the gas volumes  which represent 70  of our revenues growing approximately 15  from 2021 to 2022  But we ll also be consistent  as you said  with our financial metrics  including  yes  the 1 2 times coverage and our targeted three times leverage target  even though we will be naturally delevering absent additional opportunities  certainly that provides us the flexibility to do additional investments as we ve talked about So with our assets being extremely cash flow generative and the ability to    we expect to really be able  as I mentioned  to fund our capex and distributions with DCF by 2021  we ll have significant financial flexibility  But we re also going to remain disciplined to set our distribution growth relative to organic growth and also to our financial targets  And that s the approach we ve taken historically and that s what you should expect certainly going forward  As we get closer to 2022  obviously  we ll provide more details  But in terms of our framework of thinking about how we are thinking about it  it will be using that financial flexibility but also remain disciplined to our organic growth and our financial metrics Philip Stuart    Scotiabank    AnalystOkay  Great  And then  I guess  one last quick one from me  Obviously  with the turnaround in 3Q of this year  when we think about 4Q kind of gas gathering and processing volumes  will those kind of be able to ramp back up to similar levels to maybe 2Q 20  Or will there be kind of a slower ramp process  I guess in 4Q  coming off of the turnaround in 3Q John A  Gatling    President and Chief Operating OfficerNo  I would say there will definitely be a ramp up  I think it s just a natural process of bringing the system back up and kind of working through all of that  but the available gas is already there  So  we would expect to see the volume to come into the system fairly quickly  But again  we want to be a bit cautious here and make sure that we do it the right way It s a big project for us to actually do the turnaround and then also to tie in some critical aspects of the overall expansion  So  I would say that we will definitely see a ramp post debottlenecking and turnaround  but that ramp will really be kind of primarily done in the third quarter  but there could be a little bit of impact in fourth  So  I think we ll just    we ll cautiously look at it and as we get closer to the actual turnaround time  we ll provide a little bit more transparency into that Philip Stuart    Scotiabank    AnalystAll right  Great  Thanks  guys  That s it from me John A  Gatling    President and Chief Operating OfficerThank you OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet from J P  Morgan  Please go ahead Rahul Krotthapalli    J P  Morgan    AnalystGood afternoon  guys  This is Rahul on for Jeremy  I just have one quick question here  Is there a way to break out the 25  y o y EBITDA growth between the volumes and the fee uplift  and like some more granularity on the rate recalculation and what the drivers you have for the growth would be appreciated  Thank you Jonathan C  Stein    Chief Financial OfficerAnd just to be clear  you re asking for full year  going from  19 to  20  right Rahul Krotthapalli    J P  Morgan    AnalystYeah Jonathan C  Stein    Chief Financial OfficerYeah  So that increase is about 32  year on year to the midpoint  Primarily two thirds of that is actually volume growth  that s coming from organic gas line growth in gas processing as we have now LM4 online  It continue to backfill TGP  We also have organic oil growth as Hess continues to ramp up production toward the 200 000 BOE per day We also have higher MVCs  which have increased as the development plan has shifted and particularly with the turnaround  providing some MVC revenue there as well  The rest of the increase is really increased tariff rates  as you mentioned  offset by higher annual costs  The increased tariff rates are really driven by revenue recovery for more volumes and return on the incremental capital that we spent in 2019 from the delay in LM4 and therefore the rate went up as part of that rate redetermination process at the end of the year  There is also the annual inflation escalators  which has an impact on increased rates and then that s offset by higher opex  which particularly    primarily is driven by just the turnaround costs that we expect during the year Rahul Krotthapalli    J P  Morgan    AnalystUnderstood  That s helpful color  Thanks  guys OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Spiro Dounis from Credit Suisse  Please go ahead Douglas Irwin    Credit Suisse    AnalystHey  this is Doug Irwin on for Spiro  Thanks for the question  Just real quick on the 2022 MVCs  I guess  kind of on its face  the crude numbers imply a decline and I appreciate it s based on a different percent of the nomination versus 2021  But can you maybe just help us think about it on an apples to apples basis and kind of what that means for crude growth longer term Jonathan C  Stein    Chief Financial OfficerSo  Yeah  so let s talk about how the MVCs    again  as I mentioned in the script  MVCs provide a line of sight to continued growth  So  I ll give you the mechanics and then John can talk about kind of broad volume growth and some of the drivers  So in general  the 2021 MVCs  as we mentioned in our press release are approximately 25  or higher  It s also the contract mechanics that MVCs is higher but they can go lower So particularly with the oil gathering MVCs  that s the sum of multiple subsystems  So with the 2021 MVC above 85  compared to the 2022 MVC  we d see that oil gathering volumes will be approximately flat year on year  On the other side on gas processing and gathering MVCs  the 2022 MVCs would imply continued growth as we complete the TGP expansion  Again  as I mentioned  the gas volume growth  which is 70  of our revenues  from 2021 to 2022 is about 15  So  all of our businesses  really will be looking    as we look forward  the MVCs really imply that growth that we talked about all supported of course by the free cash flow positive and free cash flow generation that we ve talked about and the ability to completely fund our capex and distribution  So relative to those metrics and really    and the MVCs provide visibility to this  really in a very differentiated position in terms of our long term outlook and the unique platform that we have John A  Gatling    President and Chief Operating OfficerYeah  And I would just build on Jonathan s point there  I think just one thing to look at gas versus oil  Gas  you have to get it in pipe  I mean there s flaring constraints in the basin  And so you ve got to get it in pipe and so that s been a priority for producers in the basin and also other midstream companies providing services to producers So that s had us  allowed us to capture more third party volumes and will actually be the things that will help us fill TGP going long term  On the oil side and on the gas  just a reminder that approximately 30  of our gas system is third parties  On the oil side     sorry  third parties represent about 15  of our total crude oil system  So  there is definitely some run room there on the third party side to capture additional oil opportunities There is still a focus on getting more barrels off trucks and into the gathering system  and then  obviously  with our flexible export options  we ve got the terminal north of the river  we got the rail terminal and then we got the terminal south of river  We essentially can access all markets from a crude perspective  And so we see that as a differentiator for us in the basin  That will definitely attract more crude volumes  third party crude volumes into our gathering and terminaling system  So while right now  we re saying that the number is kind of at that 15   we see some potential growth opportunities there for us Douglas Irwin    Credit Suisse    AnalystGot it  Great  That s all from me  Thanks John A  Gatling    President and Chief Operating OfficerThank you Operator Operator Closing Remarks  Duration  34 minutesCall participants Jennifer Gordon    Vice

200108,421624,HES,Why Hess Stock Tumbled 15  in January,news,"What happened
Shares of Hess  NYSE HES  slumped 15 3  in January  according to data provided by S P Global Market Intelligence  Weighing on the oil stock was a sell off in the price of oil and the release of its fourth quarter results  
So what
Crude prices tumbled in January  fueled by fears that the coronavirus would sap demand for oil in China  WTI  the U S  oil benchmark  fell 15 6  for the month  closing below  52 a barrel  its lowest level since August  Meanwhile  the global oil benchmark  Brent  fell about 12  for the month  ending around  58 per barrel  That sell off weighed on most oil stocks  including Hess  since it will produce less cash this year if crude remains at these lower levels  The slump is coming at an unfortunate time for Hess since it recently started up production at the first phase of its offshore development near Guyana  

Also weighing on Hess  stock last month were its fourth quarter results  While the energy company s production soared well past its expectations  its net loss came in much worse than analysts had anticipated  The culprit was weaker pricing for natural gas and natural gas liquids  NGLs   which tumbled 27 8  and 34 5   respectively  during the quarter  
Now what
Several analysts believe that last month s sell off in Hess is a buying opportunity  Scotiabank  for example  upgraded the stock at the end of the month to sector outperform while setting a  79 price target  38  above the current price   Meanwhile  Morgan Stanley said that the stock s sell off  is overdone   which led the bank to reiterate its overweight rating while boosting its price target from  79 to  82  43  above the current price   Given that bullishness  investors might want to consider buying last month s dip in Hess since it s now trading at a more compelling price given its long term growth potential in Guyana ",2020-02-04,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pqypj,2075604

200147,421663,HES,Exclusive  U S  energy group Hess Corp s SE Asia assets attract bid interest   sources,news,"By Anshuman Daga
SINGAPORE  Reuters    The Southeast Asian offshore natural gas assets of U S  oil and gas producer  Hess Corp   N HES   estimated to be worth as much as  5 billion  have attracted takeover interest from firms including Thailand s PTTEP PCL  BK PTTEP  and Austrian energy group OMV AG  VI OMVV   people familiar with the matter said 
Hess  which has a collection of gas fields in North Malay Basin in offshore Malaysia and in the Malaysia Thailand Joint Development Area  JDA  with 50 percent equal partner Petronas  has not yet decided whether to sell the assets  according to financial and industry sources 
Their estimated market value would be about  4 billion to  5 billion  the sources said  They declined to be identified because the takeover interest had not previously been made public 
The interest in Hess  assets  among the few long term and sizeable projects in the region  comes as cashed up firms such as PTTEP are buying overseas assets  while the likes of OMV and Kuwait Foreign Petroleum Exploration Company have been scouring for acquisitions in Asia  
Hess  which hasn t reported a profit since 2014  has been under pressure from investors to make money  It posted a smaller than expected loss in April June  but many of its peers have turned profitable after the oil price crash two years ago  fuelling questions as to why Hess has not followed suit 
The firm is developing large offshore oil projects in South America and U S  shale oil  In 2014  it sold its Thai assets to PTTEP for  1 billion and also sold its Indonesian assets 
 We don t comment on rumours but we continue to believe that our Malaysia assets are an important part of our portfolio and our value creation strategy   Hess spokeswoman Lorrie Hecker said in a statement 
 JDA and North Malay Basin are significant long term  low cost cash generators  producing stable production and free cash flows  which provide funding for our compelling  long term opportunities in Guyana and the Bakken  in the United States   
 TEAMS WORKING ON THIS 
 A number of parties have looked  at the Hess assets  and have teams working on this   said one financial source   Increasing numbers of companies believe a sale is probable   said the person  adding that Hess  project would also appeal to private equity backed players and mid sized energy firms 
He said PTTEP was working with a financial advisor for its interest in the assets 
Another source said some parties had done preliminary work on the assets and were waiting to see if Hess would start a sale process 
OMV and Kuwait Foreign Petroleum Exploration Company declined to comment 
This month  OMV won regulatory approval to buy Royal Dutch Shell s  L RDSa  upstream assets in New Zealand for  578 million  OMV said in March that the acquisition was a key step to develop Australasia into a core region in line with its new strategy 
Petronas declined comment while PTTEP said it was focused on expanding in Southeast Asia 
 PTTEP is interested in M A deals with particular focus on assets located in PTTEP s region of experience such as South East Asia  which is PTTEP s areas of expertise and the operating risk is moderately low   the Thai company told Reuters  declining to comment specifically on Hess assets 
IMPROVING INDUSTRY OUTLOOK
The industry s prospects have brightened as oil  LCOc1  and natural gas prices have more than doubled since early 2016  with demand for oil in Asia   the world s biggest consumer   also growing strongly even as production is falling faster than anywhere else 
Hess  nine gas fields in the North Malay Basin have an estimated gross recoverable resource of more than 1 5 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and over 20 million barrels of condensate  Production started in July 2017 
The company has a 50 percent working interest in the Southeast Asian blocks with Petronas Carigali  a fully owned subsidiary of Petronas 
Hess signed a production sharing contract with Petronas in 2012 and has a contract with the oil major till 2029

200148,421664,HES,Hess  HES  Reports Q4 Loss  Tops Revenue Estimates,opinion,"Hess  HES  came out with a quarterly loss of  0 60 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of  0 56  This compares to loss of  0 31 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of  7 14   A quarter ago  it was expected that this oil and gas producer would post a loss of  0 32 per share when it actually produced a loss of  0 32  delivering no surprise 
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times 
Hess  which belongs to the Zacks Oil and Gas   Integrated   United States industry  posted revenues of  1 70 billion for the quarter ended December 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8 08   This compares to year ago revenues of  1 68 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Hess shares have lost about 7  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 1 4  
What s Next for Hess 
While Hess has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Hess was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  0 20 on  1 79 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  0 34 on  7 29 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year

Investment emotional triggers  fear and greed  can lead to costly mental mistakes by investors who typically fall into the trap of being a market follower instead of a market leader 
Productive market timing requires three key parts  1  A dependable sign for when to get in and out of stocks  2  The ability to follow up on the sign rapidly and precisely  3  The ability to be completely unemotional and trust in the signal no matter the current market environment 
Many investors think of market timing success as a win or lose proposition  But there is a less notable  rather straightforward  successful market timing approach that has been utilized effectively time after time by astute investors like Warren Buffet 
Rule 1  Never try and time tops and bottoms 
Abandoning the goal to time the tops and bottoms precisely gives you the flexibility to profit  thereby increasing your chances to lock in built up profits even if your calls aren t exactly right 
Rule 2  Make an effort not to sell in the midst of little crashes  Muster the courage to trust your gut and buy best in class stocks at a discount 
Warren Buffett has made an incredible piece of his fortune because of this basic standard  He cautions not to sell during little crashes  and encourages enduring them by concentrating on the long haul 
There is a major distinction between a financial crash and a mild market reset  No matter what happens in the stock market  chances are that the stocks you own will eventually come back to their pre   crash value  hanging on to your original positions  or opportunistically averaging down  during market downs can be the shrew distraction to take  Warren Buffett takes this thought one step further by often buying outsized positions in value stocks he likes across the board when markets turn  essentially leveraging his bottoms up analysis and stock picking acumen 
When It Comes to Trading Your Retirement  A Risk Adjusted Trading Strategy Should be Followed
It s just human that many surrender to emotions and attempt and game the framework by timing the market  But consider this  Nobel Laureate William Sharpe found in 1975 that a market timer would have to be accurate 74  of the time to beat a passive portfolio  Even a slight outperformance probably wouldn t be worth the energy   and given that even the experts generally fail at it  market timing shouldn t be your exclusive investing strategy of choice  especially using assets earmarked for your retirement 
Chasing alpha  outsized  short   term returns through market timing and other high   risk bets is acceptable only within a small part of your investable resources  however for your long   term retirement assets a  risk adjusted  investment discipline is what largely bodes well

Chasing alpha  outsized  short   term returns through market timing and other high   risk bets is acceptable only within a small part of your investable resources  however for your long   term retirement assets a  risk adjusted  investment discipline is what largely bodes well

Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Hess 
For Hess  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  4 59  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Hess will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Hess would post a loss of  0 32 per share when it actually produced a loss of  0 32  delivering no surprise 
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

200166,421682,HES,Here s Why You Should Retain Hess Corp  HES  Stock For Now,opinion,Hess Corporation   NYSE HES   is well poised to grow on the back of robust offshore Guyana oil reserves and solid midstream business Hess Corp   with a market cap of  20 billion   is a global integrated energy company  The New York based company engages in exploration  production  development  transportation  and purchase and sale of crude oil  natural gas liquids  and natural gas  Moreover  it is involved in gathering  compressing  and processing natural gas as well as fractionating natural gas liquids  NGLs   Additionally  Hess offers gathering  terminaling  loading and transporting operations for both crude oil and NGLs Courtesy of solid prospects  this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock is worth holding on to at the moment What s Driving the Stock The company made world class oil discoveries at the Stabroek Block  located off the coast of Guyana  It estimates gross resources of more than 6 billion barrels of oil equivalent from its 15 promising discoveries in the Stabroek Block  The discoveries made so far on the block have the potential to add five FPSO vessels that will be capable of yielding around 750 000 barrels of oil per day by 2025  Hess is expected to record significant production from the Guyana prospect in the coming years  Notably  production from the Liza Phase 1 development started in December 2019  ahead of schedule Hess is among the leading producers of crude in the Bakken oil shale play in North Dakota  With interests in the best areas of the play  the energy firm expects its daily production from Bakken to increase to 200 thousand barrels of oil equivalent by 2021  Notably  through 2019  Hess expects net production volumes   excluding Libya   to be around 285 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day  Boe D   higher than the previous guided range of 275 000 280 000 Boe D and indicating a significant increase from 117 000 BoE D in 2018 Even though the majority of the company s total production is oil  53 2  in third quarter 2019   Hess is not affected by an unfavorable oil price environment  as breakeven prices in its operating plays are considerably lower than the current commodity price level  Hess has implemented a cost reduction program  through which the company will likely boost profitability and cash margins  From 2017 through 2023  it estimates cash unit production costs to decline 30   This will provide a northbound thrust to the company s bottom line Its midstream assets are also a huge positive  While North America is currently suffering from a dearth of takeaway capacity and waiting for several midstream projects to come online  Hess  midstream assets enable it to earn stable fee based revenues  The company generated adjusted net earnings of  39 million from this business in third quarter 2019  up from  30 million a year ago DownsidesHowever  there are a few factors that are impeding the growth of the stock lately As of Sep 30  2019  its long term debt was  6 5 billion and cashtotaled  1 9 billion  The company s debt to capitalization ratio of 40  is higher than that of the industry s 35   Hence  its balance sheet is more levered than the industry it belongs to Hess expects 2019 capital expenditure to be  2 7 billion  suggesting an increase from  2 1 billion in 2018  The company s projection for increased oil and natural gas production volumes is supported by higher capital spending  However  this reflects its inefficiency  as major energy players are spending low capital for higher volumes  Moreover  the company incurred a loss of 32 cents per share in third quarter 2019 due to increased operating expenses and lower commodity price realization Over the past two years  the firm has been consistently paying a lower dividend yield than the industry it belongs to  Currently  its dividend yield of 1 5  is below the industry s 4 4  To Sum UpDespite significant prospects as mentioned above  lack of capital efficiency and reliance on debt are concerns for the company  Nevertheless  we believe that systematic and strategic plan of action will drive its long term growth Hess Corporation Price and Consensus   Key

200174,421690,HES,How To Time The Markets Like An Investing Pro   October 29  2019,opinion,"Being that unique investor who has the power to consistently time the market and always make a profit is the dream for most people who trade their own accounts 
In fact  even among long term investors who don t attempt to time the markets  being able to call the top of the market is a skill that many think they possess  This misguided confidence is often driving investors to sit on the sidelines and wait it out for better market opportunities

Anxiety and eagerness regularly lead investors into psychological traps because most investors take cues from past market moves and trends instead of attempting to anticipate potential market moves 
Productive market timing requires three key parts  1  A dependable sign for when to get in and out of stocks  2  The ability to follow up on the sign rapidly and precisely  3  The ability to be completely unemotional and trust in the signal no matter the current market environment 
Market timing is commonly perceived as the ability to guess the exact market top or bottom and make moves accordingly  However  there is a less common  rather straightforward market timing strategy that has been utilized effectively by insightful financial specialists like Warren Buffet for a considerable length of time 
Rule 1  Never try and time tops and bottoms 
Abandoning the goal to time the tops and bottoms precisely gives you the flexibility to profit  thereby increasing your chances to lock in built up profits even if your calls aren t exactly right 
Rule 2  Don t sell during small crashes   ride the storm out  or better yet  take advantage of the opportunity 
Warren Buffett has made his fortune based off this simple rule  He cautions not to sell during little crashes  and encourages enduring them by concentrating on the long haul 
There is a key distinction between a small correction and a market crash  If the companies you own are established and successful  they are likely to return to their pre   crash price before long  making holding on the wisest decision  Warren Buffett takes this thought a notch higher and frequently goes on a buying binge when markets turn  purchasing additional shares of his favorite stocks at a major markdown and tuning in to his own recommendation of being greedy when others are scared  and being scared when others are greedy

200176,421692,HES,Hess  HES  Reports Q3 Loss  Misses Revenue Estimates,opinion,"Hess  HES  came out with a quarterly loss of  0 32 per share in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  This compares to earnings of  0 38 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
A quarter ago  it was expected that this oil and gas producer would post a loss of  0 10 per share when it actually produced a loss of  0 09  delivering a surprise of 10  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times 
Hess  which belongs to the Zacks Oil and Gas   Integrated   United States industry  posted revenues of  1 52 billion for the quarter ended September 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1 79   This compares to year ago revenues of  1 83 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Hess shares have added about 67 4  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 21 1  
What s Next for Hess 
While Hess has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Hess was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is   0 27 on  1 57 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and   0 51 on  6 40 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year

Fear and greed often lead investors into behavioral traps since most investors are followers who react  rather than anticipate market moves 
Fruitful market timing requires three key parts  1  A solid sign to guide you when to get in and out of stocks  or securities  gold or different kinds of investments   2  The capacity to act on the sign accurately  3  The control to follow up on it 
The popular image of market timing is that it calls for making drastic  all or nothing moves at the precise  exact market top or bottom  There is a less well known  rather simple market timing approach that has been used successfully by savvy investors like Warren Buffet for decades 
Rule 1  Why trying to time the tops and bottoms of the market is a dead end 
Surrendering the objective to time the tops and bottoms gives you the adaptability to benefit and increase your odds to secure profits over the long term  even if your calls aren t always right 
Rule 2  Try not to sell amid little crashes   instead exploit the opportunity by buying 
Warren Buffett has made a great part of his fortune due to this simple rule  He benefits by focusing on the long   term and buying high quality stocks at a discount during large market corrections to profit down the road 
There is a noteworthy distinction between a complete market meltdown and a common 10  market correction  No matter what happens in the stock market  chances are that the stocks you own will eventually come back to their pre   crash value  hanging on to your original positions  or opportunistically averaging down  during market downs can be the shrew distraction to take  Warren Buffett takes this idea further by frequently going on purchasing binges when the markets turn  basically purchasing extra shares of his top stock picks at a major markdown and doubling   down on his very own recommendations 
When It Comes to Trading Your Retirement  A Risk Adjusted Trading Strategy Should be Followed
It s just human that many surrender to emotions and attempt and game the framework by timing the market  But consider this  Nobel Laureate William Sharpe found in 1975 that a market timer would have to be accurate 74  of the time to beat a passive portfolio  Indeed  even a slight outperformance most likely wouldn t justify the efforts   and given that even the specialists for the most part come up short at it  market timing shouldn t be your exclusive methodology for investing  particularly when it comes to building your retirement nest egg 
Chasing alpha  outsized  short   term returns through market timing and other high   risk bets is acceptable only within a small part of your investable resources  however for your long   term retirement assets a  risk adjusted  investment discipline is what largely bodes well

200190,421706,HES,When Does Market Timing Actually Work    September 12  2019,opinion,"Have you ever dreamed of being that one in a million investor who has the talent to perfectly time the markets 
Even among those who don t aspire to be the perfect market timer  many think they can call a top and act accordingly  It s at these times when investors choose to sit on the sidelines and wait for a  perceived  better opportunity to invest in the market 
Individual investors who focus their efforts on timing the market typically miss chances  For example  many investors have overlooked chances to benefit from buying the Oils Energy stocks at the first opportunity  by attempting to buy them during a pullback only to see these stocks accomplish new unsurpassed highs  Panhandle Royalty Company  PHX   Nabors Industries Ltd   NYSE NBR   Hess Corporation  NYSE HES   Ameresco  Inc   AMRC   Antero Midstrm  AM 
Anxiety and eagerness regularly lead investors into psychological traps because most investors take cues from past market moves and trends instead of attempting to anticipate potential market moves 
Accomplished market timing requires three key components  1  A dependable sign of when to get in and out of stocks  2  The capacity to act upon signals quickly and accurately  3  Have the stomach to act on market signals  no matter how counterintuitive the move may be 
Many investors believe that market timing is a short term investment strategy  There is a less known  more effective  longer term market timing approach that has been used successfully by astute investors like Warren Buffet 
Rule 1  Never try and time tops and bottoms 
Forget tracking for market tops or bottoms to expand your odds for success with a longer timeline and give yourself the flexibility to eventually profit  regardless of whether your calls are spot on or way off base 
Rule 2  Try not to sell amid little crashes   instead exploit the opportunity by buying 
Warren Buffett has made his fortune based of this straightforward guideline  He warns not to sell during small crashes  and weather the storm by focusing on the long term 
There is a major distinction between a financial crash and a mild market reset  If you own shares of a company that is well   established and has strong fundamentals  they are probably going to rebound to their pre   crash prices eventually  thereby rendering holding on a wise decision  Warren Buffett takes this thought a notch higher and frequently goes on a buying binge when markets turn  purchasing additional shares of his favorite stocks at a major markdown and tuning in to his own recommendation of being greedy when others are scared  and being scared when others are greedy 
A Risk Adjusted Trading Strategy Should be Followed for Your Retirement Assets
It s just human that many surrender to emotions and attempt and game the framework by timing the market  But consider this  Nobel Laureate William Sharpe found in 1975 that a market timer would have to be accurate 74  of the time to beat a passive portfolio  Even a slight outperformance probably wouldn t be worth the energy   and given that even the experts generally fail at it  market timing shouldn t be your exclusive investing strategy of choice  especially using assets earmarked for your retirement 
Actively trading for alpha  outsized  short   term gains through market timing and other high   risk trading strategies is fine with a small portion of your investable assets  but for your longer   term retirement assets  a risk  adjusted focused investment solution generally makes more sense

200198,421714,HES,Profit From Surprise In Q2 2019 Earnings Season,opinion,"Second quarter 2019 earnings season unofficially starts early next week when the big banks  such as Citigroup  C  and JPMorgan Chase   Co  NYSE JPM    JPM   report their report June quarter financial results  With that said  by the time that happens almost two dozen other S P 500 members will have already reported their most recent quarterly results 
This means now is a great time to try to find stocks that look poised to benefit from an earnings season boost  And today we picked a screen that works well both before and after a company reports their quarterly financial results 
Every earnings season features positive and negative surprises on both the top and the bottom lines  Therefore  our screen focuses on earnings and revenue surprises because investors should pay close attention to both metrics 
Before we dive into the screen  let s quickly go over the basic principles  In general  if a company reports quarterly earnings above expectations it is considered a positive surprise  and the firm s stock price often climbs  On the other hand  prices generally go down when a company reports a negative surprise  Clearly  there are many other circumstances that impact where a stock heads  such as guidance 
With that said  a surprise represents far more than just an extra few dollars or cents a company made or lost during the period  It is instead a look into what a company s earnings might be or should be  down the road  
Investors should also note that when these surprises occur  the market quickly tries to re price the stock to reflect the new information 
Not All Surprises Are Created Equal
It might seem intuitive  but it is still worth diving into the differences between surprises  For starters  some earnings surprises can be attributed to cost cutting measures and others are due to revenue jumps 
Sales growth often produces a larger price reaction compared to its money saving counterpart because revenue growth is viewed as more sustainable  The reasoning is straightforward  once a company has cut costs  where is its future growth going to come from  Firms can only cut so many costs  Meanwhile  sales growth is one of the most vital components of long term growth 
Along with earnings and revenue results  investors also need to pay attention to guidance  If a company reports a positive surprise and downward guidance it will often cause negative stock price movement since the firm diminished the hope of the future growth that comes with a positive surprise 
We also need to pay close attention to financial results that are not truly  surprises   For instance  companies that always beat their estimates  or stocks that have already had a  surprise  priced in by climbing or falling before an announcement  These situations might not be treated as surprises at all  In fact  in some cases  we can see the opposite reaction to an earnings surprise  known as  buy the rumor  sell the fact  type events 
With all that said  predicting which companies will surprise one way or the other is difficult  The benefits  however  of an earnings surprise will typically last for one to three months after a surprise is reported 
This means you can get in after a company reports a surprise  or you can try and find companies that are more likely to report a surprise  and get in ahead of time 
Screening Parameters
 
 
  Last EPS Surprise greater than or equal to 5 
 Stocks posting positive surprises have a tendency of surprising again  
  Last Sales Surprise greater than or equal to 5 
 A positive sales surprise shows top line strength  And once again  a company that has surprised in the past is more likely to surprise again in the future  
  Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2
 Only Zacks Rank  1 and  2 Strong Buys and Buys  
  Price greater than or equal to  10 and an Average 20 Day Volume greater than or equal to 100 000

200199,421715,HES,Will Hess  HES  Report Negative Earnings Next Week  What You Should Know,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Hess  HES  reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 31  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This oil and gas producer is expected to post quarterly loss of  0 04 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  82 6  
Revenues are expected to be  1 60 billion  up 2 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1050  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Hess 
For Hess  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  257 65  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Hess will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Hess would post a loss of  0 26 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 09  delivering a surprise of  134 62  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Hess doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-hess-hes-report-negative-earnings-next-week-what-you-should-know-200444048,200444048
200200,421716,HES,Simple Market Timing Strategies That Work   July 31  2019,opinion,"There is no better feeling for an investor than trusting your gut or doing your research and timing the markets correctly  right 
Indeed  even among the individuals who don t seek to be the ideal market timer  many feel they can call a top and act in accordance  It is these tendencies that make investors sit on the sidelines and hang tight for a better chance to put money into the market 
Lost chances by those who attempt to time the market is a common mistake among those who trade their own accounts  How many traders have lost investing opportunities by choosing to wait for the Oils Energy stocks to correct or reach attractive entry levels  Only for them to continue to move higher and achieve new all time highs  Panhandle Royalty Company  PHX   Nabors Industries Ltd   NYSE NBR   Antero Midstrm  AM   Ameresco  Inc   AMRC   Hess Corporation  NYSE HES 
Investment emotional triggers  fear and greed  can lead to costly mental mistakes by investors who typically fall into the trap of being a market follower instead of a market leader 
Accomplished market timing requires three key components  1  A dependable sign of when to get in and out of stocks  2  The capacity to act upon signals quickly and accurately  3  Have the stomach to act on market signals  no matter how counterintuitive the move may be 
Many investors think of market timing success as a win or lose proposition  But there is a less notable  rather straightforward  successful market timing approach that has been utilized effectively time after time by astute investors like Warren Buffet 
Rule 1  Attempting to time tops and bottoms is lose lose situation 
Abandoning the objective to time the tops and bottoms conclusively gives you the flexibility to profit  and extends your chance to benefit from the equity markets over the long term whether your specific market timing calls are right or wrong 
Rule 2  Don t sell during small crashes   ride the storm out  or better yet  take advantage of the opportunity 
Warren Buffett has made a great part of his fortune due to this simple rule  He warns not to sell during small crashes  and weather the storm by focusing on the long term 
There is a big difference between a stock market crash and small correction  If the companies you own are established and successful  they are likely to return to their pre   crash price before long  making holding on the wisest decision  Warren Buffett takes this thought a notch higher and frequently goes on a buying binge when markets turn  purchasing additional shares of his favorite stocks at a major markdown and tuning in to his own recommendation of being greedy when others are scared  and being scared when others are greedy 
A Risk Adjusted Trading Strategy Should be Followed for Your Retirement Assets
It s just human that many surrender to emotions and attempt and game the framework by timing the market  But consider this  Nobel Laureate William Sharpe found in 1975 that a market timer would have to be accurate 74  of the time to beat a passive portfolio  Even a slight outperformance probably wouldn t be worth the energy   and given that even the experts generally fail at it  market timing shouldn t be your exclusive investing strategy of choice  especially using assets earmarked for your retirement 
Actively trading for alpha  outsized  short   term gains through market timing and other high   risk trading strategies is fine with a small portion of your investable assets  but for your longer   term retirement assets  a risk  adjusted focused investment solution generally makes more sense

Hess shares have added about 53 1  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 20 2  
What s Next for Hess 
While Hess has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Hess was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

200208,421724,HES,Can North Dakota s Production Boom Survive Low Oil Prices ,opinion,As per North Dakota s oil regulator  the state s daily crude output remained essentially flat in April after increasing 4 2  in the previous month  The North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources    DMR   latest data said that oil production in April averaged 1 391 188 barrels a day  down by a marginal 572 barrels a day from March Drilling Activity Holds SteadyDespite this slight drop  the newest numbers showed that daily crude output remained above one million barrels for the 27th month  further confirming the status of North Dakota  centered on the Bakken formation  as one of the hottest shale plays in the United States  For the record  oil volumes reached an all time high of 1 403 808 barrels a day in January As a proof of the region s stable drilling activity  rig count has been hovering in the low  to mid 60s over the past few months  Some 63 rigs were exploring in the state in April  compared with the March count of 66  The all time low of 27 was set in May 2016  while a year ago  i e  in April 2018   North Dakota had 60 rigs operating Natural Gas Output  Producing Wells Hit Record HighMeanwhile  natural gas output hit its highest level ever  The state churned out 2 862 893 thousand cubic feet per day in April  up from March s 2 837 170 thousand cubic feet per day  North Dakota s total number of producing wells tallied 15 490 at the end of April  the highest on record Concerns Over Drop in Oil PricesAfter a strong rally in the earlier part of the year that saw prices jump more than 50  to a nearly six month high  oil has encountered a speed breaker  The commodity recently hit the lowest settlement level since January  The Jun 5 closing of  51 68 put WTI down 22  from its Apr 23 high of  66 30  officially meeting the definition of a bear market  While  black gold  has come out of the bear market  prices continued to be threatened by economic concerns and inventory overhang As crude prices plunged in recent weeks  outlook for the drillers in North Dakota have darkened  Per Lynn Helms  Director of Mineral Resources  crude is trading at just over  40 a barrel in North Dakota  close to the break even level of new wells  There are concerns that a further deterioration in prices or lower prices for an extended period might render well economics unsupportive for most producers in the state Another Challenge  Pipeline Constraints One of the major factors for the revival of Bakken activity is the construction of 1 170 mile long Dakota Access Pipeline  Energy Transfer L P  s   NYSE ET   mega project came online in June 2017 with a capacity to carry about 520 000 barrels of oil per day  or nearly 40  of North Dakota s output   The pipeline  with investments from energy majors like Phillips 66   NYSE PSX    Enbridge Inc    NYSE ENB   and Marathon Petroleum   NYSE MPC    has helped to improve the region s drilling economics by lowering transportation costs for operators  In fact  large operators like Oasis Petroleum Inc    NYSE OAS   utilize the Dakota Access Pipeline to send a major portion of their products to market But with the pipeline s spare capacity vanishing rapidly amid high demand  there is a need for infrastructure that can allow for the movement of more oil  A recent expansion of the Dakota Access Pipeline and the proposed Liberty Pipeline  which will provide opportunity to shippers to secure transportation service from the Bakken production areas to Corpus Christi  TX  are touted as solutions  While the Dakota Access expansion has augmented the pipeline s capacity by 50 000 barrels per day  the  1 6 billion Liberty pipeline will have an initial throughput capacity of 350 000 barrels per day and is expected to start operations in another two years What Lies Ahead While the crude price collapse could stall North Dakota oil growth engine for the time being  production is nevertheless expected to remain robust  Among the number of companies who have built sizeable acreage positions in the second largest oil producing state after Texas  we believe Hess Corporation   NYSE HES   might fetch you

200209,421725,HES,Hess  HES  Upgraded To Buy  Here s Why,opinion,"Investors might want to bet on Hess  HES   as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   An upward trend in earnings estimates    one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices    has triggered this rating change 
The Zacks rating relies solely on a company s changing earnings picture  It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure    the Zacks Consensus Estimate 
Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time  In these situations  the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements 
As such  the Zacks rating upgrade for Hess is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  has proven to be strongly correlated with the near term price movement of its stock  The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship  as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock 
Fundamentally speaking  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Hess imply an improvement in the company s underlying business  Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Hess
For the fiscal year ending December  2019  this oil and gas producer is expected to earn  0 02 per share  which is a change of 102 7  from the year ago reported number 
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Hess  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 102 9  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

200223,421739,HES,Here s Why Continental  CLR  Is A Hot Investment Pick Now,opinion,"Continental Resources  Inc    NYSE CLR   looks compelling at the moment  Given the company s strong fundamentals  it seems like this is the right time to add the stock to your portfolio 
Oklahoma City  OK based Continental is an independent oil and natural gas exploration  and production company  Notably  the company currently has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   which means that it is poised to outperform the market  Let s delve deeper to analyze the factors that make this upstream energy player an attractive investment option at the moment 
Premier Position
Continental holds a premier position in the Bakken area  The shale play  which is ranked among the country s largest onshore oilfields  produces premium quality of crude  Bakken comprises almost 52  of the upstream energy player s proved reserves  Notably  in this shale play  the company is planning to allocate roughly 50  of its capital budget for drilling and completion activities in 2019  This will lead to higher output and cash flow 
Production to Surge
Markedly  the company plans to operate 166 gross wells in Bakken through 2019  higher than 159 in 2018  indicating production growth potential  For 2019  oil production is expected in the range of 190 000 200 000 barrels per day  BPD   much higher than the 2018 level of 168 177 BPD  Moreover  natural gas is expected in the band of 790 000 810 000 thousand cubic feet per day  Mcf d   above the 2018 level of 780 083 Mcf d 
The company s high quality Bakken and Oklahoma assets  coupled with low cost operations lead to sustainable free cash flow generation 
Free Cash Flow
In the trailing four quarters  it generated total free cash flow of  3 262 million  On an average  Continental s free cash flow is expected to surge  700  800 million per annum over the next five years  suggesting tremendous strength in operations  This will enable the company to stay on its track of debt reduction 
All the factors stated above make the stock a rewarding one  But one should consider estimate revisions and earnings history  along with strength in operations to understand its true potential 
Earnings History   Future Prospects
In the last reported quarter  the company s earnings of 58 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 47 cents  aided by higher production from the North Dakota Bakken  as well as SCOOP and STACK regions  Continental beat estimates thrice in the trailing four quarters  delivering average positive earnings surprise of 7 6  Continental Resources  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise
   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second quarter earnings of 65 cents has witnessed 12 upward revisions by firms in the past 30 days  Clearly  this energy stock has substantial upside potential 
Other Stocks to Consider

200224,421740,HES,North Dakota Oil Output Expected To Hit Record This Summer,opinion,Per North Dakota s oil regulator  the state s daily crude output rose 4 1  in March after decreasing 4 9  in the previous month on harsh winter weather  The North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources    DMR   latest data stated that oil production in March averaged 1 390 138 barrels a day  up 54 547 barrels a day from February Meanwhile  natural gas output hit its highest level ever  The state churned out 2 801 434 thousand cubic feet per day in March  up from February s 2 631 118 thousand cubic feet per day  North Dakota s total number of producing wells tallied 15 353 at the end of March for a monthly gain of 199 Drilling Activity Remains RobustWhile the oil output is still below January s all time high of 1 403 808 barrels a day  the newest numbers showed that daily crude output remained above one million barrels for the 26th month  further confirming the status of North Dakota  centered on the Bakken formation  as one of the hottest shale plays in the United States As a proof of the region s healthy drilling activity  some 66 rigs were explored in the state in March  compared with the February count of 64  The all time low of 27 was set in May 2016  while a year ago  i e  in March 2018   North Dakota had 59 rigs operating Dakota Access Pipeline Capacity Expansion Bode WellApart from the robustness in oil prices  there is another factor that helped to speed up Bakken output growth   the 1 170 mile long Dakota Access Pipeline  Energy Transfer L P  s   NYSE ET   mega project came online in June 2017 with a capacity to carry about 520 000 barrels of oil per day  or nearly 40  of North Dakota s output   The conduit has successfully bridged the gap between Bakken players and producers in other U S  oil producing areas like the Williston and Permian basins The geographically constrained Bakken Shale s crude has now better access to Gulf and East Coast refineries and also reaches international markets  The pipeline  where energy majors like Phillips 66   NYSE PSX    Enbridge Inc    NYSE ENB   and Marathon Petroleum   NYSE MPC   have invested  has helped to improve the region s drilling economics by lowering transportation costs for operators Moreover  the pipeline s service has bolstered the revival of Bakken output  with large operators like Oasis Petroleum Inc    NYSE OAS   counting on the Dakota Access Pipeline to send a major portion of their products to market But with the pipeline s spare capacity vanishing rapidly amid high demand  there is a need for infrastructure that can allow for the movement of more oil  A recent expansion of the Dakota Access Pipeline and the proposed Liberty Pipeline  which will provide opportunity to shippers to secure transportation service from the Bakken production areas to Corpus Christi  TX  are touted as solutions  While the Dakota Access expansion has augmented the pipeline s capacity by 50 000 barrels per day  the Liberty pipeline will have an initial throughput capacity of 350 000 barrels per day and is expected to start operations in another two years What Lies Ahead Bullish supply and demand fundamentals recently pushed WTI oil prices above  65 a barrel  The U S  crude benchmark rallied to the highest in almost six months  underpinned mainly by production cuts from the OPEC led group of exporters  and drop in supply from Venezuela and Iran  The so called OPEC  deal  an alliance of OPEC  Russia and other non member countries  is withholding output by around 1 2 million barrels per day until the end of June  U S  sanctions against Venezuela and Iran also continue to tighten the commodity s fundamentals Signs of stable demand  contrary to previous expectations of slowing consumption   optimism over U S  China trade talks and the expiry of waivers granted to eight Iranian crude importers are other positives in the oil story  These themes not only put a floor beneath prices for the time being  but also are likely to aid the continuation of commodity s recent gains Agreed  soaring oil production in the United States is putting some downward pressure on black gold but prices should generally trend higher during 2019   something also corroborated by Director of Mineral Resources Lynn Helms  Moreover  with winter weather and road restrictions now out of the way  the monthly

200241,421757,HES,Hess  HES  Moves To Buy  Rationale Behind The Upgrade,opinion,"Hess  HES  appears an attractive pick  as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   This rating change essentially reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates    one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices 
A company s changing earnings picture is at the core of the Zacks rating  The system tracks the Zacks Consensus Estimate    the consensus measure of EPS estimates from the sell side analysts covering the stock    for the current and following years 
Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time  In these situations  the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements 
As such  the Zacks rating upgrade for Hess is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  has proven to be strongly correlated with the near term price movement of its stock  The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship  as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock 
For Hess  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company s underlying business  And investors  appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
As empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Hess
This oil and gas producer is expected to earn   0 07 per share for the fiscal year ending December  2019  which represents a year over year change of 90 5  
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Hess  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 88 1  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

200251,421767,HES,Disappearing Bakken oil discount adds to output slowdown signs,news,"By Catherine Ngai NEW YORK  Reuters    Oil traders scrambling to secure crude in the U S  Midwest have pushed North Dakota s Bakken to a near premium for the first time in two years  a rally stoked by record refinery runs and an unprecedented slump in Canadian imports  Yet some traders say the surprising strength emerging from opaque physical crude markets in the heartland of the fracking boom also points to a more important  lasting factor  declining production of Bakken crude  a long anticipated but as yet unproven twist in the shale revolution  The buying frenzy pushed Bakken delivered at Clearbrook  Minnesota   to trade just 35 cents a barrel below the West Texas Intermediate benchmark last week  dealers say  the narrowest discount since July 2013  On Tuesday  it widened slightly to a 75 cent discount  Four months ago  it traded at a  7 50 discount   The rapid spread contraction may be indicative of a faster than anticipated production decline  presenting upside risk to our price forecast  in the second half   Barclays   LONDON BARC  analysts wrote in a report  There are other compelling reasons for Bakken crude s relative strength  to be sure  Canada s oil exports to the United States suffered their biggest monthly decline on record this spring due to maintenance on big oil sands projects as well as forest fires that slashed a tenth of Alberta s total oil production  Refiners in the U S  Midwest region ran the most crude ever for the month of May thanks to a light maintenance slate and robust margins  triggering a bidding war for light barrels  Regardless  the disappearing discount offers a partial reprieve for large producers like Continental Resources  N CLR  and  Hess Corp   N HES  after the past year slashed global oil prices by as much as 60 percent to six year lows  Thanks to the stronger differentials  Bakken crude  has risen 54 percent from its mid March low  whereas U S  WTI prices  are up only 37 percent  according to Reuters data  DATA LAG Oil drilling rigs are down 58 percent this year in North Dakota  setting the stage for a reversal after years of breakneck production growth  The timing and scale of that descent have been unclear due to lagging official data  North Dakota s Department of Mineral Resources will release figures for April production on Friday  The No  2 oil producing state posted a surprising jump in oil output in March  The Energy Information Administration estimates that Bakken output was little changed from a record high 1 3 million bpd in March  but expects it to fall by 70 000 bpd over the following three months Others still see growth through May  PointLogic  which uses real time natural gas flow data to forecast oil production  estimates output rose by 31 000 bpd in April versus March and kept rising through May before turning lower recently  according to data made available to Reuters  Last week  North Dakota s crude by rail loadings averaged 437 000 bpd at monitored terminals  the lowest level since mid March  industry provider Genscape said  Meanwhile  Enbridge s  TO ENB  North Dakota pipeline system has run close to capacity  signifying that production has fallen   HUNGRY REFINERIES The rise in differentials differs from the brief rally in mid 2013  when the North Dakota crude traded at a premium  At that point  competing new infrastructure bid up prices  This time it is largely about supply from Canada  U S  bound exports averaged under 2 8 million bpd in May  EIA data shows  down 360 000 bpd from April   the biggest such monthly decline ever  Syncrude Canada s oil sands output has fallen by more than 50 percent between January and May on a planned turnaround  And recent Alberta wildfires hit production from companies including MEG Energy  TO MEG  and  Cenovus Energy  Inc  TO CVE   Benchmark WCS differentials climbed to a five year high  trading at a  7 00 discount last week  Cold Lake crude  most directly affected  is much heavier than Bakken light  but traders say that refiners have adjusted their slates to step up Bakken buying    Why pay   8  vs WTI  for Cold Lake when you can pay   0 50 for Bakken   said one trader   That puts a bid behind Bakken   Meanwhile  Midwest refiners are running at full speed ahead of summer gasoline demand  PADD 2 throughput rose to 2 7 million bpd last month  the highest ever for May and up 3 percent from a year earlier  EIA data shows   LOOKING ABROAD It is unclear how long the strength may last  Canadian production is already recovering and Midwest refinery runs  have fallen for the past three weeks  In addition  traders say elevated Bakken prices have priced out East Coast refiners that have been buying about a third of output  EIA data shows   Just last week  the Bakken and West Africa Qua Iboe  differential tightened to the smallest since June 2013  With the arbitrage opening for imported crude  Bakken barrels may soon be seeking new homes  
 The question is just how fast are people reacting   said Sandy Fielden at RBN Energy   How quickly are people jumping off rail and into pipeline  For the short term  there s more demand from Midwest refiners  But will it stay  ",2015-06-10,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/disappearing-bakken-oil-discount-adds-to-output-slowdown-signs-345867,345867

200261,421777,HES,Argentine debt defiance may strengthen holdouts  legal position,news,"By Daniel Bases NEW YORK  Reuters    Argentina has fought in court for a dozen years against the claims of holdout investors in its defaulted debt  and Argentina has lost  The holdouts  led by Paul Singer s Elliott Capital Management and Mark Brodsky s Aurelius Capital Management  are still waiting to collect a single penny or peso 
Argentina defied court ordered demands to pay all its bondholders by a June 30 deadline  and a 30 day grace period runs out this week  Argentina says a payment to its trustee bank insulates it against charges it doesn t pay its bills on time  It has described the holdouts as vultures and the judge who made the orders as unjust  The country has enough foreign currency to cover about five months  worth of imports  and billions of dollars of debt coming due next year  Until it pays the holdouts  it will remain locked out of international capital markets 
Having talked itself into a corner  Argentina now has to either swallow its pride and pay the holdouts  or keep its pride  accept another default and face isolation and penury  Making things worse for President Cristina Kirchner and Economy Minister Axel Kicillof  continued refusal will likely end up strengthening Elliott and Aurelius  two distressed debt specialists who haven t amassed billions of dollars in assets by backing down from a fight 
 My sense is that the holdouts might get a stronger hand in a much worse situation because default is a Pandora s box   said Hans Humes  chief executive officer of Greylock Capital Management in New York who served as co chair of the Global Committee of Argentine Bondholders  GCAB  and on the private creditor investor committee for Greece s restructuring in 2011 
 Right now they are pari passu with the other payments  If there is a default they become likely senior to those bonds as the documentation on the exchanged bonds of 2005 and 2010 is weaker than what the holdouts sued on   Humes said  referring to the legal doctrine of treating all creditors equally 
In the realm of distressed debt investing  Elliott and Aurelius are among the big guns  buying up the bonds of troubled lenders for pennies on the dollar and then pushing to negotiate for profitable payments  sometimes through the courts  Elliott has about  24 8 billion in assets under management and Aurelius has about  4 5 billion  Argentina has about  30 billion in foreign currency reserves  Singer and Brodsky are both lawyers 
BATTLE WITH PERU
Elliott is using similar tactics with Argentina as it employed in its successful pursuit of Peru s sovereign debt  It bought up defaulted Peruvian commercial bank loans starting in the mid 1990s and used the pari passu argument to collect on the debt 
In the dispute with Peru  Elliott was first rejected in both U S  District Court in New York and a Belgian commercial court  but later won on appeal 
In Belgium it succeeded in getting an injunction blocking payment  similar to the way U S  District Judge Thomas Griesa blocked Bank of New York Mellon from distributing payments to exchanged bondholders 
These victories over Peru forced a face off with President Alberto Fujimori  who was then facing corruption and human rights violation charges  Blocked by the courts and with just days to go before a default could be declared  Peru caved and did not fight Elliott any further 
 At the same time Elliott was trying to negotiate  But also remember that Fujimori was caught up in a corruption scandal investigation  I think he just didn t have the focus and settled   said Humes 
Elliott spent just over  11 million on the loans and walked away with about  60 million just weeks before Fujimori fled the country  the Peruvian government said in its official report 
Elliott has used its financial muscle in the corporate world as well  In the case of energy group Hess Corp   the firm pushed for a corporate restructuring that resulted in its nominees joining the company s board  It pressed for BMC Software to sell itself to private equity firms after fighting a proxy battle in 2012 to get two directors on its board in 2012 
Argentina has been a more intractable situation  with the current dispute stretching into its second decade without a final resolution  Moody s Investors Service says Argentina is the only sovereign default out of 34 studied in the modern era to have resulted in persistent litigation 
TRADING POSITION
Neither Elliott nor Aurelius have ever revealed their trading position  making it impossible to know what profit they stand to make after millions in legal fees and lost opportunities from the tied up cash  But sources say they have owned Argentine debt prior to the default in January 2002 
Multiple requests for comment from Elliott and Aurelius for this story were unsuccessful 
Argentina s government says Elliott stands to make a 1 680 percent profit in just six years if it gets the full payment on its portion of an award of  1 33 billion plus interest handed down by Griesa in New York  He based it upon the equal treatment clause 
Argentina was ordered to pay Elliott concurrently with the exchange bondholders 
Buenos Aires deposited  539 million sitting in a BNY Mellon account at the Central bank of Argentina in June  ahead of a regular interest payment  BNY Mellon  the trustee for the bondholders  hasn t moved the money because of Griesa s order 
That leaves Latin America s No  3 economy closer to a new default on July 30 
Holdouts  with a court victory to back them up  have said for years that they re ready to negotiate  while the government has refused to meet with them face to face  The holdouts have also said they would accept bonds as part of any settlement rather than simply cash 
The court appointed mediator has failed to get the two sides in the same room  even after weeks of coaxing the government  Argentina is sending a delegation to New York on Tuesday  mediator Daniel Pollack said in a statement on Monday 
 I again urged direct  face to face conversations with the bondholders  but that will not happen tomorrow   Pollack said 
Argentina and its lawyers at Cleary Gottlieb Steen   Hamilton have argued that if it pays holdouts it opens itself up to an even bigger liability in the tens or even hundreds of billions of dollars 
That liability is not just from other holdouts who never participated in 2005 and 2010 but from those who did exchange their bonds and thought they were protected by the so called rights upon future offers clause  or RUFO  that bars Argentina from voluntarily offering better terms to exchange bondholders 
Even if they default  Griesa s injunction remains in force and legal observers believe banks will be reluctant to do business in Argentina for fear of violating the ruling 

 If they default  I think the holdouts lose some of their leverage because the judge gave Argentina a choice  They opted for paying no one and Elliott and Aurelius don t have any money yet   said one senior lawyer who specializes in sovereign debt restructurings 
The lawyer s firm works for one of the parties to the case and therefore spoke on the promise of anonymity 
 One way around RUFO is to have a sum equal to what has been paid to the exchange bondholders paid into an escrow account  therefore not violating the clause and wait until it expires   the lawyer said  referring the RUFO expiration on Dec  31  2014

200262,421778,HES,Hess quarterly net income more than doubles on asset sales,news," Reuters    Oil and gas producer Hess Corp  N HES  said on Wednesday its quarterly net income more than doubled due in part to gains from recent asset sales and a production jump in North Dakota s Bakken shale formation 
The company posted net income of  1 billion  or  3 31 per share  compared with  420 million  or  1 23 per share  in the year ago period 

Oil production jumped to an average of 380 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day  boe d  from 310 000 boe d in the year ago quarter

200263,421779,HES,Hess  HES  May Report Negative Earnings  Know The Trend Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"Hess  HES  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 30  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This oil and gas producer is expected to post quarterly loss of  0 40 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  60 4  
Revenues are expected to be  1 59 billion  up 23  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 263 64  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Hess 
For Hess  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  6 86  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Hess will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Hess would post a loss of  0 05 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 38  delivering a surprise of  860  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss

200293,421809,HES,Republicans May Retain A Slim Majority In Congress  5 Picks ,opinion,Republicans and Democrats are probably heading for a photo finish in the mid term Congressional poll  The gap between the Democrats and Republicans  which was heavily inclined toward the former  is getting narrower as the voting day approaches  On Nov 6  all 435 seats in the House of Representatives  35 of the Senate s 100 seats and 36 state governor s posts will go for poll Several pre poll surveys have shown that Democrats will get majority in the House of Representatives while Republicans will retain the control of Senate  However  a few surveys also forecasted that Republicans may even retain the control of House of Representatives by a slim margin  Consequently  it will be prudent to invest in stocks from Oil and natural gas  coal and defense industries with a favorable Zacks Rank Close Fight Ahead  According to several poll surveys  till the end of 2017  Democrats were leading by a healthy margin of by around 13 points for U S  Congress  However  that lead has steadily come down to around 6 points in the first week of November  Polls results released on Nov 2  by ABC News The Washington Post and NBC News Wall Street Journal have confirmed this trend Moreover  the NBC News Wall Street Journal poll has shown that 29  Americans thought the country was heading in the right direction at the end of 2017  In fact  the figure has now gone up to 38   better than 37  when Trump became President  Similarly  the ABC Washington Post has shown that 65  Americans have positive view on the U S  economy  a significant improvement from 51  when Trump took charge of office Per the NBC Wall Street Journal poll  Trump s approval stood at 46  while 52  people are against him  CNN survey revealed that Trump s approval is at 44   According to IBD TIPP poll released on Nov 4  77  of Americans think economic well being will be the top priority for making voting decisions In this regards  Trump is likely to be the hero with 47  giving him an  excellent  or  good  rating while just 35  gave  poor  rating  Further  56  of the surveyed people said the U S  economy is improving Republicans Hold Slight EdgeRepublicans are likely to retain control of the Senate while the House of Representatives may go in favor of Democrats  Historically  the stock market has done reasonably well even when the Congress is divided with Republicans in Senate and Democrats in the House of Representatives  Wall Street has always been able to dodge policy deadlock situations in the U S  government The economy  immigration and impeachment have become three major issues for the mid term Congressional elections  While economy favors the Republicans  the impeachment issue is the key one for Democrats Immigration is a divisive issue as the democrats have criticized Trump administration s  zero tolerance  policy toward separating migrant children from their parents  However  various polls have shown that women voters  who are likely to be very sensitive to this issue  are gradually inclining toward Republicans as the Election Day approaches Our Top Picks With Republicans like to retain majority

200304,421820,HES,Is Canada s Oil Pipeline Bottleneck Choking The Economy ,opinion,Oil production is surging in Canada but producers are far from happy as their profit margin is sinking and they are striving to stay competitive with their U S  counterparts  While upstream companies like Marathon Oil Corporation   NYSE MRO    Hess Corporation   NYSE HES   and others are enjoying the shale boom and rebound in prices in the United States  their Canadian counterparts like Cenovus Energy Inc    TO CVE   and others are thinking of reducing production  The primary reason behind this is the shortage of pipelines in the country  In short  pipeline construction in Canada has failed to keep pace with rising domestic oil production   the heavier sour variety churned out of the oil sands    resulting in infrastructural bottlenecks  This has also forced producers to give away their products at a discounted rate Price Differences Leading to Lower RevenuesPipeline capacity constraints mean that Canadian oil explorers are selling their products in the United States   their major market   at highly discounted prices  causing tremendous loss in revenues  In fact  the discounts have led to a huge difference between Alberta s Western Canada Select and New York traded West Texas Intermediate oil benchmark  After adjustments made for differences in quality and shipping costs  the Fraser Institute in Canada found the difference between oil prices in the United States and Canada at  26 30 per barrel for 2018  This is expected to land a C 15 8 billion blow to the energy sector s revenues  Notably  the price difference between the two averaged at  16 54 per barrel during the 2012 17 period  which resulted in lost revenues of C 20 7 billion As it is  extraction from oil sands is a high risk strategy considering the extra costs involved compared with production from conventional oil wells  Add to it limited pipeline capacity and things do not look too promising for Canada s upstream players Now the question is what led to this infrastructural scenario Environmental and Political TurmoilThough several major pipeline projects received the green light from the review agencies in the country  their future is still uncertain due to political turmoil  Moreover  environmental protests are on the rise  thereby further derailing construction  The crusaders believe that the rapidly growing movement of oil around the country is unsafe For example  the C 7 4 billion Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project of Kinder Morgan  Inc    NYSE KMI     a Zacks Ranks  3  Hold  company   faced opposition from British Columbia residents and indigenous communities  who are wary of the potential impact of the project on the environment  The NDP government in British Columbia also opposed the expansion project  Currently  the Canadian government is planning to provide a financial shield to the company from the politically motivated delays You can see  Moreover  TransCanada Corporation s   TO TRP    8 billion Keystone XL pipeline   expected to carry heavy crude from Alberta to refineries in the United States   is yet to get a final investment decision  The midstream company had secured 20 years commitment for 500 thousand barrels per day for the pipeline and received Alberta government s support  However  the Nebraska government sanctioned the Mainline Alternative Route for the controversial project  which is longer than the company s preferred route and has forced it to review the alternative route keeping the final decision on hold Enbridge Inc  s   NYSE ENB   Canada United States connecting Line 3 replacement project faced criticism from the Ojibwe communities  The capital cost of the project in Canada is estimated to be C 5 3 billion while the portion in the United States will cost  2 9 billion  The preferred route of the company goes against the interests of the Native Americans  The fate of the project is expected to be decided by Jun 27  2018  The situation has become discouraging for investors in the oil energy space in Canada Related ProblemsApart from Canadian oil s massive discount relative to WTI  the pipeline shortage created another problem for the energy sector  as crude shippers increased their dependence on railway and trucks  which is costlier than pipelines as well as less safe  Carrying oil by railways and roads makes crude transportation more prone to spills  which is ironically the primary concern for environmentalists  Hence  it can be said that the pipeline shortage is causing both economic and environmental problems for Canada Additionally  the farmers who ship their grains via railroads are experiencing difficulties as they are left with stranded cargos and cash crunch  Rise in demand for shipping crudes by rail is pushing other cargoes off the rail  It created grain backlog due to lack of lower availability of crop cars  In short  the pipeline bottleneck is slowly squeezing Canada s two most important sectors and giving investors a hard time  It has also put the government in a tough spot ConclusionEven if implementation of the pipeline policies accelerates  it will take considerable time to actually finish the projects  Until then  the economy is likely to take a blow on two fronts  energy and agriculture  In case of Trans Mountain  the government s plan to provide financial assurance  taking the burden of politically motivated delays  will further create a hole in tax payers  fund  Hence  a sound regulatory and environmental policy framework is the need of the hour  The sooner it is devised  the better it is for the Canadian economy  Otherwise  it will become increasingly difficult for energy companies to find new routes to take the country s landlocked oil to foreign markets Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana Ignited by new referendums and

200306,421822,HES,Dakota Pipeline s 1st Anniversary  Bakken Game Changer ,opinion,"Energy Transfer Partners L P  s   NYSE ETP   mega project  Dakota Access Pipeline  recently marked its one year anniversary  Disregarding criticism from Native American tribes and environmental groups  the pipeline has been operational for a year now and proved to be a silver bullet for North Dakota s economic potential Clears Many ChallengesThe pipeline was supposed to become operational by the end of 2016  However  it received immense censure from a Native American tribe that delayed the commencement of its services  The Obama administration halted pipeline construction amid protests  blocking the building of the final part of the pipeline through North Dakota 
The protests drew international attention as the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe objected the project  They were of the opinion that the pipeline would desecrate their sacred burial ground as well as contaminate water supply However  making good on his campaign promises to rev up infrastructure spending  President Trump ignored bitter opposition from environmental activists and brushed aside former Obama s efforts of blocking the pipeline s construction  Efforts to complete the Dakota Access Pipeline were thus reinvigorated  as Trump signed an executive order to smoothly execute the pipeline s operations  The pipeline finally came online on Jun 1 last year Dakota Pipeline  Trump Card for North Dakota Though the opening of the pipeline was mired in controversy  the  3 8 billion Dakota Pipeline has proved to be quite a game changer for the producers in the Bakken shale play While Bakken in North Dakota has significant accumulations of profitable oil reserves  production in the area fell sharply during the oil slump  However  with rebounding crude prices  Bakken has been regaining strength  with output gradually approaching the peak levels that was achieved in 2014 
Apart from improving energy landscape  another factor that has been boosting its production prospects is the 1 172 mile long Dakota Access pipeline  While North Dakota production volumes lag Texas and Gulf of Mexico levels  the output growth has enhanced domestic energy independence  with the pipeline already carrying around 182 5 million barrels of oil In March 2018  oil production hit 1 162 071 barrels per day bpd  as against 1 025 638 bpd a year earlier  gaining impetus from the pipeline project  North Dakota s total number of producing wells totaled 14 457  banking on improved energy landscape and midstream network The pipeline  with a capacity to carry about 520 000 barrels of oil per day  has successfully bridged the gap between Bakken players and producers in other U S  oil producing areas like the Williston and Permian basins The commencement of the pipeline s service has bolstered the revival of Bakken output  with large operators like Oasis Petroleum Inc    NYSE OAS   counting on the Dakota Access Pipeline to send a major portion of their products to market  Oasis Petroleum currently carries a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see

200312,421828,HES,North Dakota Oil Production To Reach Record High In 2018,opinion,"As per North Dakota s oil regulator  the state s daily crude output fell 0 6  in January after decreasing 1 2  in the previous month  The North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources    DMR   latest data said that oil production in January averaged 1 175 638 barrels a day  down 7 198 barrels a day from December 
With crude  natural gas output came down  too   from December s 2 084 925 thousand cubic feet per day to 2 068 244 thousand cubic feet per day  Meanwhile  North Dakota s total number of producing wells numbered 14 313 at the end of January  unchanged from the previous month 
While the slight drop in oil activity   primarily attributed to winter weather   is the second month over month production decrease in a row  the decline was much smaller than anticipated  Moreover  daily output remained above 1 million barrels for the twelfth month 
Therefore  notwithstanding the temporary blip  the newest numbers confirm the resurgence in volumes extracted from North Dakota  centered on the Bakken Shale formation 
Rig Count Pushes Higher
Some 56 drilling rigs were active in the state in January  up four from the December average  The all time low of 27 was set in May 2016  while a year ago  North Dakota had just 38 rigs operating  A closely watched yardstick of North Dakota oil industry s strength  the improvement in the number of units searching for oil and gas in the region indicates rebounding drilling activities and production 
Though the rig count is still down considerably from the peak of May 2012 when North Dakota had 218 units drilling  one must note that sophisticated drilling rigs have enabled producers to get more oil out of each well  In other words  modern rigs have helped boost the per unit output 
 60 Is the New  80 for Shale Industry
More rigs in operation and stable production not only confirms the positive developments for the state of North Dakota  but also points to the rising flood of U S  shale driven production 
Now at a financial equilibrium  the shale firms are putting more rigs and employees back to work  Throughout the downturn  producers  in North Dakota and particularly the Permian Basin in Texas  worked tirelessly to cut costs down to a bare minimum and look for innovative ways to churn out more oil from rock  And they managed to do just that by improving drilling techniques 
With these efforts  many upstream companies have repositioned themselves to adapt to the new  50  60 oil reality and even thrive at those prices  In other words  while OPEC s moves to trim output and rebalance the demand supply situation has stabilized the market to a large extent  in the process it has incentivized shale drillers to churn out more 
What Lies Ahead 
The U S  West Texas Intermediate benchmark hit a more than three year high of around  66 recently  Also  we are confident that improving fundamentals have probably put a floor under crude prices for the time being  While we do not rule out chances for short term pullbacks on oversupply concerns and a stronger U S  dollar  we remain extremely confident of an extended period of gains in the near future 
In this context  the steady recovery in North Dakota s production bode well for the region  With oil prices likely to head higher  the monthly output in the second largest oil producing state after Texas is expected to stay above the psychologically important one million barrel a day mark for the time being 
Dakota Access Pipeline  Safe and Reliable Method for Transporting Oil
Apart from the strength in crude prices  there is another factor that might speed up Bakken output growth   the 1 100 mile long Dakota Access Pipeline 
Making good on his campaign promises to rev up infrastructure spending  President Trump ignored bitter opposition from environmental activists and signed executive order to smooth the way for Energy Transfer Partners    NYSE ETP    3 7 billion Dakota Access Pipeline just a few days into his new Administration  As a result  disregarding the censure from environmental groups and the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe  the sponsor brought the controversial conduit  in early June 2017 
With the project s arrival  operators have scrambled to use the Dakota Access Pipeline to send a major portion of their product to market  In fact  around 78  of oil shipments out of North Dakota are now being carried by pipelines  with the costly railroad share dropping from over 24  in the early part of 2017 to little over 10  
Market players believe that the pipeline has helped in bettering the region s drilling economics by lowering transportation costs for operators  Set to carry about 520 000 barrels of oil daily  or more than 50  of North Dakota s output  the commencement of the Dakota Access Pipeline has bridged the gap between Bakken players and producers in other U S  oil producing areas like the Permian Basin 
The geographically constrained Bakken Shale s crude has now better access to Gulf and East Coast refineries and also reaches international markets  As expected  the pipeline  where energy majors like Phillips 66   NYSE PSX    Enbridge Inc    NYSE ENB   and Marathon Petroleum Corp    NYSE MPC   have invested  has helped to improve the region s drilling economics by lowering transportation costs for operators and benefit the state financially 
Products from companies like Continental Resources  Inc    NYSE CLR     and Hess Corp    NYSE HES   were among the first to reach the international markets  China and Netherlands   with the help of Dakota Access 
Overall  rebounding oil prices  together with the start of the Dakota Access Pipeline  are expected to support further increase in Bakken output by providing the companies a chance to push their produce outward at a lower cost 
In fact  Lynn Helms   the director of DMR   feels that a conducive oil pricing environment is likely push the state s output beyond the all time high of 1 227 483 barrels day sometime by mid 2018  eventually hitting 1 3 million barrels by the end of the year

s delve deeper to analyze what s driving the stock Drop Down Deals Leading to Cash InfluxTo accelerate value accretion for shareholders and boost growth  Marathon Petroleum has been actively engaged in drop down transactions lately  As part of that effort  the company divested some of its terminal  pipeline and storage assets to its midstream subsidiary  MPLX L P    NYSE MPLX    The  8 1 billion dropdown deal with MPLX that closed last month has resulted in huge cash influx and increased equity participation in the partnership  Moreover  the transaction also ensures the generation of a steady

enhanced MPLX s scale and increased its distributable cash flow per unit  It will also enrich its earnings by diversifying it with fee based stable revenue streams  which will get reflected in the profitability of its parent company in the future MPLX s new Cushing to Patoka Expansion project concluded its binding open season late last month and garnered a substantial interest from potential

improving market conditions are likely to boost margins and the financial position of the Speedway unit in the coming quarters Refining Margins Fuel IncomeOperating income from the Refining   Marketing segment surged 71  year over year in 2017  The jump was led by wider crack spread leading to stronger refining margin and higher capacity utilization  Refining margins averaged  12 60 in

200332,421848,HES,Is The Dakota Access Pipeline Delivering What It Promised ,opinion,Energy Transfer Partners  L P  s   NYSE ETP   Dakota Access pipeline has been benefiting oil producers in Bakken Shale   We note that the opening of the pipeline was mired in controversy  However   in June 2017  this 1 172 mile pipeline has proved to be beneficial for producers in the region How The pipeline  with a capacity to carry about 520 000 barrels of oil per day  was targeted to bridge the gap between Bakken players and producers in other U S  oil producing areas like the Williston and Permian basins  The geographically constrained Bakken Shale s crude has now better access to Gulf and East Coast refineries and also reaches international markets  As expected  the pipeline  where oil majors like Phillips 66   NYSE PSX    Enbridge Inc    NYSE ENB   and Marathon Petroleum Corporation   NYSE MPC   have invested     has helped to improve the region s drilling economics by lowering transportation costs for operators and benefit the state financially   Products from companies like Continental Resources  Inc    NYSE CLR   and Hess Corporation   NYSE HES   were among the first to reach the international markets  China and Netherlands   with the help of Dakota Access Owing to improved access to the markets  discount for Bakken crude has gone down from  7 or  8 to  5  This has increased the number of operational rigs in the region from 38 in January 2017 to 53 at the end of 2017  If the current oil price environment persists  the number of active rigs is expected to increase in the coming quarters  Production per rig is higher in the Bakken Shale than most of the other shale plays in the United States  The rise in rig count pushed oil production from around one million barrels per day  bpd  to 1 185 000 bpd  Moreover  in October alone  the state witnessed an all time high total output of more than 2 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day With an increase in output  revenues are expected to surge for oil producers and the state as well  During the first year of operations  the state is expected to receive  250 million in tax  It had put North Dakota state revenue 17  higher than estimated  Notably  during the first five months of the pipeline s operation  state revenues were  43 million higher than previous projection   Crude transportation has become much easier since the introduction of the pipeline  Previously  12 trains with 100 cars used to ship oil out of the state  which now has reduced to two  It has lessened the risk of accidents and spills In addition with the financial perks  the pipeline has provided jobs for locals both directly and indirectly  It has lowered the rate of unemployment in the North Dakota state to 2 8   while the U S  unemployment rate is 4 1  The Dakota Access Controversy The pipeline  which was supposed to become operational by the end of 2016  faced immense objection delaying the commencement of services  Work on the project was halted by the Obama administration amid protests from a Native American tribe  blocking the construction of the final part of the pipeline through North Dakota  The protests of Standing Rock Sioux Tribe drew international attention  They were of the opinion that the pipeline would desecrate their sacred burial ground as well as contaminate the water supply  Efforts to complete the Dakota Access Pipeline were restarted after President Trump brushed aside former President Obama s efforts of blocking the pipeline s construction  Trump ignored the bitter opposition from environmental activists and ordered the completion of the pipeline The pipeline  despite the pending litigation against its operator  has already leaked at least three times  However  in early December 2017  a judge paid heed to the request of the tribe  It asked Energy Transfer Partners and the U S  Army Corps of Engineers to develop an oil spill response plan for the stretch of pipe below the Missouri River  which is due in April 2018 Although the  3 8 billion Dakota Access Pipeline by Energy Transfer Partners  a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company  has faced criticism  it has also proved to be beneficial in some respects  With the expected positive results from the project  it will be hard to cast a vote against the pipeline  You can see  Zacks Editor in Chief Goes  All In  on This Stock Full disclosure  Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other  He believes in its short term profit potential and also in its prospects to more than double by 2019  Today he reveals and explains his surprising move in a new Special Report ,2018-01-01,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-the-dakota-access-pipeline-delivering-what-it-promised-200276963,200276963
200333,421849,HES,Marathon Petroleum Up 34  In A Year  Is Further Upside Left ,opinion,The year 2017 turned out to be a favorable one for Marathon Petroleum Corporation   NYSE MPC   with its share price surging more than 34  compared with the  gain of 18 7  Further  the company s return on investment was more than 8 5  in the trailing 12 months compared with 7 8  for the industry  This shows that it has a more efficient profit generation and reinvestment capacity compared to its peers Marathon Petroleum fared well in 2017 on the back of improved performance in all its segments   Refining  Retail and Midstream   in the first three quarters  The company managed to pull off an average positive earnings surprise of 240 4  in the first three quarters of 2017 Marathon Petroleum s strategic initiatives to enhance growth are expected to boost performance in the future  The company expects to deliver year over year growth of 2 77  in its earnings in 2018 Moreover  it seems to be an impressive choice for growth investors with expected earnings growth rate  next three to five years  of 14 03  Let s now analyze how the stock is placed for 2018 Drop Down Deals to Contribute SignificantlyTo accelerate value accretion for shareholders and boost growth  Marathon Petroleum has been actively engaged in drop down transactions lately  In March 2017  the company divested some of its terminal  pipeline and storage assets to its midstream subsidiary MPLX L P    NYSE MPLX   for  2 02 billion  In September  it further inked a drop down deal worth  1 05 billion  These efforts to streamline its portfolio and enhance core competencies are likely to contribute to EBITDA considerably in 2018 Additionally  in November  it announced another strategic drop down deal  in cash and stock  of  8 1 billion  which is expected to close in February this year  This bodes well for the company as it will not only result to huge cash influx  but will increase its equity participation in MPLX  leading to steady revenue generation for the company Midstream Segment Poised for GrowthMPLX s robust portfolio of projects in Permian  Marcellus and STACK shale plays offers significant growth opportunities  The recent agreement relating to the elimination of incentive distribution rights will also enhance its ability to pursue growth opportunities and manage its business over the long term by decreasing its cost of capital The drop down deals will enhance MPLX s scale and increase its distributable cash flow per unit  It will also to enrich its earnings by diversifying it with fee based stable revenue streams  which will get reflected in the profitability of its parent company in the future  Speedway Segment to Drive ProfitabilityMarathon Petroleum  which had been contemplating the spin off of its retail segment   Speedway   due to pressure from hedge fund Elliott Management Corporation  finally decided to retain it which will position the company for long term values to the shareholder  Speedway is the second largest gasoline and convenience store chain in the United States  providing support to Marathon Petroleum s earnings in times of high volatility in commodity prices  The segment remains primed for solid earnings and growth on healthy merchandise margins  Speedway  which is banking on its marketing enhancement opportunities and acquisition synergies  including the retail arm of Hess Corporation  NYSE HES   is poised for growth Refining Margins to Boost Net Income     Operating income from the Refining   Marketing segment  the main contributor to Marathon Petroleum earnings   was  1 589 million in the first three quarters of 2017  reflecting an increase of 33 4  from the prior year period  The rise is attributed to wider gross margin  which averaged  12 42 a barrel in the first nine months of 2017 compared with  11 11 in the corresponding period of 2016  Specifically  refining margin of Marathon Petroleum was  14 14 per barrel in the third quarter of 2017 versus  11 32 in the second quarter and  10 67 a year ago  We expect the margin strength to continue in the near to medium term  thus boosting the overall performance of the company    Lower Tax Rate to AidThe corporate rate cut from 35  to 21  is likely to benefit the downstream operators in the energy sector  As the upstream players are highly exposed to the weakness and volatility of the oil prices  not many exploration and production companies generate positive net income and thus won t be able to gain much from new tax regime  However  the business of downstream operators is negatively correlated with the energy prices  and their refining margins have been soaring over the past few quarters  Hence  the oil refiners will see new corporate profits from the tax as they generally generate positive income before taxes and are hence better positioned to take advantage of a lower tax burden Strong Financials Bode WellMarathon Petroleum s financial flexibility and a strong balance sheet are its real assets   As of Sep 30  the company had cash and cash equivalents of  2 088 million and a manageable debt to capitalization ratio of 38  Importantly  Marathon Petroleum is known for raising dividends and has an active share repurchase program  These highlight the company s commitment to return more value to shareholders  During the third quarter  it returned  654 million of capital to shareholders  including  452 million in share repurchases  The company s drop down deals are likely to further enhance its dividend and buyback programs Upward Estimate Revisions for 2018Analysts have increased their estimates for the company for the next year  which make the earnings picture favorable  Over the past 60 days  seven estimates have gone up against two downward revisions for 2018  This has caused the consensus estimate to trend higher  from  3 52 60 days ago to its current level of  3 95 Final ThoughtsMarathon Petroleum has been facing challenges from cut throat competition and stiff regulations  We also view the United States  renewable Identification credits  also known as RINs  as an ongoing burden on refineries  profitability because the full cost is not always passed through to the consumer at the pump Nevertheless  we expect Marathon Petroleum to tide over these limitations on the back of its impressive asset quality and extensive midstream retail network  With such solid fundamentals  this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company has a Growth Score of A and seems well positioned to sustain the growth momentum in 2018   Does Oil

200343,421859,HES,Oil Bulls Own Quarter,opinion,"Oil prices surged this quarter as Brent crude put in the best performance in 13 years  This comes as oil demand is surging  geopolitical risk is rising and Moody s warns that shale oil producers will need  50 a barrel plus oil to make any money 
Shale oil producers have shown signs that they are pulling back because many are having a tough time making any money  We have said it before and we will say it again  You can t lose money on every barrel and try to make up for it in volume  While Moody s says that producers have driven down costs  their capital efficiency now depends on higher oil and gas prices  The study says they need above  50 for oil and  3 00 for natural gas  Moody s says that drillers won t be able to make significant returns on the capital they plow into new production unless benchmark U S  West Texas Intermediate crude oil and natural gas prices cooperate 
Moody s analysts  Sreedhar Kona and Steven Wood  said the  producers in the U S  and Canada have made dramatic efforts to cut costs since the collapse of oil prices three years ago  with many delivering higher dividends to investors this year  But with limited wiggle room to reduce costs further  any improvement in their ability to sustain healthy returns will have to come from commodity prices  
Hopefully  growing global demand will bring back shale play but producers have to be smart  Companies should be rewarded for good well head economics  not on how many barrels they can produce 
Yet the lack of CapX spending is sowing the seed of a new tight market down the road  Reuters reports that  Higher investments in offshore oil production are critical to avoiding a supply squeeze by 2020  as expanding shale output will not match projected demand increases in the next few years  U S  oil producer Hess Corp   NYSE HES    The past four years of low oil prices have major producers pulling back on needed offshore investment  and the gap between supply and demand should help prices rebound  Hess Chief Operating Officer Greg Hill said at an energy conference at Rice University s Baker Institute   The world is going to have to invest in more than shale   said Hill  whose company has projects in offshore Guyana  Gulf of Mexico  and Gulf of Thailand  Expanded offshore production  will play a critical role in avoiding another supply shock

200365,421881,HES,Will Dakota Access Pipeline Spur A Production Revival ,opinion,"As per North Dakota s oil regulator  the state s crude output jumped 5 4  in Feb   topping the one million barrel a day mark for the first time since November  The North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources    DMR   latest data said that oil production in Feb was 1 034 168 barrels a day  up 52 788 barrels a day from Jan 
Notwithstanding the increase  the newest numbers confirm the slowdown in volumes extracted from North Dakota  centered on the Bakken Shale formation  Churning out as high as 1 228 973 barrels day in Dec 2014  the current production statistics highlight oil s horror show that saw prices come down from  110 per barrel in mid 2014 to around  52 now  in between falling to a 12 year low of  26 21 in Feb last year  The commodity s collapse fueled spending cuts and layoffs while threatening the industry s creditworthiness by hurting cash flows  drying up liquidity and narrowing profit margins 
Bumpy Ride Awaits Despite the Rebound
The steep monthly uptick in Feb highlights milder temperature  compared with Dec and Jan  and oil prices breaching the  50 a barrel mark that boosted confidence among operators 
But the state regulator expects the improvement in activity to be a temporary phenomenon with output set to be flat or fall slightly in Mar and Apr  That s because of state imposed road restrictions in force due to inclement weather  which limits the supply of water  sand and chemicals for fracking 
Output in the second largest oil producing state is likely to return to Feb levels only sometime in the late third quarter or early fourth quarter  Before that  activity is expected to start recovering from May onward when road restrictions are lifted    
Rig Count  Rising but Still a Shadow of the Oil Boom Times
In a positive sign  North Dakota has seen its rig count improve over the past few months  with the addition of a flood of new units into an improving commodity price environment  The current tally   at 51   is up 11  from the Mar average of 49  which in itself spiked from the Feb rig count of 39 
The rig count leader is Marathon Oil Corp    NYSE MRO   which has 10 rigs at work  with 9 added in 2017 itself  Next is Continental Resources Inc    NYSE CLR    accounting for 5 rigs in the play   2 added this year 
Despite the rig count upswing  one should note that the numbers are a far cry from the peak of May 2012 when North Dakota had 218 rigs drilling  Even two years ago  there were 91 active rigs in the state s oil patch 
Dakota Access Pipeline  Boon for Oil Producers 
While the oil weakness is expected to persist at least till the second half of 2017  there is one factor that might speed up the revival of Bakken output   the 1 100 mile long Dakota Access Pipeline 
Making good on his campaign promises to rev up infrastructure spending  President Trump ignored bitter opposition from environmental activists and signed executive order to smooth the way for Energy Transfer Partners L P  s   NYSE ETP    3 7 billion Dakota Access Pipeline just a few days into his new Administration  The sponsor has already confirmed that it has finished construction of the controversial conduit and is now filling the line with crude to facilitate a mid Apr startup   
Market players believe that once online  the pipeline will help in bettering the region s drilling economics by lowering transportation costs for operators  Set to carry about 500 000 barrels of oil daily  or more than 50  of North Dakota s output  the impending commencement of the Dakota Access Pipeline will help to bridge the gap between Bakken players and producers in other U S  oil producing areas like the Williston and Permian basins 
This  industry observers hope  will set the ball rolling for Bakken s production revival  which plunged with the sharp fall in crude prices 
Operators Optimistic
Large operators like Hess Corp    NYSE HES   and Oasis Petroleum Inc    NYSE OAS   are counting on the Dakota Access Pipeline to send a major portion of their product to market  With lower costs and more options at their disposal  the companies plan to increase their Bakken production 
Even producers such as Whiting Petroleum Corp    NYSE WLL   and Continental Resources   that are not in the race to use the Dakota Access Pipeline   are betting on the facility to unclog the crowded existing pipelines out of Dakota and avoid using the costly railroads 
However  each of these firms has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   which does not make them screaming buys

Oil   Gas Stock Roundup

It was a week where oil prices moved higher on fading Brexit concerns  while natural gas futures soared to a 13 month high 

On the news front  Energy Transfer Equity L P     walked away from the merger with Williams Companies Inc      while Kinder Morgan Inc      agreed to sell a 50  stake in its Utopia Pipeline Project 

Overall  it was a good week for the sector  West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude futures added 2 8  to close at  48 99 per barrel  while natural gas prices jumped 12 2  to  2 987 per million Btu  MMBtu    See the last  Oil   Gas Stock Roundup  here     

Oil prices moved north for the first time in 3 weeks on subsiding fears about the effects of Brexit   the short way of saying Britain s exit from the EU   on crude demand  A weaker dollar  which made the greenback priced crude cheaper for investors holding foreign currency  also lent support 

Things were further helped by the U S  Energy Department s weekly inventory release that showed a large drop in crude stockpiles  However  some of the gains were erased after the Baker Hughes report revealed a rise in the U S  oil rig count   indicating resurgence in shale drilling activities 



Natural gas gained big following another lower than average build and predictions of strong cooling demand with forecasts of warmer temperature across the country over the next few days 

Recap of the Week s Most Important Stories

1  Texas pipeline operator Energy Transfer Equity L P  reported that it has ended its merger agreement to buy rival natural gas pipeline company Williams Companies Inc   following the ruling by the Delaware Court of Chancery 

Few days back  the court ruled in favor of Energy Transfer Equity  Notably  the ruling came in a lawsuit filed by Williams to hold Energy Transfer Equity to the deal  In May  Williams took the legal step when Energy Transfer Equity expressed concerns over the merger citing that the deal had not secured the necessary legal opinion to make it tax free for shareholders 

But much to the dismay of Williams  the Delaware Court concluded that Energy Transfer Equity is contractually entitled to end the merger agreement with Williams in the event that the company s counsel Latham   Watkins LLP were unable to deliver a required tax opinion prior to the merger deadline date of June 28  2016   See More     

2  Houston  TX based energy infrastructure provider Kinder Morgan Inc  announced that it has divested a 50  stake in the Utopia Pipeline Project to private equity firm Riverstone Investment Group LLC 

Per the agreement  Riverstone would provide an upfront cash payment  consisting of the reimbursement to Kinder Morgan for its 50  share prior capital expenditures and a payment in excess of capital expenditure to recognize the value created in developing the project  The total project cost is estimated at  500 million 

The Utopia Pipeline is a common carrier project that will include approximately 215 miles of new  12 inch diameter pipeline constructed entirely within the state of Ohio   from Harrison County to Fulton County  The pipeline will facilitate the transport of ethane and ethane propane mixtures to petrochemical companies operating in Ontario  Canada  to be used as a feedstock in the production of plastics   See More     

3  Energy producer Hess Corp     tasted success in the Liza 2 exploration well in the Stabroek block  offshore Guyana  The results indicate that Liza prospect is a world class oil discovery with estimated recoverable resources between 800 million and 1 4 billion barrels of oil equivalent 

Located in the Stabroek block  the Liza wells are about 120 miles  193 kilometers  offshore Guyana  The Stabroek block spans across an acreage of 6 6 million acres  26 800 square kilometers  

Drilled by an affiliate of Exxon Mobil Corp  NYSE XOM    the Liza 2 well was drilled to a total depth of 17 963 feet  5 475 meters  in 5 551 feet  1 692 meters  of water  The Exxon Mobil unit is also the operator of the Stabroek block with a stake of 45   Other partners in the block are Hess Guyana Exploration Ltd  and CNOOC Nexen Petroleum Guyana Ltd  with 30  and 25  interest  respectively   See More     

4  British energy major BP plc     on behalf of Tangguh Production Sharing Contract Partners  declared that its Tangguh Expansion Project in the Papua Barat Province of Indonesia has received approval for the Final Investment Decision  FID

200396,421912,HES,Fear of The Talking Fed,opinion,"Oil traders are starting to fear the talking Fed  While no one expects the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates  the statement and comments by Janet Yellen could cause a selloff in commodities as fears that a divergent path in interest rates will cause further slowing in the emerging markets  Oil rallied last week on the back of oil demand optimism and OPEC restraint  The rally is now retreating on fears that OPEC will continue to flood the market with oil in a world where demand may falter 
Overnight the Bank of Japan left its monetary policy unchanged which was not a surprise  but downgraded its assessment of the economy  So if Japan s outlook is weakening and the Fed is looking to raise rates  that is causing some traders to take some longs off of the table  Traders remember the January price collapse that came after a late December interest rate increase and weakness in China 
Crude oil prices are also uncertain about a deal to freeze output even after Russia s oil minister said that Iran should be exempt from an oil output freeze  Iran s oil minister  Bijan Zanganeh  said that the country would only join discussions after its own output reached 4 0 million barrels a day  This came as OPEC seems to suggest that the demand for OPEC is falling and a freeze in production may not be enough to overcome supply  OPEC reported that their output fell by about 175 000 barrels a day last month to 32 28 million barrels on lower output from Iraq  Nigeria and the United Arab Emirates  the cartel said in its monthly market report  Iran s production increased by 187 800 barrels a day to 3 132 million barrels a day last month  OPEC said it expects its crude demand will stand at 31 5 million barrels per day  100 000 barrels a day lower than last month s report but an increase of 1 8 million barrels a day from last year 
Tim Koltek  the CEO of Terrapin Energy Services  agrees and wrote me  Tim said that   While oil prices are pulling back there has been a lot of talk that as soon as prices in oil go back up  the shale producers will come back on line and crash prices again  Well not so fast  As I said before don t look for that to happen as quickly as the market believes because they are cash strapped  Mr  Koltek continued  there are  the challenges of putting rigs back on line and increasing production  My company had all the directional work on 4 rigs in North Dakota last year  Unit rigs 117  118  122 and Boss 402  and all but the last are laid down   only because 402 is on a contract  Nothing is going back anytime soon  Also  the costs and mechanics of rig mobilization without a contract are too high 
Mr  Koltek also said   One other indicator of an expected rebound in oil prices is in oilfield auctions  Just like home foreclosures  this is usually a bank forcing a liquidation to pay off debt  I bought two drilling rigs in June and August of last year at about 25 cents on the dollar  About 45 minutes after I was the winning bidder on the first rig someone representing an overseas buyer offered me  80K more than I paid for it   which I turned down  However  the past few auctions that I ve watched recently have seen final bids closer to 50 cents on the dollar  There aren t as many bottom feeding opportunities because drilling companies like mine or wholesalers expecting to flip the equipment are bidding up prices 
Tim Koltek is not alone questioning the ability of shale producers to come back on line in a significant way  Dow Jones news writes   The U S  was supposed to be the world s new swing oil producer  able to nimbly open and close the taps in response to market forces  thanks to its bounty of shale fields  But as oil prices show some signs of stabilizing  American producers and oilfield services companies are warning that they may not be able to jump start drilling  The reason  Many independent companies are too financially strapped  have let go too many workers  or have idled too much equipment to immediately ramp up again  
John Hess  the chief executive of Hess Corporation  NYSE HES  said   The balance sheets of these shale only producers have to be repaired for them to get back to drilling    That s going to curb any recovery   Just as U S  output fell more slowly than predicted   even as oil plunged from around  100 00 a barrel in 2014 to  30 00    it is likely to be slower in recuperating  even if prices rebound to  50 00 a barrel or more  some oil executives and analysts now say 
More than three dozen U S  oil and gas producers plan to cut their capital spending for 2016 by nearly half  on average  compared with last year  according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of company financial filings  Some of the largest U S  oil field services firms have laid off 110 000 people in the past year  Evercore ISI analysts estimate  and many of those workers have no plans to return to the industry  Close to 60  of the fracking equipment in the U S  has been idled during the downturn  according to IHS Energy  which estimates it would take two months for some of that equipment to return 
Still  even if prices return to levels where shale drillers can make money again  many companies are vowing to be cautious  Some are tempered by what occurred last spring when producers jumped back into drilling new wells after oil prices briefly hit  60 00 a barrel  inadvertently worsening a supply glut that ultimately made prices worse   At  40  I doubt we re going to see a lot of acceleration   said Taylor Reid  president and chief operating officer of Oasis Petroleum Inc   at an energy conference in Denver last week 
One reason output remained robust last year is that drilling and fracking wells got cheaper  Producers leaned on services companies to cut costs  and certain wells were still profitable even at lower prices  But now many companies say they have cut as much as they can 
Gas prices are on the rise  Triple A says that gas prices have jumped by 12 cents per gallon this week  which is the largest weekly increase since early March  2015  Prices increased by double digits due to a decline in gasoline supplies  relatively strong demand and continued refinery maintenance  The national average has moved higher for 18 of the past 20 days for a total of 23 cents per gallon and today s price of  1 94 per gallon is the highest average in two months  Relatively low oil costs continue to provide drivers with year over year savings at the pump and consumers are saving 50 cents per gallon compared to this same date last year

Figures 1 and 2 show the five best and worst rated ETFs and mutual funds in the sector  Not all Energy sector ETFs and mutual funds are created the same  The number of holdings varies widely  from 25 to 144   This variation creates drastically different investment implications and  therefore  ratings 
Investors should not buy any Energy ETFs or mutual funds because none get an Attractive or better rating  If you must have exposure to this sector  you should buy a basket of Attractive or better rated stocks and avoid paying undeserved fund fees  Active management has a  of not paying off

178 stocks of the 3000  we cover are classified as Energy stocks 
LyondellBasell Industries NV  NYSE LYB   LYB   88 share  is one of our favorite stocks held by CRZZX and earns a Very Attractive rating  Over the past five years  LYB has grown after tax profit    by 10  compounded annually  Over the same time period  Lyondell s return on invested capital    has improved from 17  to a top quintile 22   Additionally  over the past four years  LYB has generated a cumulative  14 8 billion in free cash flow  Despite the strength of the business  LYB is undervalued  At its current price of  88 share  LYB has a price to economic book value  PEBV  ratio of 0 8  This ratio means that the market expects LYB s NOPAT to permanently decline by 20  from current levels  If LYB can grow NOPAT by just 4  compounded annually for the next decade  the stock is worth  139 share today   a 58  upside 
Hess Corporation  NYSE HES   57 share  is one of our least favorite stocks held by IEO and earns a Dangerous rating  Contrary to GAAP net income  which has fluctuated wildly over the past decade  Hess  NOPAT has only worsened by declining from  1 7 billion in 2005 to   859 million in 2015  Over the same time period  Hess  ROIC has fallen from 11  to  2   In a large disconnect from reality  HES has risen over 50  over the past three months  which has made shares more overvalued  In order to justify its current price of  57 share  Hess must immediately achieve positive pre tax margins  from  22  in 2015  and   In this scenario  20 years from now Hess would be generating  254 billion in revenue  which would nearly equal oil giant Exxon s  NYSE XOM  2015 revenue  The expectations already embedded in HES are unrealistically high

200410,421926,HES,With Expertise And A Little Luck  East West Petroleum Reels In Profits,opinion,"Many oil companies have been devastated by the oil price debacle  East West Petroleum  on the other hand  is making money  pumping more oil and strengthening its cash balance  CEO David Sidoo tells  how shrewd joint ventures and a firm commitment to low costs have led to highly profitable wells in New Zealand and significant upside in Romania 
The Energy Report  When was East West Petroleum Corp  TO EW  founded  and where do you operate 
David Sidoo  East West was formed in 2010 on the back of the award of four exploration blocks in Romania s prolific Pannonian Basin  Following the award  we raised  30 million   30M  to fund a work program and future business development  We then entered into joint ventures on these blocks with NIS  Naftna Industrija Srbije   the Serbian subsidiary of Gazprom  MCX GAZP   NIS is committed to funding Phase 1 exploration of  60 million   60M  in exchange for 85   we retain an interest of 15  carried through to commerciality 
In 2012  East West entered New Zealand s Taranaki Basin with the award of three blocks held jointly with TAG Oil Ltd   TO TAO   Ten wells were drilled initially  and production and cash flow from New Zealand began in 2013 
TER  What was your experience before you started East West 
DS  I studied at the University of British Columbia  UBC  in Vancouver and played on its Thunderbirds football team  In 1982 we took home  for the first time  the Vanier Cup  the Canadian interuniversity championship  I then played professionally for six years in the Canadian Football League  After retiring from football in 1988  I entered the brokerage business and worked at Canaccord and Yorkton Securities for 11 years 
TER  What did you learn from football that is applicable to business 
DS  I learned that you can t build companies and achieve success on your own  You ve got to have a good team around you  That s what we ve assembled at East West  Most important  members of the team have to have strong technical knowledge  Next comes a good management squad that knows how to run a company  and has the expertise and connections to raise capital 
TER  What was your experience in oil before East West 
DS  More than a decade ago  I became involved in a company in the Pannonian Basin called Gasco Energy Inc  We secured acreage and raised over  150M  Gasco has some very good reserves and is doing well 
We then formed a company called American Oil   Gas Inc  in 2013  We worked in the prolific Bakken fields in North and South Dakota  and sold the company to Hess Corp  NYSE HES   for  630 million   630M  in 2010 
TER  What is your philosophy of building an oil company 
DS  Our model has been to enter highly prospective areas early to build a material position  and then find companies with operational capabilities that complement our technical expertise  Our goal is to complete successful partnerships and maximize value to shareholders 
As far as exploration goes  we re not interested in moose pasture  We want decent acreage in proven areas with infrastructure 
TER  How does your management team give East West a competitive advantage 
DS  We have the experience and the technical expertise  Aside from my own track record  Dr  Marc Bustin  a director who s our technical advisor  is a professor of petroleum and coal geology at UBC  He was awarded the Canadian Society of Petroleum Geologists  Stanley Slipper Gold Medal in 2013  He is world renowned and has examined source rocks all over the world  He can quickly evaluate assets when we look for new opportunities  We re agile and nimble  and we can pull the trigger quickly 
TER  What are the advantages of working in Romania and New Zealand 
DS  Both have proven histories of oil production  which significantly derisks exploration  And both offer stable political environments with attractive fiscal terms  The netbacks in Romania and New Zealand are quite high  unlike many other places in the world  Working in these countries is quite similar to working in the United States or Canada 
TER  What are the advantages of the joint venture  JV  model 
DS  It allows explorers and producers like East West to diversify and hold a larger portfolio  JVs make our money go further  By partnering with professionals in the areas we operate  we benefit from their local expertise  while they gain access to our technical team s track record and history of reviewing many different projects around the world  You can never get enough trained eyes to evaluate projects 
We have a substantial and successful history with this model  American Oil   Gas worked with Halliburton Company  NYSE HAL   This allowed us to monetize assets that were sold for  45M  which gave us the capital to develop our Bakken play 
TER  What do your partners in Romania and New Zealand bring to the table 
DS  In Romania  our partner NIS has extensive success operating in the Pannonian Basin  The company has been the leading oil producer for many decades in Serbia  which is just across the border from our southern two blocks 
In New Zealand  TAG Oil is one of the leading operators and most active drillers in the Taranaki Basin  The company has a well earned reputation in New Zealand for great community relations  We had long term relationships with senior members of their team  which greatly facilitated our deal there 
TER  How soon after you began exploration in New Zealand did you begin production 
DS  We were awarded three concessions in New Zealand in December 2012  and began drilling our first well  E1  in August 2013  nine months later  We achieved our first production by year end 2013  This was our first JV well  and it is still flowing naturally today  with little decline to date  I ll tell you something my wife always says I shouldn t say you need to be a bit lucky  Some guys have a lot of luck and do well in business  and some don t 
We re now producing about 330 barrels of oil equivalent per day  330 boe d  at a cost of about  22 per boe  and that includes all royalties  With the Brent price at about  56 per barrel   56 bbl   that makes our operations profitable  and allows us to fund the rest of this year s capital expenditure  capex  from cash flow without using any of our  8 1M cash balance  Our rapid progress in New Zealand is a testament to TAG and to the country  which is very supportive of oil and gas development 
TER  How much of your production is oil  and how much is gas 
DS  Oil is 73   27  is gas  Right now we re only selling the oil  we re flaring the gas  But in about three months  a gas pipeline will be completed  That should reduce our cost per barrel to about  18 
TER  What do you anticipate East West s year end daily production to be 
DS  We have one commitment well to drill later in 2015  Production should remain fairly steady  but we hope to raise it to perhaps 400 boe d 
TER  You announced the successful recompletion of your Cheal E2 well in mid March  How significant is that 
DS  When E2 was drilled initially  in 2013  it did not produce  So its recompletion demonstrates the technical abilities of both TAG and East West  It provides the JV with an additional 100 boe d for relatively low cost  and greatly improves our bottom line 
TER  What s the status of your Romanian operation 
DS  We are fully approved by the National Agency of Mineral Resources  Our JV has four blocks in Romania  and NIS has done seismic work to identify two drill locations on block number 7  NIS is permitting for one location as we speak  and we re hoping to drill by the end of the year 
TER  You mentioned that East West is profitable  even with Brent at  56 bbl  How low would Brent have to fall before that profitability is threatened 
DS  Breakeven for our operations is  35 bbl  That includes opex  salaries and all expenses  Today  many petroleum companies are shutting in oil wells or not completing them  They re waiting until oil rises to over  60 bbl  which is their breakeven cost  We re safe and sound now  selling at a Brent crude price even as we benefit from the weakness of the New Zealand and Canadian dollars  But when the price does rise above  60 bbl  we can start taking risks again 

We ve had people approach us for financing  but this would create dilution  so we re not interested  We re making money in New Zealand and we re carried in Romania  but the market isn t giving us any credit for the latter  We are discussing some other locations at the E site in New Zealand  but right now we re determined to focus on our bottom line and keep our general and administrative expenses low  When the market turns around and this tends to happen fast in our space we are poised to respond quickly 
TER  As you said  your cash balance is  8 1M  How much of a cash cushion would you like to maintain 
DS  I think a double digit cushion never hurts  When you ve got  0 10 share in cash in the bank  and you re building reserves  you start to look quite attractive to the market 
TER  Despite your rapid advance to production and high margins  East West trades at only  0 15 share  What are you doing to persuade the market of the value of East West 
DS  We are continuing to spread the word that we re a well capitalized company  with profitable operations at current prices and meeting our financial obligations  It is our strong belief that when you build a good company  the stock price will follow 
We were at  0 50 share with no production  now we re at  0 15 share with stable production  We ll be doing  3 4M this year at current oil prices  and we ll start selling our gas shortly  We have a strong shareholder base  and 15  of East West is owned by management  We are all shareholders here  I think there has never been a better time to buy this stock  We re derisked in New Zealand  and our cards are on the table 
TER  Where do you see your company in three years  time 
DS  We believe oil prices will likely stabilize in the next few years at  70 75 bbl  In three years  we would like to see production rise above 1 000 boe d with no further dilution  We d like to have  15 20M in the bank  We are already looking at increasing our acreage in New Zealand  Our operations in Romania should be well advanced by then  And then we ll look at acquiring a couple of other companies  bringing in partners and getting carried 
Our shareholders have been really patient in Romania  which is great because we see real upside potential there  This is where we expect to get a big win in terms of developing toward that 1 000 boe d

200429,421945,HES,Gasoline Prices On The Rise  May Pose Risk To Consumer Sentiment ,opinion,As the winter storm pounded the Northeastern United States today  gasoline futures hit another high  The March delivery contract broke  3 06  indicating that retail prices for fuel will be going up  Already prices at the pump are the highest for this time of year      Nationally  retail gasoline prices have soared 11 cents in a week and nearly 30 cents in a month to  3 57 a gallon on Friday  according to AAA  Pump prices are the highest on record for early February  and are rising the fastest along the coasts   The state wide average price of gasoline in New York is  3 92 a gallon and California gas prices on average have now surpassed the  4 a gallon mark  Increased demand from abroad  stronger crude prices  and some refinery shutdowns are all contributing to higher prices      Consumers haven t even seen the worst  with a perfect storm of factors driving higher prices   Many of the issues lifting fuel prices higher are common  but they  seem to have combined at the right time   said Matt Tormollen  president and chief executive officer at FuelQuest  a Houston based fuel management software provider   Typically at this time of year  refineries begin their switch to the more environmentally friendly summer blend gasoline and perform maintenance  which  temporarily restricts supply and drives up prices   he said   Some refineries have also announced unexpected shutdowns or closings  leading to even tighter refining capacity  said Jeff Lenard  a spokesman at the National Association of Convenience Stores  NACS   a trade group for an industry that sells 80  of the nation s gasoline   Late last month  Hess Corp  HES  1 23  said it would close its Port Reading  N J   refinery by the end of February  completing its exit from the refining business  See Jan  28 story on the rally in Hess shares  And of course the Fed s recent activities are not helping the situation either     Ultimately this trend of rising fuel prices  combined with the possibility of higher taxes in the future  constitutes the biggest risk to US consumer sentiment and spending ,2013-02-10,Sober Look,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gasoline-prices-on-the-rise;-may-pose-risk-to-consumer-sentiment-154599,154599
200432,421948,HES,The Energy Report,opinion,The Dead SpreadTrying to explain the impact of the death of Moammar Ghadfi on oil might best be described as what I guess can now be called the  Dead Spread   Oh sure  you used to be able to call it the Brent crude oil West Texas intermediate spread but the way the spread has come in since the death of the murderous dictator  I guess  The Dead Spread  might be entirely appropriate The Brent WTI spread almost became a household word in the conflict between Gaddafi loyalists and the Libyan rebels  Libyan crude is of a very high quality oil that found its nitch in Europe subbing for the production challenged North Sea brent crude  The loss of that crude created a void because European refiners accustomed to a regular flow of light crude failed to have the type of units needed to refine those heavier grades  The loss of that crude caused the Brent WTI spread to go to a record high  Now coincidentally or not  the spread has come in dramatically since Mr   Gaddafi s demise  In fact the spread has come in from an all time high of approximately  28 07 to a mere  18 97 as of this writing  With Gaddafi out of the way the hope is that Libyan oil will once again fill that void  Well early on that is even going beyond hope  Yesterday ENI told Dow Jones  that the big elephant in the room   or Libya s giant Elephant oil and gas field in Libya   could restart as early as next month and that there was  no big damage    That field  accounts for almost 25  of Libya s natural gas output  A resumption of that much oil that soon obviously could ease concerns that it will take  years  to get Libyan oil production back up to normal That not to say that there are not some tensions as Dow Jones reports of a  strike at Waha Oil Co   Libya s largest oil partnership with foreign companies  is entering its eighth week after a failure to reach an agreement over the dismissal of Gaddafi era managers  staff at the company said  Dow Jones says   Unrest at Waha  on which U S  partners Marathon Oil Corp   MRO   Hess Corp  HES  and ConocoPhillips  COP  have previously declined to comment  is part of broader strife at some oil operations  It underscores the challenges still facing the country s oil industry despite the death of former ruler Moammar Gadhafi last week  Yet at the same time the WTI has found strength as the US economy looks stronger than Europe and the decline of crude stocks at Cushing  Oklahoma  the delivery point for the Nymex WTI futures  While the world waits for Europe  data seems to suggest that the sparing over Greek haircuts  no  I am not talking about Telly Savalas  and bank rescue funds has zapped the confidence of Europe  increasing the odds of a recession It seems that market are also reacting to the spread sending light sweet crude to Europe as opposed to the formally oversupplied US  Gas and Oil Daily says   Oil stockpiles in Cushing dropped 760 000 barrels to 28 1 million  The Energy Department said last week that Cushing inventories  including floating and fixed tanks  totaled 31 1 million barrels as of October 14th  down 26  from a peak of 41 9 million on April 8th   Bloomberg News says that crude oil inventories in Cushing  Oklahoma  dropped 2 6 percent on Oct  21 from Oct  18  according to data compiled by DigitalGlobe Inc  They say that stockpiles held in floating roof tanks at the hub fell 760 000 barrels to 28 1 million  satellite images taken by the Longmont  Colorado based company show  In other words  the market forces are starting to correct the anomaly between the spread as oil is seeking higher prices  That is reducing Cushing supply and more than likely increasing European supply What is also helping is that we are seeing an increase in Nigerian exports as well  Nigeria also has the very desirable light sweet grade of crude oil  Dow Jones says that Nigeria will export 7 950 000 barrel cargos of Bonny Light in December  one more cargo than in November  They report a total of 214 516 barrels a day of QuaIboe crude will be available in December  compared with 157 000 barrels a day in November  the program shows  This should put more pressure on  The Dead Spread  as well  It also put the WTI market in backwardation for the first time since the financial crisis began  It seems that the market is worried that with all the oil ending up in Europe  supplies may tighten in the US  It is also showing a vote of confidence in the US economic growth outlook or at least a more pessimistic outlook for Europe Also with oil on fire yesterday William Dudley of the Fed  fed into the flames talking about QE3D  QE is bullish for oil and with the Dead spread out of whack we could see WTI try to attract supply  While WTI flies gas prices were mute as the Brent crude should help US imports of products  Mr  Dudley is sending a signal to the market that QE is back in play and most likely will be in the form of printing money to buy back mortgage backed securities  Very bullish for WTI oil The Energy Information Agency has some good news I suppose  They said that the national average retail price of regular gasoline is down 1 4c to  3 462 a gallon  Yahoo  Now not that I want to ruin that god feeling you had but they also want to remind you that prices are still 64 5c a gallon  or 22 9   higher than they were a year ago Want some news that might warm your heart   Reuters News points out that the average of the first 12 months of New York Mercantile Exchange natural gas futures contracts slid to its lowest in nine years on Monday as growing supplies and moderate weather weighed on the complex  The 12 month futures fell 2 3 cents to settle at  3 923 per million British Thermal Units  the lowest settle since Nov  15  2002  when the average closed at  3 926  Reuters data showed  Despite record heat this summer that drove NYMEX front month gas to its 2011 peak near  5  record high  gas production  primarily from shale  has been the main factor  pressuring price expectations ,2011-10-25,PFGBest Forex,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-energy-report-103507,103507
