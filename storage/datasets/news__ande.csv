value investing manual for investing advice That manual is Benjamin Graham s The Intelligent Investor which was first published in 1949 and updated by Jason Zweig for a new generation of investors  after Graham s death  in 2006 Benjamin Graham is long considered to be the father of value investing and was once the boss  and mentor  of Warren Buffett How can value investors be  intelligent  investors with the stock market raging higher Two Types of InvestorsGraham lays out the scenario in which there are two types of investing 1        Timing  which is when you anticipate the action of the stock market  He warns that this is when an investor can become a speculator 2        Pricing  which is when you attempt to buy stocks when they are quoted below their fair value Do you think you can time the top of a bull market Can the Dow Theory Strategy Help You Market Time Graham investigates one of the older stock timing strategies  The Dow Theory This strategy is over 100 years old  It sends out a buy signal when the Dow Transportation Index and the Dow Industrial Index both hit new highs  The thinking goes  that something good must be going on in the US economy if both of those indexes are breaking out at the same time It sends out a sell signal when they both break down at the same time as well It got its credentials during the Great Depression because  according to Graham  it correctly sent a sell signal a month before the market crash in 1929 and then correctly sent a market buy signal in 1933  after the Dow had finished selling off But how was its later track record The Dow Theory doesn t do so well during secular bull markets like those of the 1950s and 1960s because stocks keep rising during those markets So even if you sell  on a sell signal  and buy back in later  you were almost always getting in at a higher price Just Buy Cheap StocksIf you can t market time  Graham suggests using the  pricing  method to buy stocks  If you re buying a stock below fair

21757,243272,ANDE,Exclusive  Vomitoxin makes nasty appearance for U S  farm sector,news,By P J  Huffstutter and Michael Hirtzer CHICAGO  Reuters    A fungus that causes  vomitoxin  has been found in some U S  corn harvested last year  forcing poultry and pork farmers to test their grain  and giving headaches to grain growers already wrestling with massive supplies and low prices  The plant toxin sickens livestock and can also make humans and pets fall ill  The appearance of vomitoxin and other toxins produced by fungi is affecting ethanol markets and prompting grain processors to seek alternative sources of feed supplies  Researchers at the U S  Department of Agriculture first isolated the toxin in 1973 after an unusually wet winter in the Midwest  The compound was given what researchers described as the  trivial name  vomitoxin because pigs were refusing to eat the infected corn or vomiting after consuming it  The U S  Corn Belt had earlier outbreaks of infection from the toxin in 1966 and 1928  A vessel carrying a shipment of corn from Paraguay is due next month at a North Carolina port used by Smithfield Foods Inc  SFII UL   HK 0288   the world s largest pork producer   The spread of vomitoxin is concentrated in Indiana  Wisconsin  Ohio  and parts of Iowa and Michigan  and its full impact is not yet known  according to state officials and data gathered by food testing firm  Neogen Corp    O NEOG  In Indiana  40 of 92 counties had at least one load of corn harvested last fall that has tested positive for vomitoxin  according to the Office of Indiana State Chemist s county survey  In 2015 and 2014  no more than four counties saw grain affected by the fungus   And in a  considerable  share of corn crops tested in Michigan  Wisconsin and Indiana since last fall s harvest  the vomitoxin levels have tested high enough to be considered too toxic for humans  pets  hogs  chickens and dairy cattle  according to public and private data compiled by Neogen  The company did not state what percent of each state s corn crop was tested  Smithfield would not confirm it had ordered the corn from Paraguay  but two independent grain trading sources said Smithfield was the likely buyer  A company source said corn Smithfield has brought in from Indiana and Ohio  to feed pigs in North Carolina  has been  horrible quality  due to the presence of mycotoxins   TOXIN LEVELS  The U S  Food and Drug Administration allows vomitoxin levels of up to 1 part per million  ppm  in human and pet foods and recommends levels under 5 ppm in grain for hogs  10 ppm for chickens and dairy cattle  Beef cattle can withstand toxin levels up to 30 ppm  Alltech Inc  a Kentucky based feed supplement company  said 73 percent of feed samples it has tested this year have vomitoxin  The company analyzed samples sent by farmers whose animals have fallen ill    We know there is lots of bad corn out there  because corn byproducts keep getting worse   said Max Hawkins  a nutritionist with Alltech   Neogen  which sells grain testing supplies  reported a 29 percent jump in global sales for toxin tests   with strong demand for vomitoxin tests   in their fiscal third quarter  ending Feb  28    We re polling our customers and continually talking to them about the levels they re seeing  Those levels are not going down   said Pat Frasco  director of sales for Neogen s milling  grain and pet food business   The problem  stemming from heavy rain before and during the 2016 harvest  prompted farmers to store wet grain  said farmers  ethanol makers and grain inspectors  The issue was compounded by farmers and grain elevators storing corn on the ground and other improvised spaces  sometimes covering the grain piles with plastic tarps  Grain buyers say they will have a clearer picture of the problem later this spring  as more farm stored grain is moved to market  Iowa State University grain quality expert Charles Hurburgh said the sheer size of the harvest in 2016   the largest in U S  history   complicates the job of managing toxins in grain  especially in the core Midwest   Mycotoxins are very hard to handle in high volume   he said   You can t test every truckload  or if you do  you are only going to unload 20 trucks in a day   By comparison  corn processors in Iowa unload 400 or more trucks a day   BIOFUEL IMPACTS Ethanol makers already are feeling the impact  Turning corn into ethanol creates a byproduct called distillers dried grains  DDGs   which is sold as animal feed  With fuel prices low  the DDGs can boost profitability   But the refining process triples the concentration of mycotoxins  making the feed byproduct less attractive  DDG prices in Indiana fell to  92 50 per ton in February  the lowest since 2009  and now are selling for  97 50 per ton  according to USDA  Many ethanol plants are testing nearly every load of corn they receive for the presence of vomitoxin  said Indiana grain inspector Doug Titus  whose company has labs at  The Andersons  Inc  O ANDE   a grain handler  and energy company  Valero Energy   VLO  sites   The Andersons in a February call with analysts said vomitoxin has hurt results at three of its refineries in the eastern U S   That will be with us for some time   Andersons  chief executive Pat Bowe said  Missouri grain farmer Doug Roth  who put grain into storage after last year s wet harvest  has seen a few loads of corn rejected by clients who make pet food after the grain tested positive for low levels of fumonisin  a type of mycotoxin  Roth said he paid to reroute the grain to livestock producers in Arkansas  who planned to blend it with unaffected grain in order to mitigate the effect of the toxins    As long as this doesn t become a widespread problem  we re all fine   said Roth  who said toxins have shown up in less than 1 percent of the grain loads he has sold  U S  farmers with clean corn are reaping a price bump  A Cardinal Ethanol plant in Union City  Indiana  is offering grain sellers a 10 cent per bushel premium for corn with less than one part per million  ppm  or less of vomitoxin in it  according to the company s website

21767,243282,ANDE,Grain glut leaves U S  farmers facing losses from specialty corn,news,"By Michael Hirtzer CHICAGO  Reuters    U S  farmers who sought to boost revenues by planting corn used to make tortillas may be forced to sell their crops at a loss to makers of ethanol or animal feed because of a glut of what typically is a human food grade product  Oversupply of the most common grains such as corn and soybeans has spread to niche markets because so many farmers have switched to planting different strains of seed to diversify and bolster returns after four years of bumper crops cut farm income and pushed down prices for staple grains   White corn  which makes up roughly 1 percent of the 14 6 billion bushel U S  corn harvest  can command a premium of as much as  1 per bushel over the commoditized yellow strain  But premiums have shriveled to four year lows   to as little as 5 cents above Chicago Board of Trade corn futures  Cc1   Too many farmers planted white corn in states such as Illinois  Illinois  Kentucky and Nebraska  Corn prices in 2017 declined for the fifth straight year and record large U S  stocks pushed growers to look for potentially higher value alternatives  However  as acres devoted to varieties such as white corn  organic and non genetically modified corn continue to rise  the benefits have shrunk for farmers switching to such strains  White corn is used by companies such as the PepsiCo Inc  O PEP  unit Frito Lay to make corn chips  and by tortilla and chip makers including Chicago based Azteca Foods  In South Africa  it is eaten as part of the breakfast staple pap and in Colombia and Venezuela in patties known as arepas  Randy Anderson  who has planted white corn for 10 straight years in southern Illinois  said the market has become crowded  Local elevators  such as a  Bunge  Ltd  N BG  facility that loads grain barges on the Ohio River  are buying white corn at prices that are below his cost of production   I feel like there could be a better bid in the near future   Anderson said  adding that he was holding out for another 20 cents per bushel to bring him closer to eking out a profit  Premiums for white corn in the United States surged in 2015 and 2016 because of a drought reduced South African harvest that led to increased U S  exports and more demand from Mexico  which also shipped white corn to South Africa  But with supplies in South Africa once again abundant following a record large corn harvest  there is more global supply than demand   Anderson  who sold some white corn in 2016 at a 90 cent premium to CBOT futures  now can sell about 10 cents above futures   This year  we are getting the same price for white corn as yellow corn   he said  CBOT March corn futures  CH8  settled a 1 4 cent lower at  3 48 3 4 per bushel  just above the contract s lifetime low of  3 46 3 4  reached in December  Since the white corn growing region is centralized in a few U S  states  the variety can be prone to more severe price fluctuations than the more widely grown yellow strain  Roger Theisen  specialty corn manager in DowDuPont Inc s  N DWDP  agriculture division  said in an email   This means a single weather event can have a significant impact on white corn production in an area   he said  DowDuPont has as much as a 90 percent market share of the global white corn seed market  according to industry sources  The company declined to comment on sales or market share but Theisen said   the total food corn market is growing   Exports of U S  white corn through November of 1 48 million tonnes were down about 10 percent from 2016 s corresponding total of 1 63 million tonnes  according to U S  Department of Agriculture data  The value of those sales declined to  312 million  from  367 million in 2016   And there are signs that 2018 could see a further decline  South Africa is likely to return to its status as a net exporter  limiting demand for U S  shipments  said Max Thomas Olson  an analyst at Global Risk Management  which publishes the Orville Fisher White Corn Newsletter  Ben Scholl  president of specialty grain buyer Lewis B  Osterbur and Associates  said many of his farmer clients are looking for places to sell their white corn   End users have all they need and there s more available to buy   Scholl said  Reed White  a 56 year old farmer in Sturgis  Kentucky  said this spring he will plant no white corn for the first time in recent memory  He was not able to secure a big enough contract to supply white corn to a local tortilla maker and will instead plant only yellow corn   If we could get a larger chunk of that business  we might consider growing for them   he said   Grain handler Andersons Inc  O ANDE   a Frito Lay supplier  said it has a waiting list for farmers interested in growing white corn or other specialty varieties for the company

21774,243289,ANDE,Harvesting in a trade war  U S  crops rot as storage costs soar,news,"By Mark Weinraub and P J  Huffstutter  Reuters    U S  farmers finishing their harvests are facing a big problem   where to put the mountain of grain they cannot sell to Chinese buyers  For Louisiana farmer Richard Fontenot and his neighbors  the solution was a costly one  Let the crops rot  Fontenot plowed under 1 000 of his 1 700 soybean acres this fall  chopping plants into the dirt instead of harvesting more than  300 000 worth of beans  His beans were damaged by bad weather  made worse by a wet harvest  Normally  he could sell them anyway to a local elevator   giant silos usually run by international grains merchants that store grain  But this year they aren t buying as much damaged grain  The elevators are already chock full   No one wants them   Fontenot said in a telephone interview  As he spoke  he drove his tractor across a soybean field  tilling under his crop   I don t know what else to do   Across the United States  grain farmers are plowing under crops  leaving them to rot or piling them on the ground  in hopes of better prices next year  according to interviews with more than two dozen farmers  academic researchers and farm lenders  It s one of the results  they say  of a U S  trade war with China that has sharply hurt export demand and swamped storage facilities with excess grain   In Louisiana  up to 15 percent of the oilseed crop is being plowed under or is too damaged to market  according to data analyzed by Louisiana State University staff  Crops are going to waste in parts of Mississippi and Arkansas  Grain piles  dusted by snow  sit on the ground in North and South Dakota  And in Illinois and Indiana  some farmers are struggling to protect silo bags stuffed with crops from animals  U S  farmers planted 89 1 million acres of soybeans this year  the second most ever  expecting China s rising demand to give them better returns than other bulk crops  But Beijing slapped a 25 percent tariff on U S  soybeans in retaliation for duties imposed by Washington on Chinese exports  That effectively shut down U S  soybean exports to China  worth around  12 billion last year  China typically takes around 60 percent of U S  supplies  The U S  government rolled out an aid program of around the same size    12 billion   to help farmers absorb the cost of the trade war  As of mid November   837 8 million had been paid out   Some of that money will pass from farmers to grain merchants such as Archer Daniels Midland Co  N ADM  and  Bunge  Ltd  N BG   who are charging farmers more to store crops at elevators where there is limited space  Bunge and ADM did not respond to requests for comment on storage fees  The storage crunch and higher fees have boosted revenues at grain elevator Andersons  ANDE O   Chief Executive Officer Pat Bowe said in an interview   It s paying a grain handler to store   it s the old fashioned way to make money   Bowe said  These are also boom times for John Wierenga  president of grain storage bag retailer Neeralta  Sales of their bags   white tubes up to 300 feet now littering Midwest fields   are up 30 percent from a year ago   The demand has been huge   Wierenga said   We are sold out   HIGHER FEES Farmers are feeling the pinch  Those in central Illinois could pay up to 40 percent more than in previous years to store crops over the coming weeks  agricultural consultant Matt Bennett estimated  That amounts to between 3 cents to 6 cents a bushel  Bennett said  a painful expense for a crop that was already expected to deliver little income to farmers  Storage rates are swinging wildly  depending on the elevator location  Grain dealers at rivers typically charge more than their inland counterparts because they are more dependent on export markets   At some Midwest river terminals  farmers were paying 60 cents a bushel to store soybeans until the end of the year   more than twice as much as a year ago  Some commercial terminals are charging farmers to just drop off their soybeans   The trade war has only exacerbated the strain on storage  which has been a persistent problem in recent years due largely to a worldwide oversupply of grains  Even before this fall s harvest  around 20 percent of total grain storage available in the U S  was full with corn  soybeans and wheat from previous harvests  according to the U S  Department of Agriculture  That was the highest in 12 years for this time of year   Some grain merchants are also charging additional fees for farmers who deliver less than perfect soybeans  said Russell Altom  a soybean farmer and senior vice president of agricultural lending at Relyance Bank in Pine Bluff  Arkansas   I ve never seen things this bad   Altom said   I know several farmers who hired lawyers  to see if they can sue over the pricing and fees issues   Eric Maupin  a farmer in Newbern  Tennessee  said he was facing so called dockage rates of between 60 cents at  1 20 per bushels at Bunge Elevators in his area   more than three times as high as a year ago   Damage can be anything   a split bean  one that s too small  one that s too big   whatever   Maupin said  Some farmers are pulling farm equipment out of barns to make room for the overflow of grains   After packing nearly half a million bushels of corn and soybeans in their usual steel bins  Terry Honselman and his family found some additional space in 35 year old shed on their Casey  Illinois  farm  Most years  the building protects farm equipment and bags of seed  Now  it is stuffed with 75 000 bushels of corn  
Like others  Honselman is banking on a resolution to the trade war before this spring   when he says he will need the space back for his planting supplies ",2018-11-21,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/harvesting-in-a-trade-war-us-crops-rot-as-storage-costs-soar-1696182,1696182
21775,243290,ANDE,Pre IPO Coverage  Tilray  Inc   TLRY ,opinion,"Tilray Inc  NASDAQ TLRY   Canadian marijuana producer and processor  will IPO on Thursday  June 19  At a price range of  14 to  16 per share  the company plans to raise up to  144 million and has an expected market cap of   1 4 billion  At the midpoint of its price range  TLRY currently earns our Unattractive rating 
Tilray looks to capitalize on growing support for the legalization of marijuana usage  30 states in the U S  have some form of legal marijuana and Canada recently approved a bill to legalize recreational usage  which would make it the first Group of Seven nation to legalize cannabis  Is Tilray s IPO coming at the perfect time  or are the expectations baked into the stock price already too optimistic 
This report aims to help investors sort through Tilray s financial filings to understand the fundamentals and valuation of this IPO 
GAAP Net Income Hides Growing Losses
TLRY earns revenues by through selling finished cannabis products direct to consumers and through pharmaceutical distributors  The company notes it harvested 6 779 kilos of cannabis in 2017  which is up from 4 526 kilos in 2016  It also notes its products are available through a division of Novartis pharmacies in Canada and also available in Germany  Argentina  Australia  Brazil  Chile  Croatia  Cyprus  the Czech Republic  New Zealand  and South Africa 
At first glance  TLRY s GAAP net loss shrunk ever so slightly from   7 9 million in 2016 to   7 8 million in 2017  However  after tax operating profit  NOPAT  fell from   6 8 million to   7 3 million over the same time 
Figure 1  TLRY GAAP Net Income and NOPAT Since 2016

Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings
Non operating items overstated TLRY s GAAP losses in 2017  which caused the appearance of shrinking losses versus NOPAT  We remove both non operating income and expense when calculating NOPAT to get at the true recurring profits of the business 
In 2016  Robo Analyst 1  uncovered non operating items  such as 

 0 2 million  2  of revenue  in inventory write downs
 0 8 million  6  of revenue  in reported non operating expenses

After these adjustments  we removed net  1 1 million in non operating expenses in 2016  which resulted in net operating loss after tax being 14  less than GAAP net loss  This overstated GAAP net loss in 2016 created an easier comp in 2017  which allowed TLRY to report shrinking losses while the true recurring profits of the business worsened 
With only two years of history  it s hard to draw any firm conclusions about the long term trend in profitability for TLRY  but our adjustments show that growing losses are masked by GAAP numbers 
Investors Betting on Continued Regulatory Approval Worldwide 
As Tilray points out in its S 1  the world is in the middle of a paradigm shift regarding cannabis  from a state of prohibition to one of legalization  Such a shift would represent significant opportunity for a firm with proven production and distribution platforms  The United Nations estimates the total market  including illegal sales  could be worth up to  150 billion annually  with only 3 8  of the adult population currently using cannabis products 
Furthermore  Tilray notes that while still heavily regulated  medical marijuana is authorized in 29 countries  25 countries alone have introduced significant reforms to their cannabis use laws since 2015  This shift has allowed Tilray to rapidly grow its revenues  and investors getting in on the IPO are betting such regulatory easing continues 
Expense Growth Must be Contained to Reach Profitability
Despite impressive revenue growth  Tilray s expenses grew even faster in 2017  This trend must be reversed for the firm to achieve long term profitability  In 2017  revenue grew 62  year over year  YoY   which is certainly indicative of the growth potential of the business  However  research   development  sales   marketing  and general   administrative costs grew 179   99  and 71  YoY respectively 
The only place where Tilray is seeing economies of scale is in production  Its average cost per gram sold declined from  4 04 in 2016 to  2 84 in 2017  These declining costs helped the company more than double its gross margin  from 21  to 55  
Easing regulations  such as in the United States  estimated to generate  22 billion in marijuana sales by 2022   could be the opportunity for Tilray to truly capitalize on its first mover advantage in the cannabis market  It already has an e commerce platform within Canada  which could help in getting similar approvals in other countries  Similarly  it was the first company to legally export medical cannabis from North America to Africa  Australia  Europe  and South America 
These distribution channels could be a long term advantage for the company  but the costs associated with them also cancel out many of the benefits of improved production efficiency in the near term 
TLRY Looks Undervalued by Traditional Metrics 
Figure 2 shows the price to sales ratio for other publicly traded cannabis related companies  As can be seen  TLRY s price to sales ratio is actually below many peer firms  However  it is worth noting that each of these firms looks vastly overvalued relative to the overall market  S P 500   which has a price to sales ratio of 2 2

Our Discounted Cash Flow Model Reveals TLRY is Overvalued
When we analyze the cash flow expectations baked into the stock price  we find that TLRY is overvalued at the midpoint of its IPO  despite what traditional metrics show  Our dynamic DCF model quantifies exactly what kind of future cash flows the market price of a stock implies a company will generate 
To justify the midpoint IPO price of  15 share  TLRY must immediately achieve 6  NOPAT margins  comparable to the average of other agriculture farming companies such as Fresh Del Monte Produce Inc  NYSE FDP   Calavo Growers Inc  NASDAQ CVGW   The Andersons Inc  NASDAQ ANDE   and Limoneira Co  NASDAQ LMNR   and grow revenue by 45  compounded annually for the next 13 years  See the math behind this dynamic DCF scenario  For reference  TLRY s NOPAT margin was  35  in 2017 so this scenario implies immediate and drastic improvements in profitability 
Even if we assume TLRY can earn higher margins  due to cannabis being more valuable than standard crops  the stock still holds significant downside  If we assume TLRY can achieve a 10  NOPAT margin and grow revenue by 40  compounded annually for the next decade  the stock is worth just  6 share today   a 60  downside from the IPO midpoint  See the math behind this dynamic DCF scenario 
Share Class Structure Leaves Little Power for Investors
Tilray plans to list shares using a dual class structure  something we ve seen from the likes of previous IPO s Snap Inc  NYSE SNAP  and Dropbox Inc  NASDAQ DBX   Class 2 stock  which is being sold in the IPO  will grant investors one vote per share  Class 1 stock  which is owned entirely by Privateer Holdings  will receive three votes per share owned  This structure gives Privateer Holdings 93  of the voting power post IPO  and Tilray will be a  controlled company  under the definition provided by the rules of NASDAQ listings 
This concentrated voting power means investors have little say on important matters  particularly in an industry that could see significant regulatory change and upheaval in years to come  While we ve certainly seen worse corporate governance when it comes to voting rights  TLRY s voting structure remains a red flag 
Critical Details Found in Financial Filings by Our Robo Analyst Technology
As investors focus more on fundamental research  research automation technology is needed to analyze all the critical financial details in financial filings  Below are specifics on the adjustments 2  we make based on Robo Analyst findings in Tilray s 2017 S 1 
Income Statement  we made  3 million of adjustments  with a net effect of removing  1 million in non operating expense  5  of revenue   We removed  1 million in non operating income and  2 million in non operating expenses  You can see all the adjustments made to TLRY s income statement here 
Balance Sheet  we made  54 million of adjustments to calculate invested capital with a net increase of  32 million  The most notable adjustment was  4 million in other comprehensive income  This adjustment represented 104  of reported net assets  You can see all the adjustments made to TLRY s balance sheet here 
Valuation  we made  56 million of adjustments with a net effect of decreasing shareholder value by  56 million  There were no adjustments that increased shareholder value  Apart from  51 million in total debt  the largest adjustment to shareholder value was  5 million in outstanding employee stock options  This option adjustment represents less than 1  of TLRY s proposed market cap

21780,243295,ANDE,5 US Farm Stocks To Reap Benefits From US China Phase 1 Deal,opinion,After nearly two years of trade tiff  the United States and China finally signed the phase one trade agreement on Jan 15 at Washington  Per the deal  the United States will roll back some tariffs and China will in return boost its purchase of U S  goods and services This deal is a boon for American farmers as they are among the hardest hit by the trade war China to Purchase Additional Farm ProductsThe U S  China phase one deal includes China s commitment to buy agricultural products  airplanes  pharmaceuticals  and oil and gas over the next two years  worth at least an additional  200 billion  This is markedly better than China s baseline purchase of  186 billion in 2017 and would surely spur demand for American farm goods Moreover  China is also making changes to its agricultural policy and removing certain health standards that it had introduced to block a variety of American agricultural produce  Additionally  Chinese administration is relaxing licensing  inspection and registration rules that were trade barricades for America  These changes should provide easy access to meat  poultry  pet food  seafood  animal feed  baby formula  dairy and biotech products in the Chinese market Looking back  when the trade war started in 2018  agricultural exports to China dropped by about  21 billion  Even after slight easing in 2019  export levels remained far below the 2017 level of  19 5 billion  Now  with the agreement in play  China will have to purchase an additional  12 5 billion and  19 5 billion  respectively  of U S  agricultural products from the 2017 baseline in 2020 and 2021 Moreover  as negotiators from both countries continue talks to reach a second phase deal

Every week  Tracey Ryniec  the editor of Zacks   shares some of her top value investing tips and stock picks 
With stocks still hitting new all time highs  and Tesla  NASDAQ TSLA  and Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  off to the races  it s time for value investors to tap the value investing manual for investing advice 
That manual is Benjamin Graham s The Intelligent Investor which was first published in 1949 and updated by Jason Zweig for a new generation of investors  after Graham s death  in 2006 
Benjamin Graham is long considered to be the father of value investing and was once the boss  and mentor  of Warren Buffett 
How can value investors be  intelligent  investors with the stock market raging higher 
Two Types of Investors
Graham lays out the scenario in which there are two types of investing 
1        Timing  which is when you anticipate the action of the stock market  He warns that this is when an investor can become a speculator 
2        Pricing  which is when you attempt to buy stocks when they are quoted below their fair value 
Do you think you can time the top of a bull market 
Can the Dow Theory Strategy Help You Market Time 
Graham investigates one of the older stock timing strategies  The Dow Theory 
This strategy is over 100 years old  It sends out a buy signal when the Dow Transportation Index and the Dow Industrial Index both hit new highs  The thinking goes  that something good must be going on in the US economy if both of those indexes are breaking out at the same time 
It sends out a sell signal when they both break down at the same time as well 
It got its credentials during the Great Depression because  according to Graham  it correctly sent a sell signal a month before the market crash in 1929 and then correctly sent a market buy signal in 1933  after the Dow had finished selling off 
But how was its later track record 
The Dow Theory doesn t do so well during secular bull markets like those of the 1950s and 1960s because stocks keep rising during those markets 
So even if you sell  on a sell signal  and buy back in later  you were almost always getting in at a higher price 
Just Buy Cheap Stocks
If you can t market time  Graham suggests using the  pricing  method to buy stocks  If you re buying a stock below fair value  and a market sell off or crash happens  you re already ahead of the game

21826,243341,ANDE,Zacks com Highlights  Centene  Andersons  Builders FirstSource  United Continental Holdings And Dillard s,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   Feb 28  2018   Stocks in this week s article include  Centene Corporation   NYSE CNC    The Andersons  Inc    NASDAQ ANDE    Builders FirstSource  Inc    NASDAQ BLDR    United Continental Holdings  Inc    NYSE UAL   and Dillard s  Inc    NYSE DDS   Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research 5 Stocks to Bet on Following Recent Broker UpgradesWe are at the tail end of the Q4 earnings season with the majority of the companies having already unveiled their quarterly financial numbers  The picture that has emerged so far is an extremely healthy one   The earnings season remains on track to end on a strong note  displaying substantial growth  A high proportion of companies have reported better than expected earnings per share in the current reporting cycle Generally  an earnings beat leads to stock price appreciation   In such a highly bullish scenario  investors tend to add outperformers to their respective portfolios for healthy returns However  with a deluge of earnings reports flooding the market during the reporting cycle  pinpointing outperformers is by no means an easy task for individual investors  In the absence of proper guidance  identifying a winning stock is akin to searching for  a needle in a haystack   for an investor  The proper guidance  in this respect  comes from brokers  who are deemed to be experts  equipped with vast knowledge and know how as far the field of investing is concerned Of the three types of brokers analysts  sell side  buy side and independent  present in the investment world  sell side analysts are most common  Various brokerage firms employ them to provide unbiased opinion to investors after thorough research  Buy side analysts are employed by hedge funds  mutual funds etc  while the independent ones simply sell their reports to investors Why Such Advice Is InvaluableBrokers  irrespective of their types  undertake thorough research of the stocks covered by them  They have at their disposal a lot more information on a company and its prospects than individual investors To attain their objective  they go through minute details of the publicly available financial documents apart from attending company conference calls and other presentations  Consequently  the opinion of brokers should act as a valuable guide for investors while deciding their course of action  buy  sell or hold  on a particular stock Earnings Estimates Revisions  A Key PointerSince brokers follow the stocks in their coverage minutely  they revise their earnings estimates after carefully examining the pros and cons of an event for the concerned company  In fact  a rating upgrade or downgrade by brokers has the potential to immediately influence the price of the stock Since brokers arrive at their recommendation on a stock after thoroughly analyzing the nitty gritty associated with the company  it is natural that if investors see them improving their recommendation on a particular stock  they are inclined to believe that there is a solid reason logic behind it  In fact  a rating upgrade generally leads to stock price appreciation  Similarly  the price of a stock may plummet following a rating downgrade Estimates can move north for a number of reasons   favorable earnings performance  a bullish guidance  product launch or a favorable macro scenario   Making the Most of Broker OpinionsThe above write up clearly suggests that by following broker actions  one can arrive at a winning portfolio of stocks  Keeping this in mind  we have designed a screen to shortlist stocks based on improving analyst recommendation and upward revisions to earnings estimates over the last four weeks  Also  since the price sales ratio is a strong complementary valuation metric in the presence of analyst information  it has been included  The price sales ratio takes care of the company s top line  making the strategy foolproof And that s what we re screening for today For the rest of this Screen of the Week article please visit Zacks com at  Get the

21914,243429,ANDE,Thor Industries  Andersons  Avid Technology  Marvell Technology And Splunk As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   December 1  2017    highlights Thor Industries  Inc    NYSE THO   as the Bull of the Day and The Andersons  Inc    NASDAQ ANDE   as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Avid Technology  Inc    NASDAQ AVID    Marvell Technology Group Ltd    NASDAQ MRVL   and Splunk  Inc    NASDAQ SPLK   Here is a synopsis of all five stocks   Thor Industries  Inc  is riding the demand for RVs and towables to new records  This Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  just posted its best quarterly revenue and profitability in the Company s history Thor is the world s largest RV manufacturer in the world  Headquartered in Indiana  it makes RVs and towables under the popular brand names of Airstream and Jayco  among others Another Big Beat in Fiscal Q1On Nov 27  Thor reported its fiscal first quarter results and crushed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 63 cents  or 35   Earnings were  2 43 versus the consensus of just  1 80 It was the third straight beat in a row Revenue was an all time quarterly record of  2 23 billion as gross profit margins rose to 14 9  from 13 9  a year ago Towable RV sales jumped 33 7  to  1 62 billion from  1 2 billion a year ago driven by strong demand for more affordably priced travel trailers Towable backlog jumped 75 2  to  2 46 billion from  1 4 billion a year ago due to strong momentum in the industry for its travel trailers in advance of the calendar 2018 selling season On the motorized RV side  first quarter sales gained 22 8  to  566 6 million from  461 5 million a year ago  It saw growth in the moderately priced Class A and Class C motorhomes  particularly in Class C  which are smaller motorhomes  Both are in demand from its dealers and consumers The motorized RV backlog jumped 59 1  to  1 12 billion from  706 4 billion in the year ago period due to continued robust demand for its smaller gas Class A and Class C motorhomes Will the Good Times Last in 2018 This has been a record time for the RV makers as it has seen growth due to the Baby Boomers retiring  with their stock portfolios at record highs  along with demand for the towables from Generation X and Millennials who are buying to travel into the national and state parks The strong stock and housing markets have likely helped towable sales as well Industry demand remains  exceedingly strong   Thor has been adding production to keep up with demand  The Andersons  Inc is in the one sector that still isn t seeing economic improvement  agribusiness  This Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  is still struggling as the fertilizer market remains weak The Andersons was founded in 1947 by Harold Anderson in Maumee  Ohio with a single grain elevator  It has grown into an agribusiness company with numerous business segments across North America  including in grain  ethanol  plant nutrient and rail Making Changes in LeadershipOn Nov 28  The Andersons announced that its President of the Rail Group  Rasesh Shah  would retire in July 2018 He s to be replaced by Joseph McNeely  who would be familiar to railroad car investors as he was CEO of FreightCar America  which makes a diverse group of different railcars This announcement comes shortly after announcing that Jeffrey Blair would join the company as President of the Plant Nutrient Group effective Dec 4 due to the retirement of Bill Wolf in that position That is two high profile management changes in two of its four business segments during the same month Third Quarter Earnings MissOn Nov 6  The Andersons reported third quarter results and missed on the Zacks Consensus by 7 cents  Earnings were  0 09 versus the Zacks Consensus of  0 16 It was the second consecutive earnings miss for the company The quarter was mixed  with some segments seeing more improvement than others It sold two of its former retail properties so that it could exit the retail business completely But its Grain Group business saw better year over year results with good margins on corn and soybean sales and strong space margins for wheat However  the Plant Nutrient Group saw a pretax loss of  7 9 million as there is simply too much fertilizer on the market and the farmers  who are still struggling under falling income  aren t buying The Rail Group was also mixed in the quarter  as it saw improvement but the overall market still remains soft It s not a surprise that it s seeing management changes in its two weakest areas Estimates Cut AgainThe analysts continue to be pessimistic about 2017 and 2018  although the earnings  low  looks to have been in 2016 The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 has fallen to  1 08 from  1 41 in the last 60 days One estimate was also cut for 2018 which has sent the Zacks Consensus Estimate falling to  1 83 from  2 33 in the last month Additional content 3 Buy Ranked Tech Stocks that

22006,243521,ANDE,What s In Store For Westlake Chemical s  WLK  Q3 Earnings ,opinion,"Westlake Chemical Corp    NYSE WLK   is set to report earnings for the third quarter of 2016 before the market opens on Nov 8  In the last quarter  the company reported adjusted net income of  1 21 per diluted share  Earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 95 cents  providing a positive surprise of 27 37   Also  net sales of  1 086 million for the quarter surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate  recording a positive surprise of 5 08   However  net sales fell 8 3  year over year  Westlake Chemical s performance deteriorated year over year due to lower production  unabsorbed fixed manufacturing costs as well as lower sales price of all its major products  This was partly offset by lower feedstock and energy costs as well as higher margins in Europe Let s take a look at how things are shaping up for the forthcoming announcement  WESTLAKE CHEM Price and EPS Surprise

Growth Factors this Quarter
Rise in programming costs due to higher sports rights deals  World Cup  NLF  Major League Basketball and college football rights and SEC Network Launch  are the near term headwinds that are likely to prove a drag on Disney s quarterly performance  Moreover  the unfavorable impact from currency fluctuations is an added concern  However  the impact of Easter that fell in the third quarter should boost the performance of Parks and Resorts segment  Also  the roaring success of Frozen should continue to enhance profitability at both Studio Entertainment and Consumer Products segments  In the latest development  Disney has signed a multi year distribution agreement with The National Cable Television Cooperative  NCTC  to relay best quality sports  news and entertainment content to the customers of NCTC members across Television  smartphones  computers  gaming consoles  tablets and other connected devices 
Earnings Whispers

Factors Affecting This Quarter
Though the company s fourth quarter fiscal 2014 results were strong  it projects a slowdown in sales growth and a decline in margins in the first quarter as well as for fiscal 2015  The company highlighted that the weak forward outlook was mainly due to increased investments toward enhancement of its global retail operations and infrastructure as well as higher capital allotments to augment advertising and marketing 
For the first quarter the company expects net revenue to increase 3  5   much lower than the growth of 13 6  registered in the fourth quarter fiscal 2014  Operating margin is anticipated to contract in the range of 300 350 bps from the year ago level 
Earnings Whispers 
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Ralph Lauren is likely to beat earnings this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  and a Zacks Rank of  1  2 or 3 for this to happen  This is not the case here as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  Ralph Lauren currently has an Earnings ESP of 0 00   This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at  1 75 a share  which is in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate

22058,243573,ANDE,Andersons  ANDE  Incurs Loss In Q1  Sales Lag  Shares Fall,opinion,Shares of The Andersons Inc    NASDAQ ANDE   have fallen 7  since reporting a first quarter 2016 adjusted loss of 52 cents per share on May 4  The performance was in stark contrast to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of earnings of 4 cents as well as the year ago quarter s earnings of 14 cents per share Market conditions in the first quarter prevented Grain Group from realizing meaningful basis appreciation following last year s poor harvest in the Eastern Corn Belt   Additionally  Andersons  affiliates experienced losses resulting from limited trading opportunities  including compressed margins at both the producer and processor ends of the supply chain  and significant reductions in distillers dried grain shipments to China Operational UpdateRevenues in the reported quarter declined 3 3  year over year to  887 9 million and also fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  889 million Cost of sales fell 1 8  to  820 million from  834 9 million in the year ago quarter  Gross profit declined 18 7  year over year to  67 8 million  Consequently  gross margin contracted 150 basis points to 7 6  in the quarter Operating  administrative and general expenses went up 1 6  year over year to  79 9 million  Andersons posted a loss of  12 million in the quarter  as against earnings of  4 7 million in the year ago quarter Segment PerformanceThe Grain Group  Revenues decreased to  538 8 million from  558 7 million in the year ago quarter  The segment reported a loss of  17 4 million as against earnings of  0 7 million in the year ago quarter  Through the first quarter  the market provided little carry or basis appreciation as global supplies and a strong dollar weighed on inventory movement  This resulted in loss in the segment  The Group s affiliates were also impacted by the weak basis and spreads which limited space income The Ethanol Group  Revenues fell 13 6  year over year to  114 7 million  The segment reported a loss of  2 7 million as against earnings of  5 3 million in the year ago quarter The Plant Nutrient Group  The segment reported revenues of  467 million  up 8 5  year over year  Operating income of  1 7 million was an improvement from  0 4 million in the prior year quarter  driven by stronger sales of nutrient and lawn products The Rail Group  Revenues decreased 10 4  year over year to  36 million  Operating income declined to  9 4 million from  10 3 million in the year ago quarter Financial PerformanceAndersons ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of  46 3 million compared with  63 8 million at the end of 2015  Long term debt was  402 4 million as of Mar 31  2016  compared with  436 2 million as of Dec 31  2015 Other UpdatesDuring the reported quarter  the company signed an agreement to sell eight grain and agronomy assets in western Iowa to MaxYield Cooperative  Andersons acquired the grain and agronomy locations as part of a larger transaction with Green Plains Grain Company in 2012  The Tennessee assets acquired during that same transaction will remain part of Andersons  The transaction does not involve the Denison ethanol facility or the recently acquired Nutra Flo facilities in Iowa  This transaction closed on May 1  2016   The sale will result in a small gain in the second quarter of 2016 In early March  Andersons redeemed its stake in Iowa Northern Railway after nearly six years of investment in the short line  Meanwhile  the company will continue to have an ongoing relationship with the railway  providing repair services OutlookAndersons  outlook for the remainder of the year remains strong as nutrient sales are trending favorably and ethanol margins are expected to improve with summer driving demand However  the grain group s performance will continue to be challenged until the fall harvest  which should produce opportunities to return to normal levels of profitability  Negative industry fundamentals persist for commercial grain handlers  including high global inventory levels and moderate movement  These will limit opportunities for improvement for the group in the near term Again  many factors point to opportunities in the fourth quarter and going into 2017  The combination of the high levels of residual inventory in the industry and the recently published planting acreage estimates points to higher space utilization levels during this year s harvest  providing opportunities for the company to purchase grain at more normal discounts and achieve desired profits from the space The outlook for the ethanol group entering the stronger spring and summer driving months is positive though mixed  U S  national average gasoline prices are running below five year lows  supported by high stocks of crude and low oil prices  Demand from higher gasoline consumption should provide some relief to margin pressures from current gasoline prices Further  the conditions for the plant nutrient group early in the second quarter have been good across the farm belt  with April showing continued strength in basic and specialty nutrients  Assuming that favorable weather conditions will prevail  the second quarter should yield good results for the group The year 2016 is off to a good start for the rail group  While market conditions will raise challenges to asset utilization and renewal rates  the group is well positioned for the slowing rail shipping cycle with currently high utilization rates  even spread of lease renewal activity and a diverse lease
