a company s efficiency in generating cash flows  This is because even a profit making company can have a dearth of cash flow and fail to meet its obligations  But a company s resiliency can be fairly judged when its efficacy in generating cash flows is assessed To find this efficiency  one needs to consider a company s net cash flow figure  While in any business cash moves in and out  it is net

23208,244723,ARGO,6 Top Stocks With Impressive Net Profit Margin,opinion,The primary motive of investors is to earn maximum returns from his stakes  Thus  they are always on the lookout for companies  which are minting money in heaps Net profit margin is the most effective way to measure a company s profitability  A proper analysis of the same shows how well a company is run and the headwinds dogging it Net Profit Margin  Net profit Sales   100 In simple terms  net profit is the amount a company retains after deducting all costs  interest  depreciation  taxes and other expenses  In fact  net profit margin can turn out to be a potent point of reference to gauge the strength in a company operations and cost control measures Also  higher net profit is essential for rewarding stakeholders  Further  strength in the metric not only attracts investors but also draws well skilled employees that eventually add to the value of the business Moreover  a higher net profit margin compared to its peers gives the company a competitive edge Pros and ConsNet profit margin helps investors gain clarity on a company s business model in terms of pricing policy  cost structure and manufacturing efficiency  Hence  a strong net profit margin is preferred by all classes of investors However  net profit margin as an investment criterion has its own share of pitfalls  The metric varies widely from industry to industry  While net income is a key metric for investment measurement in traditional industries  it is not that important for technology companies Moreover  the difference in accounting treatment of various items   especially non cash expenses like depreciation and stock based compensation   makes comparison a daunting task Further  for companies preferring to grow with debt instead of equity funding  higher interest expenses usually weigh on net profit  In such cases  the measure is rendered ineffective while analyzing a company s performance The Winning StrategyA

5 Top Stocks with Striking Net Profit Margins
As the primary motive of any investor is to generate maximum returns  companies raking in huge profits emerge as solid picks 
Net profit margin is the most effective way to measure a company s profitability  A proper analysis of the same indicates how well a company is run in the face of headwinds 
Net Profit Margin  Net profit Sales   100 
In simple terms  net profit is the amount a company retains after deducting all costs  interest  depreciation  taxes and other expenses  In fact  net profit margin can turn out to be a potent point of reference to gauge the strength in a company operations and cost control measures 
Also  higher net profit is essential for rewarding stakeholders  Further  strength in the metric not only attracts investors but also draws well skilled employees that eventually add to the value of the business 
Moreover  a higher net profit margin compared to its peers lends the company a competitive edge 
Net Profit Margin  Net profit Sales   100
In simple terms  net profit is the amount a company retains after deducting all costs  interest  depreciation  taxes and other expenses  In fact  net profit margin can turn out to be a potent point of reference to gauge the strength of a company s operations and cost control measures 
Also  higher net profit is essential for rewarding stakeholders  Net margin helps investors judge the risk involved in an investment  Creditors also view it as crucial to determining a company s ability to pay off debts 
Moreover  a higher net profit margin compared to its peers lends the company a competitive edge 
Pros and Cons
Net profit margin helps investors gain clarity on a company s business model in terms of pricing policy  cost structure and manufacturing efficiency  Hence  a strong net profit margin is preferred by all classes of investors 
However  net profit margin as an investment criterion has its own share of pitfalls  The metric varies widely from industry to industry  While net income is a key metric for investment measurement in traditional industries  it is not that important for technology companies 
Moreover  the difference in accounting treatment of various items   especially non cash expenses like depreciation and stock based compensation   makes comparison a daunting task 
Further  for companies preferring to grow with debt instead of equity funding  higher interest expenses usually weigh on net profit  In such cases  the measure is rendered ineffective while analyzing a company s performance

23325,244840,ARGO,Karmic reckoning  Investors in activist hedge funds agitate for change,news,"By Svea Herbst Bayliss  Reuters    Frustrated by high fees and uninspiring returns  pension funds  sovereign wealth funds and other big institutional investors are demanding U S  activist hedge funds be more transparent about their investment ideas and charge less  investors and fund managers say   Activist hedge funds push for changes at companies  ranging from ousting management and board directors to buying back stock and divesting non core assets  Traditionally they have used capital from their total pool of investor money to build stakes in companies  without telling clients in advance what their targets and strategy will be   They then go  active  and call for changes in some of the companies they invest in  but charge the same fees for all the money that investors place with them   Now  institutional investors are increasingly pressuring the hedge fund managers to raise separate pots of capital for each company they target through so called special purpose vehicles  and have been able to drive down how much they pay for investment gains  Fund managers now have to bring their best ideas  fully formed and described in detail in glossy pitch books  outlining to their investors exactly how they plan to drive up a company s stock   This structure lets us look at dozens of transactions and only invest in a manager s very best ideas   said Gregg Hymowitz  chief executive officer of EnTrust Global  one of the largest investors in special purpose vehicles raised by activist hedge funds   For lower fees and with an increased level of transparency  we can specifically target only the highest conviction ideas of our partners   There is no industrywide data on the proliferation of these pools of capital  often referred to as co investments or sidecars  because fundraising is confidential  but investors and fund managers said their use is growing   Some of the industry s most prominent activists  including Nelson Peltz s Trian Fund Management LP  Keith Meister s Corvex Management LP and Glenn Welling s Engaged Capital LLC  are increasingly relying on special purpose vehicles to raise money  Smaller players like J  Daniel Plants  Voce Capital Management are also turning more to co investments for their campaigns  The fund managers either declined to comment or did not respond to a request for comment   Electronics maker Sony Corp  T 6758   retailer Bed Bath   Beyond Inc  O BBBY   building materials producer  Eagle Materials Inc   N EXP   insurance company Argo Group International Holdings  N ARGO  and specialty chemicals provider Ashland Global Holdings Inc  N ASH  are among the companies that were targets of campaigns mounted by activist hedge funds through co investments  investors said   The companies either declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment  The proliferation of special purpose vehicles underscores how activist hedge funds  run by some of the biggest personalities in the industry  have lost some of their star power  as returns and assets under management have sagged amid increasing competition and misplaced bets on overvalued companies    Previously fund managers were almost always in the driver s seat  That has changed for many now   said Eleazer Klein  a partner at law firm Schulte Roth   Zabel  who advises activist investors   Last year activists lost 10 4  on average  far more than the hedge fund industry s average 5  drop  according to data from research firm Hedge Fund Research  Assets under management shrunk by 16  from their peak in 2015 to  146 billion at the end of last year  Activist hedge funds are performing better this year  returning 10 1  in the first six months of 2019  according to HFR data As demand for activist funds dried up at a time investors wanted less exposure to stocks  they suddenly had significantly more power to dictate terms in return for their multi million dollar investments  Managers who needed the cash were ready to compromise on fees  Hedge funds have traditionally charged a 2  management fee and 20  of the gains  Co investments often charge no management fees and require investors to pay only 10  of the profits  In addition  fees  instead of being collected annually  are collected only at the end of the investment period  which tends to be longer  between three and five years  managers and investors said  CURBING ABILITY TO MOVE AT WILL  Some fund managers complain that the shift in the fundraising model is cumbersome and limits their ability to target companies when they are ready and to do so in secret  It can also raise the risk of a leak that can drive up a target s stock price and give the target an opportunity to line up defenses   Sony  for example  was able to hire investment bankers and prepare its strategy weeks before Daniel Loeb s Third Point approached it with its demands  after Reuters reported in April that the hedge fund was raising a special purpose vehicle to target the Japanese company  according to people familiar with the matter  But special purpose vehicles have advantages  too  giving activists access to more cash than they normally would be able to deploy  allowing them to go after bigger companies   In the case of Sony  Third Point built a  1 5 billion stake with the help of co investment  a big bet that would have run afoul of rules of how much money Loeb could allocate to a particular bet in his main  15 billion fund  according to investors  Third Point did not respond to a request for comment  Sony declined to comment   
 Fund managers find it an efficient way to raise capital  it is a win win   said Corvex s Meister  who has raised several billion dollars for co investments over the last years ",2019-07-30,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/karmic-reckoning-investors-in-activist-hedge-funds-agitate-for-change-1938762,1938762

Fight Simmering Trade Tensions with These 5 Low Beta Stocks
Securities with significant exposure to markets perform well only when the market is bullish  Such stocks generally underperform the market when investor sentiments are bearish  Presently  the global market seems uncertain as fresh trade tensions are brewing between the United States and China 
Hence  to tide over market volatility  we have presented a strategy to create a portfolio of low beta stocks that are likely to reward investors with stable returns 
Meaning of Beta 
Beta measures the volatility or risks to a security relative to the market  we are considering the S P 500 here   That is  beta measures the extent to which the price of a stock moves with respect to the market 
If the beta is equal to 1 it means that the stock is as volatile as the market  So  a stock is relatively more volatile if it has beta greater than 1 and less volatile if beta is less than 1 
For example  if the beta is 1 8 then the stock will witness 80  more movement than the market   Hence  we can say that if the market goes up  the stock will outperform by 80   Conversely  if the market plunges  the stock will lose much more value than the market

23361,244876,ARGO,5 Stocks To Buy In The Middle Of A Bull   Bear Tug Of War,opinion,Wall Street has seen increased volatility this week  after a rebound in U S  stocks on May 14 followed the worst single day drop in months on May 13  While bearish investors are skeptical about any trade deal  bullish investors believe in President Trump s claim that he will reach a settlement with China  The bulls also believe that the U S  economy is in good shape  Lest we forget  corporate earnings  rather surprisingly  continue to beat estimates Given the widespread uncertainty over the future course of the equity market  investing in stocks unperturbed by market gyrations isn t a bad proposition  These stocks will surely capitalize on any upward journey  and provide cushion during times of downturn Topsy Turvy Ride for Wall StreetThe U S  stock market finished a solid day of trading on May 14 with the Dow jumping 207 06 points  or 0 8   to 25 532 05  The blue chip index registered its best one day gain since April 12  This followed May 13 s brutal trading session  with the blue chip index registering its worst day since Jan 3 The broader S P 500 bounced back to close at 2 834 41  up 22 54 points  or 0 8   However  the benchmark is still down nearly 4  so far this month  Battered tech giants  in fact  rebounded in the last trading session from their worst one day declines on May 13 since January  Some heavyweight exporters like Caterpillar Inc    NYSE CAT   and The Boeing Company   NYSE BA   also reversed a portion of Monday s huge losses This shows that the market is unpredictable and often erratic in the short term  After all  the Cboe Volatility Index  VIX   Wall Street s so called fear gauge  had touched an intraday high on May 7  only to end at 18 06 on May 14  Thus  currently the index of expected volatility for the S P 500 over the coming 30 day period indicates calmness in the equity markets  Needless to say  any reading above the 20 mark indicates volatility in the equity market Bulls and Bears Locked in SlugfestThe wild swings over the past two days are mostly due to the escalating U S  China trade tussle  President Trump recently called the trade tensions with China a  little squabble   and reassured Americans that a trade settlement could still be in the cards  His comments soothed investors  nerves  But  it s still not clear whether this is a  dead cat bounce   or a temporary rebound for stocks in the midst of a steep market downturn Trump s unwavering resolve to levy hefty import duties on Chinese goods  despite China s announcement of new tariffs on nearly  60 billion of U S  exports  did no good to the stock market in recent times Bearish investors are worried that the trade war might destabilize an already slowing global economy  Thanks to higher tariffs  Chinese goods will surely become more costly compared to U S  products  And if consumers start buying U S  products  eventually prices will move north  So  in both cases  U S  consumers will bear the cost China won t be spared either  The country uses the dollars it earns from exports to buy goods across the globe  But  due to trade tensions  China won t have many dollars to pay for its imports However  bullish investors argue that trade related headlines can t dominate market sentiments forever  Stocks simply can t fall at all times  especially  when you have a strong economy and corporate earnings are too strong Talking about the U S  economy  GDP for the January March period expanded at a 3 2  annual pace  the best first quarter growth since 2015  The gain was well above analysts  expectations of a 2 3  increase To top it  Americans are now feeling more optimistic about their conditions  The key economic indicator that measures attitudes on future economic prospects came in at 129 2 in April and exceeded analysts  expectations of a 126 9 reading Some other recent reports also point to signs of strength  March retail sales  surprise jump of 1 6  does indicate that consumer spending will eventually improve and that a proxy for business investment has risen sharply  Headline durable goods orders expanded 2 7  in March  easily surpassing estimates  In fact  durable goods orders grew at the fastest pace in seven months And when it comes to first quarter corporate results  the 450 S P 500 members that have reported so far have seen earnings go up 0 6  on 5  higher revenues  with 77 1  beating EPS estimates and 59 3  surpassing the revenue mark  The proportion of these 450 companies beating both EPS and revenue estimates is 51 3   read more    The Winning StrategyAs the broader market struggles for direction  smart investors should simply look for stocks that provide superb risk adjusted returns  The best way to go about doing this is by creating a portfolio of low beta stocks  which are inherently less volatile than the markets they trade in  In this case  a low beta ranges from 0 to 1 But even though low beta stocks pose less risk  they provide lower returns  So  in order to boost your returns  we have zeroed in on stocks that have seen positive earnings estimate revision  usually in the past two month period  Rising earnings estimates generally indicate that the stock will outperform the market in the near future  After all  earnings estimates are one of the most powerful metric that measures the fundamental strength of the company  To top it  these stocks flaunt a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see  Argo Group International Holdings  Ltd    NYSE ARGO   underwrites specialty insurance

23362,244877,ARGO,Top 6 Stocks With Substantial Net Profit Margin To Invest In,opinion,Businesses earning big bucks are pursued by all and sundry  In order to estimate the profit limit  there is no better measure than the net profit margin Net profit margin signifies the financial standing of a company  It is indicative of the company s ability to manage its resources  thereby making it the paramount metric to assess its profitability Net Profit Margin  Net profit Sales   100 In simple terms  net profit is the amount a company retains after deducting all costs  interest  depreciation  taxes and other expenses  In fact  net profit margin can turn out to be a potent point of reference to gauge the strength in a company operations and cost control measures Also  higher net profit is essential for rewarding stakeholders  Further  strength in the metric not only attracts investors but also draws well skilled employees that eventually add to the value of the business Moreover  a higher net profit margin compared to its peers gives the company a competitive edge Pros and ConsNet profit margin helps investors gain clarity on a company s business model in terms of pricing policy  cost structure and manufacturing efficiency  Hence  a strong net profit margin is preferred by all classes of investors However  net profit margin as an investment criterion has its own share of pitfalls  The metric varies widely from industry to industry  While net income is a key metric for investment measurement in traditional industries  it is not that important for technology companies Moreover  the difference in accounting treatment of various items   especially non cash expenses like depreciation and stock based compensation   makes comparison a daunting task Further  for companies preferring to grow with debt instead of equity funding  higher interest expenses usually weigh on net profit  In such cases  the measure is rendered ineffective while analyzing a company s performance The Winning StrategyA healthy net profit margin and solid EPS growth are the two most sought after elements in a business model Apart from these  we have added a few criteria to ensure maximum returns from this strategy Screening ParametersNet Margin 12 months  Most Recent     greater than equal to 0  High net profit margin indicates solid profitability Percentage Change in EPS F 0

International Holdings  Ltd    NYSE ARGO    eGain Corp    NASDAQ EGAN    G III Apparel Group  Ltd    NASDAQ GIII    Westlake Chemical Partners LP   NYSE WLKP   and OP Bancorp   NASDAQ OPBK   Here are highlights from Wednesday s Analyst Blog 5 Stocks to Buy in the Middle of a Bull   Bear Tug o  WarWall Street has seen increased volatility this week  after a rebound in U S  stocks on May 14 followed the worst single day drop in months on May 13  While bearish investors are skeptical about any trade deal  bullish investors believe in President Trump s claim that he will reach a settlement with China  The bulls also believe that the U S  economy is in good shape  Lest we forget  corporate earnings  rather surprisingly  continue to beat estimates Given the widespread uncertainty over the future course of the equity market  investing in stocks unperturbed by market gyrations isn t a bad proposition  These stocks will surely capitalize on any upward journey  and provide cushion during times of downturn Topsy Turvy Ride for Wall StreetThe U S  stock market finished a solid day of trading on May 14 with the Dow jumping 207 06 points  or 0 8   to 25 532 05  The blue chip index registered its best one day gain since April 12  This followed May 13 s brutal trading session  with the blue chip index registering its worst day since Jan 3 The broader S P 500 bounced back to close at 2 834 41  up 22 54 points  or 0 8   However  the benchmark is still down nearly 4  so far this month  Battered tech giants  in fact  rebounded in the last trading session from their worst one day declines on May 13 since January  Some heavyweight exporters like Caterpillar  NYSE CAT  and Boeing  NYSE BA  also reversed a portion of Monday s huge losses This shows that the market is unpredictable and often erratic in the short term  After all  the Cboe Volatility Index  VIX   Wall Street s so called fear gauge  had touched an intraday high on May 7  only to end at 18 06 on May 14  Thus  currently the index of expected volatility for the S P 500 over the coming 30 day period indicates calmness in the equity markets  Needless to say  any reading above the 20 mark indicates volatility in the equity market Bulls and Bears Locked in SlugfestThe wild swings over the past two days are mostly due to the escalating U S  China trade tussle  President Trump recently called the trade tensions with China a  little squabble   and reassured Americans that a trade settlement could still be in the cards  His comments soothed investors  nerves  But  it s still not clear whether this is a  dead cat bounce   or a temporary rebound for stocks in the midst of a steep market downturn Trump s unwavering resolve to levy hefty import duties on Chinese goods  despite China s announcement of new tariffs on nearly  60 billion of U S  exports  did no good to the stock market in recent times Bearish investors are worried that the trade war might destabilize an already slowing global economy  Thanks to higher tariffs  Chinese goods will surely become more costly compared to U S  products  And if consumers start buying U S  products  eventually prices will move north  So  in both cases  U S  consumers will bear the cost China won t be spared either  The country uses the dollars it earns from exports to buy goods across the globe  But  due to trade tensions  China won t have many dollars to pay for its imports However  bullish investors argue that trade related headlines can t dominate market sentiments forever  Stocks simply can t fall at all times  especially  when you have a strong economy and corporate earnings are too strong Talking about the U S  economy  GDP for the January March period expanded at a 3 2  annual pace  the best first quarter growth since 2015  The gain was well above analysts  expectations of a 2 3  increase To top it  Americans are now feeling more optimistic about their conditions  The key economic indicator that measures attitudes on future economic prospects came in at 129 2 in April and exceeded analysts  expectations of a 126 9 reading Some other recent reports also point to signs of strength  March retail sales  surprise jump of 1 6  does indicate that consumer spending will eventually improve and that a proxy for business investment has risen sharply  Headline durable goods orders expanded 2 7  in March  easily surpassing estimates  In fact  durable goods orders grew at the fastest pace in seven months And when it comes to first quarter corporate results  the 450 S P 500 members that have reported so far have seen earnings go up 0 6  on 5  higher revenues  with 77 1  beating EPS estimates and 59 3  surpassing the revenue mark  The proportion of these 450 companies beating both EPS and revenue estimates is 51 3   read more    The Winning StrategyAs the broader market struggles for direction  smart investors should simply look for stocks that provide superb risk adjusted returns  The best way to go about doing this is by creating a portfolio of low beta stocks  which are inherently less volatile than the markets they trade in  In this case  a low beta ranges from 0 to 1 But even though low beta stocks pose less risk  they provide lower returns  So  in order to boost your returns  we have zeroed in on stocks that have seen positive earnings estimate revision  usually in the past two month period  Rising earnings estimates generally indicate that the stock will outperform the market in the near future  After all  earnings estimates are one of the most powerful metric that measures the fundamental strength of the company  To top it  these stocks flaunt a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see  Argo Group International Holdings  Ltd  underwrites specialty insurance and

 Top Stocks with Substantial Net Profit Margin to Invest InBusinesses earning big bucks are pursued by all and sundry  In order to estimate the profit limit  there is no better measure than the net profit margin Net profit margin signifies the financial standing of a company  It is indicative of the company s ability to manage its resources  thereby making it the paramount metric to assess its profitability Net Profit Margin  Net profit Sales   100 In simple terms  net profit is the amount a company retains after deducting all costs  interest  depreciation  taxes and other expenses  In fact  net profit margin can turn out to be a potent point of reference to gauge the strength in a company operations and cost control measures Also  higher net profit is essential for rewarding stakeholders  Further  strength in the metric not only attracts investors but also draws well skilled employees that eventually add to the value of the business Moreover  a higher net profit margin compared to its peers gives the company a competitive edge Pros and ConsNet profit margin helps investors gain clarity on a company s business model in terms of pricing policy  cost structure and manufacturing efficiency  Hence  a strong net profit margin is preferred by all classes of investors However  net profit margin as an investment criterion has its own share of pitfalls  The metric varies widely from industry to industry  While net income is a key metric for investment measurement in traditional industries  it is not that important for technology companies Moreover  the difference in accounting treatment of various items   especially non cash expenses like depreciation and stock based compensation   makes comparison a daunting task Further  for companies preferring to grow with debt instead of equity funding  higher interest expenses usually weigh on net profit  In such cases  the measure is rendered ineffective while analyzing a company s performance For the

23429,244944,ARGO,Arch Capital  ACGL  Consistently Rides On Robust Premiums,opinion,Arch Capital Group Ltd    NASDAQ ACGL   has been exhibiting an excellent track record of premium growth on the back of sustained improvement in the metric across its segments  Moreover  the company s wide and diverse suite of product and service has been contributing to this upside The property and casualty  P C  insurer has been effectively meeting its clients  demands and needs with the help of its tailor made products and services  Further  this will drive the company s long term growth  thereby enabling it to reach greater heights in the future Interestingly  the company s focus on expanding its mortgage insurance business has been beneficial to its success  Further  this growth complements the P C insurer s strengths in the specialty insurance and reinsurance businesses The company s robust inorganic portfolio through strategic acquisitions has in turn  not only helped the company widen its footprint internationally but has also added capabilities and boosted its operations  To that end  Arch Capital completed the buyout of McNeil   Co  in December 2018 wherein the insurer stands to gain from the latter s reputation in the program space as well as its underwriting expertise and experience Given an improving interest rate environment  the company has been experiencing better investment results over the last several quarters  We expect this momentum to continue owing to a probable reinvestment of fixed income securities at higher available yields as well as an increase in investable assets Banking on better investment results and solid premiums  the company s top line is estimated to improve in the near term  In fact  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 revenues is pegged at  5 7 billion  reflecting a 5 6  year over year rise With respect to enhancement of shareholder value  the company has been indulging in a few good shareholder friendly moves like share buybacks and dividend payments  Such measures underscore the company s strong liquidity position and in turn  not only retain the existing investors  faith in the stock but also attract new ones Additionally  a solid capital position aids the company to protect itself from market volatility while retaining the financial strength and flexibility required to pursue new opportunities Shares of the Zacks Rank  2  Buy  insurer have lost 10 4  in a year s time  slightly wider than the  s decline of 5 9   We believe  the aforementioned positives will turn the stock around and drive it higher in the near term  For the P C insurer  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 earnings stands at  2 44  indicating year over year growth of 11 8  Regarding its earnings history  the company delivered positive surprises in all the trailing four reported quarters  the average being 13 29  Shares of the company are trading at a price to book multiple of 1 13  lower than the industry average of 1 30  Price to book value ratio is the best multiple for valuing life insurers because of large variations in earnings results from one quarter to the next  This ratio essentially measures a life insurer s current market value  relative to what it would be worth if it chooses to shut down  Underpriced shares with solid fundamentals are profitable picks Additionally  the stock carries a favorable  of A  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum with the score being a weighted combination of all three factors  Back tested results have shown that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a top Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2 offer best investment opportunities Other Stocks to ConsiderInvestors interested in some other top ranked stocks from the same space can also consider Argo Group

23459,244974,ARGO,4 Property   Casualty Insurers Likely To Outperform In Q1 ,opinion,The property and casualty  P C  insurers fared well in the fourth quarter of 2018 on the back of prudent underwriting  strong reserves  better pricing  expenses management and effective capital deployment  However  devastation caused by California wildfires and Hurricane Michael took a toll on insurers  profits in the quarter The first quarter of 2019 looks promising  largely because there have not been any major catastrophic events  Profitability of property and casualty insurers are measured by underwriting profit   the difference between premiums collected on insurance policies and expenses incurred and claims paid  Thus  lower the magnitude of cat losses  better the underwriting profit Notably  after 19 quarters of soft pricing market  insurers have been gaining strength since the fourth quarter of 2017  Per excerpts from Insurance Marketplace Realities 2019 by Willis Towers Watson  rates are expected to increase in low single digit to low double digit range across most insurance lines in 2019  except for U S  workers compensation and international liability programs  Also  reinsurance covers should help insurers limit the magnitude of losses Further  an improving rate environment is beneficial for investment income of insurers  While there has been an accelerated pace in rate hikes in the last couple of years  in its last FOMC meeting the Fed took a cautious stance  The central bank may not raise any rates in 2019 against its earlier expectation of two raises  This is likely because of slowing economic growth and sluggish inflation  Nevertheless  the interest rate now stands at 2 50  from a near zero level post the 2008 financial crisis  Hence  net investment income  an important component of insurers  top line  should benefit from an improved rate environment This apart  capital reserves  built by insurers owing to a not so active catastrophe environment in the past  is helping companies meet insurance claims without hampering profitability greatly Moreover  adoption of technologies like artificial intelligence  robotic process automation  cognitive intelligence or blockchain should help insurers curb operational costs  Insurers  thus  are expected to continue making investment in technological platforms The  has underperformed the Zacks S P 500

23683,245198,ARGO,P C Insurers  Q3 Earnings To Watch On Nov 1  Y  RNR   More  ,opinion,We are in the second half of the third quarter reporting cycle and the picture so far shows improvement  Results from 291 S P 500 members that combined account for 58 2  of the index s total market capitalization are already on board  as per the article  Total earnings for these companies are up 2 2  from the same period last year on 1 3  higher revenues  with 73 5  beating EPS estimates and 57 4  surpassing top line expectations The Finance sector  one of the 16 Zacks sectors  started the Q3 earnings season on a strong note  In fact  the financial performance of 78 9  companies from this sector that have already reported their quarterly results indicates 9 3  earnings growth due to a 5 9  increase in revenues  on a year over year basis  Moreover  the beat ratios of 74 6  for the bottom line and 73 2  for the top line compare favorably with the S P 500 The Finance sector is highly diversified and includes several industries like insurance  banks and financial transaction services to name a few  The property and casualty  P C  insurance industry also forms a sizable part of the broader finance sector  Let s see how the third quarter has turned up for insurers so far Unlike the last quarter  which bore the brunt of high catastrophe losses  earnings for property and casualty players this quarter will be relieved by benign cat activity in the period under review Nevertheless  a still low interest rate environment will lead to depressed investment yields  consequently putting pressure on investment income which is one of the revenue drivers for the sector  However  a broader invested asset base and alternative asset classes bring some respite The industry is  however  expected to post another profitable quarter aided by capital gains and reserve releases  We also expect to see favorable reserve development related to the past years led by low catastrophe losses and prudent reserving practices The sector is flushed with excess capital  due to a benign catastrophe activity in recent years  The players are therefore indulging in share buyback  dividend hike and mergers and acquisitions  These efforts will also be accretive to earnings Insurers are expected to benefit from growing exposure to the key areas of the economy such as new vehicle sales and construction  Moreover  continued growth in workers  compensation premiums and continued growth in premiums related to residential construction will drive premium growth Let s take a look at how these

23837,245352,ARGO,5 Impressive PEG Stocks For Value Investors,opinion,There are numerous financial metrics  which can prove to be quite effective in terms of measuring the financial health of a company  However  value investors with a varied risk appetite more often than not confine themselves to a limited number of popular and easy to compute metrics such as price earnings  P E   price sales  P S  or price book value  P B  Needless to say  many important yardsticks  which are unique in terms of judging a company s future prospects  are disregarded  The price earnings to growth  PEG  ratio is one such less popular investment option  which investors often find difficult considering the limitations in calculating the future earnings growth potential of a stock We note that P E  P B or P S can easily measure whether a stock is at present trading at a discount  However  these fail to give any idea about the future growth trend of a stock  In such a case  even if you buy a stock at less than its fair value  you might still end up paying more The PEG ratio on the other hand  with the term  growth  within it  is perfect for accurately calculating the future earnings  EPS  growth rate of a company The PEG ratio is defined as   Price  Earnings   Earnings Growth RateA lower PEG ratio is always better for value investors While P E fails to identify a true value stock  PEG helps to find the intrinsic value of a stock There are some drawbacks to using the PEG ratio though  It doesn t consider the very common situation of changing growth rates such as the forecast for the first three years at a very high growth rate followed by a sustainable but lower growth rate in the long term Nonetheless  PEG based investing can turn out to be even more rewarding if some other relevant parameters are also taken into consideration Here are the screening criteria for a winning strategy PEG Ratio less than X Industry Median P E Ratio  using F1  less than X Industry Median  For more

23986,245501,ARGO,5 Low Leverage Bargain Stocks To Buy Now ,opinion, Leverage  is a term used casually and frequently in everyday business  but deep down it is of grave importance  Basically  leverage  better known as financial leverage  refers to the use of debt financing by any corporation to boost its business  Although companies also have the option to resort to equity financing  the majority of them see debt financing as a more viable choice This is because debt financing brings in money at a lower cost than equity financing  especially in periods of historically low interest rates  However  too much debt can turn out to be detrimental for any business Particularly  it is better to avoid companies bearing a high degree of financial leverage as they are the most vulnerable ones in times of financial distress and may even go bankrupt in the worst case scenario Considering this  it is reasonable to conclude that investors should measure the extent of financial leverage a company is bearing before putting their hard earned money in its stock  Several leverage ratios have been constructed for this purpose  debt to equity ratio being the most popular among them Analyzing the Ratio Debt to Equity Ratio   Total Liabilities Shareholders  EquityThis metric is a liquidity ratio that reflects how much debt a company currently bears  A lower debt to equity ratio implies a comparatively less risky business and thereby greatly contributes to an investor s confidence in a company s financial stability With the second quarter earnings season on the last lap  investors must be flocking to high earnings yielding companies  However  it will be rather stupid to target stocks exhibiting a surge in earnings only  This because if a stock has a high debt to equity ratio  its so called booming earnings picture might turn into a nightmare any time soon So instead of choosing companies bearing high earnings growth  low leverage stocks should be ideal investment choices  for a sensible investor Picking the Right StrategyChoosing stocks based solely on one financial metric might not fetch the desired outcome To ensure the maximum possible return from this strategy  we have expanded our screening procedure to include some other criteria  Particularly  we added a low P E ratio and a favorable to the screen to shortlist cheap stocks Here are the parameters Debt Equity less

23989,245504,ARGO,5 Low Price to Sales Stocks For Best Portfolio Returns,opinion,It is essential to assert the value of stocks before investing  Following this principle  investors always compare the value of stocks using various valuation metrics at disposal  While Price to Earnings is the first to cross one s mind when using valuation metrics  Price to Sales has emerged as a useful measure in narrowing down the list of valuable stocks Price to Sales helps to determine the value of stocks that are suffering losses or are in the early cycle of development  generating meager or no profits  Though a loss making company with a negative Price to Earnings ratio falls out of investors  favor  its Price to Sales could indicate the hidden strength in its business  This underrated ratio is also used to identify recovery situations or ensure that a company s growth is not overvalued Price to Sales is often preferred to Price to Earnings  as companies and managements can fiddle with their earnings using various accounting measures  However  sales are harder to manipulate and are relatively reliable A stock s Price to Sales ratio reflects how much investors are paying for each dollar of revenues generated by the company If the Price to Sales ratio is 1  it means that investors are paying  1 for every  1 of revenues generated by the company  So it goes without saying that a stock with Price to Sales below 1 is a good bargain  as investors need to pay less than a dollar for a dollar s worth   Thus  a stock with a lower Price to Sales ratio is more suitable for investment versus a stock with a high Price to Sales ratio However  one should keep in mind that a company with high debt and low Price to Sales is not an ideal choice  The high debt level will have to be paid off at some point  leading to further share issuance and a rise in market cap and ultimately a higher Price to Sales ratio In any case  the Price to Sales ratio used in isolation can t do the trick  One should also analyze other ratios like Price Earnings  Price Book  Debt Equity before arriving at any investment decision Screening ParametersPrice to Sales less than Median Price to Sales for its Industry  The lower the Price to Sales ratio  the better Price to Earnings using F 1  estimate less than Median Price to Earnings for its Industry  The lower  the better Price to Book  common Equity  less than Median Price to Book for its Industry  This is another parameter to ensure the value feature of a stock Debt to Equity  Most Recent  less than Median Debt to Equity for its Industry  A

24027,245542,ARGO,4 Insurance Stocks To Buy Before A Rate Hike,opinion,Will the Federal Open Market Committee  FOMC  make any positive change to the interest rate in the meeting scheduled on Jun 15   While this is anybody s guess  the Fed decision is being eagerly waited for When everyone predicted an increase in the rate in the Sep 2015 FOMC meeting  the Fed decided against it  However  after a period of prolonged near zero interest rate  the Fed chose to raise the rates to only 0 25 0 50  at its December meeting  While the federal funds rate was kept the same at the Mar 2016 meeting  uncertainties over further rate hikes were removed  In fact  the Fed lowered the median forecast for the number of rate hikes this year to two from four projected at its meeting last December Nevertheless  the rate environment is still low  But comments from St  Louis Fed President James Bullard is definitely drawing attention  In an interview to CNBC  Bullard said   A U S  Federal Reserve rate hike in June or July wasn t set in stone  but labor data suggested it was time to pull the trigger   As per the Bureau of Labor Statistics  total nonfarm payroll employment in April increased by nearly 0 2 million while the unemployment rate remained unchanged at 5   Other factors that might act as gunpowder are the easing of the U S  dollar  momentum in oil prices and inflation approaching 2  as noted by Eric Rosengren  the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston It is to be noted that the June meeting will be before the U S  presidential election and will thus attract eyeballs  However  James Bullard does not think that the election will have any impact on the Fed s decision of hiking rates Interest rate directly impacts the investment results of a company  For insurance companies  investment income forms a major revenue component  A low rate puts pressure on investment income and in turn on investment yields  Life insurers  in particular  suffer spread compression on products like fixed annuities and universal life due to sustained low rates  Hence any increase in the interest rate would bring some respite for insurers But it s not that a low interest rate regime does not bring any fortunes for insurance companies  These generally hold a considerable amount in bonds  which would see a decline in value if rates rise   So since insurance stocks are poised for growth no matter what the Fed chooses to do  the space is bound to attract attention  We have picked four solid operators in the space that have the potential to boost one s portfolio even more  We

24028,245543,ARGO,5 Value Picks With Incredibly Low EV EBITDA Ratios,opinion,Many investors have a fixation for the price to earnings  P E  strategy in their quest for stocks that are trading at a discount  This is by far the most popular metric used by investors to figure out the fair market value of a firm s equity and is also a widely used tool for screening stocks  But even this ubiquitously used  simple to calculate valuation multiple is not without its flaws Is There a Better Alternative to P E The EV EBITDA ratio  also referred as the enterprise multiple  is often considered better than P E as it gives a true picture of a company s valuation and its earning potential  It is essentially the enterprise value   EV   of a company divided by its earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization   EBITDA   EV is a company s market capitalization plus the market value of its debt and preferred equity minus cash  EBITDA  on the other hand  gives a clearer picture of a company s profitability as it eliminates non cash expenses like depreciation and amortization that depress net earnings  It is also often used as a proxy for cash flows Typically  the lower the EV EBITDA ratio  the more appealing it is  Just like P E  a low EV EBITDA ratio indicates that a stock is potentially undervalued and vice versa Now  the question is  why is the more complicated EV EBITDA metric a better option than P E in stock evaluation  The answer lies in the fact that unlike the P E ratio  EV EBITDA takes debt on a company s balance sheet into consideration  This is also the reason why EV EBITDA is commonly used to value possible acquisition targets  Stocks with a low EV EBITDA multiple could be seen as attractive takeover candidates Moreover  P E can t be used to value a loss making entity  A company s earnings are also subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation  EV EBITDA  on the other hand  is harder to manipulate and also can be used to value companies making loss on the net earnings front but are EBITDA positive This ratio determines the total value of a company  not just its equity portion that is solely considered by the P E ratio  It is a useful tool in assessing the value of firms with a debt laden balance sheet and a high degree of depreciation  Moreover  it allows comparison of companies with different debt levels However  EV EBITDA is also not without its downsides and it alone can t conclusively determine a stock s inherent potential and its future performance   The multiple varies across industries  a high growth industry typically has higher EV EBITDA multiple and vice versa  and is usually not appropriate while comparing companies in different industries given their diverse capital requirements So  instead of banking on EV EBITDA alone  you can club it with other key ratios in your stock investing toolbox such as price to book  P B   P E and price to sales  P S  to uncover bargain stocks  Screening CriteriaHere are the parameters to screen for true value stocks EV EBITDA 12 Months Most Recent less than X Industry Median  A lower EV EBITDA ratio represents a cheaper valuation P E using  F1  less than X Industry Median  This metric screens stocks that are trading at a discount to their peers P B less than X Industry Median  A lower P B compared with the industry average implies that the stock is undervalued P S less than X Industry Median  The lower the P S ratio the more attractive the stock is as investors will have to pay a smaller price for the same amount of sales generated by the company Estimated One Year EPS Growth F 1  F 0  greater than or equal to X Industry Median  This parameter will help in screening stocks that have growth rates higher than the industry median  This is a meaningful indicator as decent earnings growth always adds to investor optimism Average 20 day Volume greater than or equal to 100 000  The addition of this metric ensures that the shares can be traded easily Current Price greater than or equal to  5  This parameter will help in screening stocks which are trading at a minimum price of  5 or higher Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  No screening is complete without the Zacks Rank  which has proven its worth since inception  It is a fundamental truth that stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy  have always managed to beat adversities and outperformed the market Value Score of less than or equal to B  Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of  A  or  B  when combined with Zacks Rank  1 or 2 offer the best upside potential Here are 5 of the 13 stocks that made it through the screen Omega Protein Corporation   NYSE OME   makes products to enhance the nutritional integrity of foods  dietary

over a given period of time  In short  it is the ultimate indicator of profitability Upbeat earnings results also have a positive impact on the company s share price  A better than expected earnings

profit margins  expenses and cost control  Thus  earnings estimates are a valuable tool for investors when deciding whether or not to buy a stock So  it is imperative for an investor zeroing down to
