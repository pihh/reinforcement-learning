214481,435997,GLW,Better Buy  Universal Display vs  Corning,news,"Just as there are many ways to scalp a feline  there are plenty of ways to invest in the digital display market  Two popular choices involve glass and ceramics materials specialist Corning  NYSE GLW  and organic light emitting diode  OLED  technology researcher Universal Display  NASDAQ OLED  
Both of these companies have deep connections to digital displays  and the screen on your current smartphone may contain products and technologies from both of them  The same goes for your large screen OLED television set  though those are still a bit too pricey to be found in every living room 
Universal Display and Corning actually don t have much in common apart from that shared reliance on some key markets    at least not from an investor s perspective  So which one should you buy today 
Life in the fast lane
Universal Display s revenue depends directly on the total area of OLED screens being produced under license to the company s patents  What started as an almost exclusive focus on smartphone and tablet computer screens is now a near perfect split between small screen mobile devices and big screen OLED TV sets  Screen manufacturers are currently ramping up their production lines to handle larger volumes of TV sized screens  paving the way toward economies of scale and lower street prices in due time 
The amount of produced screen area varies from quarter to quarter  driving Universal Display s revenue higher and lower at the whims of consumers and device builders around the world  As the top line goes  Universal Display s earnings and share prices typically follow suit 

OLED data by YCharts 
Sales have doubled over the past five years while adjusted earnings tripled  Universal Display s shares rose 720  over the same period 
This is a growth investment  not a value stock  Universal Display s  10 billion market value is largely built on expectations of further hypergrowth  The stock trades at 78 times trailing earnings and 86 times free cash flow today    way up in Wall Street s nosebleed section 
Steady  as she goes
Corning runs a diverse business where no single market accounts for more than one third of the company s total sales  This broad collection of unrelated target markets makes the company less vulnerable to sudden shifts in any particular area  For example  Corning s third quarter report saw a 7  lower display technology top line haul and a 10  drop in optical communications revenue on a year over year basis  But life sciences posted an 11  gain while automotive orders came in 38  higher  All in all  Corning s third quarter sales fell just 2  despite turbulent markets and macroeconomic headwinds 
So Corning may be a less exciting stock to own than Universal Display  but it also lets you sleep at night  Over the past five years  sales and earnings rose by 20  each and the stock gained 29   This stock trades at 22 times trailing earnings and 19 times free cash flow    a fair valuation for a mature and generally slow growing business 

Different strokes for different folks
Universal Display is by far the more exciting growth investment in this matchup  I own it myself and it s one of the most profitable holdings in my real money portfolio  I also believe that Universal Display s high octane growth story has only just begun  If you can tolerate the wild swings this stock tends to make  sometimes on the flimsiest of news  I highly recommend that you grab a few shares and hang on for dear life  You will probably thank me later 
That being said  there s nothing wrong with owning Corning  either  It s a much safer and slower investment  paired with a generous 2 7  dividend yield  compared to 0 2  for Universal Display   and a fine choice for income generating portfolios  In this era of commission free stock trades  there s nothing stopping you from picking up Corning shares alongside a spicy little bet on Universal Display ",2020-01-16,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pivxp,2061156

and full year 2019 results  For the fourth quarter sales were  2 9 billion  net income was  406 million and EPS was  0 46  For the full year  sales increased 2  to  11 7 billion  net income was  1 6 billion and EPS was  1 76 While our 2019 growth did not meet our long term targets  we once again outperformed our underlying markets  We grew environmental sales 16  while car sales were down  We grew Specialty Materials sales 8   while smartphone units were down  In Life Sciences  we exceeded industry growth on the strength of new products for bioprocess and advanced cell culture In Display  our glass volume grew mid single digits  while TV unit sales were down  and in Optical  we outperform the passive optical market  which declined a high single digit percentage  Changing market and customer dynamics impacted our 2019 performance significantly  Corning enter 2019 building on two years of strong growth and that growth continued in the first half  with sales up 11  and EPS up 24  year over year In the second half  a supply chain correction in the display industry and weakness in the optical market  highlighted by capital spending reductions at two of our significant customers led to declines in Display Technologies and Optical Communications  While we acted quickly to mitigate lower than expected second half demand in Display and Optical  we did not fully overcome these challenges  As a result  our second half sales were down versus 2018 and as our volume decreased  factory utilization declined and so did our profitability  especially gross margin We re confident that the situations in Display and Optical communications are temporary  and we expect the company to return to sales and profit growth in the second half  In Display  we see indicators that the supply chain correction has ended and we expect normal seasonality to resume with the majority of volume and growth in the second half  We also plan to start production at our next Gen 10 5 plants  which will support faster than market growth as the plant s ramp In Optical  we expect year over year growth in the second half  driven by projects for 5G  fiber to the home and hyperscale data center deployments  We expect these higher volumes to increase factory utilization and support higher profitability and we expect to benefit from the recent and ongoing cost actions in Optical Communications and Display  Tony will provide additional segment details and I will focus on our overall progress and outlook 2019 was challenging from a financial perspective  but we remain committed to our new Strategy   Growth Framework introduced last year  Our new framework is the evolution of our strategy and capital allocation framework  which we successfully completed last year  Building on the strong foundation of our original framework  we made excellent progress on many strategic initiatives during the year  We made commercial and regulatory progress on Valor  We opened a dedicated factory for our burgeoning auto interiors glass business and grew our order book significantly Display pricing remained moderate and we advanced several compelling innovations in Gorilla Glass and Optical Communications  We met or exceeded all of the goals of our 2016 to 2019 strategy and capital allocation framework  including returning more than  12 5 billion to shareholders over four years through share repurchases and a 67  dividend per share increase  all while creating a better  stronger  more resilient company Under our new Strategy   Growth Framework  we expect to continue capturing significant organic growth and creating additional value for shareholders  From 2020 to 2023  we expect to deliver 6  to 8  compound annual sales growth and 12  to 15  compound annual EPS growth  Expand operating margin and return on invested capital  invest between  10 billion and  12 billion with a focus on our organic growth and return  8 billion to  10 billion to shareholders through a combination of dividend increases and opportunistic share repurchases How do we plan to achieve these goals  We are targeting an incremental  3 billion to  4 billion in annual sales along with improved profitability by the end of 2023  driven primarily by our strategy to create and sell into new product categories that enhance our customers  offerings  As I ve said before  we re not just counting on everybody buying more stuff  we re putting more Corning into the products that people already buy this provides a mechanism for us to grow even in challenging environments  We saw that happen during 2019 in Environmental  Specialty Materials and Life Sciences as I outlined earlier  In short  a big part of Corning s story over the next four years is a content story  and we expect to see it across the company  Let s look at how we advanced our strategy in each market access platform in the fourth quarter and for the full year In Optical Communications  we are currently feeling the impact of capital spending reductions in both the carrier and enterprise markets  We expect to recovery  driven by 5G  fiber to the home and hyperscale data center deployments  Our goals in Optical Communications are to advance our product portfolio and align costs with demand in the near term  we re making progress in both areas Perspective  in 2019  we continue to transform the way the world connects by enabling 5G solutions with industry leaders  New collaborations with Intel and Verizon demonstrate our commitment to helping our customers increase efficiency and address the challenges of new network deployment  We also extended our leadership and data centers as Altice Portugal  the country s largest provider of telecommunication services selected our EDGE product  EDGE provides the increased speed  power and capacity needed to withstand future pressure on servers and network capabilities  EDGE has been playing a vital role in our continued success in enterprise  it s been deployed in 30 countries  used in 50 000 installations and has received 10 global awards since its introduction  Stepping back  the long term trend in Optical is strongly positive due to the benefits of photons replacing electrons in network after network  and we re unique situated to enable that shift  But it s not always a smooth line As one network or segment upgrades to Optics  there can be a pause  before the next one begins  that pause is where we are right now  So  we re aligning capacity and inventory to current market demand  We vital equipment and reduced head count and we re delaying capital investments  In the long term because of our leadership  we are positioned to continue putting more Corning solutions into every network that is built  We will return to growth as the inevitable Optical trend continues Turning to mobile consumer electronics  We re making significant progress on our goal of doubling sales  Since 2016  we ve added  500 million in sales on a base of  1 1 billion  We grew sales 42  cumulatively while smartphone unit sales did not grow  In 2019 we bolstered the presence of Corning content on and in mobile devices with amplify screen protectors  decorative backs and durable solutions for wearables  Apple announced that it is awarding  250 million from its advanced manufacturing fund to Corning  building on the  200 million we received from Apple s fund in 2017  Both investments support Corning s state of the art glass processes  equipment and materials integral to the delivery of next generation consumer devices In 2019 as one of our prominent customers noted  we took a major step forward in state of the art cover glass  In 2020  we will continue to advance and introduce new glasses  and we are confident that the adoption of our technologies will enable us to our sales goals  so stay tuned Moving to the Automotive market  our goal is to double sales by 2023  In 2019  we ran production capacity in Hefei  China to meet committed demand for both our auto glass solutions and our gasoline particulate filter products  We are well on our way to building a  500 million plus GPF business by 2023  Sales in 2019 exceeded  250 million and in 2019 Automotive Glass Solutions deliver the industry s first auto grade Gorilla Glass for 2D and 3D interiors along with Corning s patented ColdForm Technology Earlier this month  we announced collaborations with industry leaders across the auto ecosystem including Visteon  LGE  BOE and VIA Optronics  We are beginning mass production and have built an order book worth several hundred million dollars  with nearly half of that book under contract In Life Sciences Vessels  we reached several exciting milestones in 2019  We exceeded  1 billion in sales in our Life Sciences segment as adoption of our industry leading bioprocess in advanced cell culture products continues  driving our organic growth rate 7   And we continue to build momentum for Valor Glass  We signed commercial agreements with three leading pharmaceutical companies and received FDA approval for use of Corning Valor Glass as a primary package for a marketed drug product  These major milestones validate our strategy to build a long term multi billion dollar franchise as we create a new standard in pharmaceutical glass packaging In Display  our goal is to stabilize returns  The market continues to shift to large size TVs  which are most efficiently produced by our customers on Gen 10 5 fabs  Our leadership in Gen 10 5 glass supports medium and longer term volume growth  In 2019  we continued to increase output at our first Gen 10 5 plant in 2020  we plan to ramp additional Gen 10 5 capacity in tandem with our customers  And 2019 was a great year for display glass pricing  We saw low single digit percentage price declines for the full year  which was even more moderate than anticipated  And we expect a moderate pricing environment again in 2020 You can see that across our markets  our strategic investments are well aligned with major trends and our relationships with industry leading customers are creating new opportunities  We ve got the structural steel in place  Our strategy is sound  We re advancing growth in each of our market access platforms and we will overcome the challenges in Display and Optical In 2020  three operational priorities drive our focus  Successfully ramping our next Gen 10 5 plants  Aligning cost and capacity to current demand and commercializing innovations to support our customers  Execution against these priorities will create the momentum needed to achieve our strategy and growth framework goals Now  let me turn the call over to Tony for more details Tony Tripeny    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThank you  Wendell  and good morning  In the fourth quarter  we delivered on sales and EPS expectations  Sales in each of our businesses performed at or above expectations and we generated over  1 billion in adjusted operating cash flow  We accelerated actions in Optical Communications to align production output and working capital to current customer demand  This impacted gross margin  which was below our fourth quarter guidance  For the full year as expected sales and profitability were down due to the challenges in Display and Optical communications  While we also faced challenges in other markets  it s important to note that Specialty Materials  Environmental Technologies and Life Sciences powered through and grew sales As we turn to 2020  we expect continued strong growth in all three of these businesses  We also expect the Display and Optical sales and profitability to grow year over year beginning in the second half  As a result  we expect margins and profitability for the corporation to improve in the second half of the year  Now  before I get into the details of our performance and results  I want to note that the largest difference between our GAAP and core results are related to charges associated with capacity realignment in Display and Optical Communications and at our equity venture Hemlock Semiconductor  Other differences between our GAAP and core results come from a non cash mark to market adjustment for our currency hedge contracts and a change in our tax reserves Now  with respect to mark to market adjustments  GAAP accounting requires earning translations  hedge contracts and foreign debt settling in future periods to be mark to market and recorded a current value at the end of each quarter  even though those contracts will not be settled in the current quarter  For us  this impacted GAAP earnings in quarter four by  59 million  To be clear  this mark to market accounting has no impact on our cash flow  Our currency hedges protect us economically from foreign exchange rate fluctuations and provide higher certainty for our earnings and cash flow  our ability to invest for growth and our future shareholder distributions  Our non GAAP or core results provide additional transparency into operations by using a constant currency rate aligned with the economics of our underlying transactions  We re very pleased with our hedging program and the economic certainty it provides  We received  1 7 billion in cash under our hedge contracts since their inception more than five years ago As shifting to results  fourth quarter sales were  2 9 billion  net income was  406 million and EPS was  0 46  For the full year  sales were up 2  to  11 7 billion  net income was  1 6 billion and EPS was  1 76  Now  let s look at the detailed segment results and outlook In Display Technologies  fourth quarter sales were  795 million and net income was  180 million  Q4 glass prices declined slightly sequentially as expected  Our fourth quarter volume was up low single digit sequentially  better than expected  Display full year sales were  3 3 billion and net income was  786 million  Our full year 2019 price decline was a low single digit percentage Retail demand in 2019 was strong  Our preliminary view with most  but not all of the data in is that retail display increased mid single digits in 2019 driven by TV screen size growth  Last month glass market volume was up low single digits  less than retail as set makers  took a conservative stance in the back half of the year due to macro uncertainty  This conservativism drove panel maker utilization reductions and led to a supply chain correction  We believe that supply chain inventory exiting 2019 is healthy  and we think the correction is largely behind us  Full year 2019    for full year 2019 our glass volume was up mid single digits  outperforming overall glass market driven by our increased Gen 10 5 output during the year  The glass market shipped more volume in the first half than the second half  due to the supply chain correction and so  did we  The lower shipments in the second half  reduced our gross margin For 2020  we again expect the retail market measured in square feet to be up by a mid single digit percentage driven by TV screen size growth and given that the supply chain is now at a healthier inventory level  We expect the glass market to increase in the mid single digits and for our volume growth to be similar to the overall glass market  In the first quarter  we expect the glass market to be up low single digit sequentially as panel maker utilization increases  We expect our volume to be down low single digit sequentially underperforming the glass market because of a structural shift in the Korean panel market Up until two years ago  South Korea was the leading provider of panels  Korean panel makers are going through structural changes that will reduce their capacity significantly as the global center of panel making moves to China  This reduction impacts our shipments in Korea  In the second half of 2020  we expect to grow faster than the glass market as our new Gen 10 5 tanks in China buyer up and absorb the panel demand that is shifting from South Korea  Given Corning s leadership with three of the four planned Gen 10 5 fabs  we expect the benefit from this regional shift  We expect more normal seasonality in 2020 and from almost all of our year over year volume growth to incur in the second half  As our volume increases  we expect our margins to improve Turning to pricing  we expect Q1 sequential glass price declines to be moderate  For 2020 with over 95  of our volume under contract  we expect full year price declines to be at mid single digit percentage  We reached our goal of mid single digit year over year declines in the second half of 2018 and had even more favorable changes for several subsequent quarters  More recently as just discussed the panel industry is working through a fundamental restructure of capacity migrating from Korea to China  The fact that we continue to have moderate price declines  while these changes are happening is positive  We believe that three factors continue to drive the favorable glass pricing environment we ve been experiencing  First  we expect glass supply to continue to be balanced with demand or even tight  For Corning  we are aligning our capacity with demand  We are also pacing our Gen 10 5 capital projects to align with panel makers schedules Second  our competitors continue to face profitability challenges at current pricing levels  And third  display glass manufacturing requires periodic investments in existing capacity to maintain operations  Glass prices must support acceptable returns on those investments  Now to recap Display  the industry is emerging from a temporary supply chain correction retail remained strong with the increase in TV screen size  continuing to drive glass volume growth  we are well positioned with our customers and successfully ramping new Gen 10 5 facilities and we expect to return to year over year growth in volume  margins and profitability in the back half of the year In Optical Communications  fourth quarter sales were  903 million and net income was  62 million  Profitability was impacted by lower volume and reduced production output to bring down inventory  For the full year  sales were  4 1 billion  down 3  in a market that declined by a high single digit percentage  Net income declined 17  to  489 million In 2020 sales increased 13  year over year in the first half and declined 16  in the back half  The lower volume in the back half negatively impacted sales margins and profitability  Nearly 90  of the second half year over year decline can be explained by changes in spending by two large customers  a large carrier completed its fiber to the home build and redirected capital to pay down its debt  A hyperscale data center customer concluded a period of unusually intense building  We have excellent relationships with these customers and continue to co innovating with them  We expect our sales to increase at both companies as they spend more on Optical passes In 2020  we expect year over year sales to be down 5  to 10  as the lower level of sales we experienced in the second half of 2019 continues throughout the first half of 2020  and we expect first quarter sales to be down about 25  versus the strong project spending in Q1 of 2019 In the back half of 2020  we expect year over year growth in sales and profits to resume  driven by projects for 5G  fiber to the home and hyperscale data center deployments  Now  the exact timing of these projects is hard to predict  if they proceed as expected will be in the upper range of our guidance  If the project start later will be at the lower end of the range  When year over year growth occurs  Our factories will fill and our margins and profitability will improve we are working closely with our customers and we ll keep you informed as the year progresses Stepping back  we are innovating to improve network speed and capacity  We also continue to receive confirmation that Optical is essential for 5G and hyperscale and to secure long term agreements with major industry players  all of which sustains our confidence in our ability to deliver long term growth In Environmental Technologies  fourth quarter sales were  374 million  up 17  year over year and ahead of expectations  Continued adoption of gasoline particulate filters drove the growth  Net income was  64 million  driven by strong operational performance and successful ramping of additional GPS capacity in China  For the full year  sales were  1 5 billion  up 16   Net income was  263 million  2019 GPF sales exceeded  250 million and we are well on our way to building a greater than  500 million gasoline particulate filter business  With a market leading product  we continue to earn a majority position globally as automakers award platforms to make Euro 6 and China 6 regulations  Sales are accelerating as Euro 6 regulations are in full effect and automakers are preparing for China 6 implementation in 2020 Our Hefei plant start up is ahead of schedule and has been key to delivering incremental sales and net income  We expect continued growth  Looking to 2020 despite continued weakness in the global auto markets and the expected downturn in the North America heavy duty market  we once again expect to grow year over year  with sales up in the mid single digits in the first quarter and for the full year  We expect GPF sales to exceed  350 million for the year Specialty Materials in its    ended strong driven by demand for our premium glasses  Fourth quarter sales were  453 million  up 14  year over year and net income was  94 million  Full year sales were  1 6 billion  up 8  year over year and grew for the fourth straight year despite essentially flat smartphone unit volume  Net income was  302 million Similar to 2019  we expect our growth in 2020 to come from further advancement and adoption of our premium glasses as well as our additional innovations for Mobile Consumer Electronics  We expect Specialty Materials sales to be up by a high single digit percentage for the full year  We expect Q1 sales to be up a mid single digit percentage year over year Life Sciences also ended the year strong  exceeding expectations with fourth quarter sales of  256 million  an increase of 8  year over year  net income was  38 million  up 31  year over year  For the full year  the business reached the milestone of with sales of  1 billion  a 7  increase year over year  Net income was a  150 million  up 28  year over year For 2020 our market outlook  and customer demand remain positive and we expect growth to continue  with full year sales at mid single digits  In the first quarter  we also expect sales to be up mid single digits year over year  Now  let s turn to the consolidated results and outlook Operating cash flow in the quarter was  1 1 billion  As we said in October  we expected to reduce working capital in the second half  We did reduce working capital in Q3 and again in Q4  Full year adjusted operating cash flow was  2 1 billion and capex was just under  2 billion  We are taking actions that will result in stronger operating cash flow and lower capital spending in 2020  We expect capex to be approximately  1 5 billion for the year Gross margin in the fourth quarter was 37   Gross margin was impacted by the lower volume and reduced production output to bring down inventory in Display and Optical Communications  In the first half of 2019  gross margin was 40  in the back half of the year as Display and Optical Communications volumes declined  gross margin also declined to 38   In the first half of 2020 we expect Display and Optical volumes to remain low impacting our gross margin percent  We expect volume in Display and Optical Communications to grow sequentially and year over year in the second half  When that happens  gross margin should improve to approximately 40   In the first quarter  we expect sales to be seasonally lower than the fourth quarter and gross margin to be the lowest for the year  down 100 to 150 basis points from the fourth quarter  We expect gross margin dollars and percentage to increase sequentially thereafter Moving on to the rest of our P L as a percent of sales  We expect SG A and RD E to be nearly 14  and approximately 8 5  respectively for the full year  In addition  we expect other income  other expense to be approximately  275 million in 2020  Full year gross equity earnings are expected to be approximately  170 million  down  67 million from the prior year  The expected decline in 2020 is due to lower expected sales at our Hemlock Semiconductor JV  Most of Hemlock Semiconductor business is under long term take or pay contracts  which include upfront cash payments  In the fourth quarter of 2019  similar to prior years Hemlock sell some of their solar customer contracts  The settlements positively impacted their 2019 cash flow and reduced expectations for future sales in the solar segment  Hemlock took a charge related to realigning capacity to the lower sales level  The business remains quite profitable selling primarily semiconductor products  which are supported by Hemlock s quality leadership and long term take or pay contracts We expect our effective tax rate for 2020 to be approximately 20  to 21   Now  before I close  I know there are a lot of questions on the impact of the Coronavirus on Corning  The safety and well being of our people is our number one priority  We are in close contact with our employees  customers and suppliers  and we are engaging with governments and health services organizations as we monitor the situation  at the same time  we have not factored any meaningful operational or financial impact in our guidance  the situation remains fluid and as more information becomes available  We will update you accordingly  In closing  we expect 2020 to be in many ways the mirror image of 2019  We believe that the first half will remain challenging as markets and customer dynamics reflect  We expect the first half will remain challenging as market and customer dynamics reflect what we ve seen over the last six months  And in the second half  we expect to return to growth in Display and Optical Communications improved and a strong growth continues in Environmental  Specialty Materials and Life Sciences  As this happens  we expect the company to return to grow to growing sales and profitability as we saw in the first half of 2019 Overall  Corning is operating on a strong foundation that we ve built over the past four years and we continue to make progress in key areas  as evidenced by our ongoing customer announcements  We are confident in our ability to achieve the objectives we laid out in our 2020 to 2023 Strategy   Growth Framework With that  let s move to Q A  Ann Ann H S  Nicholson    Vice President Investor RelationsThanks  Tony  Okay  Steve  we re ready for our first question Questions and Answers Operator Operator Instructions  Our first question will come from the line of Rod Hall of Goldman Sachs  Please go ahead Rod Hall    Goldman Sachs    AnalystYeah  thanks for the question  A couple of quick ones  So  on Display pricing  I wanted to start off  Tony and Wendell to whoever wants to answer this  On the    the movement of pricing through 2020 understand that the mid single digit declines are being driven by the movement from Korea to China  But could you talk us through more of that dynamic  What is driving that  Are you assisting that movement with your own pricing or is there a mix of factor or something like that  And then could you also talk about the timing of that is the first half pricing view that we re going to see different from the second half in Display  And then I also wanted to just quickly ask you about Optical  I know  Justin  working on modeling that  And it sounds like you feel like you ve got some better visibility  I m just wondering on the low end of that guide  are you    do you think you are adequately cautious  I guess the answer is  yes  but how do you have any confidence in engaging the risk on Optical  Thanks Tony Tripeny    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerAll right  Rod  Let me first start with the pricing answer  I mean  as you know  most of our contracts get put in place in the fourth quarter and the seasonally the largest price decline that we have in any quarters in the first quarter and that is the case here too  and we expect more moderate price declines is as items move out throughout the year  I think from a Korea standpoint  I think what s important to highlight here is that there is just a lot of change going on in the industry  I think Korea capacity is going to be down around 40  on a year over year basis  So that s a pretty significant decline from a pricing standpoint  from a capacity standpoint  and has that capacity comes offline  It shows back up in China  So  as we see our year flow out  we re going to see less volume  a little bit less volume in the market in the first half of the year and more volume in the back half of the year  And so  I think that that s  that s a trend that s been going on and that s a trend that we really see the impact of our in 2020 Wendell P  Weeks    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI think if we just take through display  First  I think you ve got it right  Rod  on that  just the way in which we do our contracts sort of the pattern of price through the year in a little more weighted earlier in the year than later  I think what Tony was trying to get across is if you take a look at the Korean market or the Korean production and their share of the overall world market  just two years ago they were the largest producer of large size panels in the world  And what s happening is Gen 10 5 plants in LCD are to so much lower cost and you re seeing sort of the China industrial policy of that capital will be underwritten in China  there is giving our Korean customers a challenge to how do they compete  When they have it made that investment in Gen 10 5  So  you re just seeing a pretty natural which begin and what Tony was talking about was that we ve seen announcements out of the Koreans that over time  you re going to see about a 40  reduction in their capacity  all happened this year  but over that time period and you re just going to see that shift toward China and the Gen 10 5 plants Now  when that shifts  there are players at the glass level who are better or worse positioned in that  We are extremely well positioned in that  but the overall industry structure just sort of has to move with that dislocation and so  the fact that we are able to maintain such really good strong pricing performance in the face of this level of announcements for folks  I think is what Tony is getting at is why we feel that s really good news for the pricing environment  And then since we re so well positioned in China  we ll just see that progress that he talked about in the back half  Just continue to accelerate through timeRod Hall    Goldman Sachs    AnalystWendell  Can I just ask you  do you guys think that this year is the year that all this kind of  is this play out this year in the next year  things go back to more of a normal trajectory or do you think this is a multi year kind of transition and it will continue next year to be strange Wendell P  Weeks    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWell  I think you re going to see the bulk of it happen with the    this year with just the fact that how clear the Korean panel makers have become just on their future  We always anticipated  much like we move from Japan to Taiwan and Korea happened that and then we pre positioned for that that we d see this move to China  I think this year what was surprising to everybody in the industry is  as we went through this last supply chain correction is that the Chinese players continue to produce pretty strongly and pretty aggressive pricing for panels and this made the Korean customers sharply act and sort of implement sort of some the long term strategy thought they had in near term and they re just focusing their guns on next gen innovations for their Korean based panel capacity  And while there set arms are sourcing more and more out of the Chinese panel makers  So  our view that the bulk of this move has been announced will feel in the industry will continue to feel its after effects  It s pretty big change  But I think the bulk of it going to be behind us this year Rod Hall    Goldman Sachs    AnalystOkay  thank you  And optical visibility Tony Tripeny    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  I think from an optical visibility standpoint as you re right  Jeff and his team have been doing a lot of work  relative to what the future especially in the near term looks like over the next year or so and we ve tried to integrate that work along with what we know from a business standpoint and what our customers are telling us and the range is really inform for those both of that work  I mean at the minus 5  of the range  that s an indication that we ve got certain customer projects and we re following those closely and if that happens  we ll be closer to that and at the lower end of the range  the minus 10   that would be reflective of what some of those projects actually get themselves pushed out  So  I mean  that s how we ve done the work and clearly we ve  we really are focused on getting better at that over the last six months Rod Hall    Goldman Sachs    AnalystOkay  great  thank you guys  I appreciate it OperatorOur next question will be from the line of Wamsi Mohan  Bank of America  Please go ahead Wamsi Mohan    Bank of America    AnalystYes  thank you  I was wondering if you can maybe talk a little bit about your plans to use this capacity is going to be stranded in LCD in Korea  What timeframe can or should we expect asset redeployment and that to show up in your financial results and I will follow up Wendell P  Weeks    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSo  we ve a basically we ve already done most of that  Korea is a low cost production facility for us  So  what we are doing and what we ve been planning for is to continue to use that as a strong melting source for full sheet to feed some of our finishing operations in China  So  therefore the main piece that we ll see will be on that part of the plants  which is where we finished the last cut it into  into the right sizes  So  that s where we will primarily see that we ve made those adjustments  We have to continue to work our way through just sort of what s the appropriate way is to work our way through all the workforce implications and we re continuing to do that But remember  so much of our higher cost capacity in Display  we have evolved to play into our Gorilla plays and work it and Korea as well  we ve taken a hunk of their panel making production and instead put that in the Gorilla  So  this is all playing out on our long term planning  It s just  it s happening at a little more accelerated fashion  Wamsi Wamsi Mohan    Bank of America    AnalystOkay  Thank you  Wendell  And just as a follow up  there was obviously a meaningful step down here in your FX plans for this year  How should we think about sort of the next couple of years  given what we know about the demand environment here  is this sort of a level that we should expect that we can sustain over a couple of year timeframe or is this something that  given the market conditions and given sort of the more elevated capex levels over the last couple of years that this is sort of more of a one time  How should we think about this capex levels over the next few years  Thank you Tony Tripeny    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerWamsi  as you know  our capex is really kind of divided into two different pieces  one is what it takes to kind of sustain and continue to improve our businesses and then the second is what it takes to build and grow the businesses  especially as we get new customer demand  And so  we re always going to matter  In the longer term is how much additional customer demand and commitments  do we get  And then what is going to drive as far as capital spending  Now of course  once we start those projects  it takes a couple of years for the for both the sales and the revenues to show up  And if you think back on to IR Day  I think  Jeff  did good description of that  But I think as  as we look at in 2020  there are certain projects that were    can finishing up with customer demand that will drive growth in 2021 and 2022 and you know exactly what we ll spend in 2021 and 2022 will just depend on how our innovations continue to evolve and how much customer commitment we get there  So overall  we said we d spend  6 billion to  8 billion and I think these numbers are really consistent with that Wendell P  Weeks    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I think the way to think about the timing is  we ve got but now sort of the bulk of the investment that we need to deliver the revenue and earnings growth that we laid out of our Strategy   Growth Framework Wamsi Mohan    Bank of America    AnalystOkay  thank you for the context  That s helpful Wendell P  Weeks    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerAnd they only thing now  we told to is what happens in the period after that and then how much strong demand will we see that  and then we ll just have to start early because it takes a while to build those facilities  So  that s a little bit far in the future for us to be able to dial up exactly  And as we get closer to it  we ll be a lot more clear with you  sir Wamsi Mohan    Bank of America    AnalystOkay  great  Thank you OperatorOur next question will come from the line of Meta Marshall  Morgan Stanley  Please go ahead Meta Marshall    Morgan Stanley    AnalystGreat  thanks  I wanted to dig a little bit into kind of the growth in Specialty Materials next year  And just  it seems as if just get a sense of how much of that is just from newer generations of Gorilla Glass versus kind of a new use cases  And then maybe second  just a little bit of a description of kind of what is the difference between core and non core gross margins  kind of backing out one time effects that impacted in Q4 and just how that carries forward to Q1 would be helpful  Thank you Tony Tripeny    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerWell  why don t I start with that  I think that there is  as we do the various restructuring actions  Some of that shows up into the gross margin and since that is in part of our ongoing operations  That ends up in our GAAP results  but not in our core results  We did a number of things during the quarter  in particular in Optical Communications and in our Display business  and those are one time charges and that s where you see that Wendell P  Weeks    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerAnd in Specialty  the bulk of our financial drivers are the new generations of glass  But we will also see some revenue growth out of our new innovation sets that are non glass especially our group of very durable optical treatments and that is a little bit lower gross margin percent then glass  but clearly this next year we re counting on our glass innovations to get adopted and that providing strong growth in an overall unit growth market  which we are not anticipating to grow strongly Meta Marshall    Morgan Stanley    AnalystGot it  Thank you OperatorOur next question will come from the line of Samik Chatterjee  J P  Morgan  Please go ahead Samik Chatterjee    J P  Morgan    AnalystHi  thanks for taking the question  if I can just start off on Environmental Technologies and going to be  if you can talk to the  what do you expecting  What s the driver for the moderation in growth that you re expecting from the teens growth rate you had this year in 2019 to more of a mid single digit in 2020  Is that kind of content moderation on automotive or is that more driven by the diesel segment  which obviously has a more challenging outlook  I believe Tony Tripeny    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerIt is mostly driven by the change in the diesel segment  GPF we feel continues to be very strong and we expect sales to be up few  Phonetic  million dollars in 2020  They were up more than that in 2019  but we re well on our way to the  0 5 billion goal that we set out for this business  where we are clearly the market leader and continue to have great success Samik Chatterjee    J P  Morgan    AnalystOkay  thank you Wendell P  Weeks    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerAnd if I can you still segment  you re going to see us because you going to see the North American heavy duty diesel market as you ll see from talking to our customers that we expect to go through down cycle here  but we are replacing that with our gates  And as the Chinese adopt some of our new tech and there diesel market  So that s why I ve sort of moderating Samik Chatterjee    J P  Morgan    AnalystAnd Tony  if you can quickly clarify what s driving the confidence in improving cash flow in 2020 versus 2019 when the outlook on the profitability or profit side  seems to be more kind of flat to down modestly Tony Tripeny    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSo  there is a couple of things there  I mean I think the first thing is that in 2019  we built a lot of working capital  And now we always but build inventory and working capital as we expect businesses to grow but obviously compared to the first part of the year  our businesses didn t grow as much  So there is  we wouldn t be growing as much working capital in 2020 as we did in 2019  And then the second thing is  in the back half of the year  we do expect to see growth on a year over year basis and I think that will help us from a cash flow standpoint  And then of course  finally  we are going to also reduce our capital spending compared to what we spent in 2019  So from an overall standpoint  we expect our free cash flow to be much greater than it was this year Samik Chatterjee    J P  Morgan    AnalystAll right  thank you  Thanks for taking the call Operator Operator Instructions  Our next question will come from the line of Steven Fox of Cross Research  Please go ahead Steven Fox    Cross Research    AnalystHi  good morning  I had a question  a couple of questions on Optical actually  First of all  I was curious on your view on the  just the industry supply situation  My understanding is that there is quite a bit of excess capacity in China for fiber and cable  I understand you cannot move seamlessly across the globe  But it seems to be making its way into Europe  are you guys factoring in any of those any of that excess supply into your model  should we be concerned about pricing pressure risks as the year goes on  And then I have follow up Wendell P  Weeks    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI think on that would  Steve  You are seeing that to the extent that is going to impact us  is already in our financials  The actual level of excess inventory in China has been trending down  there is still some to come  I think how rapidly the Chinese market tightens up will depend a lot on this upcoming tender  it will see out of China Mobile  We anticipate that is part of this  they will lay forward a little more clearly what their 5G plans are and therefore what they ll need to densify that network  If that comes out with a very aggressive set of 5G builds  then the China market itself will tighten up very significantly  If it s not quite as aggressive  we ll just have a little bit longer tail  We think we ve got the bulk of that in these numbers Steven Fox    Cross Research    AnalystOkay  that s very helpful  Thanks for that  And then just in terms of the Optical margins  I guess the rough math is you did about 9  pre tax margins this quarter  which is about half of what you are doing a few quarters ago  So  I guess maybe just I think I understand the walk from 18  to 9   but if there is anything you want to point out there  But more importantly when you get to the second half of the year  if you re executing or demand is where you think it s going to be  are the percent margins reasonable or should we think about that is taking a little longer to come back  Thanks Tony Tripeny    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerI think from an overall standpoint  our margins in this business and it s Display all about volume and we had significant decline in volume in the back half of last year  16  on a year over year basis and that really impacts our factory utilizations and the like and that clearly causes our margins to go down  And we do expect to return to growth in the back half of 2020 and when that happens  we get both the benefit of that volume  But of course  we ve also done some cost reductions during that period of time  So we expect  from an overall standpoint  we d get back to the 40  gross margins and Optical both Optical and Display would also get back to where they were before Steven Fox    Cross Research    AnalystGreat  very helpful  Thank you OperatorOur next question will come from the line of Asiya Merchant of Citigroup  Please go ahead Asiya Merchant    Citigroup    AnalystGreat  thank you for taking my questions  Lot of them have been answered  but just had a quick question on Specialty Materials  knowing that this primarily goes into a lot of smart phones  we re starting to see smartphones inflect to growth this year  Calendar  20 driven by 5G models  etc  The growth rate that you talked about  should we expect some inflection there  I think you re guiding for growth rate to be similar to what it was this year given that it was slightly down market for smartphone  Thank you Tony Tripeny    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  I think from an overall standpoint  clearly of smartphones  started to grow  you would  that would certainly impact our business but what s really has made the difference from our business standpoint is the content that we provide on the smartphones  As Wendell said  I mean  we ve grown 40  over four year has grown every single year in the last four years  even though the number of smartphone units have been down in most of those years  And so  yes  I think as you get more smartphones that might put us at the higher end of the high single digits  But the really matters  there are  is our premium glass strategy and some of our other innovations and that s what s really driving our growth Asiya Merchant    Citigroup    AnalystAnd so  should we expect that 5G phones  We have higher content  but I think you guys have talked a lot about higher content and other category in other consumer electronics as well  So  if you could just maybe talk a little bit about that  And then just on margins  Sorry to keep talking about that  The 40  inflecting to 40   is that something we expect in the third quarter  third quarter  is it more toward the fourth quarter  it s really depends on how quickly or does it just simply a matter of that 5  to 10  range that you talked about that in the Optical segment  Thank you Wendell P  Weeks    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerLet me start with the 5G phone and then I ll turn it over to Tony  on the profitability  So yes  I think your hypothesis on 5G using more of our content is true  We don t anticipate that 5G becomes a very large segment in smartphones here in this coming year  but you are right  it has more of our content  it tends to be the most premium phones  which is our very best glass and because of the nature of what it takes to deliver 5G  we have an increase in the need for RF transparency  which tends to increase the amount of glass required on those phones I think sort of a question back for you  We would be very interested if you are now predicting a positive inflection point in smartphone unit sales  We currently aren t counting on that  if you have any insight into that  that would be helpful to us Tony Tripeny    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerOkay  And then on margins  you re absolutely right  I mean I think what requires for the margins to get back to the 40  is the volume increase that we expect in the back half of the year and exactly where that ends up in the timing of that volume increase is what s going to drive us back to 40  in the back half of the year  we should be back at the 40  number Asiya Merchant    Citigroup    AnalystGreat  thank you Ann H S  Nicholson    Vice President Investor RelationsOperator  we ve got time for one more question OperatorAnd that question will come from the line of Tim Long of Barclays  Please go ahead Tim Long    Barclays    AnalystThank you  Yeah  let me just squeeze two quick ones in if I could  I just wanted to go back to the GPF market  You highlighted  better than expected results in 2019 and  100 million additional next year just talk a little bit about what you think drove the outperformance this year  do you think it was better share  Were there any advance sales into the China market or what specifically drove that  and that help in the trajectory next year  And then on the auto glass side  can you just give us an update on timing there  it sounds like  still a lot of wins  but when  when can we start to see more meaningful contribution there  Thank you Wendell P  Weeks    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSo on the GPF side  our product shrinks the relative advantages of our product led to us winning more than we originally planned  So that is one driver  The other is that with the move to real world driving the automotive companies are envisioning perhaps use of GPF and even some more advanced GPF technologies on more and more of their vehicle platforms  So  that s more of a longer term piece  It s in pretty much everything that we ve worked so far has been positive about our relative position in GPF and the need for this technology to help clean up cars even further  especially in a city environment Tony Tripeny    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerAnd then on the auto glass piece  I mean  clearly we re winning these awards and our factories ramping  So  we will see some increased sales this year  But as you know  the automotive market in the supply chain takes longer than say the mobile consumer electronic supply chain  So  the bigger impact of that will be in 2021  but we will see some increases as we go through each quarter of this year Wendell P  Weeks    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYes  So net after we break through that  that sort of  100 million revenue run rate level will our analytics  would be able to click and can be a lot more helpful to you and us and being able to guide the trajectory going forward  We just need a little more data  We need to get implanted in a few more places was breakthrough that run rate and then we should be able to be a little more accurate for you  sir Tim Long    Barclays    AnalystOkay  thank you very much Ann H S  Nicholson    Vice President Investor RelationsThanks  All right  thank you everybody

214485,436001,GLW,The Silver Lining in Corning s Latest Challenging Quarter,news,"When Corning  NYSE GLW  announced fourth quarter 2019 results early Wednesday  the market s initial positive reaction was no surprise considering those results arrived comfortably above both Wall Street s models and management s guidance laid out three months ago  But shares of the glass centric tech stock have since all but given up that brief post earnings surge both as investors absorbed news of difficult industry conditions and as broader market indexes pulled back on coronavirus fears 
The silver lining  Corning continues to outpace the growth of the industries on which it relies  leaving it well positioned to profit handsomely when those industries rebound 
In the meantime  let s take a closer look at how Corning ended its tumultuous year  as well as what the company had to say about its future expectations 

Data source  Corning  GAAP   generally accepted accounting principles  
While it s important to examine GAAP results  Corning also provides  core   non GAAP  metrics to offer clarity on the performance of its underlying businesses  This effectively means excluding items like foreign currency translation  acquisition costs  and restructuring expenses 
To that end  Corning s core net sales in Q4 fell a more modest 4  year over year  to  2 851 billion  Its core net income declined 25  to  406 million  and fell 22  on a per share basis to  0 46  By comparison  leading into the report analysts  consensus estimates had called for lower core earnings of  0 44 per share on core sales of  2 7 billion 

By business segment  Corning s display technologies sales fell 12  to  795 million  translating to a 25  decline in segment net income to  180 million  While display glass volumes outpaced the market with mid single digit percent growth    in line with expectations detailed in September    that growth was more than offset by a moderated low single digit percent decline in display glass pricing 
Next  optical communications segment sales dropped 23  to  903 million  leaving full year 2019 sales down 3  even as the broader optical market endured high single digit percent declines  After coupling those lower volumes with reduced production in an effort to lower inventories  optical segment net income fell a steep 63  to  62 million 
Corning s smaller businesses fared better  Quarterly life sciences sales rose 8  year year over to  256 million  well ahead of the lab equipment niche it serves  driving a 31  increase in segment net income to  38 million  Environmental technologies sales also rose 17  to  374 million  thanks to sustained gas particulate filter demand  sending segment net income up an impressive 52  to  64 million  And specialty materials    which notably includes Corning s premium Gorilla Glass cover glass products    jumped 14  to  453 million  translating to an 8  increase in segment net income to  94 million 
 Expect to build momentum throughout 2020    
Corning chairman and CEO Wendell Weeks elaborated 

In 2019  we grew sales 2  driven by strong performance in three businesses  We advanced key growth initiatives and took actions to address the material impact of changing market and customer dynamics in Display Technologies and Optical Communications  While our 2019 growth did not meetlong term targets  we once again outperformed our underlying markets and expect to build momentum throughout 2020 that will keep us on track to achieve the goals set forth in our four year Strategy   Growth Framework 

Of course  Weeks was referring to Corning s new 2020 2023 Strategy   Growth Framework introduced last June  under which the company is targeting annual sales growth of 6  to 8   and compound annual growth in earnings per share of 12  to 15   Corning also pledged to return  8 billion to  10 billion to shareholders through 2023 via stock repurchases and dividends  even as it invests  10 billion to  12 billion back into growing the business through a combination of RD E  research  development  and engineering   capital investments  and mergers   acquisitions 
In the meantime for 2020  according to CFO Tony Tripeny  Corning sees continued growth for the three smaller segments  Specialty Materials  Life Sciences  and Environmental Technologies   And on a consolidated basis  management believes Corning will  return to sales and profit growth and expand margins  by the second half of 2020  driven largely by improved volumes in both the core display technologies and optical communications businesses 
That s fair enough  it s a telling sign of Corning s dominance and leadership that it continues to outgrow the industries it targets  after all  And Corning remains well positioned to benefit when those industries turn for the better  So while it s no surprise to see investors offering a muted positive reaction to this stronger than expected end to 2019  I still think the stock is a compelling bet for patient  long term shareholders ",2020-02-01,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/ppt9l,2073734

214503,436019,GLW,Corning  GLW  Beats Q3 Earnings And Revenue Estimates,opinion,"Corning  GLW  came out with quarterly earnings of  0 44 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 40 per share  This compares to earnings of  0 51 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 10   A quarter ago  it was expected that this specialty glass maker would post earnings of  0 44 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 45  delivering a surprise of 2 27  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
Corning  which belongs to the Zacks Communication   Components industry  posted revenues of  2 97 billion for the quarter ended September 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 62   This compares to year ago revenues of  3 05 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Corning shares have added about 1 3  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 21 3  
What s Next for Corning 
While Corning has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock

214507,436023,GLW,Earnings Preview  Corning  GLW  Q4 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Corning  GLW  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 29  2020  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This specialty glass maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 44 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  25 4  
Revenues are expected to be  2 69 billion  down 12 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 93  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Corning 
For Corning  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 38  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Corning will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Corning would post earnings of  0 40 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 44  delivering a surprise of  10  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Corning doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2020-01-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-corning-glw-q4-earnings-expected-to-decline-200500700,200500700

214519,436035,GLW,Why Corning Stock Declined 3 6  in 2019,news,"What happened
Shares of Corning  NYSE GLW  declined 3 6  in 2019  according to data from S P Global Market Intelligence  trailing far behind the S P 500 s impressive 29  gain 
To be fair  the glass centric tech stock started the year on a high note  rising 15  through the end of February on the heels of its strong fourth quarter 2018 report  But Corning all but gave up those gains after its subsequent quarterly updates showed headwinds impeding the growth of its core optical communications segment 

So what
To be sure  Corning first tempered its optical growth expectations at the end of April  calling for full year gains of 10   down from the low teens before  after a  major fiber to the home customer  shifted the timing of a large optical deployment  Still  Corning largely reiterated its previous expectations for its remaining display technologies  environmental  life sciences  and specialty materials segments at the time 
Then shares slumped in late July when Corning posted reasonably solid second quarter 2019 results  but followed by further reducing its expected optical segment growth to be in the low  to mid single digit percent range for the year due to carrier customer weakness  
More recently in September  Corning piled on investors  concerns by not only lowering its outlook for the optical segment yet again    this time calling for sales to decline 3  to 5  for all of 2019 on lower spending from certain enterprise customers    but also by slashing expectations for its display technologies segment volume to increase only slightly for the full year  down from guidance for high single digit volume growth before  
Now what
As it stands  Corning is now trading roughly flat from where it stood a year ago and around 14  below its 52 week high  But I do think there s reason for optimism surrounding the stock considering the underlying causes for Corning s stalling growth aren t necessarily indicative of a company losing market share to competitors  Rather  they re a function of acting as an industry leader for markets facing headwinds that won t last forever  leaving Corning primed to benefit when those markets eventually  inevitably rebound  That s why  as I wrote last month  Corning management remains confident in its strategy for creating shareholder value over the long term  And I think Corning s depressed stock price will ultimately reflect as much ",2020-01-13,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/phi4c,2058312

214584,436100,GLW,Corning  GLW  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Corning  GLW  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 30  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This specialty glass maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 44 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  15 8  
Revenues are expected to be  2 97 billion  up 7 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 39  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Corning 
For Corning  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Corning will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Corning would post earnings of  0 39 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 40  delivering a surprise of  2 56  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Corning doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/corning-glw-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200443274,200443274

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 3 51   A quarter ago  it was expected that this specialty glass maker would post earnings of  0 48 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 51  delivering a surprise of 6 25  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
Corning  which belongs to the Zacks Communication   Components industry  posted revenues of  3 08 billion for the quarter ended December 2018  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 10   This compares to year ago revenues of  2 74 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Corning shares have added about 0 5  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 5 5  
What s Next for Corning 
While Corning has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Corning was unfavorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

214609,436125,GLW,Corning  GLW  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Corning  GLW  reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 30  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This specialty glass maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 39 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  25 8  
Revenues are expected to be  2 81 billion  up 12  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 85  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Corning 
For Corning  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  3 90  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Corning will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Corning would post earnings of  0 57 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 59  delivering a surprise of  3 51  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Corning doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/corning-glw-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200409492,200409492

How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then 
In the past month  investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates 
VGM Scores
At this time  Corning has a strong Growth Score of A  though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with an F  However  the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side  putting it in the second quintile for this investment strategy 
Overall  the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B  If you aren t focused on one strategy  this score is the one you should be interested in 
Outlook
Estimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock  and the magnitude of this revision indicates a downward shift  Notably  Corning has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   We expect an above average return from the stock in the next few months ",2018-11-21,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/corning-glw-up-14-since-last-earnings-report-can-it-continue-200361767,200361767
214635,436151,GLW,GLW Vs  VCRA  Which Stock Should Value Investors Buy Now ,opinion,"Investors interested in Communication   Components stocks are likely familiar with Corning  GLW  and Vocera Communications  VCRA   But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors  We ll need to take a closer look to find out 
There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks  but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns  The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits 
Currently  both Corning and Vocera Communications are holding a Zacks Rank of   2  Buy   The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates  so investors should rest assured that both of these companies have improving earnings outlooks  But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in 
Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics  including the popular P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors 
GLW currently has a forward P E ratio of 18 12  while VCRA has a forward P E of 80 95  We also note that GLW has a PEG ratio of 2 06  This figure is similar to the commonly used P E ratio  with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company s expected earnings growth rate  VCRA currently has a PEG ratio of 4 34 
Another notable valuation metric for GLW is its P B ratio of 2 19  The P B ratio pits a stock s market value against its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  VCRA has a P B of 7 99 
These metrics  and several others  help GLW earn a Value grade of B  while VCRA has been given a Value grade of D 
Both GLW and VCRA are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks  but based on these valuation figures  we feel that GLW is the superior value option right now ",2018-12-12,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/glw-vs-vcra-which-stock-should-value-investors-buy-now-200367782,200367782

214640,436156,GLW,UPDATE 1 LG Display shares rise after Japan quake,news,"  Shares in No  2 LCD maker rise 2 3 pct in down market
   Production halt at glass factory expected to hit Sharp
   Nomura upgrades LCD sector to neutral from bearish
  Adds details  more analyst comments 
 SEOUL  Aug 12  Reuters    Shares in South Korean LCD maker
LG Display rose while those in Japanese competitor Sharp fell on
Wednesday  after news that an earthquake had disrupted glass
production in Japan and may deepen an ongoing shortage 
 Corning Inc on Tuesday said it had halted production of
liquid crystal display  LCD  glass at a factory in Japan
following an earthquake there  warning the shutdown would mean
the volume of glass shipments in the third quarter would decline
5 to 10 percent from the second quarter 
 Shares in LG Display  the world s second biggest maker of
LCD panels  rose 2 33 percent to 35 200 won at 0050 GMT 
outpacing the broader market s 0 74 percent drop 
 By contrast Sharp  Japan s only major LCD supplier  fell 2 6
percent to 1 085 yen as it was expected to be directly affected
by the Corning stoppage 
  Glass supply was already tight and this quake will
contribute even more to that  This is good news for LG Display
as a lead maker of LCDs   said Moon Hyun sik  an analyst at
Meritz Securities 
  As we believe it should take at least two months to repair
the furnaces from the disruption  we expect    panel prices will
maintain a stable trend  in the fourth quarter of 2009 and the
first quarter of 2010     and panel makers  earnings will be
positively affected   Nomura analyst James Kim said in a
research report 
 Kim said he was planning to review the earnings of LG
Display and Taiwanese competitors AU Optronics Corp and CMO 
 Last week  an LG Display executive told Reuters he expected
the uptrend in PC screen prices to continue into October because
of the glass shortage

By Elaine Lies
 TOKYO  Aug 12  Reuters    Asian stocks sagged on Wednesday 
with Shanghai shares tumbling to a four week low  as investors
locked in profits and waited to hear what the Federal Reserve
has to say about prospects for U S  economic recovery 
 The Shanghai fall  set off by worries that a surge in
Chinese shares has outrun economic recovery and that a drop off
in bank lending means less money flowing into shares  also
helped the yen strengthen against the dollar 
 European shares were expected to be mixed following a
two session retreat  though gains were seen likely for most
exchanges  with investors awaiting the Fed outcome 
  The MSCI index of Asian markets excluding Japan
 slipped 1 1 percent  still in retreat from last
week s 11 month peak 
 China s central bank said on Tuesday that banks extended
355 9 billion yuan   52 billion  in new local currency loans in
July  down from 1 53 trillion yuan in June and a sharper fall
than many analysts had forecast   ID nPEK158166  
 A sizeable share of bank loans in the first half is
believed to have gone into the stock market  helping push the
Shanghai index up more than 80 percent as of last week 
  The rally in the  Shanghai  index has far exceeded the
speed of economic recovery   said Western Securities analyst
Cao Xuefeng 
  Yesterday s mixed economic data and sharp drop in bank
lending heightened such worries  while weak overseas markets
triggered the sell off  
 The Shanghai Composite Index  fell 3 5 percent on
worries about a possible tightening of market liquidity
following the sharp drop in July bank lending  The losses
pressured Hong Kong s Hang Seng index   which fell 1 9
percent  coming down from a 12 month closing high the previous
day 
 The Nikkei  pulled back from 10 month highs  losing
1 4 percent 
 Sharp Corp  6753 T  fell after an earthquake forced
supplier Corning Inc  to halt production of LCD glass at
a Japanese factory  while Astellas Pharma  4503 T  extended
losses after Novartis  launch of the first generic version of
its transplant drug triggered a ratings downgrade

  A fall in Chinese stocks tends to bring down Japanese
stocks as well  Investors in Europe and the United States watch
China when making their investment decisions  with the whole
world now hugely depending on the Chinese economy   said
Kenichi Hirano  operating officer at Tachibana Securities 
 In Seoul  the Korea Composite Stock Price Index

 AHEAD OF FED
 The Fed started its two day meeting on Tuesday  with
expectations that it will leave benchmark interest rates near
zero and let a  300 billion programme to buy Treasury
securities expire on schedule in September as economic gloom
lifts 
 But after a report showing U S  firms continue to cut
inventories as they lack confidence in the economy  analysts
expect the Fed will try to dampen speculation about higher
interest rates while still supporting hopes that the makings of
a recovery are at hand 
 Its statement is due at about 1815 GMT 
 Wall Street fell after a prominent banking analyst warned
the sector s fundamentals had yet to improve and the drop in
wholesale inventories raised worries about recovery as U S 
wholesalers cut inventories of unsold goods for the 10th month
in a row in July    N 
  World share markets have been moving in tandem for a while
and there s growing concern that many have been overbought 
which may lead to a bit of adjustment after all the gains  
said Masayoshi Okamoto  head of dealing at Jujiya Securities in
Tokyo 
 The yen rose against the dollar  extending gains of the
previous day as investors liquidated yen short positions ahead
of the Fed on the view that the Japanese currency s slide after
last week s U S  jobs data had run its course for now 
 The dollar slipped 0 4 percent to 95 55 yen  and the
Australian dollar dropped 1 percent to 78 73 yen  
 The euro was steady at  1 4144  
 U S  crude futures steadied below  70 a barrel

 U S  Treasury debt prices held steady after rising in the

214654,436170,GLW,Corning Stock Could Be A Buy Before Earnings,opinion,"Glass concern Corning Incorporated  NYSE GLW  will report earnings before the open tomorrow  Oct  23  The shares have pulled back with the broader stock market of late  but if recent history is any indicator  it could be time to bet bullishly on GLW 
Corning stock notched a 17 year high of  36 56 on Sept  21  but since then has surrendered roughly 16  to trade around  30 81  on pace for its first monthly loss since April  However  GLW is now within one standard deviation of its 160 day and 200 day moving averages  after a lengthy stretch north of these trendlines    and similar pullbacks have had bullish implications in the past 
Specifically  in the past three years  Corning shares have experienced a similar pullback to the 160 day trendline four times  after which the stock went on to average a one month gain of 4 35   and was higher 75  of the time  per data from Schaeffer s Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White  Meanwhile  GLW has experienced similar pullbacks to the 200 day on three occasions  averaging a subsequent one month gain of 5 26   and higher two thirds of the time 
Along with double barreled trendline support  the stock could also find a foothold in the round number  30 region  This area is where GLW was trading prior to a third quarter bull gap  and acted as a ceiling in the early part of 2018 

In fact  the aforementioned bull gap came on the heels of a well received Corning earnings report in late July  with GLW shares enjoying a one day gain of 11 3  after reporting  Looking back eight quarters  the stock has averaged a single session post earnings reaction of 5 1   regardless of direction  This time around  the options market is pricing in a bigger than usual 9 1  swing for GLW  per implied volatility data 
Should Corning stock  once again  bounce off key trendlines    especially in the wake of another blowout earnings report    there s plenty of room on the bullish bandwagon for the oversold stock  Just three of eight analysts following GLW deem it worthy of a  buy  or better rating  and recent option buyers have been upping the bearish ante 
On the International Securities Exchange  ISE   Chicago Board Options Exchange  CBOE   and NASDAQ OMX PHLX  PHLX   the stock s 10 day put call volume ratio of 0 78 is in the 95th percentile of its annual range  While this tells us that calls bought to open have outnumbered puts on an absolute basis lately  the percentile indicates GLW option buyers have demonstrated a much healthier than usual appetite for bearish bets over bullish in the past two weeks ",2018-10-23,Schaeffer's Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/corning-stock-could-be-a-buy-before-earnings-200349842,200349842

214657,436173,GLW,GLW Vs  ACIA  Which Stock Should Value Investors Buy Now ,opinion,"Investors interested in Communication   Components stocks are likely familiar with Corning  GLW  and Acacia Communications  Inc   ACIA   But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors  We ll need to take a closer look to find out 
We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions  while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits 
Corning and Acacia Communications  Inc  are sporting Zacks Ranks of  2  Buy  and  3  Hold   respectively  right now  This means that GLW s earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive  so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook  But this is only part of the picture for value investors 
Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics  These include the long favored P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company s fair value 
GLW currently has a forward P E ratio of 18 91  while ACIA has a forward P E of 55 54  We also note that GLW has a PEG ratio of 2 15  This metric is used similarly to the famous P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock s expected earnings growth rate  ACIA currently has a PEG ratio of 4 47 
Another notable valuation metric for GLW is its P B ratio of 2 29  The P B is a method of comparing a stock s market value to its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  ACIA has a P B of 3 42 
Based on these metrics and many more  GLW holds a Value grade of B  while ACIA has a Value grade of D 
GLW stands above ACIA thanks to its solid earnings outlook  and based on these valuation figures  we also feel that GLW is the superior value option right now ",2018-11-06,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/glw-vs-acia-which-stock-should-value-investors-buy-now-200356201,200356201

214785,436301,GLW,What s In Store For Corning  GLW  This Earnings Season ,opinion,"Corning Inc    NYSE GLW   is set to report second quarter 2016 results on Jul 27  before the market opens  Last quarter  the company s earnings matched the Zacks Consensus Estimate 
Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement CORNING INC Price and EPS Surprise
   Factors to Consider
Corning s first quarter earnings were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  However  revenues missed by only a small margin  Revenues also dropped 8 2  sequentially and 9 6  year over year 
In the first quarter  Corning s sales in Display  Environmental  Specialty Materials and Life Sciences were met or exceeded expectations  While strong demand was observed in the Optical Communications segment  deployment issues with new manufacturing software interrupted the company s cabling production and posed a problem to fulfilling customer orders  This had a substantial effect on the company s revenues 
Corning s management is upbeat on the sequential growth that s showing up across its various business verticals  Management s capital allocation plans also remain on track 
Going into the second quarter  Corning expects sequential sales growth in all of its business segments  except Environmental  which it expects will underperform slightly 
Optical Communications  The company expects sales to grow more than 20  on a sequential basis  It expects moderate decline in LCD glass prices in the second quarter compared with the first quarter as the market conditions are more stable 
Environmental  Corning expects strong demand in the auto market  However  given the weak demand for heavy trucks in North America and China  which is likely to continue in the coming quarters  Corning expects sales to be flat year over year 
Speciality Materials  Gorilla Glass volume is expected to grow on both sequential and year over year basis  Corning expects low single digit growth in this segment compared with the same quarter a year ago 
Life Sciences  Despite some headwinds due to a weaker euro  Corning expects to post single digit growth in this segment on a year over year basis 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Corning will beat estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 32 cents  Hence  the difference is 0 00  
Zacks Rank  Corning s Zacks Rank  1 when combined with a 0 00  ESP makes surprise prediction difficult 
We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
Stocks to Consider
One can consider the following stocks with a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank instead 
Bruker Corp    NASDAQ BRKR    with an Earnings ESP of  5 26  and a Zacks Rank  1  The company is slated to report second quarter 2016 earnings on Aug 2 
Open Text Corp    NASDAQ OTEX    with an Earnings ESP of  1 10  and a Zacks Rank  1  The company is set to report fourth quarter fiscal 2016 earnings results on Jul 27  2016

214839,436355,GLW,Corning  Short Term Catalysts Long Term Value,opinion,Those who are familiar with my work know that I like it when investment ideas remind me of prior decisions that have worked out well  Corning Inc   GLW  reminds me of other cyclical stocks that have done well once earnings estimates first start to get revised upward  A year ago  the street was expecting Corning to earn  2 per share in 2013  Today  the consensus expectation for 2013 EPS is  1 43  In early 2011  Corning was trading above  22  It is now below  13  which puts it at 9x 2013 EPS and below book value  The company recently increased its dividend  yield of close to 3    LCD GlassCorning is involved in several businesses  but most of its earnings currently come from LCD glass  The LCD glass industry went into oversupply  because of two simultaneous events  First  the weak economy caused demand to be less than expected for LCD TVs  computer monitors and laptops  Second  the industry started a transition to using thinner glass  which effectively increased supply  The industry is currently half way through this transition  The oversupply caused pricing pressure and market share loss for Corning and was the primary reason for the dramatic cut in earnings expectations for the company  Corning responded by taking close to a quarter of its own capacity offline  Since Corning has about half of the industry s supply  that move resulted in a moderation of pricing pressure  On the company s Q2 earnings call  CFO Jim Flaws stated   Our quarter two price declines for LCD glass were indeed much more moderate than the previous two quarters   During the question and answer session of the call  Flaws also stated   I m delighted by the Q3 pricing that we basically have reached agreement with almost all of our customers already   With pricing more of a known variable  the company appears to be set to beat earnings expectations in the short term for several reasons  Corning s Outlook1  Demand has turned out to be better than expected  Since Corning s last earnings call  there have been many industry data points that imply strengthening business conditions  AU Optronics  AUO   one of Corning s largest customers  reported September quarter revenue that was better than expected  When AUO initially gave Q3 guidance at the end of July  it expected large panel shipments to be flat sequentially from Q2  Actual shipments wound up being up close to 5  sequentially  A couple of weeks ago  Nippon Electric Glass  NEG   the number three manufacturer of LCD glass  also revised upward its expectations for the September quarter  Retail TV Demand from China during its Golden Week Holiday appears to have been better than expected  This is important since Corning s CFO specifically highlighted Chinese demand as the biggest risk factor during the Q2 earnings call  He stated   I feel our biggest risk is our television forecast is China   Despite all these positive industry data points  consensus estimates for Corning s Q3 have barely changed  2  Currency has gone in Corning s favor  Something many people usually miss is that the company prices much of its LCD glass in Japanese Yen  The Yen has strengthened versus Q2  The stronger Yen will not only help the company beat short term expectations  but it will also give even more confidence to bulls who are looking for continued moderation in pricing pressure  3  The company has become more aggressive with returning capital to shareholders  It recently increased its dividend by 20   Corning also bought back close to 2  of its total shares outstanding in Q2  This was at a faster pace than Q1  The Street does not appear to be accurately modeling Corning s share buyback going forward  Most expect the company s share count to increase going forward when it should be decreasing  People who are bearish on Corning will point out how the stock has recently risen from slightly below  11 to about  13 per share in a couple of months  They will affirm that recent data points are already  priced in   The problem with this point of view is that it is fails to take into account the larger context  While the stock has done well recently  it has still underperformed massively over the last couple of years  A large portion of industry supply has been taken off line and the most painful part of the transition to thin glass is in the rear view mirror  At the current valuation  the stock is not priced like a company that is expected to beat earnings expectations  The price to earnings multiple at 9x can only go up from here and it should go up given the improved certainty around industry pricing and the return to growth  Q4 should be the first quarter in a long time when revenue and EPS inflect back to positive year over year growth  This is usually a positive for the multiples of cyclical companies  Longer term  there are several potential positive scenarios for the company  I do not necessarily have a strong view about any of these  but at the current valuation  I think of the stock as a cheap call option  Actually  it s better than a call option  because instead of paying a premium  I get paid close to a 3  dividend to wait  Positive Scenarios1  Large new business opportunities and diversification should help the stock s price to earnings multiple  Corning is an R D company that has regularly reinvented itself over its long history  During the dot com bubble  it was primarily known as a supplier of fiber optics and it is currently viewed as a manufacturer of LCD glass  The company s labs are constantly churning out new technologies  It is only a matter of time until one or more of these new products become another big business for the company  Furthermore  because some of the technologies Corning is working on leverage its existing manufacturing facilities  there is the potential that its success leads to better industry supply conditions and pricing for LCD glass  The company s effort in glass for solar panels is one example  Corning is working on lightweight glass that would protect solar panels but also would make them much more efficient at generating electricity  Since the Street is not modeling anything from this new business  any success in this area would be a source of earnings upside  Moreover  since solar glass would be made with LCD glass factories  success in solar glass could also lead to upside in pricing for LCD glass  Even without a large new explosive business  corning s earnings should become more diversified over time as other businesses are expected to grow faster than LCD  In an upgrade note published in mid September  Goldman Sachs noted that it expects Corning s LCD business to account for 74  of earnings in 2013 down from 96  in 2009  The diversification should lead to less cyclicality and increased predictability over time  This  in turn  should improve the stock s multiple  2  Replacement demand and a housing recovery could drive an upturn in LCD TVs  According to the company  the average LCD TV is replaced about every 6 5 years  This replacement rate implies that a very small amount of current TV demand is for replacement  However  that will change in a couple of years  In 2008  there were about 118 million LCD TV units sold  Replacement demand for these units could drive an upturn in overall TV demand in 2014   Furthermore  while many expect housing to recover  current TV demand expectations assume little to no correlation to housing  Therefore  any positive correlation could lead to upside  I hypothesize that the correlation is higher than people think  I personally bought a new TV when I recently moved into a new apartment and I know several other people where this was also the case  Since industry supply has been taken off line  any significant upside surprise in demand could cause pricing to actually go up for a short period of time  This has happened in the past and there is no reason why it can t happen one day again if demand improves  3  Windows 8 could drive an improvement in PC demand  While most believe that the PC market is secularly challenged  there is an argument that PC demand is also cyclically depressed ahead of the launch of Windows 8  Any significant cyclical improvement could lead to upside to industry demand projections  Of course  there is also the risk that Christmas demand for TVs and PCs is very weak  Retail demand will be the main variable to monitor  The Japanese Yen is another variable to keep an eye on  As of now  channel inventories appear to be in good shape and I feel relatively confident with the stock s risk   reward  A stock s price is a function of earnings and the multiple applied to its earnings  Both the earnings and the multiple are more likely to be revised upward than downward after Corning s Q3 results are reported  I am apparently not alone in thinking this  A few corporate insiders have bought stock at around this same price over the last several months Please see the associated with this blog  I own shares in GLW and may trade in and out of it without posting new information  You should consult with a
