1715,223230,DORM,8 Stocks To Watch  CGC  CRC  RIGL  SLCA  DORM  GRUB  IIN  TLRD,opinion,"It was an interesting  topsy turvy  volatile day on this FOMC Wednesday  No question that the news was great  the stocks exploded  and then pulled back with a little bounce at the close  We ll see what happens on Thursday  Right now  I am going to show you both longs and shorts and highlight several here 
Stocks on the Long Side   
Canopy Growth Corporation  CGC 
CGC started to pop on Wednesday  getting up to resistance and backing off  but gaining 76 cents or 1 65   to 46 87  on 14 7 million shares  That s the largest volume in a month  This is one to watch  If it breaks across that zone of resistance  it s going to fly  So  keep an eye on it 
California Resources Corporation  CRC 
CRC one of my favorite oil stocks  had a nice day on Wednesday as oil increased to over 60  This one jumped 1 86  or 7 38   to 27 05  on 3 1 million shares  The volume increased to about the best in three weeks  It looks pretty good  I think we re going to see 30 and 36 coming up 
Rigel Pharmaceuticals  Inc   RIGL 
RIGL which I put a swing on recently  actually came through on Wednesday and pulled right back to it  closing flat at 2 57  on 2 1 million shares  There might be a buy here  I m looking for 3 15  3 75  and then 4 00 and 4 50 
U S  Silica Holdings  Inc   SLCA 
SLCA after the breakout  we put a swing on it  It then pulled back on Tuesday  but resumed the advance on Wednesday  gaining 40 cents  or 2 48   to 16 52  on 1 5 million shares  That s not a lot of volume and technically it needs to get over the double top around 16 90  and then you re looking at 18  and 20 1 2 
Stocks on the Short Side   
Dorman Products  Inc   DORM 
DORM has a head and shoulders that is still existing  It s going sideways in a flag and looks bearish to me  It was down 21 cents to 82 77  on 123 743 shares traded  If it rolls over  we re going to see 74  67  and less 
GrubHub Inc   GRUB 
GRUB swing short is acting well  It dropped another 1 75  or 2 48   to 68 85  on 4 3 million shares  which is pretty good volume for this stock  To me  it looks like  if it breaks its double bottom  it s headed to 66 1 2  and 56 1 2  or less 
IntriCon Corporation  IIN 
IIN also a swing short  was down 18 cents to 22 19  on 77 113 shares traded  It formed a flag around 35 and has been coming down ever since  reaching a low of 21 91 on Wednesday  I think it s headed lower as well  The target on this one is in the 17 range  followed by 15  and then 14 
Tailored Brands  Inc   TLRD 
TLRD is one of the better shorts this year  It formed a flag and I gave you a short about 26  it rolled over  flagged  and got hammered all the way to under 8 00 at 7 88  down another 19 cents  or 2 35   on 4 5 million shares  We ll have to watch this one to see what happens next

1720,223235,DORM,5 Stocks That GARP Investors Would Love To Buy,opinion,An investment strategy that seeks to provide impressive returns from stocks that are undervalued on the one hand and have a solid growth potential on the other  has always attracted attention  Growth at a reasonable price or GARP is one of the popular strategies in this domain  Instead of picking both value and growth stocks like the blend strategy does  GARP looks for stocks that offer the best of both value and growth investing GARP Strategy in Detail Though investors following GARP consider popular metrics of both value and growth investing  the ideal range of these metrics is different from what is considered by value and growth investing  GARP investing employs popular value metrics   price to earnings  P E  and price to book value  P B  ratio   to evaluate whether a stock is undervalued or not In case of P E ratio  investors following the GARP strategy look for a higher value of the ratio compared to value investors  However  they avoid picking companies with extremely high price to earnings ratios  On the other hand  like value investors  GARP investors give precedence to low P B ratios  A ratio less than the industry average is preferred by GARP investors for choosing undervalued stocks The other metrics that are borrowed by GARP investors from the growth investing strategy are strong earnings growth history and impressive earnings growth prospects for the coming years  Unlike growth investors  GARP investors look for stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate instead of choosing those with extremely high growth rates  Growth rates between 10  and 20  are considered ideal in GARP strategy Return on equity  ROE  is another growth metric used in GARP strategy  Here  those stocks that have higher ROE compared to the industry average are considered as strong ROE is an indicator of superior stocks In order to make GARP strategy more profitable  we have only considered those with a favorable Zacks Rank   Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or Zacks Rank  2  Buy  Screening Parameters  Zacks Rank less than or equal to  2   Only Strong Buy and Buy rated stocks can get through     Last 5 year EPS   projected 3 5 year EPS growth rates between 10  and 20   Strong EPS growth history and prospects ensure improving business    ROE  over the past 12 months  greater than the industry average  Higher ROE compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks    P E and P B ratios less than X industry average  P E and P B ratios less than that of the industry indicate that the stocks are undervalued  The use of these few criteria has narrowed down the universe of over 7 700 stocks to only 8 Here are five stocks from the eight that made it through the screen Citrix Systems  Inc    NASDAQ CTXS   is one of the leading suppliers of application delivery and management software and services  This Zacks Rank  1 has an average four quarter positive earnings surprise of 36 6  Dorman Products  Inc    NASDAQ DORM   is a leading supplier of OE Dealer Exclusive automotive replacement parts  automotive hardware  brake products  and household hardware

1724,223239,DORM,Zacks com Featured Highlights Include  Pilgrim s Pride  Insight Enterprises  Dorman  Chemours And Crown,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   April 12  2018   Stocks in this week

Grab Market Momentum with 5 Top Rising Momentum StocksAfter a lot of hassles related to trade  Wall Street regained its momentum lately  Since we are about to enter the Q1 earnings season  investors probably have shifted their focus to earnings from geopolitics  And investors should note that corporate earnings in the United States have been in decent shape  So  invoke the fighter in you and be a brave investor right now While there are a lot of momentum plays around at this moment  investors can try out some rising P E stocks too  The concept definitely goes against the method of conventional investing where investors always look for stocks with low P E ratios and try to tap undervalued stocks But there is another side to the story that highlights the strength of the stocks with an increasing P E  This often overlooked strategy can prove pivotal in finding great stocks  Let s dig a little deeper How Can Rising P E Be Helpful Investors should note that stock prices move in tandem with earnings performance  If earnings come in stronger  the price of a stock soars  Solid quarterly earnings and guidance in turn boost the earnings forecast  leading to stronger demand for the stock and an uptrend in its price So  if the price is rising steadily  it means that investors are assured of the stock s fundamental strength  expect some strong positives out of it as well as solid and faster earnings growth  Moreover  studies have revealed that stocks have seen their P E ratios jump over 100  from their breakout point in the cycle  So  if you can pick stocks early in their breakout cycle  you can end up seeing considerable gains For the rest of this Screen of the Week article please visit Zacks com at Disclosure  Officers  directors and or employees of Zacks Investment Research
