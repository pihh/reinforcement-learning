14231,235746,RCI,Rogers Communications seen having options for Toronto Blue Jays baseball team,news,"By Alastair Sharp TORONTO  Reuters     Rogers Communications Inc   TO RCIb   which has said it will keep ownership of the Toronto Blue Jays  could look to leasing  licensing and other financial tools to generate value from the Major League Baseball club  sports dealmakers told Reuters  Rogers  new chief executive  Joe Natale  and Chief Financial Officer Tony Staffieri have said in separate conversations with investors since October that the Canadian cable TV and wireless company wants to  surface value  from the franchise  Some people interpreted that to mean they were considering selling the team  which Forbes earlier this year valued at  1 3 billion  In an emailed statement  Rogers spokeswoman Sarah Schmidt said   As we have said  there are no plans to sell the Jays   She declined to comment on a range of options for extracting value from the team  but added   We continue to look for the best way to get credit for our incredible sports portfolio in our overall company valuation   Two professional sports dealmakers said one option for generating cash could include the sale and leaseback of the team s nearly 30 year old stadium in downtown Toronto  known as the Rogers Centre   The team could also sell licensing rights to the facility  which has a retractable roof and was known as SkyDome until Rogers brought it for  25 million in 2005  the sources said   Such deals can be lucrative  Bank of Nova Scotia  TO BNS  agreed in August to pay C 800 million   622 million  in a 20 year naming rights deal for the downtown Toronto arena that houses the National Hockey League s Maple Leafs and National Basketball Association s Raptors  which is now known as the Air Canada Centre  CANADA S ONLY MLB FRANCHISE Rogers paid about C 160 million for 80 percent of the Blue Jays in 2000  before buying the remaining stake in 2004  Bankers said the  1 2 billion paid for the Miami Marlins baseball club in a deal that closed in September likely pushed up comparative valuations  meaning that the Blue Jays  Canada s only MLB franchise  would likely garner significantly higher offers than that if put up for sale   Another option would be for family controlled Rogers to spin off the team  creating a separate company that could tap debt markets to pay athlete salaries  finance stadium improvements and fund other operations  according to three industry dealmakers who declined to be identified because discussions about potential deals are confidential   The current corporate structure at Rogers treats the team as a fully consolidated business unit  meaning that boosting spending to acquire top players would cut into the parent company s earnings  which are closely watched by investors  Having flexibility to spend more on talent  without worry about missing Wall Street earnings forecasts  could lead to more on field success  which would boost long term revenue from ticket sales  merchandising and broadcast rights  the sources said  The Blue Jays  who began play in 1977  won World Series titles in 1992 and 1993 and set attendance records  But the team went into a long decline on the field and at the box office before returning to the playoffs in 2015 and 2016  The team struggled this past season with a 76 86 record  A spinoff could also help improve Rogers  balance sheet as the company looks to borrow to fund network improvements and buy additional wireless spectrum that is expected to be auctioned by the Canadian government in 2019   A key debt to earnings ratio   known as gross debt to earnings before interest  taxation  depreciation and amortization   has risen steadily in recent years  to 3 4 last year from 2 in 2011

33851,255366,RCI,Is Rogers Communications  RCI  Stock A Suitable Value Pick ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Rogers Communications Inc    NYSE RCI   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Rogers Communications has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 16 8  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 17 7  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Rogers Communications  current PE level puts it slightly above its midpoint over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 24 6  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Rogers Communications has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 16 3  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Rogers Communications stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Rogers Communications has a P S ratio of about 2 4  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 2 right now  As we can see in the chart below  this is above the median for this stock in particular over the past few years RCI is actually in the higher zone of its trading range in the time period per the P S metric  which suggests that the company s stock price has already appreciated to some degree  relative to its sales Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Rogers Communications currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Rogers Communications a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Rogers Communications might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of C and a Momentum score of C  This gives RCI a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen zero estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to one lower  while the full year estimate has seen four upward and one downward revision in the same time period As a result  the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen by 2 4  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has increased 2 2   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Rogers Communication  Inc  Price and Consensus    Despite this somewhat mixed trend  the stock has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  on the back of its strong value metrics and this is why we are expecting outperformance from the company in the near term Bottom LineRogers Communications is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Furthermore  a robust industry rank  among the Top 12   and a solid Zacks Rank instills investor confidence However  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall as over the past two years  the industry has underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick  Moreover  broader factors at the industry level support the growth potential of the company as well Wall Street s Next Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time  It s a once in a generation opportunity to invest in pure genius ,2018-11-14,Zacks Investment

BCE  which is known as Bell to its customers  also said on Monday it plans to invest C 1 billion over five years after the transaction closes to expand its broadband networks and services in Manitoba 
Manitoba Telecom shareholders will have a choice of receiving C 40 in cash or 0 6756 of a BCE share for each share held 
BCE said it would pay 55 percent of the purchase price in stock and the remainder in cash 
BCE will fund the cash component internally and will issue about 28 million shares for the deal 
BCE said last Thursday it added nearly 26 000 postpaid wireless customers in the first quarter  helping it post a better than expected profit

33933,255448,RCI,4 Dividends That Pay Monthly  And Up To 12  Per Year,opinion,"If you re planning to retire  or are currently retired   I urge you to become intimately familiar with monthly dividend stocks  They offer the ultimate consideration  income payments that actually line up with your monthly bills 
Today  I m going to help get you started by introducing you to four monthly dividend payers that yield up to 12   But first  What s so great about this type of stock 
When you pay your bills   be it the mortgage  the electricity  the TV   you don t sit down at the kitchen table to do that every quarter  You do it every single month  But most dividend stocks don t keep the same kind of schedule  American stocks typically pay shareholders once every three months 
Monthly dividend stocks  however  help you to tackle regular expenses without worrying about fluctuations in payouts depending on timing  And these every 30 day payers also have a couple of additional benefits  too 

It s a sign of stability  Promising a dividend check every single month is a bold promise that a company wouldn t make if it wasn t serious about keeping  and even raising  the payout 
Faster gains  Even if you have 20 or 30 years left to retirement  a monthly payout can be put back to work more quickly than a quarterly one  A monthly payer  in fact  can generate thousands of dollars more in additional returns  over the course of a couple decades than a quarterly payer with the same yield 

Are all monthly dividend stocks perfect  Far from it  Today  I m going to show you four payers yielding between 4  and 12   Two should make your wish list  while two are proof that even monthly dividends aren t always perfect 
LTC Properties  NYSE LTC 
Dividend Yield  5 8 
LTC Properties is one of the more interesting plays in the real estate investment trust space  combining health care and retirement properties in a way that s tailor made to capture the potential of the aging Baby Boomers 
Specifically  LTC Properties has a total of 208 properties across 29 states that includes 105 assisted living facilities and 96 skilled nursing facilities  with the remaining seven properties classified as simply  other  
The company s fourth quarter and full year earnings report didn t exactly include screamingly positive results  Q4 funds from operations declined by a penny per share from the year ago period to 77 cents per share  though for the whole year  FFO improved from  3 06 per share in 2016 too  3 10 per share in 2017 
Still  shares have hemorrhaged more than 25  since July of last year  with some of that coming amid the malaise of the broader REIT space  That has LTC selling at less than 13 times FFO  and yielding nearly 6  
That should give investors plenty to think about  especially when you consider that LTC s properties naturally benefit immensely from the aging of America s Boomers  and have the added bonus of being located in areas that have high demand for senior health care services  Also appealing is a low debt burden of around 30  of its market capitalization  as well as a dividend that represents less than 75  of FFO 
Wall Street sometimes lets momentum get the best of it  and that appears to be the case in LTC Properties  This REIT is positioned for growth yet value priced   and a  only makes it look that much better 
Global Net Lease  NYSE GNL 
Dividend Yield  12 6 
At first blush  Global Net Lease looks like a prime opportunity 
You can t ask for more diversification than what GNL offers  This real estate investment trust boasts 321 single tenant properties it leases out to 100 tenants across 41 industries in eight countries  including the US  the U K   Germany and Finland  The industry diversification is outstanding  with financial services the largest slice of the pie at just 14   but its properties span everything from aerospace to healthcare to utilities  Moreover  its tenants include stable companies such as FedEx  NYSE FDX   Family Dollar and ING Groep  NYSE ING   but no one of them makes up more than 5  of straight line rent 
Moreover  the stock has been battered to the tune of about 30  in a year  driving its yield to well over 12  
But  
Global Net Lease  GNL  Keeps Flooding the Market With Shares 
While Global Net Lease does continue to post growth  its share count is expanding  too  diluting the value of its business  Moreover  the company also pays out fees to external management that drag on operations  and in fact  that healthy dividend isn t perfectly covered  Last year  the company paid out  2 13 per share in dividends but only collected  2 03 per share in core funds from operation 
The dividend is a real concern here  The payout hasn t budged in years  and now GNL is overstretching to keep its promises  While a 12  yield is tempting  it may not be a 12  yield for long 
Stag Industrial  NYSE STAG  
Dividend Yield  5 9 
 about STAG Industrial before  and in the context of monthly dividend stocks  it s worth mentioning it again 
STAG Industrial is a REIT that specializes in warehouses  boasting 70 2 million square feet across 365 buildings in 37 states  I realize the warehouse business doesn t exactly stir one s spirits  but this word might 
E commerce 
Three of STAG s top 10 tenants are XPO Logistics  NYSE XPO   FedEx and DHL   companies that have plenty to gain as more people have their goods delivered rather than make their way to the store  And as more retailers move to this model  they too will need the kinds of facilities that Stag provides 
The fundamental story here still looks great  STAG grew funds from operations by 7  to  1 69 per share in 2017  and occupancy sits at 95 3   Moreover  the company increased its dividend again   the third hike in 12 months   to 11 83 cents per share  That means STAG s monthly check is well covered  with a roughly 84  FFO payout ratio  and at 14 times FFO  I would consider this attractive REIT fairly priced 

Shaw Communications  NYSE SJR 
Dividend Yield  4 9 
Shaw Communications is a Canadian telecom with a hefty yield at the moment  The question investors want to ask themselves is  are they getting a still stable payout such as those from AT T  NYSE T  or a Verizon  NYSE VZ   or are they getting an eventual dividend cut a la Frontier Communications  NASDAQ FTR  or Windstream  NASDAQ WIN  
The answer is somewhere in between   and that s not a good thing 
Shaw  which offers internet  television  telephone and other services across several provinces  is in the midst of a self proclaimed  total business transformation  that includes a heavy renewed push in its wireless business to help offset continued declines in wireline operations  The company will be taking a  450 million charge related to this restructuring  including accepting 3 300 employee buyouts  All told  the company is reducing its workforce by roughly a quarter 
The market has been punishing SJR shares  which are off more than 17  since Jan  1  That has helped plump the yield up on this monthly dividend payer to nearly 5   However  SJR remains more expensive against future earnings estimates than rivals such as TELUS  NYSE TU  and Rogers Communications  NYSE RCI   and its path to normalcy is far from clear  Among other things  it still will have to find funds to make itself competitive in the upcoming push to transition from 4G to the newer 5G technology  which includes buying spectrum and upgrading its network 
While 5  is nice if you can get it for AT T or Verizon  which enjoy an effective duopoloy in the US  it still doesn t seem quite enough to justify a purchase in Shaw  which faces a much less sure path ahead   especially in the short term 
Your Best Plays Today  Monthly Payouts and 8  Yields 
Monthly payers deserve a place in your portfolio  period  If you re retired  they keep your cash flow as smooth as silk  And if you re not retired  you can reinvest your dividends faster giving your nest egg a nice extra boost 
If that s not a win win  I don t know what is 
That s why I ve dropped four monthly dividend stocks into the  6 pack  of steady investments that make up my  
Quality monthly dividend stocks are a rare breed  but with the right picks  you can use the power of faster compounding to achieve a fully paid for retirement for around  500 000   more than a quarter of a million dollars less than the suits at Merrill Lynch say you need to retire well 
And then once you hit retirement  you can collect a smooth  steady stream of monthly dividend checks to use against your monthly bills 
That s as win win as it gets 
My  8  Monthly Payer Portfolio  can hand you a rock solid  40 000 per year in regular income  That translates into a steady drip of more than  3 300 per month that won t vary   other than the occasional payout increases granted by these dividend dynamos  that is 
This strategy isn t capped at  500 000   if you ve saved up even more  you could be looking at monthly income of  6 349 or even  12 698 per month  That pummels the kinds of payouts you would see from a basket of quarterly paying Dividend Aristocrats 
One last bonus  Several of these picks are more than just slow and steady dividend drippers   they also possess several catalysts for growth  meaning they can deliver income while growing your nest egg  That s a vital part of retirement that many people overlook  convinced that their only strategy after age 65 is to watch their portfolio wither as they start to take withdrawals  That s just not true

Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters  with an average positive surprise of 4 97   In fourth quarter 2017  earnings of 69 cents per share outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny Although revenues of  2 86 billion lagged the consensus mark  the figure increased 3  year over year driven by solid result from the Wireless segment Blended ARPU  average revenue per user  in

Communications added 17K high speed Internet customers and 9K telephony customers in the quarter Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement Intensifying Competition HurtsRogers Communications  shares have lost 6 8  compared with the  s decline of 17  since the announcement of fourth quarter 2017 results on Jan 25 The decline  although narrower than industry  can be attributed to stiff competition in wireless and cable segment as well as softness in advertising market that is negatively impacting media revenues Rogers Communications faces fierce wireless competition in Canada from large incumbents like TELUS  BCE Inc    TO BCE   and other small regional carriers  Moreover  Shaw Communications  decision to venture into the Canadian wireless market with the WIND Mobile acquisition raises competition for Rogers Communications Cable operations are also facing increased competition from BCE s entry into cable TV services  Further  Rogers Communications  like many other cable companies  has lost viewers to video streaming service providers like Netflix  NASDAQ NFLX   In recent times  the viewership of traditional cable TV players has been significantly impacted by the popularity of on demand online videos The company s Media segment has been affected by continued softness in the advertising market  To remain competitive  Rogers Communications needs to invest heavily in new TV programs and channels  This may result in considerable cash drain thereby hurting liquidity Wireless Strength  Key CatalystRogers Communications is expected to benefit from continuing strong demand for data by consumers and businesses  Improving Wireless penetration rate  87  at the end of the fourth quarter  is anticipated to boost subscriber

33937,255452,RCI,Is Rogers Communications A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Rogers Communications Inc    NYSE RCI   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Rogers Communications has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 16 1  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 4x  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Rogers Communications  current PE level puts it above its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the broader industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 33 1  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Rogers Communications has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 15  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Rogers Communications stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Rogers Communications has a P S ratio of about 2 2  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 4x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  RCI is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Rogers Communications currently has a Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Rogers Communications a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Rogers Communications might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of A and a Momentum Score of B  This gives RCI a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen two estimates go lower in the past sixty days  while the full year estimate has seen four up and two down in the same time period This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has decreased by 7  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched upper by 1 3   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Rogers Communication  Inc  Price and Consensus    This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineRogers Communications is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  among Bottom 25  of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the broader industry has clearly underperformed the market at large  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of AllLast year  it generated  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  47 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce   the

33938,255453,RCI,These Monthly Dividend Stocks Are Set To Surge  And Pay Up To 6 8  ,opinion,"If you re like most folks  you re so used to collecting dividends quarterly that it may not have occurred to you that your portfolio can pay you every month 
But it s true  thanks to a small set of stocks that delivers cash payouts month in and month out like clockwork  I ll reveal 3 with especially juicy dividend yields up to 6 8  below  
Monthly Checks You Don t Have to Work For
If you re a retiree  this may take you back to your workdays when your paycheck rolled in at the same time as your monthly bills  Subtract one from the other and voila  you knew exactly how much disposable income you had 
But with your garden variety quarterly dividend payers  a smooth income stream like that is next to impossible 
Check out this chart showing your income from a 5 stock portfolio with  100k invested in each of 5 Dividend Aristocrats boasting relatively high yields  AT T  NYSE T   AbbVie  NYSE ABBV   ExxonMobil  NYSE XOM   Cardinal Health  NYSE CAH  and Consolidated Edison  NYSE ED  
A Lumpy Cash Stream

It s a nightmare 
Your cash flow ranges from just  926 in January  April  July and October all the way up to  2 521 in February  May  August and November 
To be certain  we ll never be able to dump quarterly payers from our portfolios entirely  because pretty well all US blue chip stocks ship out their dividends every 3 months  But adding a few monthly payers  including the 3 high yielders I ll show you below  can do a lot to smooth out our cash flow 
There are a couple other overlooked benefits monthly payers give you  too 
They signal a top notch investment  C suite types know that a dividend is a promise to investors  and they wouldn t commit to sending one out every month if they weren t serious about keeping or raising the payout 
They magnify your profits  If you re not leaning on your portfolio for income  getting your dividend cash every month lets you reinvest it faster  boosting your gains  and income stream  in the long run 
So without further ado  let s dive into the 3 monthly payers I want to show you today  starting with 
Monthly Dividend Pick No  1  A 6 7  Dividend Everyone Has Missed
Luckily for us  monthly payers tend to come from two corners of the market where massive dividends abound  real estate investment trusts  REITs  and closed end funds  CEFs    If you re unfamiliar with CEFs  click here for a quick primer  
So it s fitting that my first pick is Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  Hospitality REIT Inc  NYSE APLE  owner of 241 modern hotels in 34 states  operating under the Marriott and Hilton banners 
And when I say  modern   I mean it  the average age of Apple s portfolio is just four years 
The trust focuses on the upscale end of the market  where Airbnb isn t  with top notch in room amenities  But it keeps costs down using a  select service  model  which offers fewer  but still high quality  out of room offerings 
Examples of a select service approach could include in hotel restaurants with limited menus and smaller conference facilities than you might find at a larger hotel 
The strategy is working  in the second quarter  occupancy ticked up to 81 8   well above the Americas average of 73 5   according to Statista  And revenue per available room  RevPAR   a key metric  moved up to  114 09 from  112 10 a year earlier 
Which brings me to Apple s outsized dividend yield of 6 7   paid monthly  of course  This payout is reliable  accounting for 69  of modified funds from operations  FFO  the main indicator of REIT performance   easily manageable for a REIT particularly a well run one like Apple 
The kicker  The stock is cheap  at just 10 2 times FFO  sliding open a nice buy window for us 
Monthly Dividend Pick No  2  5 0  Dividends From a Booming Megatrend
As I wrote a couple weeks ago  the aging of the baby boomers is an investment megatrend that has many years to run yet  and our next pick  REIT LTC Properties Inc  NYSE LTC  is perfectly positioned to profit 
LTC invests in and finances senior living centres  with a portfolio of 205 holdings in all  nicely split to include 102 assisted living homes and 96 skilled nursing facilities  SNFs  across 29 states 
The trust also leases its properties on a long term basis  generally with a roughly 10  to 15 year initial term  giving it steady cash flow  And as you can see below  few of LTC s leases and loans will mature in the next six years 
Years of Steady Cash Flow Ahead

Source  LTC Properties June 2018 Investor Presentation
Finally  let s talk dividends and valuation  LTC s outsized 5 4  dividend yield  more than 3 times the size of the S P 500 s average payout  is easily sustainable at 75  of FFO  And while the stock isn t as cheap as it was in April  when rising rate fears kneecapped all REITs  it s still a great deal at 15 1 times FFO 
Monthly Dividend Pick No  3  A 6 3  Payout to Power Your Dividend Portfolio
Now that we ve got our hands on two strong monthly dividend REITs  we re going to branch out to another high yielding sector that s cheap now  due to investors  way overdone fear of rising rates 
I m talking about utilities and we re going to tap some of the best in the world through a CEF called the Gabelli Global Utility   Income Tr  NYSE GLU   payer of a gaudy 6 4  monthly dividend that s as steady as they come 
14 Years of Steady Payouts With Special Dividends Thrown In

That s because GLU s dividend is backed by a portfolio of stocks with terrific dividend histories themselves  American Electric Power Company Inc  NYSE AEP   Verizon Communications  NYSE VZ   WEC Energy Group Inc  NYSE WEC  and Canadian wireless provider Rogers Communications Inc  NYSE RCI  

One other thing backstops that outsized dividend  the fund s deep discount to net asset value  NAV  or the markdown between GLU s market price and the value of its portfolio  Keep that in your head for a moment  because this is why CEFs deserve your attention  especially if you re on the hunt for income 
Because while this fund s yield on market price is 6 3   the yield on NAV is only 5 8   a return that s easier for management to wring from its portfolio  especially when you consider that the average utility stock already pays a cash dividend yielding 3 8   giving the team at the top a nice head start 
That discount is also the trigger for some nice  pent up  gains  GLU trades at an 8 9  discount to NAV  but it has regularly traded at a premium to NAV in its 13 year history  If that discount were to vanish  a matter of time  in my view   it would unlock quick 10  upside to go with our 6 4  dividend 
Which brings me to 
Your Best Income Play to Buy NOW  Monthly Payouts and 8  Yields 
There s no doubt monthly payers deserve a place in your portfolio  for the 2 reasons we just discussed  for retirees  they keep your cash flow smooth as silk 
And if you re not retired  you can reinvest your dividends faster giving your nest egg a nice extra boost 
If that s not a win win  I don t know what is 
That s why I ve dropped 4 monthly dividend stocks into the  6 pack  of steady investments that make up my 8   No Withdrawal  portfolio 
I ve custom built this unique portfolio to debunk the myth the so called experts on Wall Street and in the media preach to anyone who will listen  that unless you have a million bucks  you can kiss a comfortable retirement goodbye 
Don t fall for it 
The truth is  with the 6 stout dividend payers in this portfolio  you could clock out of the workforce on a nest egg half the size of what the talking heads say you need 
And you can do it on dividends alone  without drawing a single penny of your hard earned capital in retirement 
I m talking about a rock solid  40 000 a year income stream on just a  500 000 upfront investment  That s an 8  dividend yield a cut above the yields you ll grab from the 2 stocks and the CEF I showed you above 
Best of all  you won t have to go back to  lumpy  quarterly payouts to do it 
Because thanks to the top flight monthly dividend payers in my 8  No Withdrawal portfolio  at least two thirds of that  40 000 a year will drop into your account every single month 
And maybe more  depending on how you split up your nest egg 
I m ready to give you everything you need to know about this dynamic retirement portfolio now  CLICK HERE and I ll share my proven monthly dividend strategy  plus the names  tickers and ALL of my research on these 6 income wonders

33939,255454,RCI,My Easy Plan For  3 300 Per MONTH In Dividends,opinion,"You might think a  500 000 nest egg isn t enough to retire on  and I wouldn t blame you  The financial media loves to tout  1 million as the end all be all mark of financial security 
But today  I ll show you how wrong they are  and how secure you can be even with just half of what  conventional wisdom  says you need   as long as you re in the right kind of dividend stock 
And I ll also show you exactly what kind of dividend stocks you need to get the job done and the bills paid 
Those bills  by the way  come every month  You and I both know this   for me  the mortgage is due come the 4th  electricity on the 10th  have been for years  But some people somehow forget this when planning out their portfolios  The result  Their motley crew of quarterly dividend stocks results in  lumpy  distributions where some months are heavy  and others are thin 
I prefer a nice  steady stream of monthly income I know I can count on  And you can get that  as the name would suggest  from monthly dividend stocks 
I m currently targeting a collection of eight monthly dividend payers that yield an average of 7 9  and deliver that income every 30 days or so  So it s not just consistent income   it s hefty  retirement sustaining income  These stocks can deliver roughly  3 300 in dividends every month on a  500 000 portfolio  not to mention upside potential you can use to help grow your nest egg  and thus reap even more in regular dividend checks 
There s only one cap on my strategy  If you re already a billionaire  this list can t help you  That s because these Goldilocks payers are simply too small to absorb all of your cash  With total market caps around  1 billion or  2 billion  these vehicles are too small for institutional money 
But which monthly dividend payers make the grade 
Realty Income Corp  NYSE O Dividend Yield  4 5 
Any discussion of monthly dividend companies needs to start with   well   The Monthly Dividend Company   That s the self given moniker of Realty Income  O   the premier single tenant real estate investment trust  REIT  with an unimpeachable dividend track record and a steady payout every 30 days or so 
A quick summary for anyone new to this company  Realty Income operates more than 5 400 properties across 49 states and Puerto Rico across 257 tenants spanning several dozen industries  Its tenants take on triple net lease agreements  which means they re not just responsible for rent  but also things such as building maintenance and taxes   something that makes Realty Income s bottom line extremely predictable 
Moreover  Realty Income is one of several stocks on the precipice of becoming a Dividend Aristocrat  with 24 consecutive years of payout increases under its belt   just one shy of the 25 year mark  That has come in the most impressive of manners  namely  83 consecutive quarterly increases that no other company can boast 
Realty Income  O   A Dividend Chart Unlike Any Other
And yet  there s still reason for pause in this venerable dividend play 
I warned about Realty Income in 2016  and it s off about 13  since then while the broader market has sprinted nearly thrice as fast  at 35  gains  O is at least on the rebound this year  with about 3  gains   but still underperforming the market 
Revenues and FFO still are headed in the right direction  up   though the latter has slowed a bit from previous years  No  my concern is longer term  While O has a pretty diverse tenant base  consider how many names in its top 20 tenants are targets of Amazon com  NASDAQ AMZN   Walgreens  WBA   Dollar General Corporation  NYSE DG   Dollar Tree  NASDAQ DLTR   Walmart  NYSE WMT   BJs Wholesale Club Holdings Inc  NYSE BJ   CVS Health  NYSE CVS   Kroger  NYSE KR   Rite Aid Corporation  NYSE RAD  and Home Depot  NYSE HD   That s roughly half of its tenants  accounting for almost a quarter of revenues  And again  that s just in the top 20 
Is Realty Income in existential danger  Of course not  But its path to growth is significantly hindered  which means the dividend is really all you can count on year in and year out 
iShares iBoxx   High Yield Corporate Bond  NYSE HYG SEC Yield  5 6 
Exchange traded funds  ETFs  are much like stocks in that the majority pay out quarterly  but you can still find some monthly payers  especially among bond funds 
Enter the iShares iBoxx   High Yield Corporate Bond ETF  HYG    the most popular junk bond ETF in the game  It holds roughly a thousand junk rated bonds  mostly between three and 10 years in maturity  and mostly in the BBB and BB ratings spheres   so it s junk  but it s primarily higher tier junk 
The resulting 5 6  yield is nice  So are the monthly payouts 
That said  there s better out there  I ve recently broken down the HYG  exposing a number of flaws  from high concentrations in lousy lenders to a false sense of security in its so called  liquidity   it s not really as liquid as investors would like to think  
I ll make this short  You re much better off in closed end funds for this kind of exposure  monthly dividends or not  Next 
Shaw Communications Inc  NYSE SJR Dividend Yield  4 6 
I firmly believe you can find good yields in international stocks  but I have to admit it s difficult to find a good dividend schedule abroad  At least most U S  companies have the common decency to pay at least quarterly   many stocks in Europe  South America and Asian only pay twice a year  sometimes even just once 
From that perspective  Shaw Communications  SJR  is every bit as friendly and accommodating as the good people of its home country  Canada 
Shaw Communications is similar to America s AT T  NYSE T  and Verizon  NYSE VZ  in that it s a massive  multi product communications titan that offers not just telephone  but internet  TV and other services across several provinces  That should  in theory  make Shaw fairly dependable   but as AT T has discovered in 2018  even controlling a significant market share in telecom doesn t always guarantee consistent stock returns 
SJR is off 15  this year as it tries to navigate a  total business transformation  in which it s trying to wean itself off reliance on its wireline operations  and instead bulk up its wireless business  That s far from the only pain Shaw has absorbed in connection to the transition   3 300 employees have been eliminated via buyouts  that s about 25  of its workforce    and the company took a  450 million charge  to boot 
Shaw managed to beat fiscal Q3 estimates when it reported at the end of June  but even still  all is far from rosy  CEO Bradley Shaw detailed a laundry list of issues that hampered the company 
 There are a number of items that impacted our results this quarter  particularly internet  including seasonal student disconnect activity that typically reverses in Q1  a shift in some bulk accounts from consumer to business  and continued market dynamics  including attractive promotions by the competition and our pricing discipline  all of which contributed to our lower sales activity in Q3  
The monthly dividend certainly is nice  and the yield puts it on par with Verizon and AT T  But its positioning   it not only must compete against the likes of Rogers Communications Inc  NYSE RCI  and TELUS Corporation  NYSE TU  on the ground  but the stock is priced less attractively than those companies   and current state of flux make it less reliable than America s telecom duopoly 
Shaw Communications  SJR   Monthly Dividends  But Not Much Else
Apple Hospitality REIT Inc  NYSE APLE Dividend Yield  6 8 
The  other Apple  AAPL   is nothing like the trillion dollar tech company   and yet they share one very attractive investing trait 
Apple Hospitality REIT  APLE    surely the bane of countless investors trying to get to the ticker page of their favorite iPhone maker   is actually a hospitality REIT whose properties are split between the Hilton  HLT  and Marriott  MAR  umbrellas  That means its 30 700 guest rooms in 241 hotels fall under brands such as Hampton Inn  Embassy Suites  Fairfield Inn and SpringHill Suites  among others 
The businesses couldn t be more dissimilar  And yet  like Apple Inc  NASDAQ AAPL    Apple Hospitality REIT is an operational growth machine 
Apple Hospitality REIT  APLE  Is Growing Unchecked
The company has delivered impressive growth over the years  Since 2013 alone  revenues of 388 million and funds from operations  FFO  of  137 million have rocketed to  1 2 billion and  389 million  respectively  FFO has grown every year but one since 2010   that s consistent excellence I can get behind 
Shares are essentially flat over the past two years  but they re bound to gain speed once Wall Street realizes what it s missing out on  not just growth  but a generous yield despite extremely conservative dividend management  The company delivered 51 cents per share in modified FFO last quarter alone  versus a 10 cent monthly dividend  That s a payout ratio of less than 60   meaning investors have no reason at all to worry about the survivability of this dividend 
My Top 8 Monthly Payers for 8 0  Dividends  Plus Upside
My all star retirement portfolio contains 8 of the absolute best preferred stocks  REITs  real estate investment trusts  and CEFs  closed end funds  out there  It s well diversified across all types of investments and sectors  and the cash flows funding these dividends will do well no matter what happens in the broader economy or stock market 
Plus  relentless dividend growth means your 8 0  yield will be more like 10  in short order 
You don t need a million dollars to be comfortable in retirement  In fact  using this portfolio  you can be well on your way to security and comfort with just a half million dollars to invest  And again  you never need to worry about budgeting around  lumpy  dividend payouts where you re  rich  in January but get just a trickle of cash in March  These monthly dividend payers will ensure a smooth  steady stream of cash   you know  to tackle that smooth  steady stream of bills

quarter Advertising revenues fell 7  year over year owing to the softness in the print advertising market primarily in Australia and the U K  and lower home delivered revenues  This was partly offset by a decent rise in digital advertising revenues  Foreign currency fluctuations also acted as a headwind  The rate of decline in advertising revenues has accelerated from 2  reported in the preceding quarter Circulation and subscription revenues grew 2  on account of strong contribution from Dow Jones   which witnessed nearly 7  growth in the circulation revenues   persistent increase in digital subscriber at The Wall Street Journal along with sturdy growth in its Risk   Compliance products  Rise in cover and subscription price also aided revenue growth  These were partly offset by lower

Hockey might be the most expensive sport to play in the U S   giving it the biggest barrier to entry  This has hurt the NHL s popularity as it loses fans every year  But it s not all bad for the biggest hockey league in the world 
The NHL just kicked off the first year of a jersey deal with Adidas   OTC ADDYY    What s more  the league s new expansion franchise  the Vegas Golden Knights  have dominated in their first season in the brand new T Mobile Arena   NASDAQ TMUS   
The NHL s salary cap is also on the rise and team valuations are up with four franchises valued at  1 billion or more  On top of that  NBC   NASDAQ CMCSA   spends billions to broadcast the league  Canadian broadcast giant Rogers Communications    NYSE RCI   national TV rights deal nearly doubles its U S  counterpart s on a yearly basis  And the NHL also recently secured a contract with Disney s   NYSE DIS   streaming firm BAMTech 
Still  despite the NHL s substantial TV deals  both local and national TV ratings sunk in the U S  last season as the sport slips further behind its peers in terms of popularity  The company s followers on Twitter   NYSE TWTR   and Instagram   NASDAQ FB   fall way below the NFL and NBA and even look poor compared to slumping MLB

33950,255465,RCI,Beware  These 3 Stocks Could Miss Earnings Estimates This Week,opinion,"Investors around the world are excitedly preparing for the busy stretch of Q4 earnings report season  which truly kicks off this week  Video streaming behemoth Netflix   NASDAQ NFLX   already impressed  and in the coming days  semiconductor giant Intel   NASDAQ INTC   will try to keep the ball rolling in the tech sector 
Meanwhile  reports are starting to pour in from market moving companies throughout all of Wall Street s top sectors and industries 
According to Sheraz Mian  the head of the Zacks Equity Research department and an acknowledged earnings expert  earnings growth is expected to be positive for 13 of the 16 sectors tracked by Zacks and growth rates are projected to hit the double digits for our Energy  Technology  Construction  Industrial Products  Basic Materials  and Automotive groups 
Smart investors are always looking to profit from these results  Typically that means looking to find companies that are poised to post better than expected earnings results and experience strong post earnings gains  But it can be equally important to avoid companies that are on the cusp of missing estimates 
Luckily  Zacks Premium customers can utilize the  in order to search for stocks that are expected to surprise  in one way or the other  Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst estimates 
This is done because  generally speaking  when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release  it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago 
A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat  In fact  our 10 year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70  of the time 
In contrast  a stock with a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or worse  coupled with a negative Earnings ESP  is one that we typically want to avoid during earnings season  Today  we are giving our readers a free look at three of these weak stocks in order to help them identify the high risk companies ahead of their upcoming reports

33981,255496,RCI,Canada s telcos burst into banking  healthcare in hunt for growth,news,"By Alastair Sharp and Euan Rocha TORONTO August 1  Reuters    Canada s three biggest telecom firms  keen to keep shareholders happy with fat dividends  are breaking into businesses ranging from banking to healthcare to drive growth as they run out of expansion options and shy away from overseas purchases 
BCE Inc  TO BCE   Rogers Communications Inc  TO RCIb  and Telus Corp  TO T  dominate their industry in Canada but with landline connections on the wane  cable TV losing out to online portals and wireless growth slowing  Canada s telecom giants are pushing into uncharted businesses 
Some of the moves   such as Rogers  C 5 2 billion deal   4 8 billion  for exclusive National Hockey League broadcast rights   may bring a rapid pay off  Others  like Telus  bid to dominate healthcare services  are gambles that may not pay off for many years 
 They re all quite different bets   said Iain Grant  head of Seaboard Group  a telecom consultancy   I was quite impressed by the audacity of Rogers making the bid for NHL in Canada   he said  pointing to a likely immediate boost to earnings as more live sports content is consumed on mobile devices 
Along with NHL rights  Rogers has also obtained a banking license as part of a foray into mobile banking and has launched its own standalone credit card  without backing from another financial institution 
 The bank stuff is unique   said Canaccord Genuity analyst Dvai Ghose  noting the baby steps into financial services offers only marginal upside even if enough customers ultimately use their phone as a credit card 
Rogers hasn t disclosed the financial performance of its new banking arm  which doesn t have retail branches or take deposits 
Rogers and BCE also jointly control a sports empire that owns the NHL s Maple Leafs as well as professional basketball  baseball and soccer teams in Toronto 
Meanwhile  No  3 Telus has sought growth in the health sector with remote diagnosis and patient monitoring  pharmacy benefits and medication management   helping patients remember to take pills  order refills  or file insurance claims  and helping doctors share x rays and other data with colleagues 
 What Telus is doing  if they can pull it off  is a lot closer to their core business than  shall we say  running the Toronto Maple Leafs   Seaboard s Grant said  adding that it could be years before it is seen as a core part of the company 
 If you look at Telus a decade from now you might say it was obvious they were moving their revenue stream from three percent healthcare to 30 percent healthcare  but it isn t quite so obvious today   he said 
Telus Health s revenue of C 550 million in 2013 accounted for less than 5 percent of the company s overall revenues 
Telus has poured over C 1 billion   926 million  into health solutions over the last six years and it is now Canada s biggest provider of electronic medical records 
The business still only accounts for a fraction of its overall capital spending in the last six years of almost C 14 billion  Telus spent C 2 1 billion in 2013 on telecom infrastructure alone 
DEALS SIGNAL WEAKNESS
Last week  BCE made a C 3 95 billion offer to take private its regional affiliate Bell Aliant  TO BA   in which it owns a 44 percent stake 
The offer highlighted the limited options available to the three major telcos  BCE in particular  which are trying to boost their bottom lines and maintain the all important dividend to shareholders 
 For BCE to do this deal signals just one thing   it says we can no longer grow our business as well as we used to  otherwise we would have just kept on reinvesting in our business   said John Goldsmith  deputy head of equities at Montrusco Bolton  an investment manager which owns positions in some of the telcos 
In a similar move that underscored the domestic growth challenge  regional cable and telecom company Shaw Communications Inc  TO SJRb  on Thursday said it would pay  830 million to buy U S  data center services provider ViaWest Inc 
For BCE  the Bell Aliant deal follows several big purchases to create and then enlarge its media arm  it paid C 1 3 billion for CTV in 2011 and a C 3 billion deal for Astral Media in 2012 
DIVIDENDS UNDER THREAT
Questions over viable growth options   and the dividend growth story   have begun to affect the stocks  Telus is off 10 percent since a mid June all time high  BCE stock also hit a record last month but has since slipped 3 percent  Shares in Rogers are down almost 20 percent since a peak in early 2013 
The three have posted about 10 percent annual dividend growth over the past three years  That is estimated to slow to between zero and 4 percent by Scotiabank analyst Jeff Fan  who also expects share buybacks to be trimmed 
With the government determined to boost competition and clamping down on takeovers by the three majors  especially in wireless  expansion via acquisition is an unlikely path 
Ottawa last year openly encouraged U S  telco Verizon  N VZ  to enter the market as a fourth player and the government also ordered telcos to sell wholesale access to their networks at lower prices than they currently do 
 We sold the telcos  mainly because the government is regulating the rates down   said Greg Taylor  a portfolio manager at Aurion Capital Management   The competitive threat is only going to get worse  and it s probably time to step aside  
Going abroad also seems to be off the table  Long accustomed to fat margins and a comfortable marketplace  Canadian telcos are reluctant to venture overseas  due to the prospect of heavy investments in competitive markets 
Asked about foreign growth opportunities  new Rogers CEO and former Vodafone executive Guy Laurence said last week that the company is  absolutely not focused on that  
 Why on earth would I expand outside the borders   he asked rhetorically  calling Rogers  one of the best train sets in the world

33982,255497,RCI,BlackBerry signs up Samsung  others  in new mobile services push,news,"By Euan Rocha and Alastair Sharp SAN FRANCISCO TORONTO  Reuters    BlackBerry  TO BB  announced partnerships with Samsung Electronics Co  KS 005930  and other high profile tech players on Thursday  broadening the reach of its new mobile device management and security platform  and sending its shares 7 percent higher 
BlackBerry and Samsung  the world s No  1 smartphone maker  will offer a  highly secure mobility solution  for Samsung s Android devices starting in early 2015  The system will wed BlackBerry s security platform with the South Korean company s own security software for its Galaxy devices 
 The partnership with Samsung is a very big deal   said John Jackson  a technology analyst at IDC   It s hard to imagine a partnership with more significant practical impact potential  
BlackBerry said the tie up is a long term commitment 
 To make this Samsung partnership happen  we went to the highest levels of both companies  so this is a very serious relationship   said John Sims  BlackBerry s head of enterprise services  calling the deal  the tip of the iceberg  
BlackBerry also touted a string of improvements to its existing products  including mobile video conferencing via its messaging app and the ability to divide usage costs between employer and employee 
BlackBerry s Nasdaq listed shares closed 7 percent higher at  12 06  their highest close since June 2013 
CONNECTING MACHINES
The new platform  the BlackBerry Enterprise Service  or BES12  will allow corporations and government agencies to manage and make secure not only BlackBerry s mobile devices  but also those running operating systems such as Google s  O GOOGL  Android  Apple s  O AAPL  iOS and Microsoft s  O MSFT  Windows platform 
For the first time  the platform will also be able to manage and make secure medical diagnostic equipment  industrial machinery and even cars 
The company also announced a BES12 deal with Brightstar  the world s largest wireless distribution company  and a tie up with business software company Salesforce com  N CRM  that will let clients in healthcare and other regulated industries that use Salesforce software securely access data via the BlackBerry platform 
 This plan is not different from what I laid out on day one  but it was hard for people to comprehend and believe me then as things were a mess then   BlackBerry Chief Executive John Chen said   The key message today is the ecosystem is coming back and the telecoms are very excited  
The new products and services are the backbone of Chen s plan to turn around the smartphone pioneer  whose devices have lost ground to Apple s iPhone  Samsung s Galaxy devices and a slew of other gadgets powered by Google s Android platform 
While still a player in the smartphone business  BlackBerry is pivoting its focus to services and the demands of a large base of enterprise clients that are increasingly grappling with data security concerns 
The Waterloo  Ontario based company said its customers have registered for 5 1 million BES licenses since it launched a migration push in March  with some 30 percent of them moving from rival mobile device management platforms 

BlackBerry also said it will launch its long awaited Classic smartphone on Dec  17 at events in New York  Frankfurt and Singapore  The device  which bears similarities to the once popular BlackBerry Bold  will go on sale immediately in launch markets and be priced at  449

announcement Why a Likely Positive Surprise Our proven model shows that BCE is likely to beat estimates because it has the right combination of the two key elements Zacks ESP  BCE has an  of  1 70   This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at 60 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged lower at 59 cents  This is a meaningful indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise  You

significantly higher chance of beating estimates  Conversely  Sell rated stocks  Zacks Rank  4 or 5  should never be considered going into an earnings announcement The combination of BCE s favorable Zacks Rank and positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat at the company What is Driving the Better Than Expected Earnings We are impressed with BCE s innovative network expansion

decline in churn rates and its focus on technology upgrades  The company continues to focus on six strategic areas including investment in broadband network and services  accelerating wireless services  leveraging wireline momentum  expanding media coverage  improving customer service and achieving a competitive cost structure  These initiatives are expected to generate higher revenues per user and attract new customers Moreover  with the completion of the MTS deal  Bell Canada gained almost 710 000 wireless  Internet and IPTV customers in Manitoba  a 5  increase in total broadband service subscribers positioning it as one of the largest mobile provider in Manitoba with more than 470 000 total Bell and MTS wireless subscribers On the flip side  the wireline segment continues to witness a decline in revenues  In third quarter 2017  wireline product revenues declined 9 7  to  184 90 million  reflecting lower demand for telecommunications equipment by large enterprise business and wholesale customers due to competitive pricing and technology substitution Moreover  the company s local line access for traditional telephony service continues to decline among large customers due to higher wireless substitution and migration to IP based services  This is reflected by persistent erosion in overall network access services on a year over year basis  hurting revenues of the

33992,255507,RCI,Canada s Wind Mobile signs roaming deal  Telus likely partner,news,"TORONTO  Reuters    Wind Mobile  a small wireless company that claims fourth spot in an industry dominated by three major players  said on Tuesday that it now reaches 97 percent of Canada s population after adding an unnamed domestic roaming partner 
Wind said the addition would most noticeably increase its coverage in British Columbia  suggesting Vancouver based Telus Corp  TO T  as a likely partner 
The deal follows a ruling in July by the Canadian Radio television and Telecommunications Commission s  CRTC  that Rogers Communications Inc  TO RCIb   the country s largest wireless provider  used exclusivity clauses and high rates in roaming agreements it signed with new wireless entrants to unfairly discriminate against them 
 The CRTC s recent ruling that Rogers  exclusivity clauses are invalid opened the doors to new discussions  and we have since sat down and finalized roaming agreements with some new carriers   said Telus spokesman Shawn Hall  who declined to explicitly state whether Telus has struck a deal with Wind  citing confidentiality clauses in deals it has reached since the CRTC ruling 
Wind lags far behind the three biggest players   Telus  Rogers and BCE Inc s  TO BCE  Bell   each of which has at least 10 times as many wireless subscribers

34022,255537,RCI,Shaw Communications  SJR  Q4 Earnings  What s In Store ,opinion,Shaw Communications Inc   NYSE SJR   is scheduled to release fourth quarter fiscal 2017  ending Aug 31  2017  results  before the opening bell on Oct 26 In the last two quarters  the company s bottom line met with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  However  the company s earnings lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the remaining two of the previous four quarters  with an average miss of 11 96  Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement Factors at PlayShaw Communications operates in a highly competitive Canadian wireless market with incumbents like Rogers Communications Inc   NYSE RCI    TELUS Corp   NYSE TU   and BCE Inc   TO BCE    Stiff competition has resulted in losses in video  Internet and landline phone businesses Rolling out of new brands  advertising promotions to lure more subscribers and technological advancements is likely to escalate expenses going ahead  These combined costs will adversely impact margins moving ahead Moreover  the company s cash and liquidity position seem to be a major concern for the company   At the end of third quarter fiscal 2017  Shaw Communications had cash and total outstanding debt of  235 73 million and  7 677 9 compared with  545 54 million and  7 186 25 million  respectively  at the end of August 2016  In the reported quarter  the company generated  173 76 million cash from continued operations compared with  202 05 million from the prior year quarter  Free cash flow totaled  177 80 million versus  245 15 million in the year ago quarter  reflecting a decrease of 27 5   Accumulating debt and decreasing cash flows pose severe trouble for the company s long term growth prospects On the back of such headwinds  the company s shares have declined 1 9  compared with the  s fall of 4 1   over the past three months   When compared with the market at large  the stock s performance fails to impress as compared with the S P 500 index s rally of 3 6   On the flip side  we are bullish about Shaw Communications  recent strategic business initiatives  which include the sale of its data center operations  ViaWest  to Peak 10 Holding Corp and the utilization of the net proceeds from ViaWest sale for the purchase of wireless spectrums from Quebecor Media  The company s rating outlook upgrade by Moody s Investor Services was a major positive  The company has positioned itself as a pure play Canadian telecom company with the divesture of its unit  Shaw Media to Corus Entertainment  The company s venture into the Canadian wireless market with the acquisition of a 100  interest in Mid Bowline Group Corp  the parent company of WIND Mobile Corp  should pay off It is to be seen whether the company can maintain last quarter s massive user gain in the quarter to be reported  In the third quarter of 2017  Shaw Communications witnessed huge growth in cable TV subscribers for the first time since 2010  marking an overall gain of 58 491 subscribers in its Consumer and Wireless divisions Earnings Whispers Our proven model does not conclusively show that Shaw Communications is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  Unfortunately  that is not the case here as elaborated below Zacks ESP  Shaw Communications has an Earnings ESP of 0 00   This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 23 cents  You can

comfortably beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 26 cents by 15 0  However  the company s fourth quarter fiscal 2017 GAAP earnings of 21 cents per share  declined 8 7  year over year  A rise in the cost of revenues as well as higher operating expenses weighed down on the bottom line performance For fiscal 2017  adjusted income was  2 61 per share  indicating a rise of 7 4  from fiscal 2016 levels Inside the HeadlinesTotal revenues of  242 million came within the company s projected range of  230  250 million and were up 3 9  on a year over year basis  Healthy increase in revenues across the two segments namely  Licensing and Services contributed to the decent rise in the top line  However  revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  244 1 million by a whisker For fiscal 2017  the company s top line grew 5 4  to  1 081 5 million  compared with the tally in fiscal 2016  Revenues also came within the company s full year guidance provided previously Dolby Laboratories Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   The company s licensing revenues were  213 4 million  up 4 9  year over year  Solid year over year growth in Licensing in other markets and Mobile devices sales drove the segment s growth  Licensing in  other markets  was up a robust 55  in the reported quarter thanks to decent performance by Dolby Cinema and higher recoveries in automotive In the fiscal third quarter  the Services segment rose 10 4  year over year to  4 9 million  Growing demand from exhibitors for digital cinema products increased the Products and Services sales  However  Product revenues came in at  23 8 million  down 4 8  on a year over year basis During the reported quarter  operating margin of Dolby decreased 290 basis points to 9 6  mainly on account of higher expenses LiquidityAs of Sep 29  2017  Dolby had cash and cash equivalents of approximately  627 million  down from  516 1 million as of Sep 30  2016 Also  net cash provided by operating activities came in at  371 1 million  compared with  356 8 million as of Sep 30  2016 GuidanceConcurrent with the market scenario  Dolby issued the guidance for first quarter fiscal 2018 earnings and revenues  The company expects non GAAP earnings in the range of 55 61 cents  while revenues for fiscal first quarter are anticipated to lie within  260  270 million Moreover  the company projects non GAAP gross margin to lie approximately at 89   Similarly  operating expenses are likely to be between  156 million and  160 million  on a non GAAP basis In addition  Dolby provided guidance for fiscal 2018  The company estimates total revenues to lie in the range of  1 14  1 17 billion  It believes that new revenue streams  such as mobile revenues  Consumer Imaging  Dolby Cinema and Dolby Voice will prove conductive to revenue growth  However  softer PCs and home theater equipment sales may affect the company s growth momentum to some extent Further  non GAAP operating expenses for fiscal 2017 are projected to lie between  655 million and  665 million Existing Business ScenarioDolby reported decent quarterly results with most of the key metrics topping the company s conservative guidance range  Going forward  we believe the company s three impressive projects  namely  Dolby Voice  Dolby Vision and Dolby Cinema  will likely accelerate growth Also  Dolby Cinema technology is proving to be a major profit churner for the company  Presently  there are over 360 Dolby Cinema locations globally  Dolby s partners have been planning to roll out as many screens this year as fiscal 2017  reflecting tremendous growth prospects  However  unfavorable timing of payments poses as a threat for the company s profitability Dolby currently carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other top ranked stocks worth

Meanwhile  TELUS and Huawei  one of the world s largest information and communications technology companies  successfully completed trials of 5G wireless technology using the global 3GPP standards platform 
The trial is a part of TELUS and Huawei s  5G Living Lab  in Vancouver  which resulted in wireless speeds of up to 200 times faster than current LTE networks  Additionally  it demonstrated the potential for 5G technology to deliver wireless to the premises connectivity as it has the necessary speed and reliability  allowing smart homes and businesses access to 5G  We believe  this achievement is an important step toward building and deploying 3GPP unified 5G networks around the world 
On  Jun 5  TELUS announced that it has decided to spend C 4 2 billion   3 11 billion  on new broadband and wireless infrastructure in Alberta by 2020

The company currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  
Shares of BCE have rallied 11 8   outperforming the  s growth of 7 5   over the last six months 

On Mar 17  2017  BCE s subsidiary  Bell Canada  completed the acquisition of Manitoba Telecom Services Inc   MTS  and helped it gain almost 710 000 wireless  Internet and IPTV customers in Manitoba  This development has further led to a 5  increase in total broadband service subscribers and also catapulted Bell Canada to the status of a leading mobile provider in Manitoba with more than 470 000 total Bell and MTS wireless subscribers 
We are impressed with BCE s efforts to strengthen footprint in advanced networks Fibe TV and Fibe Internet services as well as the hosting and cloud suite 
Bell Canada plans to invest  854 million  aiming to connect millions of homes and businesses in Montreal with the fastest broadband fiber technology  This move in turn will expectedly aid the BCE unit s fiber optics network suite 
BCE s acquisition of Q9 Networks has also fortified its foothold in the cloud space  
Increasing deployment of Gigabit Fibe  4G LTE mobile networks  IP phone services and post paid businesses have helped the company win customers in its post paid wireless business and put a check on subscriber loss 
We further believe  significant investments in network coverage  customer retention  lucrative data plans and launch of new handsets along with provision of net protection might have driven a steady customer rise 
However  the company operates in a highly competitive market  In the wireless segment  BCE competes with the likes of Rogers Communications Inc    NYSE RCI   and TELUS Corporation   NYSE TU   as well as small regional carriers in Canada  In the wireline segment  it contends with Shaw Communications Inc    NYSE SJR

carried the momentum of 2016 in to 2017  with the first and second quarter witnessing revenue growth of 10  and 8   respectively Recent Agreements to Drive the Top Line FurtherWe believe WWE will

respectively  Further  the trend continued in the first and second quarter of 2017  with home entertainment revenues declining 27  and 3 2   respectively  The decline in home entertainment revenues can primarily be attributed to steady shift of consumers to digital formats  downloaded or streamed over the Internet Decline in pay per view revenues is a major concern for the Zacks Rank  3  Hold

34099,255614,RCI,TELUS  TU  To Report Q2 Earnings  Is A Beat In The Cards ,opinion,"Leading Canadian telecom operator  TELUS Corp    NYSE TU    is expected to report its second quarter financial numbers on Aug 11  2017 before the market opens 
Last quarter  the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 7 69    Moreover  TELUS has outpaced estimates in two of the past four quarters  with an average negative surprise of 0 87  
Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Why a Likely Positive Surprise  
Our proven model shows that TELUS is likely to beat earnings  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen 
Zacks ESP  TELUS has an Earnings ESP of  5 36   This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at 59 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged lower at 56 cents  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Zacks Rank  TELUS currently holds a Zacks Rank  2 
The combination of TELUS  Zacks Rank  2 and positive ESP of 5 36  makes us reasonably confident of a positive earnings beat on Aug 11 
We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions  
TELUS Corporation Price and EPS Surprise
    What is Driving the Better than Expected Earnings 
TELUS has outperformed the  growth in the past three months  The stock has grown 8 7   outshining the industry s gain of 3 6  

The company has introduced the TELUS Global Internet of things  IoT  Connectivity platform to deliver seamless connectivity and simplified billing across 200 networks globally  to support the expansion of Canadian business enterprises 
Recently  TELUS and Huawei  one of the world s largest information and communications technology companies  successfully completed trials of 5G wireless technology  using the global 3GPP standards platform  This achievement is an important step toward building and deploying 3GPP unified 5G networks around the world 
However  The Canadian telecom market has become intensely competitive  with rival companies offering newer quad play bundled services  These comprise wireless  wireline  high speed broadband and voice products  TELUS competes with the likes of Rogers Communications Inc    NYSE RCI    Shaw Communications Inc    NYSE SJR   and BCE Inc   BCE  in the Canadian telecom market 
A Key Pick

34121,255636,RCI,Should Investors Retain Rogers Communications Amid Risks ,opinion,"On Jul 6  2017  leading diversified Canadian communications and media company  Rogers Communications Inc    NYSE RCI    was upgraded to Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  
The price performance of Rogers Communications has been encouraging for the last six months  The stock price inched up 21 3   beating the Zacks categorized  industry s gain of 7 7  over the same time span 

 
The company has maintained its position as the largest integrated telecom operator in Canada  Rogers Communications continues to remain the first wireless operator in Canada to offer Internet of Things  IoT  as a service to business enterprises  End to End Incident Management  Farm and Food Monitoring  and Level Monitoring are the three IoT services that it currently offers  The wireless carrier expects the Canadian IoT market size to reach a value of  13 5 billion by 2019 
Rogers Communications continues to roll out 700 MHz LTE  lower block  spectrum which provides better in building penetration and rural LTE coverage  It has been able to attain favorable trends in churn and net additions supported by its high quality network  value added content offerings and sustained improvements in customer experience 
On Jun 6  2017  the company s subsidiary  Rogers Media  Inc   signed two major deals  One was with The Weather Company  which is a subsidiary of the Data and Analytics Platform business unit of International Business Machines Corporation   NYSE IBM    The other was with Iowa based media conglomerate company  Meredith Corporation   NYSE MDP    Through these deals  Rogers Media will be able to expand and deliver brand safe and premium content environments to its advertising partners  These will focus on lifestyle  entertainment  news and information verticals 
Rogers Media  Inc  signed a deal to purchase broadcasting company  Tillsonburg Broadcasting Company Limited  The subsidiary views the transaction as an ideal one  which should help it strengthen its foothold in Southwest Ontario 
In Dec 2016  Rogers Communications announced plans of dumping its Internet Protocol TV  IPTV  platform and adopt Comcast Corporation s   NASDAQ CMCSA   cloud based X1 video platform  Using the powerful X1 platform  the company aims to provide its customers with an advanced seamless and connected TV experience  at home or outside 
However  the wireless carrier faces fierce competition from large incumbents like TELUS Corporation   NYSE TU    BCE Inc   BCE  and other small regional carriers  Moreover  Shaw Communications  venture into the Canadian wireless market with the WIND Mobile acquisition raises competition for the company 
We believe that these are the reasons behind the stock currently carrying a Zacks Rank  3  Hold

34123,255638,RCI,Rate Hike Reflects Canada s Economic Strength  5 Picks,opinion,"On Jul 12  Canada s central bank hiked its key interest rate for the first time in seven years  The move was widely expected and a reflection of the Bank of Canada s confidence in the economy  A long stretch of encouraging data on GDP  employment and business confidence has led to the decision to tighten monetary policy 
At a time when economies across the globe are recovering or exhibiting sluggish growth  this is welcome news for investors  Buying Canadian stocks looks like a profitable option at this point in time 
First Rate Hike Since 2010
The Bank of Canada has decided to increase its key rate from 0 50  to 0 75   the first such hike since 2010  At that time  the central bank had raised the key rate by 1   But after the central bank s current governor Stephen Poloz assumed office  the rate was actually cut on two occasions in 2015  Up to the current increase  the overnight rate  which is the rate at which leading financial institutions offer one day loans to one another  had remained at 0 5  
In recent times  reports emanating from Canada have repeatedly indicated that the economy has successfully emerged from the aftermath of a devastating oil shock  This had led to rate hike calls from several quarters  but Poloz possibly stayed away in order to protect the competitiveness of Canadian exports 
According to several experts  signs of a strong economic rebound are so evident that Poloz could no longer put off this decision  In its statement made following its decision to hike the key rate  the Bank of Canada said that the economy is exhibiting considerable strength  powered primarily by household expenditure  The central bank said that nearly all of Canada s unutilized economic capacity should disappear near the end of this year 
GDP  Employment  Business Confidence Remain Strong
On Monday  Canada s finance minister Bill Morneau said that the country s 45 300 job additions in June were a crucial sign of economic strength  Meanwhile  the country s unemployment rate declined to 6 5   the lowest level recorded since the Great Recession began 
But the unemployment report  released on Jul 3 was only the latest in a series of encouraging signals about the economy  On Jun 30  official data showed that Canada s GDP had increased to 0 2  in April  marking its sixth successive month of expansion  Out of the 20 economic sectors under consideration  14 expanded during this period  indicating that the improvement was broad based 
In fact  Canada is enjoying one its best stretches of growth since 2008 09  Over the last four quarters  the economy has expanded at a pace in excess of 3   This is the highest level of growth among the countries which make up the Group of Seven  the world s seven most advanced economies  
Additionally  the Bank of Canada has raised its GDP forecast for the year  The central bank thinks GDP will now increase at a pace of 2 8  in 2017  higher than the projection of 2 6  released in April  To top it all off  the Bank of Canada s business sentiment index touched its highest level since 2011 in April  Expectations of sales growth  investment and hiring intent all exhibited significant improvements 
Our Choices
Bank of Canada s decision to hike the key rate has been triggered by a series of positive reports which serve to illustrate the country s economic health  The central bank has also raised its GDP projections for the rest of this year

34181,255696,RCI,4 Canadian Stocks To Buy On A Thriving Domestic Market,opinion,While the S P 500 braved a tech bubble  a financial crisis and two recessions in the last decade to finally hover near its all time highs this year  Canadian stocks also regained their lost ground  The slump in commodity prices had crippled Canadian stocks for a pretty long time  But  that is a thing of the past A slew of factors including stocks trading at cheap valuations  a healthy GDP outlook  banks surviving the financial crisis with less stress and the country being home to global mining players make us believe that Canadian stocks still have plenty of room for upside  In fact  this year  their gains have already toppled returns delivered by U S stocks  Hence  investing in stocks exposed to a thriving Canada is not a bad proposition  Canadian Stocks Surge this YearThrough the first eight months of this year  Canadian stocks outperformed U S  stocks  Canada s TSX Composite index s year to date return is around 12   way above the S P 500 s return of about 7   The index s over exposure to natural resources and energy industries made it vulnerable to a commodity slump Commodity prices took a beating due to sluggish global economic growth  mostly led by a weak Chinese economy  Almost everything ranging from petroleum to potash saw their prices tank  However  the index made a comeback this year  thanks to commodity prices gaining traction  Needless to say  a weak Canadian dollar better known as  loonie  boosted exports and a sturdy government under Justin Trudeau instilled confidence in the economy Do Bulls Still Have Room to Run Even though Canadian stocks have moved north this year  they are cheaper than their American counterparts  According to Matt Barasch  the chief Canadian equity strategist for RBC Capital Markets   If you go back 35 years and look at price to book ratios compared to the U S   Canada has never been cheaper on a relative basis   It s indeed quite remarkable that Canadian stocks continue to trade at cheaper valuations amid a rise in commodity prices and recovery in earnings  This makes them quite attractive Canada s GDP growth for the next year is also poised to beat that of America  According to TD Economics  the Conference Board believes that Canada s GDP is expected to expand at a solid rate of 1 9  in 2017  whereas the U S  economy is pegged to grow 1 7   On the other hand  Brexit affected Eurozone is expected to witness decelerating growth of 1 4   according to Focus Economics  Robust economic growth will certainly boost Canada s broader markets Sector Outlooks EncouragingAs the GDP is poised to be better next year  the odds of the country s jobless rate whittling down from 6 9  increases  This in turn could boost consumer spending levels  the backbone of any economic growth  Rise in spending levels will work wonders for retail conglomerate George Weston Limited  doughnut chain Tim Hortons Inc   and media companies Rogers Communications Inc    NYSE RCI   and Bell Media Inc Meanwhile Canadian banks unlike their American counterparts indulged in fewer risks to sail though the financial crisis with ease  Canada s central bank hasn t trimmed rates as aggressively as other central banks across the globe  Canadian banks including Toronto Dominion Bank   TO TD   and Royal Bank of Canada   NYSE RY   enjoyed bigger profits  while they paid out hefty dividends Canada s global mining giants also enjoyed a bull run as global jitters boosted gold prices  The rise in the price of the yellow metal benefited mining majors Goldcorp Inc    NYSE GG    Franco Nevada Corp   TO FNV   and Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd   TO TRQ   Top 4 Canadian Stocks to Buy NowAs prices of oil and other commodities have somewhat stabilized  with consumer driven companies to banks to mining behemoths all set to gain  investing in Canadian stocks will be judicious  These stocks are also far more attractively priced

34213,255728,RCI,Is Comcast Mulling To Partially Acquire Icontrol Networks   revised ,opinion,"According to a recent report by Light Reading  leading cable MSO  multi service operator  and media company Comcast Corp    NASDAQ CMCSA   is seriously thinking of acquiring certain useful assets of Icontrol Networks Inc   a major developer of smart home products 
The report stated that Comcast is eyeing Icontrol s Zigbee based smart home products and the majority of its patents  Moreover  Alarm Com Inc   a competitor of Icontrol  also has an eye on a minor part of the Z wave product portfolio together with a handful of patents and the Piper home monitoring assets that Icontrol acquired in 2014 
Icontrol s smart home product platform has a strong clientele in the North American cable MSO market  Comcast itself is a major customer of Icontrol  Apart from Comcast  other major customers include Time Warner cable  a division of Charter Communications Inc    NASDAQ CHTR    Roger Communications Inc    NYSE RCI   and Cox Communications Inc  Small sized cable TV operators are also gradually shifting to Icontrol s platform 
However  in recent years  Icontrol has been facing a lack of demand for its products  There are two reasons for this setback  Firstly  competition in the market has intensified and  secondly  Comcast  its major customer  has decided to develop some of the smart home products in house  Hence  the acquisition of the core assets of Icontrol will boost the existing product portfolio of Comcast 
On the flip side  other large cable MSOs may not want to be a client of Comcast  their major competitor in the market  Charter Communications  Rogers Communications and Cox Communications might switch to a different platform and other vendors  In this situation Alarm Com could prove to be a suitable alternative 
Alarm Com also boasts a strong clientele consisting of Suddenlink Communications and Vivint Inc  Suddenlink is currently a division of Altice N V  Notably  Altice is awaiting regulatory approval to acquire Cablevision Systems Corp    NYSE CVC    If the deal materializes  it may further boost Alarm Com s business

noticed that the top 20 stocks had a 10 year dividend growth performance of remarkable 10 to 30 percent yearly but for most of them  the performance slowed within the recent years  It s not possible for any company to raise dividends at a very high rate over a longer period  It s also not possible to raise dividend payments with a gaining momentum  Every company that does this must reduce its growth speed over the time  Today  I will introduce some of the fastest growing dividend payers that have raised their distributions at least for five consecutive years but less than ten years  Here

34290,255805,RCI,Keep The Faith With Dividend Stocks,opinion,Asset allocation  which sounds pretty boring  is much more important than stock picking  Deciding how much of a portfolio to put into cash  into bonds  and into stocks  has a huge effect on returns over time  One of the key factors in determining optimal asset allocation is interest rates  That brings us to the three crucial questions of the moment  when will interest rates go up  how much will they go up  and what should we do about it When interest rates are high  conservative investors can buy the safest securities such as GICs and Government bonds  and live off the income they produce  When they are low  as they have been the past four years  the income investors receive drops sharply  and riskier investments such as common shares become more attractive  This graph shows the income yield from the 5 year Canada bond over the past fifty sixty years  compared to the dividend yield from all stocks in the TSX S P Index It is easy to see why even very conservative investors were driven out of bonds  With the interest rate on the bond falling from over 5  ten years ago to under 1 5  today  fixed income simply does not produce enough income  Couple the low interest rates with high tax rates  interest is taxed at the highest marginal rate  and bond investors are faced with post tax yields of under 1   less than inflation  At the same time  the dividend yield on the TSX is rising  from about 1 8  ten years ago to about 2 8  today  With the dividend tax credit  the post tax dividend yield is almost three times the post tax yield on bonds In fact  the relationship between interest rates and dividend yields has been turned on its head  Normally  dividends on the major blue chip stocks   shares of banks  telecommunications companies  utilities and pipelines   are considerably less than the interest on medium term bonds  For the past ten years  the ratio of dividend yield to interest yield has been rising  and is now at a record high  Dividend yields are now almost twice as high  before taxes  as bond yields This has been one of the reasons behind the recent upward movement in the stock markets in both Canada and the US In late May  as a result of better than expected strength in the U S  economy  and due to comments made by Ben Bernanke  Chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank in the U S   investors began to fear that interest rates would begin to rise  Bond prices did indeed increase somewhat  We saw a huge sell off of dividend payers in the Canadian stock market in the last three days of the month  All of the stocks which investors had run to for yield were suddenly unattractive  and were sold  But yet  even with the recent increase  bond yields remain far below normal levels In fact  the five year Canada bond yield is just about the same as it was in both August 2011 and August 2012  It is hard to understand any good reason for the selling panic we saw in the last days of May It is obvious that interest rates will go up at some point  The current record low rates are a result of the severe recession in the world economy in the 2008 to 2010 period  We expect that within a few years  five at the outside  the five year Canada bond will be back up to a yield of 4  to 6   much more typical of the past fifty years  Does this mean that investors should flee the stock market Not in our view  The rise in rates will be slow and gradual  Central bankers cannot risk throwing the major world economies back into recession by imposing high borrowing costs on deeply indebted governments  Both the U S  Federal Reserve and the Bank of Canada have recently adopted a policy of giving business and investors very explicit messages to facilitate forward planning  For this reason  we know that short term rates  90 days and less  will not rise more than say   of 1  in the next year  and not more than 1  in the next two years  Longer rates will rise somewhat more  and perhaps somewhat faster  but there will be no fast and furious increases Secondly  rates can rise a long way before the dividend yields on stocks become unattractive  For example  with yields of about 4  on average  the major Canadian banks are paying more than twice the Canada five year bond yield  If the five year bond rises to 5   the bank dividends will be almost back to their normal level compared to bond yields  As noted above  this is not likely to happen before 2016 Finally  good quality companies keep increasing their dividends and continue to buy back their own shares  Two of the banks hiked dividends this quarter  and it is likely that three more will do so before the end of the year  The same is true of the telecoms  all of BCE  BCE   Telus  TU  and Rogers  RCI  have raised their dividend this year   utilities  pipelines and REITs  Simply put  rising dividends on top of already high yields is an unbeatable combination There is no question that investors exhibited characteristic over exuberance in pushing up the prices of some high yield stocks  This is normal  the pendulum always swings too far in the stock market  both on the high end  and on the low end  At the end of May the selling was overdone  We see no reason to exit from high dividend stocks at this time  and unless something important changes  very little reason to fear them over the next two years or so Disclosure  The author and or household family members own stocks mentioned in this post  Clients of Baskin Financial own all stocks mentioned in this post ,2013-06-04,Baskin Financial

34300,255815,RCI,Rogers Has At Least  5B Of Hidden Value,opinion,"Investors in Rogers Communication Inc  NYSE RCI  have every right to be in a sour mood  Competitors  BCE Inc   NYSE BCE  and TELUS Corporation  NYSE TU   have seen their stocks go straight up  while Rogers has done nothing  With a new CEO trying to make a name for himself it may be time to shake things up  And shake them up in a dramatic fashion 
Rogers Communications has at least  5B in value in the company that is not being properly valued  That s 25  of the company s current market value  Here s how our management can unlock value 
1  Rogers has close to  1B of securities in other publicly traded securities  It owns a big stake in Cogeco Cable  As a shareholder  I don t need to own a stock that owns stock in other companies  Sell it  and use the proceeds to reduce debt  buyback stock or increase dividends
2  Rogers has at least  2B worth in sports franchises  Sports teams are hot  Celebrities and billionaires want to own them and clearly overpay for them  Rogers Communications should strike will the iron is hot and look to spin off its sports franchises to the public  Rogers owns the Toronto Blue Jays  the Rogers Centre  Skydome for you old folks  and 37 5  of Maple Leaf Sports Entertainment  MLSE  which owns the Toronto Maple Leafs  the Toronto Raptors  the Toronto FC Soccer team  the Air Canada Centre  restaurants  some real estate and three specialty sports channels  Well it s hard to put a value on these assets  but here s my best guess 
In October 2013  Bloomberg said that the Toronto Blue Jays were the 12th most valuable team with about  350M of revenue  They slapped a value of  950M  Now that the Jays are winning a little more and with the passage of time  I m sure we can go as high as  1B  Let s move on to MLSE  In 2012  Rogers paid  575M to acquire 37 5   This valued the company at  1 5B  I think company is now worth at least twice that  With Steve Ballmer offering to buy the L A  Clippers for  2B a benchmark has been set  In 2013  Forbes said the Raptors are worth  500M plus  C mon  Close to  1 5B is more likely  Then you have the Maple Leafs  Forbes said the company was worth  1 2B in 2013  Finally  you the Toronto FC  which Forbes said was worth  120M in 2012  Let s use  150M now  As for the other assets  let s say another  100M  Add it all up and you get about  3B  37 5  of MLSE at  3B plus  1B for the Jays gets you  2 1B  And if you need any further confirmation  look how well MSG s stock has done recently  It owns the New York Knicks  Rangers  Madison Square Gardens arena as well as specialty channels 
3  Rogers owns close to 6 000 cell towers across Canada  American Tower  a publicly traded cell tower company  owns 68 000 towers and has a valuation of  35B  That s over  500 000 USD each per tower  Let s be conservative and give Rogers a lower value of  400 000 per each  That gets you  2 4B USD  A publicly traded Canadian cell tower company would get a huge following given the strong recurring revenues  high operating leverage and limited competition 
There you have it   1B in securities  at least  2B in sports franchises and at least  2 4B in cell towers  That s a lot of dry powder to get Rogers  stock back on track
