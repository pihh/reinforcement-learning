103535,325050,CPB,Proxy solicitor Okapi hires Harnett from Strategic Governance Advisors,news,"By Jessica DiNapoli and Svea Herbst Bayliss
NEW YORK  Reuters    Okapi Partners  a proxy solicitor that has long worked for activist hedge funds Elliott Management and Starboard Value  is hiring a senior executive from an advisory firm to help expand its business with corporate clients  three people familiar with the matter said this week 
Okapi  which specializes in guiding clients through shareholder votes on proxy contests at companies like  Campbell Soup   N CPB  and planned mergers like this year s Bristol Myers Squibb  N BMY  takeover of Celgene  NASDAQ CELG   recruited Mark Harnett  an industry veteran  to join later this month 
Harnett 60  most recently worked at public relations firm Sard Verbinnen   Co s corporate governance advisory unit  Strategic Governance Advisors  which was launched by former Institutional Shareholder Services executive Chris Cernich in 2016  Harnett s last day at Strategic Governance Advisors was Thursday  He joined Sard s public relations business in 2015 
The bulk of his career was spent counting votes in corporate battles at MacKenzie Partners  the proxy solicitor he co founded with Daniel Burch in 1992  He worked there until 2015 
After a few years of advising corporate clients on how to engage with activist investors  Harnett was ready to return to his roots and the nitty gritty work of vote counting  the sources said 
Okapi was founded by Bruce Goldfarb and Patrick McHugh  who worked together at proxy solicitor Georgeson Inc   at the height of the financial crisis in 2008 when activism was finding fresh traction  The firm has a reputation for working with activists like Elliott and Starboard but it also has other types of clients such as mutual fund firms 
Since its founding  pressure from activists on companies has steadily increased  Last year  for example  was a banner year for activists who put more capital to work than ever before  targeted a record number of companies and won a record number of board seats  data from Lazard show  While many activists lost money last year  their returns have largely rebounded this year with a handful including Pershing Square  NYSE SQ  Capital Management  ValueAct Capital  Trian Fund Management and Starboard Value posting double digit returns in the first half  according to investors ",2019-10-04,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/proxy-solicitor-okapi-hires-harnett-from-strategic-governance-advisors-1992020,1992020
103536,325051,CPB,Day Ahead  Top 3 Things to Watch,news,"Investing com   Here s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow 
1  Private Sector Jobs  Services Activity in Focus 
The U S  labor market and services sectors will be in focus on Wednesday  with the release of ADP s measure of private sector employment and the ISM s non manufacturing index 
The ADP report is due at 8 15 AM ET  13 15 GMT  
Economists  on average  expect that private nonfarm payrolls rose by 140 000 last month  up from 125 000 in October 
The update on the private labor market comes just days ahead of Friday s nonfarm payrolls report 
An ISM survey on the service sector activity  meanwhile  is slated for 10 00 AM ET  15 00 GMT 
Economists forecast that ISM non manufacturing data for November will show a slight downtick to a reading of 54 5 from 54 7 previously   However  a reading above 50 means the sector is still growing 
2  Crude Inventories Data in Spotlight
The Energy Information Administration  EIA  releases its petroleum report on Wednesday 
The EIA is expected to report a draw in crude stockpiles of about 1 73 million barrels 
Crude oil futures settled up 14 cents to settle at  56 10 in a choppy session as traders weighed fading hopes of a U S  China trade deal against expectations for OPEC to announce cuts at a meeting later this week 
 The global oil supply demand balance requires an extension of the current OPEC  cuts   Goldman Sachs said 
Ahead of the EIA report  the American Petroleum Institute released data  which  while not perfectly correlated with the EIA s report often serves as an early indication of weekly petroleum levels  that showed weekly crude stockpiles fell by 3 7 million barrels last week
3  Campbell Soup Earnings Due
  Campbell Soup    NYSE CPB  reports earnings before the opening bell Wednesday 
Ahead of the report  some on Wall Street have warned that sales may fall short of expectations as a later date for Thanksgiving and the sale of its U K  snacks segment will likely keep a lid on growth 
 We think net sales may trail consensus given the impact of a later Thanksgiving on soup shipments   Wells Fargo said in a note to clients 
Campbell Soup is expected to report earnings of 72 cents a share on revenue of  2 2 billion  That would be down from 79 cents a share in earnings on revenue of  2 69 billion in the year ago quarter 
Shares were up 0 9  on Tuesday and are up 44 2  this year ",2019-12-03,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/day-ahead-top-3-things-to-watch-2032938,2032938
103537,325052,CPB,After a String of Divestments  Can Campbell Soup Resume Its Growth Path ,news,"Campbell Soup  NYSE CPB  has seen better times  The processed food and snacks company  with its iconic  Campbell s  brand of soups  has suffered falling operating and net income over the last two fiscal years  Though the company delivered revenue growth over that same period  net income tumbled from  887 million to just  211 million  a steep 76  plunge 
Campbell s problems seem to be two pronged  First  the company s gross margin has been weakening  starting out at 41 8  in fiscal 2017 and declining steadily to 35 9  in 2018 and then 33 2  the following year  This seems to demonstrate a lack of pricing power  Second  the company has a boatload of debt that cost the company  356 million in interest last year  Gross debt stood at  8 3 billion against just  61 million of cash as of Oct  2019 
The company has a stable of strong  iconic brands and has counted itself as one of the premier food stocks for investors over the decades  In the last six months  Campbell has announced a series of divestitures to raise cash and realign its business for growth  Can investors rest assured that the company is now on the right track 

A string of divestitures
With such a heavy debt load  management started to sell off various businesses during calendar year 2019  In February  Campbell parted with its U S  refrigerated soup business and in April  it sold Garden Fresh Gourmet  Total net proceeds amounted to  55 million  In June  the company let go of Bolthouse Farms for approximately  500 million and in July  its Kelsen business fetched  300 million 
In the biggest of its divestitures from last year  Campbell sold its Arnott s biscuit business for around  2 2 billion  A month later  the European chips business sold for around  80 million  This string of divestitures is expected to generate aggregate net proceeds of  3 billion for the company and will help to alleviate its debt load and generate cash for working capital purposes 
New operating model
Now  the company is focusing on building strong brands with a strategy that consists of two core divisions  snacks and meals   beverages  and 13 categories that represent nearly 80  of total sales  Management has also implemented a four pillar strategy along with a new operating model that promises to focus on both growth and optimization of the company s cost structure 
The first pillar is to create a profitable growth model by focusing on the Pepperidge Farm and Snyder s Lance brands within the snacks division  Investments will be made to model Snyder s Lance after Pepperidge Farm as the latter has shown promising 3  compound annual growth over the last three years  New products will also be introduced for the Goldfish  Cape Cod  and Kettle brands  and these will be funded by cost savings from recent integration efforts 
Management is also focusing its attention on turning soup around  as this is a  4 billion category that has strong brand recognition  The company has developed a three year road map that will more clearly define the many brands within the soup category  cut time for research and development  and transform retail and channel presence 
The second pillar is to fuel investments with targeted cost savings  The idea is to drive total enterprise savings of  850 million by the end of the fiscal year 2022  So far   560 million of this goal has already been achieved in the previous fiscal year  with another  290 million earmarked for the next three years 
The third pillar is to build a winning team and culture by adopting a different metric driven incentive structure  This will now be based on three metrics  net sales  adjusted earnings per share  EPS   and cash flow  By linking compensation to these three key performance indicators  management hopes to drive the right behavior through alignment of objectives 
Finally  the last pillar is aptly titled  deliver on the promise of our purpose   This will incorporate sustainability practices into the supply chain and enhance employees  connections to the communities where people work and live 
A three year transformation plan
Management has worked out a three year  transformation  plan based on the above four pillars  For fiscal 2020  the goal is to stabilize the business after the aforementioned divestitures  For fiscal 2021  acceleration is the goal  with growth being a key objective for the company as it starts to deliver on these many initiatives  By fiscal 2022  Campbell plans to sustain this momentum and deliver steady and sustainable growth 
The company s long term target is to achieve annual growth of 1  to 2  for organic sales  4  to 6  for adjusted earnings before interest and taxes  and 7  to 9  for adjusted earnings per share 
Tempting prospects  but execution is key
Personally  I find the above objectives and transformation plans lofty  It s a good start for management to identify what went wrong and to stem the decline  but for growth to restart  execution and focus are essential 
Campbell s problems lie with both profitability and its high levels of debt  While alleviating some of the debt through its divestments may buy the company breathing time  ultimately  it has to continue to reduce more of this crippling burden through higher levels of free cash flow generation if it is to stand a chance in growing its net income 
As for gross margins  the stated initiatives will take time to work their way through Campbell s portfolio  but I am optimistic on this front  as the company has a strong  recognizable stable of brands that it can leverage 
All in  I believe the company has a solid  coherent plan for turning the business around  but growth is still probably at least one or two years away ",2020-01-08,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pff72,2054941
103538,325053,CPB,Is Campbell Soup Stock a Buy ,news,"Campbell Soup Company  NYSE CPB  celebrated its 150 year anniversary in 2019  Shares of this food and beverage company showed impressive results in 2019  as Campbell s share price increased 49   some 20 percentage points above the S P 500 s rise 
By selling unsuccessful or lagging brands  acquiring new brands  and tightening geographic focus  Campbell Soup is quickly changing its breadth in the market    potentially keeping the company on track to exceed earnings expectations in the current fiscal year 

Cutting away the fat
In addition to its namesake brand  Campbell Soup s well known brands include Pepperidge Farm  Prego  and Swanson  Adding to that portfolio in 2018  Campbell acquired Snyder s Lance  which includes Snyder s of Hanover snacks  
Campbell CEO Mark Clouse is strategically divesting underperforming brands and exiting the fresh foods business while increasing the concentration on packaged meals  soups  and snacks  Campbell s endeavors in its fresh foods business lowered earnings and caused an abrupt departure in 2018 of then CEO Denise Morrison  Selling off Campbell s fresh division and its international businesses will help pay down debt  maintain a high focus on the North America region  and streamline segments like snacks and meals and beverages   
Cutting away inefficiency  Campbell recently sold Australian snack business Arnott s as well as other businesses in Malaysia  Hong Kong  Japan  and Australia  to New York investment firm KKR   Co for  2 2 billion in cash  This wrapped up the sale of the company s international division  Campbell had sold its European chips business to the privately held Valeo Foods in October 2019 for  80 million   
Setting the bar for 2020
Campbell s snacks segment and its meals and beverages segment made up 45  and 55   respectively  of Campbell s total net sales in the recent first quarter of fiscal 2020  Sales in the meals and beverage segment decreased by roughly 2 8  year over year while the snacks segment grew sales roughly 1 6   Campbell had total revenue of  2 18 billion during the quarter  which is  19 million less than the same quarter one year earlier  Campbell s attributed the drop to a loss during the sale of the European chip business  
Gross margins improved  rising 30 basis points to 33 8  as the company increased productivity and worked on cost savings initiatives and raising prices  Capital expenditures are expected to be  350 million in 2020    up from  111 million in 2019    which will be used to expand Milano cookie  Goldfish cracker  and chip capacity  which will help the company meet growing demand  The Goldfish crackers brand is the largest brand within Pepperidge Farm and reportedly sold  574 7 million in the 52 weeks ending May 2019  making up an estimated 64 5  of Pepperidge Farm s total sales  Increasing production capacity of Pepperidge brands Milano cookie and Goldfish crackers should create a tailwind for a growing segment of the company     
Campbell projects fiscal 2020 net sales will grow between 1  and 3  while adjusted earnings per share are expected to rise 9  to 11    
An optimistic outlook
A forward price to earnings ratio of 19 11 doesn t put Campbell Soup at a deep discount  However  comparing Campbell Soup against packaged food and snack powerhouses Kellogg Company and PepsiCo  Campbell Soup is in the middle  with Kellogg at 17 54 and Pepsi at 25 56  which indicates Campbell isn t overly expensive  A forward dividend yield of 2 89  is below Kellogg s 3 35  but higher than Pepsi s 2 82   
Overall  Campbell looks to be headed in the right direction by narrowing the strategic focus to North America and concentrating on the growing segments of the business  The acquisition of Snyder s Lance may be the first of many snack acquisitions in Clouse s strategy of chasing growing segments while lowering costs    making shares of Campbell Soup stock a buy ",2020-01-12,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/ph2ai,2057599

103547,325062,CPB,Here s How Philip Morris  PM  Is Placed Ahead Of Q4 Earnings,opinion,Philip Morris International Inc    NYSE PM   is slated to report fourth quarter 2019 results on Feb 6  This tobacco giant delivered a positive earnings surprise of 5 9  in the last reported quarter  Further  its earnings have outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8 4   on average  in the trailing four quarters The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter earnings has been stable at  1 22 per share over the past 30 days  This suggests a decline of 2 4  from the year ago period s reported figure  The consensus mark for revenues stands at  7 759 million  indicating a rise of 2 4  from the figure reported in the year ago period The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 earnings per share stands at  5 20  suggesting a rise of almost 2  from the year ago period s reported figure  The consensus mark for revenues stands at  29 8 billion Philip Morris International Inc  Price and EPS Surprise   Stern Regulations Dent Cigarette VolumesPhilip Morris has been battling reducing cigarette sales volumes for a while due to stern government regulations and rising health consciousness  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter cigarette shipment volumes is pegged at 178 billion units compared with 190 billion units reported in the year ago period Notably  the tobacco industry has been facing many challenges as governments around the world are imposing restrictions on tobacco companies  which in turn are lowering cigarette consumption  The U S  Food and Drug Administration  FDA  has made it mandatory for tobacco companies to use precautionary labels on cigarette packets to dissuade customers from smoking  Apart from this  the court wants tobacco companies to admit that cigarettes have been made addictive  through the issuance of corrective ads   To add to the woes  the FDA is bent on drastically reducing nicotine in cigarettes to minimally addictive levels  Also  the FDA had earlier announced that tobacco makers must seek marketing authorization for any tobacco product introduced after Feb 15  2007  The law was extended by the agency to include e cigarettes  pipe tobacco  cigars and hookah   Battered by such factors  Philip Morris  revenues from combustible products declined 5 7  during the third quarter  Also  total cigarette and heated tobacco unit shipment volumes inched down 2 1  to 199 5 billion units  Further  management  in its last earnings call  guided for a 1 1 5  decline in total shipment volumes  including cigarettes and heated tobacco categories  in 2019 on a like for like basis  Moreover  total tobacco industry volumes  excluding the United States and China  are expected to showcase a decline of 2 5  Pricing   RRPs Offer RespitePhilip Morris has been responding to the changing market scenario by offering reduced risk products or RRPs   In fact  the company s IQOS  a smokeless cigarette  counts amongst one of the leading RRPs in the industry  Last year  the company launched additional versions of IQOS in Japan  which have been depicting encouraging results  Notably  strong growth in IQOS boosted revenues in the RRPs unit  which rose almost 63 4  to  1 344 million in the third quarter  The company earlier stated that it expects consistent growth in IQOS and the Heated Tobacco category Apart from this  Philip Morris  strong pricing has helped it stay afloat in the industry  even in the face of declining cigarette volumes  Though higher pricing might lead to a decline in cigarette consumption  it is seen that smokers tend to absorb price increases owing to the addictive quality of cigarettes  Evidently  higher pricing at the combustible tobacco portfolio has been aiding the company s performance for a while  Hence  solid pricing and strength in RRPs are likely to have driven Philip Morris  performance in the fourth quarter For 2019  management expects adjusted earnings per share of  5 14  Excluding the impacts of unfavorable currency of approximately 14 cents  management expects earnings per share growth of at least 9  to  5 28 What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model predicts an

103548,325063,CPB,Can Campbell  CPB  Keep The Earnings Surprise Streak Alive ,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  Campbell Soup  CPB   which belongs to the Zacks Food   Miscellaneous industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
When looking at the last two reports  this maker of canned soup  Pepperidge Farm cookies and V8 juice has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates  The company has topped estimates by 7 74   on average  in the last two quarters 
For the most recent quarter  Campbell was expected to post earnings of  0 69 per share  but it reported  0 78 per share instead  representing a surprise of 13 04   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  0 41 per share  while it actually produced  0 42 per share  a surprise of 2 44  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Campbell lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Campbell currently has an Earnings ESP of  3 34   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  2  Buy  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2020-02-03,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-campbell-cpb-keep-the-earnings-surprise-streak-alive-200504132,200504132

103574,325089,CPB,Day Ahead  Top 3 Things to Watch,news,"Investing com   Here are the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow  
1  Inflation  Consumer Spending and Manufacturing on the Way
The update on the health of the U S  consumer and the pace of consumer prices due 8 30 AM ET  12 30 GMT  on Friday will help traders assess whether the slowdown in the global economy is beginning to seep into the U S  economy  
The Fed s preferred inflation measure  core PCE price index  which calculates spending minus volatile food and energy costs  is expected to rise to 0 3  in July from the prior month  but remain unchanged at 1 6  from a year earlier 
Personal income for July is forecast to have slowed to a rise of 0 3  from 0 4  in the prior month  while personal spending is expected to have increased to a rise of 0 5  from 0 3  
The Chicago purchasing managers index  PMI   which gives investors insight into manufacturing in the Midwest  will come out at 9 45 AM ET 
The August PMI is expected to rise to 48 1  according to economists 
Consumer sentiment data is also expected to be closely watched 
The final measure of the University of Michigan s August consumer sentiment index  due at 10 00 AM ET is forecast to show a reading of 92 1  unchanged from the preliminary number 
2  Oil Rig Count Rolls In
Traders will look to the latest rig count data due Friday for clues on crude production activity after U S  production surged to a record 12 5 million barrels a day last week  
Data last week showed the number of oil rigs operating in the U S  fell by 16 to 754 
The weekly rig count is an important barometer for the drilling industry and serves as a proxy for oil production and oil services demand 
Oil prices are set to end the week higher as signs of tightening global supplies help ease fears of slowing oil demand growth  driven by the weakness in the global economy  Sentiment on oil has also been bolstered by optimism on trade as China said it may cooperate  boosting hopes of a meeting between the U S  and China next month    
3   Campbell Soup  Earnings Due
 Campbell Soup   NYSE CPB  reports earnings before the opening bell Friday amid a shakeup at the top  as the food company on Thursday hired Mick Beekhuizen to succeed Anthony DiSilvestro as chief financial officer  
The move comes as Chief Executive Mark Clouse  who took up the reins earlier this year  bolsters his team to revive some of the food company s brands amid stiff competition from upstart brands that draw on the health and wellness trend appreciated by younger consumers  
Campbell Soup is expected to report earnings of 41 cents a share on revenue of  1 98 billion ",2019-08-29,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/day-ahead-top3-things-to-watch-1966694,1966694
103575,325090,CPB,Wall St  rises on trade hopes  strong consumer spending data,news,"By Akanksha Rana
 Reuters    U S  stocks rose on Friday as an easing of trade tensions between the United States and China  and data showing solid domestic consumer spending abated concerns that major economies were on the brink of a recession 
The Commerce Department said consumer spending  which accounts for more than two thirds of U S  economic activity  rose 0 6  last month after an unrevised 0 3  gain in June 
However  the pace of growth in consumption is unlikely to be sustained amid tepid income gains 
A sharp heightening of tensions this month after the U S  and China slapped tariffs on each other s goods  caused panic across global markets and resulted in a key part of the U S  yield curve  a closely followed recession indicator  inverting 
The two economic superpowers gave signs on Thursday that they will resume trade talks  as the countries discussed the next round of in person negotiations in September ahead of a looming deadline for additional U S  tariffs 
That helped Wall Street rise more than 1  on Thursday and set the indexes on pace to post their best weekly gain since June  The benchmark S P 500  SPX  index is now 3  off its record high hit in late July 
 It is a continuation of what we saw yesterday and there is optimism that there s going to be some sort of progress  that seems to be the biggest factor   said Scott Brown  chief economist at Raymond James in St  Petersburg  Florida 
Trade sensitive technology  SPLRCT  and industrial stocks  SPLRCI  rose 0 58  and 0 81   respectively  while chipmakers  which get a major portion of their revenue  jumped 
The Philadelphia chip index  SOX  was up 1 40  
However  markets are bracing for a new round of U S  tariffs on some Chinese goods that come into effect on Sunday 
 The market believes that there will be some type of negotiation  but there is real danger this trade conflict is going to last  especially with the magnitude of September tariffs   added Brown 
Hopes that the Federal Reserve would step in to impede any slowdown in economic growth as a result of the trade war  have led traders to fully price in an interest rate cut at the central bank meeting next month 
Investors are now watching out for the monthly jobs report and the manufacturing data next week to gauge the health of the U S  economy  and gain insight regarding the Fed s path of future interest rate cuts

NEW YORK  Reuters    U S  stocks were in the red on Friday afternoon as investors were wary after mixed data and ahead of a holiday weekend in which a fresh round of U S  tariffs on Chinese imports were due to kick in 
While Wall Street was on course to register a weekly gain  August was expected to show its biggest monthly decline since May after escalations in U S  China trade tensions and the inversion of a key part of the U S  yield curve which is often a recessionary signal 
Wall Street markets will be closed on Monday for the U S  Labor Day holiday  Since bonds have recently outperformed stocks  investors may have taken early action to rebalance their portfolios for the end of the month due to the long weekend  according to Vinay Pande  head of trading strategies at UBS Global Wealth Management in New York 
 Trying to make a very large move in the last day of the month when Labor day is following is not the best idea   said Pande   Most of the rebalancing that was expected     has likely been accomplished in the days leading up to the long weekend  
U S  consumer spending increased solidly in July as households bought a range of goods and services  While this could allay financial market fears of a recession  a survey from the University of Michigan  also out Friday  showed its consumer sentiment index in August dropping by the most since December 2012  amid nerves over the U S  China trade war 
 The news today has been mixed  There was positive news about consumption data and negative news on consumer confidence   said Pande

103582,325097,CPB,Know These 3 Facts To Avoid Paying Half Your Retirement Income To The IRS   January 22  2020,opinion,"Neglecting to withdraw a required minimum distribution  RMD  from an IRA by the due date brings about a painful tax code penalty  50   Yes  you read that right  If you are supposed to withdraw at least  4 000 and  uh oh   did not do as such  you have to write the IRS a check for  2 000  Keep in mind that on January 1  2020  the RMD rules were modified 
Like many investors  you re likely aiming to build a comfortable nest egg to ensure a comfortable retirement  Among retirement financial planners  this is called the  accumulation phase   In this phase  your goal is to invest wisely by choosing stocks with long term potential for your retirement portfolio  such as Campbell Soup  CPB   a current top ranked dividend stock 
There is also a second phase of retirement planning that gets less focus   despite the fact that it s the more interesting part  It s the  distribution phase   which essentially means spending the wealth you ve worked hard to amass 
Planning for the distribution phase is the time where you may make decisions about where you ll want to live in retirement  whether you ll want to travel  hobbies you may pursue  and other decisions that will affect your retirement spending 
Along with these aspects  it is important to consider the RMD that applies to most retirement accounts  Essentially  the IRS requires you to withdraw a specific sum from your qualified retirement accounts once you attain a certain age  That age used to be 70 1 2 but it is now 72 
Why does the IRS require these distributions  It s straightforward   they need to ensure they get their tax  In the event that this standard didn t exist  individuals could live off other pay and never pay tax on their retirement investment returns  So  that cash could be left to family or companions as an inheritance without the IRS getting any taxes from you 
What You Need to Know About RMDs
Which types of retirement accounts have RMDs  Qualified retirement accounts like IRA accounts  401 k s  457 plans and other tax deferred retirement savings plans like a TSP  403 b   TSA  SEP  or SIMPLE IRA plan require withdrawals in retirement 
When do I have to start taking distributions  For most accounts  you must take your first distribution by April 1 of the year following the calendar year in which you reach age 72  If you retire after that age  you must take your first RMD from your 401 k   profit sharing  403 b   or other defined contribution plan by April 1 of the year following the calendar year in which you retire 
Every year after your start date  you are required to take your RMD by December 31  Remember  for Roth IRAs you do not have to take an RMD because you paid taxes before contributing  However  other types of Roth accounts do require RMDs  but you may be able to avoid them  for instance  by rolling your Roth 401 k  into your Roth IRA  
What happens if I don t take my RMD  The penalty for not taking a required minimum distribution  or not taking a large enough distribution  is a 50  tax on the amount not withdrawn in time 
How much cash do I need to withdraw  The RMD you are required to take is calculated by dividing your previous year s December 31st retirement account balance by a  distribution period  factor dependent on your age 
Here s an example to give you an idea of the amount  Ann is 71 and will take her first RMD in the year following the year she turns 72  Her IRA balance at the end of the prior year was  100 000  Her  distribution period  factor is 27 4  Dividing  100 000 by 27 4 equals  3 649 63  This is how much Ann is required to withdraw for her first RMD

103584,325099,CPB,Here re 4 Food Stock Treats If You Find TreeHouse Foods Bland,opinion,TreeHouse Foods  Inc    NYSE THS   has not been in a good shape lately  owing to its dismal sales trend   especially in the Baked Goods and Meal Solutions units  Also  the company is grappling with escalated costs  These factors have compelled quite a few investors to steer clear of this Zacks Rank  4  Sell  stock  which has plummeted 17 8  in a year against the  s growth of 15 5  Clearly  there are players in the Food   Miscellaneous space  which have contributed to the industry s solid run with their sound fundamentals and impressive performances  However  before that  let s take account of the factors weighing on TreeHouse Foods Here s Why TreeHouse Foods Appears UnappetizingTreeHouse Foods has been seeing soft sales for a while now  The company s third quarter 2019 results marked its tenth consecutive quarter of year over year sales decline  We note that this packaged food and beverage manufacturer has been battling weak trends in the Baked Goods and Meal Solutions units for the last few quarters  Sales in the Baked Goods segment fell 6 7  year over year in the third quarter  whereas net sales in the Meals Solutions unit declined 6 6   Sales in both segments were hurt by SKU rationalization efforts  adverse volume mix and currency rates Moreover  TreeHouse Foods has a significant international presence  courtesy of its manufacturing facilities in the United States  Canada and Italy  This keeps the company exposed to volatile currency movements  which in fact was a headwind in the last reported quarter  Apart from this  TreeHouse Foods  gross margin contracted 150 basis points in the last reported quarter due to lower volumes and increased expenses related to change in regulatory requirements  Moreover  adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations declined 2 6  due to fixed cost impacts stemming from lower volumes We believe that continuation of such trends might affect the company s performance in the days ahead Food Space   Not Devoid of DelicaciesDespite having underperformers like TreeHouse Foods  the Food   Miscellaneous space appears buoyant  with a rank of  81  which places it among the top 32  of more than 250 Zacks industries  Certainly  there are companies in the space  which are benefiting from their focus on innovation  product launches and diversification  and solid pricing initiatives Also  benefits from acquisitions and divestitures are helping these companies boost their portfolio and focus on areas with better growth potential  Additionally  many food companies are gaining from efforts to augment organic and natural offerings in response to rising health consciousness  Stringent cost containment efforts and efficient productivity programs are also helping a host of food players stand out On that note  we have highlighted four stocks from the Food   Miscellaneous universe  which carry a solid Zacks Rank and flaunt

103586,325101,CPB,K Vs  CPB  Which Stock Should Value Investors Buy Now ,opinion,"Investors interested in stocks from the Food   Miscellaneous sector have probably already heard of Kellogg  K  and Campbell Soup  CPB   But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks  Let s take a closer look 
There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks  but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns  The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions  while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits 
Currently  both Kellogg and Campbell Soup are holding a Zacks Rank of   2  Buy   This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions  so investors should feel comfortable knowing that these stocks have improving earnings outlooks  But this is only part of the picture for value investors 
Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional  tried and true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics  These include the long favored P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company s fair value 
K currently has a forward P E ratio of 17 47  while CPB has a forward P E of 19 33  We also note that K has a PEG ratio of 2 91  This popular figure is similar to the widely used P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also considers a company s expected EPS growth rate  CPB currently has a PEG ratio of 3 25 
Another notable valuation metric for K is its P B ratio of 7 31  Investors use the P B ratio to look at a stock s market value versus its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  CPB has a P B of 11 82 
These are just a few of the metrics contributing to K s Value grade of B and CPB s Value grade of C

bourses in Europe and Asia have opened 1  lower across the board  and have seen some of the steepest decline so far this year  Talking about the U S  stock market  worries about the spread of China s coronavirus has dragged the Dow below its coveted 29 000 mark that the blue chip index surpassed for the first time this month  In fact  the blue chip index and the broader S P 500 ended last week in

those infected neared 3 000  What s more  questions are now being raised over the effectiveness of the confinement on cities like Wuhan  which is considered to be the epicenter of the virus The virus

recently featured in the blog include  Ares Capital Corp    NASDAQ ARCC    Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Corp    NYSE BAH    Campbell Soup Company   NYSE CPB    DHT Holdings  Inc    NYSE DHT   and The Buckle  Inc    NYSE BKE   Here are highlights from Monday s Analyst Blog  Fretting a Market Pullback  Buy These 5 Safe StocksU S  stocks are  undoubtedly  selling off sharply as worries mounted over the spread of the deadly coronavirus  Major bourses in Europe and Asia have opened 1  lower across the board  and have seen some of the steepest decline so far this year  Talking about the U S  stock market  worries about the spread of China s coronavirus has dragged the Dow below its coveted 29 000 mark that the blue chip index surpassed for the first time this month  In fact  the blue chip index and the broader S P 500 ended last week in the red  thereby snapping a two week winning streak Major U S  benchmarks pulled back after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed that the death toll in China mounted to 80  and those infected neared 3 000  What s more  questions are now being raised over the effectiveness of the confinement on cities like Wuhan  which is considered to be the epicenter of the virus The virus has certainly raised an alarm  quite similar to SARS  severe acute respiratory syndrome   Lest we forget  SARS  which erupted in 2002  resulted in the death of 800 and triggered a severe economic slump that fettered global stocks With so many people affected during the Lunar New Year holiday  travel related stocks were hit hard  After all  market pundits fear possible contagion  as hundreds of millions of passengers traveled during the holiday season  By the way  manufacturers of luxury items also felt the heat  After all  such companies rely heavily on outlays by Chinese tourists But it s just not the coronavirus outbreak that s triggering a stock market pullback  Extreme bullish sentiments are leading to overbought conditions  leaving the stock market vulnerable  Per the Investors Intelligence survey  currently  percentage of respondents with a bullish view increased to 59 4  on the back of a trade truce and heathy domestic economic scenario And how can we forget that the United States  for most part of next year  will face political uncertainty  eventually leading to gyrations in the stock market  But  it s not just political risks that should bother investors  Rapid increase in government borrowing along with threat of more taxes and stringent regulations may jeopardize the U S  stock market performance The U S  tech sector  in the meantime  has helped the broader U S  stock market climb north since the 2008 financial crisis and significantly outdo all other major equity markets  Thanks to FAANG stocks and their adaptation of technologies  including AI and cloud computing  the tech sector has gained  But now  FAANG stocks are facing increasing threat of regulation  leading us to believe that such stocks may not perform well in the near future  And with it  the broader stock market may underperform Buy These 5 Ultra Safe Stocks NowWith the markets witnessing a major pullback  investing in stocks that provide excellent risk adjusted returns seems judicious  The best way to go about doing this is by creating a portfolio of low beta stocks  which are inherently less volatile than the markets they trade in

103619,325134,CPB,Campbell Q1 Earnings On Deck  Will CPB Stock Continue To Climb  ,opinion,"Campbell Soup   NYSE CPB   is set to report its first quarter financial results before the market opens on Wednesday  December 4  The company has seen its shares climb over 41  in 2019 to outpace the broader food market s 15 3  run 
The canned food company has made its unforeseen run after posting financial results that exceeded management s targets in each of the past four quarters  The firm is now riding its breakout performance into its fiscal 2020  where it looks to keep the momentum going 
Rebound Year in Fiscal 2019
Campbell was hit hard by the consumer shift away from highly processed foods to more health conscious foods  To make matters worse it made some ill fated acquisitions of brands such as Bolthouse Farms and Garden Fresh Gourmet  which contributed to the weak growth in fiscal 2018 
However  after this challenging period  the food company has put together some strong quarterly performances that has convinced some investors that things are turning around  Campbell s fourth quarter sent the stock trading higher after it reported that net sales from continuing operations rose 2  to  1 78 billion and adjusted earnings from continuing operations grew 14  to  0 42 per share 
Campbell s snack segment yielded strong results as it saw organic growth of 4   which helped boost overall sales  Wall Street was also pleased to see positive results from the meals and beverage business  Sales of soup in the U S  unexpectedly increased 3  in the quarter after years of declining revenue 
Will Fiscal 2020 Be Similar 
Looking forward to fiscal 2020  Campbell expects sales from continuing operations to rise between 1  and 3  and adjusted EPS to increase between 9  and 11   Wall Street will look for organic sales to continue its climb as the demand for Campbell s products continues its recovery 
Campbell s recovery plan involved heavy spending on growth initiatives like marketing and product innovation  Despite the increased spending Campbell has employed to revive its sales  the firm has managed to increase quarterly earnings  which investors will expect to continue to see in this upcoming report  The company is confident that its marketing expenditures will eventually help Campbell stimulate growth in the current fiscal year and beyond 
Our Q1 consensus estimates forecast earnings from continuing operations to decline 13 9  to  0 68 per share and for sales from continuing operations to drop 18 6  to  2 19 billion  The meals and beverages segment is projected to bring in  1 23 billion  which is just below last year s figure and the snacks segment is predicted to slip 15 6  
Our full fiscal 2020 estimates call for a bottom line jump of 9 57  to  2 52 per share and a top line Y Y decrease of 11 8  to  8 25 billion 
Bottom Line 
Campbell Soup looks to post another quarter with encouraging financial metrics that can help further its recovery efforts  The food giant has made some ambitious acquisitions of snack franchise brands like Snyder s Lance to bulk up its product portfolio 
As a result  investors will now look for those recovery efforts to continue to bear results in the upcoming report  However  our consensus estimates indicate that Campbell isn t out of the woods yet as top and bottom line declines are anticipated  Campbell has risen 25  in the past six months which has helped drive over its YTD run

103620,325135,CPB,GNCGY Vs  CPB  Which Stock Is The Better Value Option ,opinion,"Investors with an interest in Food   Miscellaneous stocks have likely encountered both GREENCORE GRP  GNCGY  and Campbell Soup  CPB   But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors  We ll need to take a closer look to find out 
There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks  but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns  The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions  while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits 
GREENCORE GRP and Campbell Soup are sporting Zacks Ranks of  2  Buy  and  3  Hold   respectively  right now  This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions  so investors should feel comfortable knowing that GNCGY is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent  But this is only part of the picture for value investors 
Value investors are also interested in a number of tried and true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics  including the popular P E ratio  as well as the P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years 
GNCGY currently has a forward P E ratio of 12 77  while CPB has a forward P E of 18 73  We also note that GNCGY has a PEG ratio of 1 52  This popular metric is similar to the widely known P E ratio  with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company s expected earnings growth rate  CPB currently has a PEG ratio of 3 15 
Another notable valuation metric for GNCGY is its P B ratio of 6 31  The P B ratio pits a stock s market value against its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  CPB has a P B of 12 77 
Based on these metrics and many more  GNCGY holds a Value grade of A  while CPB has a Value grade of C 
GNCGY has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than CPB  so it seems like value investors will conclude that GNCGY is the superior option right now ",2019-12-02,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gncgy-vs-cpb-which-stock-is-the-better-value-option-200489610,200489610
103621,325136,CPB,Campbell Soup  CPB  Tops Q1 Earnings Estimates,opinion,"Campbell Soup  CPB  came out with quarterly earnings of  0 78 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 69 per share  This compares to earnings of  0 79 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 13 04   A quarter ago  it was expected that this maker of canned soup  Pepperidge Farm cookies and V8 juice would post earnings of  0 41 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 42  delivering a surprise of 2 44  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
Campbell  which belongs to the Zacks Food   Miscellaneous industry  posted revenues of  2 18 billion for the quarter ended October 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 51   This compares to year ago revenues of  2 69 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Campbell shares have added about 44 2  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 23 4  
What s Next for Campbell 
While Campbell has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Campbell was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  0 69 on  2 19 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  2 52 on  8 25 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year

103646,325161,CPB,Day Ahead  Top 3 Things to Watch,news,"Here s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow 
1  Jerome Powell Speaks Again
This time  Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell testifies about the economy and Fed interest rate policy before the House Financial Services Committee  headed by Rep  Maxine Waters  D Calif  At the hearing  which starts at 10 AM ET  15 00 GMT   Powell is likely to get many questions about consumer concerns  He will certainly be asked about how the Fed can help middle class and lower middle class workers 
Powell likely won t say much more than he said at Tuesday s hearing before the Senate Banking Committee  The Fed isn t in any rush to raise interest rates because of worries about slowing economic growth in the U S  and globally  he said 
Nor is the Fed in much of a rush to sell off huge amounts of the government securities it bought after the 2008 2009 financial crisis  Selling down that inventory would also put pressure on interest rates 
While unemployment is at record low levels and job growth is steady  some parts of the economy  especially housing  have slowed in the last half year or so

The Energy Information Agency will release its weekly reports on oil and natural gas inventories  production and imports at 10 30 AM ET  15 30 GMT

103655,325170,CPB,GNCGY Or CPB  Which Is The Better Value Stock Right Now ,opinion,"Investors interested in stocks from the Food   Miscellaneous sector have probably already heard of GREENCORE GRP  GNCGY  and Campbell Soup  CPB   But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks  Let s take a closer look 
We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends  while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits 
GREENCORE GRP has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while Campbell Soup has a Zacks Rank of  4  Sell  right now  The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates  so investors should rest assured that GNCGY has an improving earnings outlook  However  value investors will care about much more than just this 
Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional  tried and true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics  including the popular P E ratio  as well as the P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years 
GNCGY currently has a forward P E ratio of 12 58  while CPB has a forward P E of 18 46  We also note that GNCGY has a PEG ratio of 1 50  This metric is used similarly to the famous P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock s expected earnings growth rate  CPB currently has a PEG ratio of 3 10 
Another notable valuation metric for GNCGY is its P B ratio of 5 96  The P B ratio pits a stock s market value against its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  CPB has a P B of 12 57 
Based on these metrics and many more  GNCGY holds a Value grade of A  while CPB has a Value grade of D 
GNCGY has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than CPB  so it seems like value investors will conclude that GNCGY is the superior option right now ",2019-11-07,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gncgy-or-cpb-which-is-the-better-value-stock-right-now-200483901,200483901
103656,325171,CPB,Will Campbell  CPB  Beat Estimates Again In Its Next Earnings Report ,opinion,"If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report  you should consider Campbell Soup  CPB   This company  which is in the Zacks Food   Miscellaneous industry  shows potential for another earnings beat 
This maker of canned soup  Pepperidge Farm cookies and V8 juice has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 12 09  
For the most recent quarter  Campbell was expected to post earnings of  0 41 per share  but it reported  0 42 per share instead  representing a surprise of 2 44   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  0 46 per share  while it actually produced  0 56 per share  a surprise of 21 74  
Price and EPS Surprise

For Campbell  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Campbell has an Earnings ESP of  3 14  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on December 4  2019 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-11-20,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-campbell-cpb-beat-estimates-again-in-its-next-earnings-report-200487070,200487070

103686,325201,CPB,Campbell  CPB  Stock Soars After Q4 Earnings Beat  What s Next For The Company  ,opinion,"On Friday  Campbell   NYSE CPB   shares soared over 8  after the company reported strong Q4 results before the opening bell  The company has had a solid year thus far  rising over 42  year to date  The consumer staples company has benefited from the recent uncertainty that has plagued investors  sending them pouring into safer dividend yielding stocks  The consumer staples giant closed out their fiscal 2019 on a solid note and is looking to continue its success in the closing half of the year  Let s delve deeper into the company and how our Zacks estimates have them performing in the near future 
Overview and Q4 Performance 
The company is based out of Camden  New Jersey  and together with its subsidiaries  is a worldwide manufacturer and marketer of branded convenience food products  The company s brands are sold in approximately 120 countries  Some of their most recognized brands include Campbell s  Prego  Pepperidge Farm  V8  Swanson  and Pace 
In the third quarter of fiscal 2019  the company finalized the deal to sell off their Bolthouse Farms business as well as their Garden Fresh Gourmet business  After the transaction  Campbell now reports under the Meals and Beverages and Global Biscuits and Snacks segments  The company acquired Snyder s Lance last year  which has boosted its Global Biscuits and Snacks unit sales 
The company has been benefiting from its board led strategy of undergoing robust cost saving initiatives such as increasing their focus on their Snacks segment and divesting underperforming units 
In Q4  Campbell reported earnings of  0 42 per share  beating our estimates by 2 44   Revenues came in at  1 78 billion  missing our estimate by 11   The company s top line popped 2  and earnings were a whopping 96  surge from the year ago quarter  Campbell s Meals and Beverages segment reeled in  813 million and its organic sales increased 1   The hike in organic sales reflected strong performances form the company s US soups  Prego sauces  and Pace Mexican sauces  The Snacks segment rose 3  Y Y to  967 million and their organic sales rose 4   Their strong organic sales reflected the continued growth in Pepperidge Farm bakery products  Goldfish crackers and a few other products 
What Lies Ahead  
Our consensus estimates call for earnings to rise 1 27  next quarter and for the company to bring in  2 47 billion  a 8 35  drop from the prior year s quarter  The Meals and Beverages segment is expected to slip roughly 1  to  1 23 billion and Global Biscuits and Snacks is forecasted to total  1 22 billion in Q1 2020 
The company has introduced new soup recipes with added chicken and tomatoes and eliminated preservatives in order to appeal to the new health conscious consumer landscape  The company s initiatives to cut costs and focus on the aspects of their business that perform well have boded well for the company thus far  Selling certain segments of their business that were weighing down their bottom line helped catapult Campbell s earnings in Q4 
Campbell is looking to turn things around  and if it continues to adhere its products to the conventional consumer and continues focusing on strengthening their snacks segment  then the company s YTD run will likely increase

103712,325227,CPB,Third Point gains ISS  Glass Lewis support in Campbell proxy fight,news,"By Svea Herbst Bayliss NEW YORK  Reuters    Shareholder advisory firms Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis backed a push by Daniel Loeb s hedge fund to make changes at  Campbell Soup  Co  N CPB   including replacing some board members  ISS recommended that investors elect all five of Loeb s Third Point LLC board nominees  giving a boost to the activist firm  which is fighting a high profile proxy battle with the company   The dissident slate seems well qualified to contribute to the company s turnaround by providing relevant industry expertise  fresh ideas  and a greater sense of urgency   ISS said in a report  adding  As such  votes FOR all dissident nominees are warranted   Days ago Loeb backed off his call to replace the entire 12 person Campbell board  Investors are expected to vote on directors at the Nov  29 annual meeting  ISS is generally seen as being reluctant to recommend ousting all board members  In its report  ISS backed former Blue Buffalo CEO Kurt Schmidt and former Hostess Brands Inc CEO William Toler as well as ComScore Inc president Sarah Hofstetter and former Uber Technologies executive Bozoma Saint John  It also recommended support for Third Point partner Munib Islam  However  Glass Lewis was not as whole hearted in its support of Third point  recommending only three of its nominees   We believe shareholders would be best served by supporting changes to the board intended specifically to increase the number of directors who have applicable  recent operating and branding experience in the packaged food industry   Glass Lewis said  The firm added that the appointment of a Third Point representative to Campbell s board would not be warranted at this time   Third Point has said its nominees can provide operational  marketing and branding as well as financial expertise to help turn around Campbell s lagging stock performance  The company has been hurt by falling soup sales plus its fast paced acquisitions spree  In August  it announced plans to sell its fresh foods and international units  Campbell responded to the ISS and Glass Lewis reports by urging shareholders to support its full slate and said again that it had offered to expand the board to include two Third Point nominees  Schmidt and Hofstetter  It again voiced its objection to having a Third Point employee on its board  Third Point said in a statement that the findings of the two advisory firms conveyed a clear message to shareholders      the time has come to refresh the recipe in Campbell s boardroom   ISS said Campbell s underperforming total stock return and weak fundamentals are linked to its acquisition strategy and poor execution on mergers as well as a lack of focus on its core business   In light of these factors  the dissident has presented a compelling case that change at the board level is warranted   the report said  Third Point owns roughly 7 percent of Campbell s stock and it has allied with George Strawbridge  a descendant of John Dorrance who invented condensed soup and ran the company about a century ago  Three Dorrance heirs currently serve on the Campbell board and they plus another family member control roughly 40 percent of the shares  making Loeb s proxy contest all the more difficult  At the outset  Loeb was pushing for a sale of the company but later backed away from that and more recently recommended splitting the company to make it more attractive to potential buyers  It also warned the company against hastily hiring a new chief executive during the proxy contest  The company had criticized the hedge fund for not having a concrete plan to turn around the company   
ISS said it may make more sense for the company to improve its operations instead of pursuing a sale right now   The dissident s seemingly premature focus on a sale may have caused some investors to worry that a dissident controlled board might not thoroughly explore all strategic options   the report said ",2018-11-15,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/proxy-advisory-firm-iss-recommends-for-all-third-point-nominees-at-campbell-1689031,1689031
103713,325228,CPB,Kraft Heinz  KHC  Stock Continues To Fall  When Will The Bleeding Stop ,opinion,"Kraft Heinz   NYSE K   shares closed down 0 53  through intraday trading Monday as the stock continues to plummet following the release of its earnings report  The consumer packaged goods company posted its first half results last Thursday and the less than stellar report sent the stock plummeting by as much as 13  
KHC s quarterly filing was delayed amid a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into the company s accounting and procurement practices  The stock has been pummeled in 2019  down 39  year to date  Kraft Heinz s downturn Monday brought it to a new all time low 
First Half Performance 
Kraft Heinz s 2019 struggles led the firm to hire former marketing executive Miguel Patricio as CEO  in an effort to switch its focus from cost cutting to growing brands like Oscar Mayer  Velveeta  and Jell O  Patricio was formerly the chief marketing officer of Anheuser Busch InBev   NYSE BUD   and KHC hopes his brand building skills will be able to revitalize growth 
On Thursday  the new CEO said he was unable to provide financial guidance for investors  citing his limited time as Kraft Heinz s chief executive as the contributing factor  The refusal to provide financial guidance further frustrated shareholders who had gone six months without a quarterly filing  and hoped they would finally gain more insight into the firm s recovery plans  On top of all that  Kraft Heinz cut its dividend in February of this year by 36  
In its preliminary second quarter results  KHC announced that its net income in the first half of 2019 came in at half the prior year period s levels  KHC said it would write down the value of its eastern emerging markets  Brazilian  U S  refrigerated and Latin America exports businesses by about  744 million  The company also recorded a  474 million write down of its Miracle Whip  Velveeta  Lunchables  Maxwell House  Philadelphia  and Cool Whip brands  Plus  KHC hired an investment bank to explore options for a sale of its Maxwell House brand but has received lackluster interest from investors thus far 
KHC reported EPS of  0 78  which beat our estimate by 4   But its reported revenue of  6 41 billion fell short of our estimate by 3 6   Revenue in the first half of 2019 fell 4 84  to  12 37 billion and the company s profits plummeted 51 48  to  852 million  U S  revenue fell 1 9  to  8 71 billion  while Canada dropped 3 6  to  1 01 billion  Additionally  EMEA tumbled 10 2  and the rest of the world revenue sunk 16 8  
Second Half Outlook 
The company s inability to provide financial guidance for the second half of 2019 left investors wondering what the true value of Kraft Heinz s brands are  and just how much more value they might lose  Consensus Estimates project KHC s earnings to drop 20 51  to  0 62 per share and for revenue to tumble 1 94  to  6 25 billion in Q3 
U S  revenue is forecasted to slightly increase from the year ago quarter to  4 46 billion  Meanwhile  Canadian revenue is expected to drop 20 2  to  419 million  while EMEA revenue is set to gain 1 75  to  640 million  Full fiscal year estimates predict further year over year falls for KHC  The company s bottom line is expected to take the brunt of the hit  with earnings projected to fall 22 38  to  2 74 per share  Total revenue is projected to sink 1 59  to  25 84 billion 
Long Term Worries 
Kraft Heinz is currently listed as a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Kraft Heinz s product portfolio is full of processed food brands that are seemingly out of touch with many of today s consumers  Most of the company s sales are tied to the U S  at a time when international growth has become pivotal for many company s success 
The likes of Mondelez   NASDAQ MDLZ   have been able to capitalize in the international market  which in turn has helped the MDLZ stock soar 35 7  YTD  outpacing the broader food market industry  Kraft Heinz struggles with its earnings and revenue growth have made investors steer clear of the stock 
KHC s third quarter and full year outlook doesn t provide many incentives for investors to try to buy the stock at its discounted price  Furthermore  companies like General Mills   NYSE GIS    Campbell   NYSE CPB    and Kellogg   NYSE K   have been able to adapt to the health conscious consumer landscape resulting in them having better returns than KHC thus far in 2019

103716,325231,CPB,Campbell Soup  CPB  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Campbell Soup  CPB  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended July 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on August 30  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This maker of canned soup  Pepperidge Farm cookies and V8 juice is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 41 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  64  
Revenues are expected to be  2 billion  down 9 7  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Campbell 
For Campbell  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Campbell will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Campbell would post earnings of  0 46 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 56  delivering a surprise of  21 74  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Campbell doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-08-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/campbell-soup-cpb-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200458081,200458081

103738,325253,CPB,Archer Daniels  ADM  Q2 Earnings Miss Estimates  Down Y Y,opinion,Archer Daniels Midland Company   NYSE ADM   reported disappointing second quarter 2019 results  wherein earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third straight quarter and also declined year over year  Although sales beat the consensus mark for the second straight time  the metric declined on a year over year basis Quarterly results were hurt by persistent unfavorable winter weather conditions in North America and adverse high water conditions  A weak ethanol industry environment remained an added headwind Q2 DetailsAdjusted earnings of 60 cents per share decreased 41 2  from the year ago quarter and also lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 61 cents  On a reported basis  the company s earnings came in at 42 cents per share  down from  1 earned in the prior year quarter Archer Daniels Midland Company Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Revenues in the quarter under review totaled  16 297 million  which decreased 4 5  year over year but outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  15 628 million  Revenue decline across all the segments of the company  except Nutrition  was the primary reason behind the year over year decline Going by segments  quarterly revenues at the Origination  Oilseeds  Carbohydrate Solutions and Other segments fell 2 4   13 7   7 8  and 3  to  6 481 million   5 747 million   2 441 million and  104 million  respectively  Conversely  at Nutrition  revenues improved 49 7  to  1 524 million Operational DiscussionArcher Daniels reported adjusted segment operating profit of  682 million in second quarter 2019  down 26 2  from the year ago quarter  On a GAAP basis  the company s segment operating profit fell 28 5  year over year to  645 million On a segmental adjusted basis  adjusted operating profit at the Oilseeds segment decreased 14 7  year over year to  291 million owing to soft results at Refining  Packaging  Biodiesel and Other  Also  soft crushing and origination margins in South America due to higher soybean prices and lower China demand negatively impacted the segment s results  Further  crush volumes in North America were down owing to production outages on account of high water at the company s Quincy  IL  facility  This had an adverse impact of roughly  10 million  However  crushing and origination results were somewhat driven by higher crush margins in North America and EMEA  Also  impressive Wilmar results in Asia aided the segment s performance Adjusted operating profit at the Origination segment amounted to  71 million  down 62 8  from the year ago quarter  This downside can be mainly attributed to lower results at Merchandising and Handling  and Transportation results on a year over year basis  Despite effective execution  volumes and margins in North American were hurt by high water conditions on U S  rivers  thus reducing river asset utilization and the competitiveness of crops in export markets  High water conditions hurt the segment by about  40 million in the quarter under review  At the Nutrition segment  adjusted operating profit edged up 2 6  to  117 million owing to impressive performance at Animal Nutrition  This was primarily backed by the Neovia buyout  However  the segment s performance was somewhat negated by soft results at WFSI as WILD Flavors North America s solid sales and the margin were hurt by changes in consumer order patterns in EMEAI and weak sales in APAC  Further  Specialty Ingredients was lower owing to the isolated production deficit  Meanwhile  Health   Wellness was driven by contributions from acquisitions along with organic sales and margin expansion The Carbohydrate Solutions segment s adjusted operating profit plunged 22 3  to  192 million  The downside can mainly be attributed to weak Bioproducts results due to negative ethanol industry margins  Also  the persistent unfavorable weather hurt the segment s results by nearly  15 million  Starches and Sweeteners were also down  Moreover  margin contractions on account of low sugar prices and the Turkish quota on starch based sweeteners affected the segment s results in EMEA  Nevertheless  North American sales and margins remained sturdy but were offset by high water impacts at the Columbus  NE  facility FinancialsArcher Daniels ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of  849 million  long term debt including current maturities of  7 713 million and shareholders  equity of  18 979 million During the first six months of 2019  the company generated negative cash flows of  2 713 million from operating activities  Further  the company s average trailing four quarter adjusted ROIC came in at 6 9  Additionally  the company paid dividends of  395 million in the first six months of 2019 Other DevelopmentsIn second quarter 2019  Archer Daniels took various measures to offset the impacts of adverse weather conditions in the first six months of the year  These measures are merging its Origination and Oilseeds segments into a single business   Ag Services   Oilseeds  Notably  Ag Services   Oilseeds will report as a new segment effective third quarter 2019 Moreover  the company has completed important organizational changes including early retirement offers for colleagues in the United States and Canada  The strategic measures also include standardizing business activities and achieving synergies from recent buyouts Despite soft quarterly results  management remains optimistic about delivering a stronger second half of 2019 driven by

103739,325254,CPB,Beyond Meat Has A Good Problem  Too Bad Investors Don t Like It,opinion,"Beyond Meat   NASDAQ BYND   shares took a beating this week as the alternative protein supplier made the most of its soaring valuation to raise some more capital 

 
The dilution to existing shareholders notwithstanding  this was a really good move to raise a neat  40 million by issuing just 250 000 additional shares  The IPO price of  25 a share fetched just  240 million 
Some early investors also took profits  which is one of the concerns people seem to have because usually  insider sales are a red flag that means the company isn t headed in the right direction 
But honestly  there doesn t appear to be reason for fear  not on this count anyway  Because first  they are offloading just a teensy bit of their holdings  totaling 3 million shares  and second  the company is putting up towering growth numbers that really makes it look like they underpriced the shares at the IPO  The insiders were released from their legally required six month long lock in period  which must count for something 
And as far as growth is concerned  which number would you rather pick 
Revenue growth in the just reported quarter was 67 3  and 287 2  from the previous and year ago quarters  respectively  Take your pick 
The Fresh platform  by far its larger segment  grew 74 5  sequentially and 347 9  from last year 
The emerging Frozen platform grew 25 0  sequentially and 25 1  year over year 
Retail  50 7  of sales  was up 74 3  sequentially and 192 0  year over year 
Restaurant   Foodservice  49 3   was up 60 6  and 483 0   from the two periods  respectively 
It s hard to find a weak spot  but one does wonder why the company needs to offer such a hefty discount  which grew 96 3  sequentially and 170 6  year over year  more on this in a minute   The company still managed to expand its gross margin  which went from 15 0  a year ago to 33 8  in the last quarter 
Moreover  positive EBITDA  earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortization  is not just in sight  it s a reality today  So in the last quarter  adjusted EBITDA came in at  6 9 million compared to   5 6 million last year 
We can t even complain about the net loss  which at 24 cents a share  shrank from  1 22 last year  The pro forma profit of a penny was better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of an 8 cent loss 
The company even raised its full year guidance 
To sustain such high growth rates  it s only natural that the company would need to invest in capacity  And this is actually value creation  because if numbers are to get anywhere close to justifying the sky high valuation  the company has got to keep the growth rates up  And there are opportunities both in the domestic market and internationally  because soy free  gluten free  plant based  responsibly sourced processed stuff is just so much in demand  The company just can t seem to sell enough  which is a good problem to have 
We should of course consider competition  which will no doubt intensify somewhere down the line  from both existing fresh frozen processed meat producers and vegan suppliers like Beyond Meat  This will pressure supplier sources for inputs  it recently expanded suppliers  which is another positive  on the one hand and prices on the other 
For many  the vegan burger is a novelty and they ll just go back to what they were eating earlier  or it ll be more like a once in a while sort of thing  So the  1 4 trillion meat market  which is what alternative meats are looking to eat into  is also part of the competition 
Producing plant meat is more expensive than traditional meats  which is likely the main reason for the heavy discount on its products  But that day may not be far away when the benefits of scale reduce eliminate the difference 
While the gross margin expansion looks attractive now  it s an obvious indication of improving utilization  So when the company adds capacity sometime next year  those numbers aren t going to look as good  But it wouldn t be something to panic over either 
Conclusion
For a company with the kind of solid fundamentals that Beyond Meat is displaying and more importantly  the kind of growth it is seeing  there shouldn t be so much concern  In fact  we should probably not look at the numbers from a quarter to quarter perspective  other than to see that it remains on track directionally 
The volatility in share prices is because of the high valuation with many investors expecting the shares to tank  this is a heavily shorted stock   The new shares will increase the float  there could even be more volatility with prices receding to a more realistic level  where it could be worth a buy  So it s all good 
Recommendations
Since we can t recommend BYND at the current valuation and therefore have a Hold rating  Zacks Rank  3  on it  there are other buy ranked stocks in the space such as BRF S A    NYSE BRFS    Campbell Soup Company   NYSE CPB    Freshpet   NASDAQ FRPT    General Mills   NYSE GIS   and others  If you d like a more varied exposure  head over to the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

103752,325267,CPB,Should Value Investors Consider Campbell Soup  CPB  Stock ,opinion,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Campbell Soup Company   NYSE CPB   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Campbell Soup has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 17 58  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 18 55  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Campbell Soup s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  Further  the stock s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Consumer Staples sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 22 48  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers   We should also point out that Campbell Soup has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 15 97  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Campbell Soup stock in the near term too   P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings  Right now  Campbell Soup has a P S ratio of about 1 25  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 35 right now   Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years   If anything  CPB is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms  Broad Value Outlook In aggregate  Campbell Soup currently has a Zacks Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Campbell Soup a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the its P CF ratio comes in at 9 37  which is lower than the industry average of 12 57  Clearly  CPB is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall   Though Campbell Soup might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of B and a Momentum Score of B  This gives CPB a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores   Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current year has seen six estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to no movement in the opposite direction  while the full year 2020 estimate has seen three upward revision compared to no downward in the same time period     This has had a positive impact on the consensus estimate though as the current year consensus estimate has inched up by 2 8  in the past two months  while the full year 2020 estimate has risen by 2 4   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Campbell Soup Company Price and Consensus
 

   This bullish trend is why the stock boasts a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and why we are expecting outperformance from the company in the near term Bottom Line  Campbell Soup is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible line up of statistics on this front  A Zacks Rank  2 further instils our confidence However  a sluggish industry rank  among bottom 40  of more than 250 industries  makes it hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the Zacks Food   Miscellaneous industry has clearly underperformed the market at large  as you can see below  So  value investors might want to wait for industry trends to turn favorable in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Today s Best Stocks from Zacks Would you like to see the updated picks from our best market beating strategies  From 2017 through 2018  while the S P 500 gained  15 8   five of our screens returned  38 0    61 3    61 6    68 1   and  98 3  This outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon  From 2000   2018  while the S P averaged  4 8  per year  our top strategies averaged up to  56 2  per year ",2019-07-03,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/should-value-investors-consider-campbell-soup-cpb-stock-200437046,200437046

category dropped 1 2  through February on a quarter to date basis Additionally  soft volumes and escalated costs dented Dean Foods  adjusted gross profit and the bottom line  The company has posted year over year decline in the bottom line for four straight quarters  In the first quarter of 2019  adjusted loss from continuing operations amounted to 41 cents per share  wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 22 cents  The bottom line also compares unfavorably with the year ago quarter s earnings of 14 cents  Management expects Class I raw milk costs to witness an inflation of nearly 12  in the second quarter  Moreover  it anticipates dairy commodity inflation to persist throughout 2019 Can Efforts Aid a Turnaround Dean Foods is focused on reducing unnecessary costs and improving efficiency throughout the organization  It is particularly paying attention to improve waste management and operating efficiency  Under the OPEX 2020 cost productivity plan introduced in 2017  the company had targeted annual productivity of  80  100 million  These savings are likely to provide some cushion against input inflation and volume deleverage throughout its operational phase Dean Foods is also on track with its enterprise wide cost productivity program  This productivity program mainly revolves around three major areas  including enhancement of its supply chain network  optimizing spending across all key categories to ensure greater efficiency and integration of operating model along with minimizing general and administrative expenses Notably  the cost productivity program is likely to deliver an incremental annual run rate savings of  150 million by 2020  The company is taking several pricing actions to overcome cost hurdles  These initiatives should help Dean Foods offset some negative impacts from volume declines and higher non dairy input costs Apart from these  the company is taking steps to focus on core business activities and diversify portfolio by moving beyond pure milk products  To this end  Dean Foods is focused on strengthening its DairyPure and TruMoo brands through innovation and improved marketing  The buyout of Friendly s Ice Cream manufacturing and retail operations is also delivering results  Further  deals with Good Karma and Organic Valley Fresh milk brand  and the acquisition of Uncle Matt s Organic juices are helping Dean Foods expand in the organic space We believe the aforementioned tailwinds have the potential to bring this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock back on the growth trajectory in the future Stocks to

103806,325321,CPB,Campbell to sell fresh  international units  complete sale an option,news,"By Harry Brumpton and Svea Herbst Bayliss NEW YORK BOSTON  Reuters     Campbell Soup  Co  N CPB  said on Thursday it plans to sell its international and fresh refrigerated foods units and left open the possibility of putting the whole company up for sale  following a months long review and pressure from a hedge fund to sell itself outright  It is not clear if the plan will appease activist investor Dan Loeb  whose Third Point LLC announced a 5 65 percent stake on Aug  9 and immediately pressed for a sale of the entire company to a competitor as  the only justifiable outcome   If dissatisfied  Loeb could escalate his attack into a proxy fight and nominate a slate of directors within the next few weeks to be voted on at Campbell s annual meeting later this year  sources familiar with the matter told Reuters this week  Third Point declined comment on Thursday   Campbell s Interim Chief Executive Keith McLoughlin said the board considered the option of a complete sale during its review and ended the process  with a completely open mind    Selling the two smaller units could make Campbell a more attractive takeover target by turning its focus back to its core soup and salty snacks businesses   The board concluded that this current plan right now is the best one to maximize value   McLoughlin told Reuters in an interview on Thursday   Having said that  the board remains open to alternatives that could create more value for the shareholder   Billionaire investor Warren Buffett told CNBC his  Berkshire Hathaway Inc   N BRKa  would not buy the company and said it is  very hard to offer a significant premium for a packaged goods company    On a conference call with analysts McLoughlin sidestepped questions about investor pressure for a sale and declined to comment on whether any activists  such as Loeb s Third Point  would be given board seats  Shares of Campbell  which has a market value of about  12 billion  fell 2 6 percent to  38 95 shortly after midday  Alongside the results of its review  Campbell also forecast earnings per share for fiscal 2019 below Wall Street s average estimate  as its costs continue to rise  NEW STRATEGY  The 149 year old company which revolutionized the home cooking industry with easy to prepare soups and low cost production techniques has been struggling to attract young consumers to its namesake soups and Pepperidge Farm cookies  Campbell s latest foray into fresh food has faltered while Wall Street has questioned an acquisition strategy that increased debt while costs are increasing  Its shares have fallen by a third over the past two years  The company said on Thursday it would use the proceeds of the unit sales to reduce its debt and also increased its cost savings target by  150 million to  945 million by the end of fiscal 2022   Retreating from the international and fresh food businesses marks a reverse from the strategy of former Chief Executive Denise Morrison  who wanted Campbell to have a wide ranging portfolio with a focus on health and well being  Morrison stepped down abruptly in May after a string of poor results  On the same day  the company announced its sweeping review and named McLoughlin as interim CEO   Simply put  we lost focus   said McLoughlin on Thursday   We aggressively pursued the important consumer mega trend of health and well being without having clarity on our source of uniqueness     and we depended too much on M A  to shape our business strategy   he said  Campbell is still looking for a new permanent CEO  McLoughlin said on Thursday he was not a candidate to take the job  The company also said it was rescheduling its annual investor day from October to spring next year  OUT WITH OVERSEAS  FRESH  The two businesses put up for sale currently bring in about  2 1 billion in annual sales  about a quarter of Campbell s overall revenue  Campbell International includes Australian biscuits brand Arnott s and the Kelsen Group  along with the company s manufacturing operations in Indonesia and Malaysia and its businesses in Hong Kong and Japan   Campbell Fresh includes Bolthouse Farms  Garden Fresh Gourmet and the company s refrigerated soup business  The company has hired  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc  N GS  and Centerview Partners to sell the units   Under Morrison  Campbell arranged its products into three parts in 2015  setting up the new Campbell Fresh business  The unit was meant to tap into consumers  booming appetite for healthier foods but the business struggled  resulting in a two year decline in organic sales  FAMILY BUSINESS  Historically  the company has resisted big changes  being effectively controlled by the heirs of John Dorrance  the chemist who invented condensed soup and went on to run the company a century ago  Dorrance s grandchildren Mary Alice Malone  who raises horses in Pennsylvania  and her brother Bennett Dorrance  a real estate developer in Arizona  between them control 33 percent of Campbell s shares  They have fended off periodic calls over three decades for the company to sell itself   In the past  the family has been able to rely on supportive  long term shareholders  But in the past few months   most notably in the second quarter of 2018  when the company announced its review   a number of hedge fund investors have bought positions and are looking for more sweeping measures  including a sale   For fiscal 2019  Campbell forecast earnings per share of between  2 45 and  2 53 for fiscal 2019  not including the effect of the planned unit sales  below Wall Street s average estimate of  2 69  according to Thomson Reuters I B E S

103844,325359,CPB,PJT Partners to buy CamberView as activism defense heats up,news,"By Svea Herbst Bayliss
BOSTON  Reuters    Advisory firm CamberView Partners agreed to sell itself to boutique investment bank  PJT Partners Inc   N PJT  on Tuesday in a deal that comes as public companies seek help defending against activist investors demanding corporate changes 
PJT Partners  founded by former  Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS  veteran investment banker Paul J  Taubman  said it will pay  165 million to acquire the six year old advisory firm run by Abe Friedman  Of that amount  PJT will pay  100 million in the form of Class A common stock and partnership units and  65 million in cash 
The deal is expected to close early in the fourth quarter and PJT  which employs more than 500 people  plans to keep all of CamberView s 40 professionals  the companies said  Corsair Capital  CamberView s biggest investor  will become a shareholder in PJT Partners 
 CamberView s deep experience and expertise in shareholder and governance matters significantly expands our ability to serve clients   Taubman said in a statement 
PJT advises companies on mergers and acquisitions as well as restructuring and capital raising  With the merger it is positioning itself to offer activism defense banking services and advice to companies  a niche market currently dominated by Morgan Stanley  Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS   Evercore and Lazard 
The two are joining forces at a time when more corporations are being pressured by investors to perform better and want help to defend against so called activist investors  who often demand changes ranging from sale processes to share buybacks 
During the first half of 2018 a record 145 new campaigns were launched targeting 136 companies and activist investors won 119 board seats  marking a 75 percent increase from the year before  according to  Lazard Ltd   N LAZ  data 
Some of the year s most prominent activist campaigns include Elliott s agitating at Nielsen Holdings PLC  N NLSN   Jana Partners s planning to seek board seats at Pinnacle Foods Inc  N PF  before it sold itself to Conagra Brands Inc  N CAG  and Third Point s call for soup maker  Campbell Soup  Co  N CPB  to sell itself 
Taubman  one of Wall Street s top deal makers  left Morgan Stanley six years ago and took his company public in 2015  This year  PJT s share price has jumped roughly 30 percent 
This is not the first time PJT has pursued acquisitions  In 2014  Taubman agreed to merge his investment banking advisory firm with the advisory businesses of private equity firm Blackstone Group LP  N BX

103845,325360,CPB,Proxy fight looms as new investors ramp up pressure on Campbell Soup,news,"By Svea Herbst Bayliss and Richa Naidu BOSTON CHICAGO  Reuters    The family that controls  Campbell Soup  Co  N CPB  looks to be on a collision course this week with new hedge fund investors pushing for the company to sell itself  heralding a potential proxy fight industry analysts have labeled the  fight of the fall   The soup and snack company is set to report the results of a strategic review on Thursday  but has shown no sign that it will put itself on the block  as recommended by activist investor Daniel Loeb s Third Point LLC earlier this month   If no sale process is planned  Loeb could escalate his attack and nominate a slate of directors within the next few weeks to be voted on at Campbell s annual meeting later this year  according to sources familiar with the matter  Loeb and Campbell Soup  which has a market value of about  12 billion  declined comment  GRAPHIC   New investors make bets on Campbell in second quarter   The Camden  New Jersey based company has been struggling with falling profit as younger consumers drift away from Campbell s namesake soups and Pepperidge Farm cookies  Its share price is down by a third over the past two years   Wall Street has questioned the success of its acquisitions of juice and smoothie maker Bolthouse Farms and salty snack maker Snyder s Lance  Chief Executive Denise Morrison  who headed Campbell for seven years  left as the company announced poor quarterly results on May 18   On that day  the company said it would conduct a review of all its business plans and portfolio of brands to find ways to improve its financial performance    Everything is on the table  There are no sacred cows   Interim CEO Keith McLoughlin told investors at the time  The result of the review will be announced on Thursday   Historically  the company has resisted bigger changes  being effectively controlled by the heirs of John Dorrance  the chemist who invented condensed soup and went on to run the company a century ago  Dorrance s grandchildren Mary Alice Malone  who raises horses in Pennsylvania  and her brother Bennett Dorrance  a real estate developer in Arizona  have fended off periodic calls over three decades for the company to sell itself  and have shown no sign of changing their minds this year   Malone and Dorrance  who between them control 33 percent of Campbell s shares  could not be reached for comment   Archbold van Beuren  John Dorrance s great grandson who is Campbell s third biggest holder with 8 6 percent of its shares  also could not be reached for comment   In the past  the family has been able to rely on supportive  long term shareholders  But in the past few months   most notably in the second quarter of 2018  when the company announced its wide ranging review   a number of hedge fund investors have bought positions and are looking for more sweeping measures  including a sale   Everyone s dream is for the company to give up looking for a permanent CEO and put the company up for sale   said one investor not permitted to speak publicly  If that does not happen  the investor said the best course would be for the company to sell Bolthouse Farms  name a new CEO  and talk with Loeb  about putting two or three new people on the board   NEW HEDGE FUND HOLDERS  Steven Schonfeld s Schonfeld Group Holdings and Jamie Zimmerman s Litespeed Management made big new purchases of Campbell Soup shares during the second quarter  filings show  Och Ziff  now known as OZ Management  and Hudson Bay Capital Management also bought shares  The hedge funds declined to comment   There has clearly been a lot of crowding into Campbell stock by event driven investors  seeking to make money off share price moves around corporate events like a sale  said Simnan Abbas  a managing director at investment data firm Symmetric io  That crowding  does not happen all the time and has changed the makeup of the shareholder base pretty significantly   Campbell s new hedge fund investors are likely allies for Loeb  who in August joined forces with another of Dorrance s grandchildren  George Strawbridge Jr   in calling for a sale   Loeb s  18 billion fund is now Campbell s fifth largest investor  It and Strawbridge between them hold 8 4 percent of Campbell s shares  Despite the increased pressure for change  Campbell s board shows little sign of shifting course dramatically  It recently turned away at least one company that approached it about buying parts of its portfolio  a person familiar with the matter said  It has  however  weighed selling off brands including its Arnott s Australian cookie business  another person familiar with the matter said  As hedge fund investors move in  longstanding shareholders such as trust company Bessemer Trust and mutual fund company Fidelity Investments have pared back their holdings  according to filings  Neither company would say why they cut their stakes   That means Malone and Dorrance could face more demanding and outspoken investors at this year s annual meeting  if not an outright proxy fight   This company has really slowed down since 2016 and I don t see a major way for them to innovate quickly   said investor David Dreman whose Dreman Value Management bought shares several years ago   How can a company with a diversified product line in a low growth industry turn itself around quickly

103846,325361,CPB,Day Ahead  Top 3 Things to Watch,news,"Investing com   Here s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow 
1  Fed Gets Its Favorite Number
The Federal Reserve s favorite measure of inflation will likely be the most anticipated economic number out before the bell tomorrow at 8 30 AM ET  12 30 GMT  
Personal consumption and expenditures  excluding food and energy  or the core PCE price index  is expected to have risen by 0 2  in July  compared with a 0 1  rise in June  Year on year  economists forecast a 2  rise 
The core PCE price index is widely regarded as the Fed s preferred inflation gauge  If it comes in hotter than expected  it could raise expectations for an interest rate hike in December 
Traders are already pricing in a 100  chance of a rate rise in September  The core PCE price index is released as part of the personal income and spending numbers  Both are expected to have risen in July  month on month 
Weekly initial jobless claims numbers come at the same time  with economists predicting a small rise from the previous week 
2   Campbell Soup  Starting the Fight of the Fall 
Campbell Soup Company  NYSE CPB  reports earnings tomorrow  but more importantly it will also report on the results of its strategic review 
Activist investor Third Point  run by Daniel Loeb  wants the company to put itself up for sale  But that s not what the company plans to announce  according to a report in the New York Post 
That could set the stage for a proxy battle for the fate of the company that analysts are calling the  fight of the fall   according to Reuters 
Shares sank yesterday after the Post report  but finished today higher 
For those investors keeping score at home  the company is expected to earn 24 cents per share for the most recent quarter  on sales of  2 25 billion 
3  Dollar Stores Release Results
Elsewhere on the earnings calendar are more numbers from the retail sector 
Rival discount stores Dollar Tree  NASDAQ DLTR  and Dollar General  NYSE DG  both weigh in before the bell 
Those numbers will give investors an idea of how the low cost retail segment is performing in an economy running at a 4 2  pace of growth with very high levels of consumer confidence 
Analysts expect Dollar Tree to post a profit of  1 16 per share on sales of about  5 5 billion  The company has missed earnings estimates the last two quarters  Dollar General is forecast to post a profit of  1 49 per share on sales of about  6 4 billion 
Over the last three months  Dollar General shares have been the clear winner  rising about 11   Shares of Dollar Tree are down slightly over the same time period

103866,325381,CPB,Beyond Meat Gets Beefier As Competition Heats Up,opinion,"Beyond Meat   NASDAQ BYND   stock faltered this week as Tyson   NYSE TSN    the established meat producer  jumped into the space with meatless chicken nuggets and blended  with beef  pea protein and other ingredients  patties and sausages  It s also claiming that the burgers are healthier because they contain fewer calories and saturated fat 
Tyson must be regretting the fact that it dumped its 6 5  stake just before the company s IPO because the stock has appreciated beyond anyone s wildest imaginations  Tyson must have sold its stake because it believes its products will be more appealing to consumers  which it can be for some   but the meatless meat market is obviously much bigger than anticipated 
Tyson is targeting the segment of consumers that wants to lower meat consumption but not do away with it entirely  It can have a product line or two to see how this market performs and even make losses for a while  given its size and reach  Since this is the primary market that Beyond Meat is targeting as well  there is some reason for concern  Especially since the blended category might be more effective at making inroads into the meat eating segment  taste will determine this  
But Beyond s focus on creating the most nutritious and attractive product will reap dividends  For example  the company s saturated fats come from coconuts and cocoa butter  both very healthy options  It has also tweaked the patty formula to include moong beans and rice  so it offers all nine essential amino acids for a more complete protein  An apple extract addition will facilitate browning on the grill  This new version is likely to hit shelves in weeks  in time for the cook out season 
It s also a fact that large meat producers looking at this market actually validates it  Other than Tyson  Cargill has an investment in meatless producer Memphis Meats and Yum Brands    NYSE YUM   KFC is selling a meatless chicken product in the UK  What s more  none of this is a surprise  The increased interest in the space and the entry of new players merely goes to show that the market is in expansion mode 
While no one expects the meat market to go away  or even shrink materially any time in the near future  this expansion will continue as peoples  tastes and preferences continue to evolve   
Peoples  reasons for choosing meat alternatives aren t the same  While some are concerned for the environment  others are concerned about animal welfare  some are concerned about health and for others it s a combination of factors  So it s impossible to guess what this market might ultimately look like  But Beyond s total addressable market is slightly larger because it also includes the 5  share that goes to vegans vegetarians  although some in this group would consider  meat like  as revolting  
At any rate  all analysts are upbeat about the company and the segment although none have a buy rating on it  That s because of the valuation that just doesn t reflect the still low revenues  the 215  growth in the last quarter comes off a very small base  and lack of profitability at the company 
So while Beyond expects to achieve EBITDA breakeven this year  Read more     and it will likely continue to see very substantial revenue increases in the domestic market and abroad  at least double digits over the next 5 years  in line with the market   it s still hardly comparable with the leading meat producers 
Beyond Meat has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Zacks  2  Buy  ranked Campbell Soup Company   NYSE CPB    Celsius Holdings   NASDAQ CELH   and Flowers Foods   NYSE FLO   are therefore better buys at the moment You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

Wrapping UpApart from alternative protein space  Tyson Foods is steadily expanding in the freshly prepared foods offerings arena  owing to consumers rising demand for natural fresh meat offerings without any added hormones or antibiotics  In this respect  the buyout of Tecumseh is quite noteworthy In addition to these  Tyson Foods strives to expand its traditional meat offerings  Moreover  the Chicken unit is doing exceptionally well  driven by prudent acquisitions  The company is also progressing with the Financial Fitness Program  which is aimed at boosting efficiency and fuel investments for growth Undoubtedly  the company s efforts to build a solid meat products portfolio are likely to continue yielding and help it remain a solid pick for investors  Well  shares of this Zacks Rank  2  Buy  company have rallied 26 5  in the past three months compared with the  s rise of 13 6  Interested in Consumer Staples Stocks  Check TheseCampbell Soup   NYSE CPB   has a long term EPS growth rate of 6  and currently holds a Zacks Rank  2  You can see General Mills   NYSE GIS    also with a Zacks Rank  2  has long term EPS growth rate of 7  Will you retire a millionaire One out of every six people retires a multimillionaire  Get smart tips you can do today to become one of them in a new Special Report   7 Things You Can Do Now to Retire a Multimillionaire  ",2019-06-14,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/tyson-foods-tsn-launches-new-plantbased-protein-products-200431806,200431806

103904,325419,CPB,Campbell Soup  CPB  Beats Q3 Earnings Estimates,opinion,"Campbell Soup  CPB  came out with quarterly earnings of  0 56 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 46 per share  This compares to earnings of  0 70 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 21 74   A quarter ago  it was expected that this maker of canned soup  Pepperidge Farm cookies and V8 juice would post earnings of  0 70 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 77  delivering a surprise of 10  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times 
Campbell  which belongs to the Zacks Food   Miscellaneous industry  posted revenues of  2 18 billion for the quarter ended April 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 7 35   This compares to year ago revenues of  2 13 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Campbell shares have added about 15 5  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 11 8  
What s Next for Campbell 
While Campbell has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Campbell was unfavorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  0 45 on  2 19 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  2 48 on  9 95 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year

103907,325422,CPB,Investors Ignore Analyst Warnings  Pile Into BYND Stock,opinion,"Beyond Meat   NASDAQ BYND   delivered encouraging results beating expectations by a sliver on the top line while meeting on the bottom line 
Analysts at Jefferies  Credit Suisse  SIX CSGN   Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  and JPMorgan  NYSE JPM  raised their estimates and price targets  all of which are still below the company s current price   and continued to issue warnings about an imminent slump when reality strikes 
But investors couldn t care less  The novelty of a new product  the anticipated disruption of a  1 4 trillion market  the strong revenue growth of 215   yes    existing operating leverage and management assurance that 2019 adjusted EBITDA will approach breakeven were all too much to handle at one shot 

Management also mentioned that foodservice was doing stronger than retail  having grown 6X over the prior year  Apparently  restaurants serving the burger patty are seeing increasing footfall  So naturally they must be stepping up orders and arousing interest at even more restaurants 
And what about the rumors that McDonald s   NYSE MCD   was in talks with the company  Of course management let out that any such future partnerships weren t included in the guidance  So yummy  that means scope for upside 
It s another matter that analysts are factoring in higher sales than the guidance since management called it  conservative   Will it or wont it beat those revised expectations  With  40 million on the wall  BYND needs another  170 million in the remaining quarters to make the guided revenue of  210 million for the year 
Quarter two will be stronger  says management  with quarter three even stronger  Current expectations are for a drop off thereafter  Since repeat customers are 40 50   management must be expecting to get the things before many new people  There s definitely a deal or two in the works that will fructify real soon and Europe will compound that 
So the bet is that new deals announced mid quarter will keep share prices buoyant in the next couple of quarters  In quarter four  the company will likely be working on growing sales at existing partners and reaching breakeven  If it falls very far short  there could be a pullback  But if it s in the ballpark  maybe share prices will stabilize  That seems to be where we re headed   
Management also outlined three growth drivers for the slightly longer term  the first being taste and sensory  the second  nutrition and the third  price  Taking beef as the measuring yardstick  it has made some progress on the first two and will work toward the third  So over a 5 year period  the target is to deliver tastier  more nutritious patties at lower prices than beef  Other meats may follow  we don t know  So look for dollar increases in R D and SG A through 2020 and 2021 at least 
The company s longer term targets are gross margins in the mid 30  range  EBITDA revenue in the mid teens percentage range  in line with other best in class consumer packaged goods companies   
There has been some talk about competition  because suddenly there seems to be a large number of offerings at new and existing meat suppliers  Management claims that Beyond is the best  So we ll just have to wait and see

103928,325443,CPB,Can AB InBev  BUD  Return To Earnings Beat Trend Amid Woes ,opinion,"Anheuser Busch InBev SA NV   NYSE BUD    also known as AB InBev  is slated to release first quarter 2019 results on May 7  In the last reported quarter  it delivered negative earnings surprise of 30 4  Moreover  the company reported earnings miss in 10 out of the last 12 quarters   It recorded average negative surprise of 9 5  in the trailing four quarters  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter is pegged at  1 50  reflecting year over year growth of 105 5   Moreover  estimates remained unchanged in the last seven days The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues of  12 550 million reflects a decline of 4  year over year  While the company has been witnessing improving trends in key markets and continued premiumization in most of its markets  higher marketing expenses and soft beer sales in the United States remain deterrents to top and bottom line growth Anheuser Busch InBev SA NV Price and EPS Surprise
    How Things Are Shaping Up for This AnnouncementAB InBev  like most of its peers  is suffering from the industry wide decline in beer sales as it holds the top spot in the beer industry  controlling about one third of the global beer market  The primary reason for soft beer sales in the United States has been the shift of consumers to healthier drinking options  which resulted in consumers gravitating to wine and drinks like sparkling water  This shift has caused lower volumes at its flagship Budweiser and Bud Light brands  which continue to lose market share  In 2018  Budweiser and Bud Light lost 35 basis points  bps  and 80 bps of the total market share  respectively  We expect the persistence of softness in beer sales to impact top and bottom line performance in the first quarter of 2019 Furthermore  higher cost of sales due to increased commodity prices also remain a threat to the bottom line in the upcoming quarterly release  The company projects cost of sales per hl to increase in a mid single digit in 2019  with currency and commodity headwinds to be offset by cost management initiatives It is also witnessing increases in cost base  mainly owing to aluminum globally  and freight costs in the United States  which should affect results Nonetheless  the company s three global brands like Budweiser  Corona and Stella Artois are poised to display growth again in the first quarter  backed by improving trends in key markets and continued premiumization in the majority of its markets While AB InBev sees volatility in certain key markets  it anticipates delivering strong top line and EBITDA growth for 2019  with the help of solid brand performance and robust commercial plans  Driven by increased focus on category development  it expects to deliver balanced top line growth between volume and revenue per hl   Net revenue per hl growth is likely to exceed inflation while costs  sum of cost of sales and SG A  are expected to come below inflation  Premiumization and revenue management initiatives are likely to aid revenue per hl growth Though the stock has surged 4 7  in the past month  it underperformed the  s growth of 5 8   This reflects a negative sentiment on the stock ahead of earnings

103945,325460,CPB,Trump steel tariffs may leave these U S  steelworkers jobless,news,"By Nick Carey FARRELL  Penn   Reuters    Mick Lang has been a steelworker for nearly 40 years and voted for businessman Donald Trump in the hopes he would bring about a renaissance for the long suffering U S  steel industry  Now he worries President Trump s tariffs on imports of the metal will cost him his job   This is not what I voted for  I voted for Trump because I thought he d straighten things out  not do something like this   said Lang  59  a third generation steelworker  whose son also works at the same steel mill in Farrell in western Pennsylvania s Mercer County  The county voted for then Republican candidate Trump by more than 24 points in the 2016 U S  presidential election  Some Republican strategists said Trump s tariffs appeared partly to be timed to sway voters in Pennsylvania steel country  where a special election is being held for a U S  House of Representatives seat next Tuesday   Trump is scheduled to visit Moon Township about 60 miles southwest of Farrell on Saturday to support the Republican candidate and he is expected to be warmly received in an area he also won handily in 2016  U S  steel companies such as U S  Steel Corp  N X  and AK Steel Holding Corp  N AKS    seen as winners thanks to the president s actions   have lauded Trump s tariff on imported steel   U S  Steel said it would restart one of two idled blast furnaces at an Illinois steel plant  creating up to 500 jobs  America is the world s largest steel importer  buying about 35 million tons in 2017  GRAPHIC   But Lang is one of around 780 workers at the Novolipetsk Steel PAO  NLMK   MM NLMK  mill  NLMK s U S  subsidiary which imports around 2 million tons of steel slabs annually from its Russian parent company  The slabs that the mill rolls into sheets for customers including  Caterpillar  Inc  N CAT   Deere   Co  N DE  Harley Davidson Inc  N HOG  and  Home Depot  Inc  N HD   are almost impossible to acquire from U S  steel producers  Bob Miller  Chief Executive Officer of NLMK s U S  unit  said if his company s customers refuse to accept a 25 percent price hike as a result of the tariffs  nearly 1 200 workers could eventually lose their jobs   and the ones in Farrell would be the first to go when supplies of imported slabs run out  The U S  steel industry employed about 147 000 people in 2015  according to the Commerce Department s Bureau of Economic analysis  Manufacturers that need steel employ about 6 5 million people each year and the construction industry 6 3 million  GRAPHIC   IRONY Miller said tariffs will also force NLMK to shelve planned  600 million investments in plants in Pennsylvania and Indiana  around  400 million of which was earmarked for upgrading antiquated equipment at its Farrell plant   Trump has stood by the tariffs  despite resistance from his fellow Republicans and other countries  which have vowed to respond with levies of their own  On Thursday  Trump pressed ahead with the imposition of 25 percent tariffs on steel imports and 10 percent for aluminum  Some steel executives such as Miller say this is the ultimate irony  by acting ostensibly to protect U S  steel jobs with sweeping tariffs  Trump will also kill off some steel jobs   The workers here in Farrell are on the front line   Miller said   This policy is picking winners and losers and unfortunately  we are the losers   The tariffs are good for steel producers that melt and produce their own steel  But for those like NLMK  which is reliant on imported raw materials  they could prove catastrophic  The mill is the largest employer in Farrell and accounts for more than one fifth of the town s tax base  Mercer County has a poverty rate that is nearly double the national average  The area was America s steel heartland  with mills dotting the landscape until the industry s decline began in the 1970s because of an increase in global competition  The mill owned by NLMK has existed since the beginning of the 20th century  but experienced two lengthy shutdowns and mass layoffs in the 1990s  Its blast furnace was sold for scrap and instead of producing steel  its current crop of workers heat 25 ton imported steel slabs to a glowing orange temperature of 2 400 degrees fahrenheit  1 316 Celsius  before rolling them down in some cases to as thick as a few sheets of paper  Amid blasts of steam  intense heat  dirt and noise  the mill s 600 union represented workers earn up to  27 per hour  a solid middle class wage  Terry Day  local president for the United Steelworkers union  said the 1990s shutdowns convulsed the community and resulted in a spate of suicides and divorces   This time it will be much worse   said Day  53  who experienced both shutdowns   Back then there were other jobs to go to  but now there s nothing else here     It would be devastating   Steel customers ranging from automakers General Motors Co  N GM    which makes its Cruze sedan in Lordstown  Ohio  around 20 miles west of Farrell   and  Ford Motor Co   N F  to soup maker  Campbell Soup  Co  N CPB  and brewer  Molson Coors  Brewing Co  N TAP  are expected to lose  as tariffs will allow domestic steel producers to raise prices  But likely job losses within the steel industry run counter to Trump s professed aims of bringing back manufacturing jobs    There is a substantial number of people in the steel industry that could lose their jobs as a result of tariffs   said metal analyst Charles Bradford of Bradford Research  Farrell can ill afford to lose its NLMK steel jobs  The town s population of under 5 000 is less than a third of what it was in 1920  As of June 2017  there were around 11 000 steel jobs in Pennsylvania  2 percent of the state s 546 000 manufacturing jobs  Mercer County had 5 5 percent unemployment in December   above the state rate of 4 8 percent and the national rate of 4 1 percent   The Farrell mill was originally owned by a U S  firm that went bankrupt in 1992 and was subsequently owned by British and Swiss companies before the Russians bought in back in 2006  Since then  NLMK has invested around  1 billion in its U S  operations  U S  CEO Miller said  Miller is working to lobby the Trump administration to follow the precedent of former Republican President George W  Bush s administration  which allowed quotas for slab steel in 2002 rather than applying tariffs as it did for products that were domestically produced  Those quotas allowed the Farrell plant to keep operating and Miller hopes the Trump administration will follow suit  
The mood in Farrell is grim and fearful  Truckers coming to pick up coils of rolled steel ask when the mill will go out of business and plant manager Bill Benson says workers keep asking him   What on earth is Trump thinking  ",2018-03-09,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/trump-steel-tariffs-may-leave-these-us-steelworkers-jobless-1335052,1335052

103955,325470,CPB,How Trump s steel tariffs kick the can business,news,"By Nick Carey WOODLAND  Calif   Reuters    Dan Vincent is in a bind   The president of Pacific Coast Producers  PCP  plans to use around 700 million tin coated steel cans this year for tomatoes  peaches and pears from 168 growers here in California   His cooperative then sells the canned fruits and vegetables to grocers ranging from Walmart Inc  N WMT  to Kroger Co  N K   as well as food services companies such as  Sysco Corp   N SYY  and a host of restaurant chains  Since President Donald Trump announced sweeping tariffs on steel and aluminum to help the domestic steel industry on March 20  PCP s steel costs have jumped 9 percent as the market prices in the tariffs before they even take effect  Vincent now expects his steel bill for the year to rise  18 million to  20 million  forcing him to choose between taking a potential 75 percent cut to his company s profits  or pushing the added costs to his retail customers and eventually to consumers   many of whom are lower income Americans  who can least afford it   Vincent told Reuters    Look  we all want to protect U S  steelworkers   Vincent said while touring a tomato farm in Woodland  California   But we don t want to be an unintended consequence of this   Meant to protect U S  jobs and even out trade imbalances  the Trump administration s tariffs on steel and aluminum are having a ripple effect throughout the U S  economy  from cars to aircraft to oilfield pipes  Cans have a special significance in the debate over the pros and cons of the policy   U S  Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross  during a March 2 appearance on CNBC  held up a  Campbell Soup  Co  N CPB  can and said it only contained 2 6 cents worth of steel in it  equating to less than a one cent added cost per can    Who in the world is going to be too bothered by six tenths of a cent   Ross said   A Commerce Department spokesman said the figures Ross used were based on the cost of tin plate steel and calculated for a 10 75 ounce  0 3kg  can  adding steel is  only one component of the cost   Canning industry executives  however  say the cost of America s most common 15 ounce  0 43kg  can is actually around 17 cents  and will rise 4 cents thanks to tariffs   Even a 10 ounce can costs food processors up to 14 cents  and should cost 3 cents more with tariffs  Those pennies add up  If the cost of all 24 billion cans Americans use annually went up 3 cents  it would generate an additional  720 million in costs someone in the supply chain must eat  industry executives said   Our members have razor thin margins   said Nickolas George  president of the Midwest Food Products Association  which represents Seneca Food Corp  O SENEA  and  Del Monte Pacific Ltd   SI DMPL   which both can fruit and vegetables  among others   Lower profits for them mean less innovation  less investment  less expansion into new markets and less hiring   HIT TO THE POCKETBOOK For consumers  a spike in prices in the grocery aisle puts poorer Americans at risk  U S  government statistics show  because they spend more of their budget on food than those in higher income brackets   For a graphic  click  The canning industry has made economic fairness part of its public argument for canceling the tariffs  According to 2012 research commissioned by the Can Manufacturers Institute  Americans on food stamps and other food assistance programs consumed 7 1 cans of fruit and vegetables every week  compared with the national weekly average of 5 5 cans   Retailers and companies like PCP work to keep the cost of canned fruit and vegetables under 99 cents  which is what Vincent calls the  magic number   a psychological threshold over which poorer U S  consumers in particular have historically walked away   I m afraid the tariffs are going to push us over that 99 cent threshold   Vincent said   A key question is whether Walmart will let producers pass on higher costs  as the retail giant is renowned for pushing back against price hikes  said Edward Jones analyst Brittany Weissman  Walmart referred Reuters to the Retail Industry Leaders Association trade group  Hun Quach  the group s vice president for international trade  said with tariffs  the bottom line is there is no other place for through costs to go than to consumers   Rivals for PCP in China and Europe  meanwhile  are seen getting a boost from steel tariffs  Canned fruit and vegetables imported into the United States will not be subject to tariffs because they are classified as finished goods  so foreign competitors are under no pressure to raise prices   PUTTING INVESTMENT ON HOLD The farmers in PCP s cooperative grow fruits and vegetables in the rich  sandy loam soil of California s Central Valley  east of San Francisco   One of those farmers is Frank Muller  chairman of the cooperative s board and a second generation tomato farmer  On the thousands of acres he farms  workers carefully drop young tomato plants into perfectly formed holes  irrigated by underground strips to save water  New seeds and more precise planting techniques have helped Muller more than double the yield of his fields during the past three decades to 55 tons of tomatoes per acre   But at the same time  his costs have exploded  In just one example  he now pays  2 600 per 100 000 seeds up from  20 three decades ago  Muller had planned a new steel equipment storage building on his farm  but that investment is on hold  he said  due to uncertainty about the cost   The tariffs hit me at both ends   Muller said   It means higher input costs and it will hurt our end markets   Richard Elliot is another of PCP s farmers worried by tariffs  A fifth generation pear grower  he said a broader trade war would hurt his exports to Canada and South America  But Elliot is more concerned steel tariffs will harm PCP  which he relies on to buy and can a significant portion of his crop    We can t be in business unless PCP is doing well   he said  PCP has expanded over the years  investing in a fruit import business to can exotic fruit and a cherry growing operation in Oregon  When a rival closed its Modesto  California  peach canning plant earlier this year citing rising costs and  import competition from China and Europe   PCP took over that business  The 700 million cans PCP needs for this year s growing season will add close to  20 million in unplanned additional cost  The company had expected profit for this year of  24 million  but those extra steel costs could cut PCP s profits by up to  18 million  Vincent said   To cut costs  PCP will process the extra fruit without adding to its labor force  
 There s a lot of money we could have made that will go into steel   PCP s Vincent said ",2018-05-10,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/how-trumps-steel-tariffs-kick-the-can-business-1440249,1440249

103957,325472,CPB,Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Friday,news,"Investing com   Here are the top five things you need to know in financial markets on Friday  May 18 
1  Doubts rise over China U S  trade talks
As the U S  and China were set to continue trade talks on Friday in Washington  China poured cold water on reports that it was willing to reduce its trade surplus with the U S  by  200 billion annually by importing more American goods 
News of the offer was leaked Thursday by a Trump administration  but two posts on Chinese state social media disputed the report on Friday while a foreign ministry official said no such offer had been made to his knowledge 
In a more conciliatory tone  China did say on Friday that it is ending its anti dumping and anti subsidy investigation into imports of U S  sorghum 
The news followed words by Trump himself stating that he doubted trade talks with China would be successful   Other countries have become very spoiled  because they always got 100  of whatever they wanted from the United States   the President said in a briefing Thursday 
2  Fed speakers to be watched on data less day
With no major U S  economic reports set for release on Friday  traders will focus on a series of appearances from Federal Reserve policymakers to gauge plans on the path of rate hikes this year 
Cleveland Fed president Loretta Mester focused mostly on bank regulation  warning against unwinding steps taken during the financial crisis  Mester was upbeat on the economy  saying that the outlook was as strong as it has been  in a long time  
Both Fed governor Lael Brainard and Dallas Fed chief Robert Kaplan will be making separate appearances at 9 15AM ET  13 15GMT  
The next rate hike is fully priced in for the June 12 13 meeting  although markets remain uncertain as to whether there will be  after the increase seen in March  a total of three or four hikes in 2018  Odds for the fourth hike in December hovered just above 50  on Friday  according to Investing com s Fed Rate Monitor Tool 
While waiting for clues from policymakers  the dollar was largely unchanged against major rivals on Friday  hovering near five month highs 
3  Oil heads for solid weekly gains ahead of data on U S  shale production
Oil headed higher in early morning trade on Friday  hovering just below 3  year intraday highs reached a day earlier  as looming sanctions against Iran  the continuing economic crisis in Venezuela and strong demand continued to support prices 
Investors looked ahead Friday to the latest weekly installment of drilling activity from Baker Hughes that will provide investors with fresh insight into U S  oil production and demand 
Data last week showed the number of U S  oil rigs rose for the sixth week in a row  fueling concerns that increased production stateside could eventually derail OPEC led efforts to curb output and balance markets 
U S  crude oil futures gained 0 28  to  71 69 at 5 55AM ET  9 55GMT   while Brent oil rose 0 52  to  79 71  off Thursday s high of  80 50 
4  U S  futures point to higher open  Dow on track for slight weekly decline
U S  futures pointed to a slightly higher open on with the Dow currently on track for weekly losses of about 0 5   Geopolitical concerns have been the main market driver this week with retail sales having been the only major economic data and while earnings season comes to a close  Deere   Company  NYSE DE  and  Campbell Soup  Company  NYSE CPB  will be among firms reporting Friday before the opening bell 
At 5 56AM ET  9 56GMT   the blue chip Dow futures gained 76 points  or 0 30   S P 500 futures rose 7 points  or 0 24   while the Nasdaq 100 futures traded up 19 points  or 0 28  
Elsewhere  European stocks traded lower on Friday  but dipped were still on track to pocket their eighth straight weeks of gains  supported by a rally in energy shares and a weaker euro  which helped investors shrug off worries over Italy
Earlier  Asian shares closed higher as traders appeared to take heart into China s announcement that it would end an anti dumping probe into U S  sorghum import and as bilateral trade talks moved into a second day in Washington 
5  Japanese inflation slowdown continues for 2nd month
Data released on Friday showed that Japanese inflation slowed for a second consecutive month  dropping to a 0 6  rise and missing expectations for a smaller easing to 0 7  
The latest slowdown in consumer prices will likely heighten questions about the sustainability of the Bank of Japan s stimulus program  which is widely thought to be both at the limits of its powers and producing diminishing returns 
Japan s economy contracted more than expected at the start of this year  suggesting growth has peaked after the best run of expansion in decades 
While analysts expect growth to rebound in the current quarter  any sign of the economy hitting a plateau could further push back market expectations of an exit from easy monetary policy

2019 results  wherein both top and bottom lines came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Moreover  sales improved year on year  Also  management has reiterated its outlook  However  earnings plunged year over year and organic sales remained flat  owing to sluggishness in some of the segments Q2 HighlightsAdjusted earnings of 77 cents per share dipped 23  year over year  however beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 70 cents  The downside came due to a fall in EBIT in the base business  increased tax rates  as well as dilutive impacts from the buyouts of Snyder s Lance and Pacific Foods  These were partially mitigated by favorable impacts of nearly 3 cents from revenue recognition changes Net sales of  2 713 million climbed 24  year over year  primarily backed by gains from the Snyder s Lance and Pacific Foods buyouts  The top line figure also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 692 million  However  organic sales remained flat year on year  as benefits from Snacks and Global Biscuits were offset by declines in Meals and Beverages as well as Campbell Fresh Moving on  the company s adjusted gross margin contracted 4 3 percentage points to 30 9   which included a negative impact of about 200 basis points from the recent acquisitions  Apart from this  the gross margin contraction was accountable to cost inflation  escalated supply chain expenses and increased

up 1  to  1 230 million  Further  the segment s organic sales were down 1  due to softness across Prego pasta sauces  Plum and Canada  partially made up by gains in V8 Energy V8 vegetable juice beverages   Excluding gains from the Pacific Foods buyout  U S  soup sales were flat year on year  as benefits from broth and ready to serve soups were countered by softness in condensed soups Global Biscuits and Snacks  Sales at this division soared 76  at  1 243 million  Excluding gains from the Snyder s Lance s buyout and currency headwinds  organic sales improved 3   driven by advancements in Pepperidge Farm and Arnott s biscuits  Markedly  Pepperidge Farm sales have been rising for 17 consecutive quarters Campbell Fresh  Sales at this segment slipped 7  to  239 million on account of

103969,325484,CPB,As Pace Of Cannabis Sector Deals Heats Up  3 Pot Stocks Worth Watching,opinion,"Even as analysts continue raising their estimates regarding the actual size of the burgeoning marijuana market  key sector players continue jockeying for position within that market  It seems as if the pace of partnership announcements as well as mergers and acquisitions on both sides of the Canada U S  border have escalated  as participants attempt to stake their claims in the recreational  medicinal and edible cannabis segments 
And with each new announcement  investor reaction intensifies pushing the needle higher on pot stock prices  The fluctuations are sometimes dramatic  often temporary  yet always noteworthy  These reactions only add to the frenzied state of sentiment toward this sector  Indeed  observers are no longer waiting to see what deal will be announced next  but rather attempting to get out ahead by determining which company could be making a move next 
Add to all that such fundamental drivers as comments such as those made by U S  Attorney General William Barr  when he told Congress last week that he considered the situation  intolerable  that all various forms of marijuana continue to be illegal on the federal level  yet a growing number of states are legalizing it  indicating a softening of the federal government s stance 
For investors  therefore  getting out ahead of the fundamentals  at least by knowing which companies are about to ink any deals is important  not to mention profitable  After all  each new agreement has the potential to influence stock prices in both the near  as well as the mid term and longer term horizons 
Here are three companies to watch in the coming months  according to industry analysts and observers 
1  HEXO Corporation
Quebec based HEXO Corp   NYSE HEXO    TO HEXO   could be busy on the merger and acquisitions front in 2019   says Michael Berger  founder of Technical 420  which specializes in research and analysis of cannabis stocks  Indeed  last month it acquired another Canadian marijuana company  Newstrike Brands  V HIP   in an all stock deal valued at C 260 million   195 04 million USD  
Some  according to published reports  are speculating HEXO could be in talks with U S  based companies like the Campbell Soup Company  NYSE CPB  

On Friday  HEXO shares closed on the NYSE at  6 30  up from the previous day s close of  6 20  Since the start of the year  the stock has gained 84   The company has a market cap of  1 32 billion 
2  The Green Organic Dutchman Holdings
Considered a world leader in organic grade cannabis  The Green Organic Dutchman Holdings Ltd  OTC TGODF    TO TGOD  has been trading publicly for a little less than a year after raising C 132 26 million   99 22 milion USD  last May in its initial public offering  the largest Canadian cannabis IPO to date 

The Ontario based company is currently running growing operations in Canada  Europe and the Caribbean  It also recently signed a distribution agreement with Velvet Management a division of Canada s largest wine distributor Philippe Dandurand Wines  for sales and distribution of its products to provincial liquor and cannabis boards across Canada 
The company also has plans to build a 40 000 square foot research and development center with space to develop new products  including cannabinoid infused beverages  It could be primed to ink a few more deals in the coming months 
Shares of The Green Organic Dutchman closed last Friday on the U S  OTC market at  3 15  giving it a market cap of  9855 37  The stock is currently trading about halfway between it s all time high of  7 79 and its  1 60 low 
3  Aurora Cannabis 
Perhaps the most likely candidate to announce a major deal is Alberta based Aurora Cannabis  NYSE ACB    TO ACB   It s one of Canada s largest marijuana companies  with a specialty in medical cannabis 
What sets Aurora apart from the other big boys in the sector is that it has yet to announce a major partnership deal with any mega cap U S  firm active in one of the many sectors pharmaceuticals  beverages and consumer edibles for example that are all poised for disruption by the legalization of marijuana  Investors  however  are betting that will quickly change 

Last month  the company hired activist investor Nelson Peltz as a strategic adviser  Shares jumped more than 13 percent on the news  His deal with the company gives him the option to buy 20 million common shares  a move that could make him Aurora s second largest stake holder 
In a statement issued outlining Peltz s appointment  Aurora said he would 

 Work collaboratively and strategically to explore potential partnerships that would be the optimal strategic fit for successful entry into each of Aurora s contemplated market segments  

In addition  he ll advise on its continued global expansion 
Aurora s stock closed at  8 88 on Friday  Shares are up more than 38  since the start of the year  The company has market cap of  8 85 billion ",2019-04-15,Brenda O'Farrell/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/pace-of-cannabis-sector-deals-heats-up-as-pot-stocks-gain-traction-200406616,200406616

104029,325544,CPB,Analysts Estimate Campbell Soup  CPB  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"Campbell Soup  CPB  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended January 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 27  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This maker of canned soup  Pepperidge Farm cookies and V8 juice is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 70 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  30  
Revenues are expected to be  2 69 billion  up 23 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 8  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Campbell 
For Campbell  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  2 37  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Campbell will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Campbell would post earnings of  0 69 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 79  delivering a surprise of  14 49  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

104038,325553,CPB,Trump jettisons business councils after CEOs quit in protest,news,"By David Shepardson and Michael Erman WASHINGTON NEW YORK  Reuters    President Donald Trump announced the disbanding of two high profile business advisory councils on Wednesday after several chief executives quit in protest over his remarks blaming weekend violence in Virginia not only on white nationalists but also on anti racism activists who opposed them  A parade of prominent Republicans and U S  ally Britain also rebuked Trump after his comments on Tuesday about the bloodshed in the college town of Charlottesville further enveloped his seven month old presidency in controversy  paralyzed his policy aims and left him increasingly isolated  Trump announced the dissolution of the American Manufacturing Council and Strategic and Policy Forum  whose members included some leading American business figures  after eight executives including  Campbell Soup  Co CEO  N CPB  Denise Morrison and 3M Co CEO  N MMM  Inge Thulin quit the panels  Both of the councils were moving to disband on their own when Trump made his announcement on Twitter  A memorial service was held on Wednesday in Charlottesville for 32 year old Heather Heyer  killed when a car plowed into the anti racism protesters  A 20 year old Ohio man said to have harbored Nazi sympathies has been charged with murder  Trump  a real estate magnate who had never before held public office  was elected president in November touting his experience in the business world and ability to strike deals  But some of the Republican president s actions and words have alienated many corporate leaders  The Strategic and Policy Forum was headed by Blackstone Group  N BX  CEO Stephen Schwarzman  a close ally of Trump in the business world  Schwarzman organized a call on Wednesday for member executives to voice concerns after Trump s comments  and an overwhelming majority backed disbanding the council  two sources said  Schwarzman then called Trump to tell him about the decision to disband  and the president subsequently announced he was the one pulling the plug on the panels   Racism and murder are unequivocally reprehensible and not morally equivalent to anything else that happened in Charlottesville   Morrison said  JPMorgan Chase   Co  N JPM  CEO Jamie Dimon  a member of one of the panels  said he strongly disagreed with Trump s reaction to the events in Charlottesville  adding in a statement that  racism  intolerance and violence are always wrong  and  fanning divisiveness is not the answer    Dow Chemical  Co  N DOW  Chief Executive Andrew Liveris  who headed the manufacturing council  said he told the White House on Wednesday that  in the current environment it was no longer possible to conduct productive discussions   Trump said on Twitter   Rather than putting pressure on the businesspeople of the Manufacturing Council   Strategy   Policy Forum  I am ending both   The Strategic and Policy Forum was intended to advise Trump on how government policy impacts economic growth  job creation and productivity  The manufacturing council was designed to promote U S  job growth   Along with the snubs from business leaders  Trump was rebuked by a string of Republicans including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell  Ohio Governor John Kasich  Senator Lindsey Graham and former U S  presidents George H W  Bush and George W  Bush  The president needs the support of fellow Republicans as he tries to push his policy agenda  including tax cuts  through a Congress that is controlled by the Republicans  Few public figures have voiced support for Trump over his response to the violence  Vice President Mike Pence  who is cutting short a trip to Latin America  told reporters in Chile that  I stand with the president and I stand by those words   Former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke praised Trump s  honesty and courage   Richard Spencer  head of a white nationalist group  lauded the president for  speaking the truth   U S  stocks ended slightly firmer but off the day s highs as investors worried that the backlash to Trump s remarks could stunt his ability to deliver on pro business promises  POSSIBLE RESIGNATIONS A former senior Trump administration official raised the prospect that some White House officials could quit because of Trump s comments  The demise of the councils raised Wall Street speculation that senior administration figures such as White House economic adviser Gary Cohn or U S  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin might step down to avoid the tarnish of being associated with Trump  Cohn  Mnuchin and Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao stood awkwardly by Trump during his remarks at Trump Tower on Tuesday   He s worried about his reputation being trashed  which is much more valuable to him than anything else   the former administration official  speaking on condition of anonymity  said of Cohn  McConnell  who last week drew Trump s ire over the Senate s failure to pass healthcare legislation  issued a statement saying  messages of hate and bigotry  from white supremacists  the Ku Klux Klan and neo Nazi groups should not be welcome anywhere in the United States  McConnell s statement did not mention Trump by name  The Republican Jewish Coalition  a group whose board includes several former Republican officials and big party donors including casino mogul Sheldon Adelson  called on Trump to  provide greater moral clarity in rejecting racism  bigotry and antisemitism    There is  simply no place  in American public discourse for  hate and violence  displayed in Charlottesville  U S  Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said before meeting with Canada s foreign minister   BLAME ON BOTH SIDES  Trump s remarks on Tuesday were a more vehement reprisal of his initial response to the bloodshed  At a heated news conference in New York  he said  there is blame on both sides  of the violence  and that there were  very fine people  on both sides  In London  British Prime Minister Theresa May offered a rare rebuke of Trump from so close a U S  ally   I see no equivalence between those who propound fascist views and those who oppose them and I think it is important for all those in positions of responsibility to condemn far right views wherever we hear them   May told reporters when asked to comment on Trump s stance   Politicians in Germany  which has tough laws against hate speech and any symbols linked to the Nazis who murdered six million Jews in the Holocaust  expressed shock at the images of people in Charlottesville carrying swastikas and chanting anti Jewish slurs  The country s justice minister accused Trump of trivializing anti Semitism and racism  Senior American military officers usually stay clear of politics  but two more of the U S  military s top officers weighed in on Wednesday  without explicitly mentioning Trump  U S  Army Chief of Staff General Mark Milley wrote on Twitter   The Army doesn t tolerate racism  extremism  or hatred in our ranks  It s against our Values and everything we ve stood for since 1775   Air Force Chief of Staff General Dave Goldfein  said on Twitter that  I stand with my fellow service chiefs in saying we re always stronger together

typical process of using the previous year s budget as a starting point and adjusting it based on revenue and inflation projections  for example  It often cracks down on the size of a company s real estate footprint  corporate travel  terms of international assignments  redundant technology and outside consultants  Employees get cut  too  But there are risks  One is that companies focus too keenly on restraining spending and not on reinvestment that promotes new products and revenue growth   You continuously have to ask what are strategic costs and how can we invest behind the things that drive the highest volume   said Jason Heinrich  a partner in Bain   Company s Chicago office  FEELING THREATENED ZBB first gained widespread attention in the late 1970s  when Carter  as president  said he would apply the budgeting principles to federal spending  It never fully got off the ground  however  and Ronald Reagan abandoned it when he became president in 1981  Its recent resurgence is due in part to Brazilian buyout firm 3G Capital  which used ZBB when it combined H J  Heinz with Kraft Foods in 2015  The combined Kraft Heinz  O KHC  now has the best profit margins among its peers with an estimated year over year gross margin expansion of 258 basis points  better than twice the average among rivals  according to  Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS   Kraft Heinz s stock sports a 2 5 point price to earnings multiple premium over its peers  3G s success is one reason the highest adoption rate of ZBB is in the consumer staples sector  which has banked on cost cutting to offset weak sales growth  In the current fourth quarter reporting season  the consumer staples sector is on track to report profit of 6 3 percent off revenue growth of just 3 2 percent  according to Thomson Reuters data  Contrast that with the consumer discretionary sector where sales are seen rising 5 percent but profit just 1 1 percent  Greg Kuczynski  a consumer staples analyst at asset manager Janus Capital  said ZBB is also being used by some to head off agitation from activist shareholders or even takeovers  like the Kraft Heinz deal   So many of them feel threatened   he said   They re desperately implementing ZBB packages   Now the approach is spreading to energy  finance  health care and manufacturing   Cheniere Energy Inc   A LNG   Huntington Bancshares Inc  O HBAN   Baxter International Inc  N BAX  and  Ford Motor Co   N F  are some of the latest devotees   If a company uses zero based budgeting  I have more confidence it can take out cost faster than peers who do not   said Marc Scott  who helps run the  1 billion American Century All Cap Growth Fund    TOUGHER THAN IT LOOKS Not everyone is sold on it  It can be an uncomfortable adjustment for managers and companies have to be careful not to alienate customers and business partners  according to analysts  The biggest risk is that companies concentrate only on cutting costs  and don t put some of that money back to work behind businesses with the potential for growth  One unintended consequence is cutting a product s marketing budget only to see a rival boost spending for their product and grab market share    It s not so simple as some of our other competitors out there make you believe  which has been roughly translated into   Let s cut all the costs as long as we can get away with it to show you better margins for a short period of time  But I can t promise you any growth along the way     Unilever   L ULVR  Chief Executive Paul Polman told investors in November  Even Kraft Heinz has had trouble generating consistent growth  Its organic net sales  which excludes the impact of currency fluctuations and other items  declined by 1 percent in the three month period that ended Oct 2  Still  the cost cutting has caught the attention of investors  particularly when companies scrap product lines that add little value  American Century s Scott said ZBB was a factor when he evaluated kidney dialysis provider Baxter International  which has used ZBB principles to cancel several programs that added little value  He began building a position in late 2015 when Baxter traded below  35 a share  according to Thomson Reuters data  The fund now owns about 540 000 shares and the stock trades around  46  
 It was just another feather in their cap   Scott said about Baxter s use of ZBB   It s not a huge growth play  but we expect their profit margins to nearly double in a couple of years  ",2017-01-30,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/back-to-zero:-companies-use-1970s-budget-tool-to-cut-costs-as-they-hunt-for-growth-456469,456469

104061,325576,CPB,Sysco  SYY  To Post Q2 Earnings  Can Endeavors Check Costs ,opinion,Sysco Corporation   NYSE SYY   is slated to come out with second quarter fiscal 2019 results on Feb 4  This provider of food and related products has a mixed record of earnings surprises over the trailing four quarters  Let s see how the company is positioned ahead of the upcoming quarterly results Sysco Corporation Price and EPS Surprise   What to Expect The Zacks Consensus Estimate has gone down in the past 30 days to 72 cents  which however reflects 9 1  growth from the year ago quarter s figure  Also  the consensus mark for revenues is  14 853 million  depicting a rise of 3 1  from revenues recorded in the year ago quarter Not All Seem to be RosyLike many food companies  Sysco is also reeling under cost related headwinds for a while now  The company continued to witness this trend in the last reported quarter  mainly due to a tight U S  labor market  Moreover  gross margin in this segment contracted 7 basis points  bps  to 20 10   caused by a fall in food cost inflation in U S  Broadline  particularly due to deflation in meat  poultry and produce categories During the quarter  operating expenses in the U S  Foodservice unit increased 5 8   owing to higher supply chain expenses related to both transport and warehouse  In fact  warehouse and transportation related costs also posed concerns to the company s SYGMA unit and the International segment s Canada region  The company s International unit also incurred increased costs related to investments in integration and transformation  which are likely to linger  Further  higher fuel costs led to escalated U S  Foodservice unit operating expenses  which also included overtime costs and other costs related to additional hiring owing to a tight labor market  The company expects its warehouse and transportation costs associated with supply chain to persist  which is a threat to margins  Well  escalated costs are posing hurdles for companies like Pilgrim s Pride   NASDAQ PPC    TreeHouse Foods   NYSE THS   and Campbell Soup   NYSE CPB    among others Coming back to Sysco  the company s International segment witnessed a slowdown in the first quarter as Canadian sales were lower than expected  and consumer sentiments were unfavorable in the U K   with several restaurant closures and Brexit related worries  Also  a tough operating environment in Mexico hampered Latin America s performance to an extent  Persistence of these hurdles along with volatile currency movements is a concern for the impending quarter  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for International Foodservice Operations sales stands at  2 892 million compared with  2 869 million reported in the same period last year Will U S  Foodservice Unit  Strategic Plans Offer Adequate Respite On the brighter side  Sysco s U S  Foodservice unit has been performing well for quite some time now  The robust trend continued in first quarter fiscal 2019  wherein earnings and sales advanced year over year  mainly buoyed by strength in U S  Foodservice Operations  Notably  local case volumes in this segment have been rising year over year for 18 consecutive quarters now  Additionally  rising restaurant sales have been benefitting the company s U S  Operations for a while  Well  a rosy economic scenario  marked by elevated consumer confidence and favorable consumer spending  is likely to continue working in favor of restaurant sales  thereby being a driver for the U S  Foodservice segment  The consensus mark for sales at this segment is pegged at  10 010 million for the second quarter  representing growth of 3 4  from sales reported in the year ago period The company is on track with its strategic priorities that are expected to drive growth and fuel value creation  Talking of Sysco s growth endeavors  the company is on track with its four core plans that include enhancing consumers  experience  optimizing business  stimulating power of its people and achieving operational efficacy  In this regard  the company focuses on enhancing assortments  making constant innovations  ensuring food safety and revitalizing brands  Further  to evolve with the changing consumer preferences  Sysco is committed toward investing in technology and enhancing e commerce operations  Moreover  it plans to improve supply chain  increase transparency  enhance deliveries and manage product costs effectively   We expect these factors to provide significant respite to Sysco in the quarter to be reported What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model doesn t show that Sysco is likely to beat bottom line estimates this quarter  For this to happen  a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong

For the company s first quarter  which ended on November 1  Campbell s revenues fell 2 3  to  2 2 billion  amid the effects of a stronger dollar  The impacts of an appreciating dollar tamped down on Campbell s foreign sales in a wide range of segments throughout the company  Foreign currency translation created a negative eight point impact on Global Biscuits and Snacks sales and a negative 2  impact on its Americas Simple Meals and Beverages division  contributing to an overall negative 3  effect on total sales 
As a result  Campbell s reported quarterly earnings of  194 million or 0 62 per share  down from net profits of  248 million or 0 78 during the same quarter in Fiscal Year 2015  When certain items were excluded  Campbell s reported per share earnings of 0 95 from its continuing operations  above analysts  expectations of 0 76 
 We re encouraged by our first quarter performance  While organic sales for the quarter were comparable to a solid prior year  we recognize that we have more work ahead to improve our growth trajectory   Campbell s President and CEO Denise Morrison said in a statement   I am particularly pleased that we delivered a third consecutive quarter of adjusted gross margin expansion with improved execution in our supply chain  
 We drove strong adjusted EBIT and EPS performance across the company  Given an improved margin outlook for the year  we raised guidance for adjusted EBIT and EPS  while we lowered sales guidance to reflect increased currency headwinds  
In addition  the company s gross margin decreased from 35 3  to 34 3   even as its adjusted gross margin improved 2 6  for the quarter  amid higher selling prices and improved supply chain results  Marketing and selling expenses also fell 7  to  226 million from the impacts of a stronger dollar 
Moving forward  Campbell s increased its forward guidance for the year from 2 53 to 2 58 per share to 2 75 to 2 83  The company still expects the impact from foreign currency translation to have a negative 3 point effect in 2016 
 We began fiscal 2016 after successfully implementing a number of changes to align our enterprise structure with our strategy  Most significant among those changes were the formation of three new divisions with clear portfolio roles and the roll out of a major cost savings initiative that included streamlining our organization  the launch of an Integrated Global Services organization and initiating zero based budgeting   Morrison added   We have made clear and meaningful progress and commence the new fiscal year better positioned to execute against our strategic imperatives

104108,325623,CPB,Dean Foods Hits 52 Week Low  Soft Volumes   Input Costs Hurt,opinion,Shares of Dean Foods Company   NYSE DF   touched a 52 week low of  3 89  before closing the session a tad higher at  3 93 on Dec 21  Notably  the company has long been grappling with escalated fuel  freight and resin costs  which along with volatility surrounding fluid milk volumes has been hurting its performance In third quarter 2018  the company reported disappointing results  wherein both top and bottom line deteriorated year over year due to soft volumes stemming from plant closures and associated transitionary costs  These cost hurdles are expected to persist  which compelled management to slash its earnings outlook for 2018   Read   Consequently  the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been witnessing a downtrend  We note that estimates for current and next year have moved south by 18 cents and 17 cents to a loss of 24 cents and a loss of 5 cents  respectively  over the past 30 days Clearly  these downsides have hurt investors  confidence in the stock that has crashed 34 5  since the announcement of the results on Nov 7  In the past three months  shares of this Texas based company have plunged around 47   wider than the  s decline of 41 5   Currently  this Zacks Rank  4  Sell  stock carries a  of D  That said  let s take a closer look at the aspects impacting the company s performance  You can see  Input Cost and Soft Volumes  A ConcernDean Foods is battling significant input cost inflation  Evidently  increased resin  freight and fuel expenses have been hurting the company s margins for a while and also remained a worry in the third quarter of 2018  Companies like Conagra Brands   NYSE CAG    TreeHouse Foods   NYSE THS   and Campbell Soup   NYSE CPB   among others are also bearing the brunt of rising input costs  Coming back to Dean Foods  a tight labor market due to limited driver availability dented margins These factors along with higher transitory costs related to plant closures and increased advertising expenses weighed on Dean Foods  third quarter results  While adjusted gross margin contracted 250 basis points  the company posted an adjusted operating loss of  20 million  Management stated that fuel rates flared up 25  year to date and is expected to remain high through the final quarter Moreover  the company has been witnessing lower volumes and loss of share in U S  fluid milk volumes for a while now  During the third quarter  volumes declined significantly year over year  largely due to the closure of seven plants  Further  per USDA results  fluid milk category dropped 2  through August on a quarter to date basis  Soft volumes and escalated transitory costs too affected Dean Foods  adjusted gross profit and the bottom line   These volume losses are expected to linger in the fourth quarter  which remains a concern Will Cost Cutting Plans Provide Respite to Stock Dean Foods is focused on reducing unnecessary costs throughout the organization and improving efficiency  It is particularly paying attention toward the improvement of waste management and operating efficiency  Under the OPEX 2020 cost productivity plan introduced in 2017  the company had targeted annual productivity of  80  100 million  These savings are likely to provide some cushion against input cost inflation and volume deleverage throughout its operational phase Further  the company is on track with its plans to boost operational excellence via execution of the enterprise wide cost productivity program in order to generate additional savings in 2018 and beyond  This productivity program mainly revolves around three major areas including enhancement of its supply chain network  optimizing spending across all key categories to ensure greater efficiency and integration of operating model along with minimizing general and administrative expenses  Meanwhile  the enhancement of supply chain focuses on consolidating plant network and maintaining quality  value and service Moreover  Dean Foods is implementing plans to alleviate headwinds related to high freight and fuel expenses  while continuing to boost its brands and private label business to fuel volumes  Notably  the cost productivity program is likely to deliver an incremental annual run rate savings of  150 million by 2020  These initiatives should help the company offset some negative impacts from volume declines and higher non dairy input costs However  the company does not expect the cost woes to be completely countered by the end of this year  This is also reflected in management s lowered outlook for 2018  That said  the current hurdles keep us apprehensive about the stock Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside

104120,325635,CPB,GIS Vs  CPB  Which Stock Is The Better Value Option ,opinion,"Investors looking for stocks in the Food   Miscellaneous sector might want to consider either General Mills  NYSE GIS  or Campbell Soup  CPB   But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors  We ll need to take a closer look to find out 
Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities  but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank  The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits 
Right now  General Mills is sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while Campbell Soup has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold   This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions  so investors should feel comfortable knowing that GIS is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent  But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors 
Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics  These include the long favored P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company s fair value 
GIS currently has a forward P E ratio of 13 51  while CPB has a forward P E of 15 71  We also note that GIS has a PEG ratio of 1 74  This popular figure is similar to the widely used P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also considers a company s expected EPS growth rate  CPB currently has a PEG ratio of 2 66 
Another notable valuation metric for GIS is its P B ratio of 3 84  The P B ratio pits a stock s market value against its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  CPB has a P B of 8 33 
These are just a few of the metrics contributing to GIS s Value grade of B and CPB s Value grade of C 
GIS stands above CPB thanks to its solid earnings outlook  and based on these valuation figures  we also feel that GIS is the superior value option right now ",2018-12-04,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gis-vs-cpb-which-stock-is-the-better-value-option-200364947,200364947

 NEW YORK  Sept 11  Reuters    Wall Street was poised for a
flat to higher open on Friday as positive remarks from Treasury
Secretary Timothy Geithner supported optimism for a recovery 
but stocks could stall after five days of gains 
 Surprisingly strong industrial output and other economic
data from China underscored optimism that the global economy is
pulling out of a slump 
 Geithner said on Thursday that with a strengthening economy
the government can end some of the extraordinary support put in
place for markets and prepare for a slow recovery 
 Appearing before the Congressional Oversight Panel for the
 700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program  Geithner said the
economy was in far better shape now than a year ago  when it
was  on the verge of collapse   though it still had problems 
 Analysts said his comments were helping markets   The
general economic recovery    which you get more and more
testimony on every day    is causing investors to rebuild
equity portfolios and continue to buy stocks   said Rick
Meckler  president of investment firm LibertyView Capital
Management in New York

 By Leah Schnurr
 NEW YORK  Sept 11  Reuters    Wall Street was set for a
modestly higher open on Friday as investors were optimistic
about economic recovery prospects and FedEx said its
first quarter earnings would exceed expectations 
 Positive comments from Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner
and surprisingly strong industrial output and other economic
data from China underscored optimism that the global economy is
pulling out of a slump  For details  see  ID nPEK13979 
 Geithner said on Thursday that with a strengthening economy
the government can end some of the extraordinary support put in
place for markets and prepare for a slow recovery 
 ID nLB484541 
 Appearing before the Congressional Oversight Panel for the
 700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program  Geithner said the
economy was in far better shape now than a year ago  when it
was  on the verge of collapse   though it still had problems 
 FedEx Corp  said that profits in both its current
and subsequent quarters would be higher than previously
expected  citing an improving economy and fuel prices  Its
shares were up 5 percent at  76 26 before the bell

 FedEx and UPS are  really good indicators for the market

  Obviously people are shipping more  People look at that as
a bullish sign for the economy  And the market did spike on
that news

104161,325676,CPB,What s In The Cards For Flowers Foods   FLO  Q3 Earnings ,opinion,"Flowers Foods  Inc    NYSE FLO   is slated to release third quarter 2018 results on Nov 7  This provider of packaged bakery foods delivered negative earnings surprise of 10 7  in the last reported quarter  though it has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters  average beat being 6 4  Flowers Foods  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise
   Let s see what s in store for the company this time around Factors Impacting Flowers FoodsFlowers Foods has been battling high costs for quite some time now  The company has been incurring higher materials  supplies  labor and other production costs  exclusive of depreciation and amortization  for three straight quarters  In fact  this metric  as a percentage of sales  expanded 140 basis points  bps  to 51 9  during the second quarter of 2018 
This was associated with promotional costs to support new products and operational issues associated with inferior yeast  Moreover  elevated outside product purchases  owing to robust demand for DKB breakfast items  escalated ingredient costs  We believe persistence of rising costs will be a threat to the company s margins and profitability Well  rising input costs have been posing hurdles to many other food companies like Campbell Soup   NYSE CPB    General Mills   NYSE GIS   and Conagra Brands   NYSE CAG    among others  Coming back to Flowers Foods  the company has been witnessing a year over year decline in EBITDA for the past three quarters  In second quarter 2018  adjusted EBITDA margin contracted 140 bps to 10 9  due to higher marketing investments related to new products  and increased commodity  labor and transport expenses along with costs and disruptions associated with the inferior yeast 
Incidentally  the company encountered operational hurdles at many bakeries during the second quarter  owing to substandard yeast received from a supplier  These factors also weighed on the gross margin  Moreover  these headwinds prompted management to lower its adjusted earnings per share outlook for 2018  raising concerns for the quarter to be reported Nevertheless  Flowers Foods has been progressing well with Project Centennial plan  The plan is aimed at streamlining operations  lowering expenditures  fueling efficiencies and making prudent investments to solidify Flowers Foods  competitive position and aid revenue growth  Markedly  management expects gross savings of  38  48 million in 2018 from this plan  which should also provide some cushion to the company in the quarter under review 
Apart from this  the company should also gain from its acquisitions  which have been strengthening its product portfolio and helping it expand in untapped markets  To this end  strength in DKB  Nature s Own and Wonder brands drove Flowers  Foods  market share in the second quarter  which marked the company s eighth consecutive quarter of market share improvement  Alpine Valley Bread also provided additional organic production capacity to the company What to Expect The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings currently stands at 26 cents  which has remained stable in the past 30 days and also compares favorably with 23 cents per share reported in the year ago quarter  However  the consensus mark for revenues stands at  929 million  reflecting a slight decline from  933 million recorded in the year ago period What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model doesn t show that Flowers Foods is likely to beat bottom line estimates this quarter   For this to happen  the stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our Though Flowers Foods has a Zacks Rank  3  its Earnings ESP of 0 00  makes surprise prediction difficult You can see Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest StrategiesIt s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But while the market gained  21 9  in 2017  our top stock picking screens have returned  115 0    109 3    104 9    98 6  and  67 1  And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon  Over the years it has been remarkably consistent  From 2000   2017  the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over  Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we re willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation ",2018-11-06,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/whats-in-the-cards-for-flowers-foods-flo-q3-earnings-200355814,200355814
104162,325677,CPB,Earnings Preview  Campbell Soup  CPB  Q1 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Campbell Soup  CPB  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended October 2018  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on November 20  2018  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This maker of canned soup  Pepperidge Farm cookies and V8 juice is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 69 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  25  
Revenues are expected to be  2 68 billion  up 23 9  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 27  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Campbell 
For Campbell  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  2 19  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Campbell will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Campbell would post earnings of  0 25 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 25  delivering no surprise 
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Campbell doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2018-11-12,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-campbell-soup-cpb-q1-earnings-expected-to-decline-200358779,200358779
104163,325678,CPB,Campbell  CPB  To Post Q1 Earnings  Cost Woes Likely To Stay,opinion,Campbell Soup Company   NYSE CPB   is slated to release first quarter fiscal 2019 results on Nov 20  This provider of branded convenience food products has a mixed earnings surprise record in the trailing four quarters  where it delivered average positive surprise of 8 8  Campbell Soup Company Price and EPS Surprise   Let s see what s in store for the company this time around What to Expect The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings was revised downward in the past 30 days to 69 cents  which reflects a plunge of 25  from 92 cents per share in the year ago quarter  Nonetheless  the consensus mark for revenues is  2 677 million  reflecting close to 24  growth from  2 161 million in the year ago quarter Factors Driving CampbellCampbell is focused on taking actions related to its portfolio review and Board led strategy  To this end  Campbell plans to draw focus on two separate businesses in its key North American market   Campbell Snacks  and Campbell Meals and Beverages  Further  the company plans to divest non key businesses   Campbell International  which includes Arnott s and the Kelsen Group  and Campbell Fresh   to sharpen focus and enhance portfolio The company should also gain from its strategic buyouts  In this regard  Campbell concluded the buyout of Snyder s Lance during third quarter fiscal 2018  which marked the company s biggest acquisition till date  Campbell is on track with Snyder s Lance s integration and expects to generate cost savings and synergies of nearly  295 million from this acquisition  Prior to this  the company acquired leading organic broth and soup producer  Pacific Foods  in a drive to expand in the fast growing organic food space  Notably  contributions from Snyder s Lance and Pacific Foods drove Campbell s top line growth by 33  in fourth quarter fiscal 2018  These factors also bode well for the quarter to be reported Too Many Hurdles in the PathThough Campbell witnessed top line growth in the fourth quarter  its organic sales went down 3   owing to decline in Americas Simple Meals and Beverages unit  The unit witnessed a 6  drop in organic sales  mainly due to softness across U S  Soup and Canadian sales  Excluding gains from the Pacific Foods buyout  U S  Soup sales tumbled 14  on account of lower sales of condensed soups  broth and ready to serve soups  U S  soup sales were hampered by intense competition and reduced promotional activities  Management expects organic sales to fall slightly in fiscal 2019  Though the company is making efforts to improve trends in the U S  Soup business  it is likely to decrease in fiscal 2019  Apart from this  management also expects Campbell Fresh sales to be hurt by termination of two key private label refrigerated soup deals  These hurdles pose threats to the company s first quarter show Further  Campbell expects its first quarter performance to be dented by several factors  Adoption of new revenue accounting standard is expected to have a 4 cents per share negative impact in the first quarter  wherein results are also anticipated to be hurt by effects of product Goldfish recall  Additionally  the company expects U S  soup business to remain pressurized in the first quarter The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Campbell Fresh sales for the quarter is pegged at  214 million compared with  234 million in the year ago period  On the other hand  the consensus mark for sales of Global Biscuits and Snacks  and Americas Simple Meals and Beverages divisions stand at  1 248 million and  1 224 million  depicting year over year growth of 76  and 0 5   respectively Cost Inflation a Major WorryCampbell has been witnessing strained margins for a while now  In fourth quarter fiscal 2018  the company s adjusted gross margin contracted 5 6 percentage points to 30 6   which included a negative impact of about 3 points from the recent buyouts  Apart from this  the gross margin contraction was accountable to cost inflation  escalated supply chain expenses  adverse mix  increased promotional spending and impacts from the recall of flavor blasted Goldfish crackers  The cost inflation stemmed from increased prices of dairy  steel cans  meat and resins along with greater than expected rise in transportation and logistics expenses  Also  adverse portfolio mix and pricing weighed on gross margin  Gross margin softness  and higher adjusted marketing and selling expenses also weighed on Campbell s EBIT margin Management expects fiscal 2019 gross margin to decline nearly 2 percentage points on account of cost inflation and unfavorable mix related to the acquired businesses  Notably  management expects cost inflation to remain high and range between 4  and 5   stemming from the aforementioned drivers along with tariff impacts  These headwinds are likely to hit the bottom line  which is also expected to bear the brunt of higher interest expenses related to buyouts  In fact  cost inflation  which is a threat to Campbell s first quarter earnings  has been weighing on many other food companies like Conagra Brands   NYSE CAG    General Mills   NYSE GIS   and McCormick   NYSE MKC   What the Zacks Model UnveilsComing back to Campbell  our proven model doesn t show that the company is likely to beat bottom line estimates this quarter   For this to happen  the stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our Campbell s Zacks Rank  4  Sell  combined with its Earnings ESP of  2 19  makes us apprehensive about an earnings beat  In fact  we caution against sell rated stocks  Zacks Rank  4 or 5  going into earnings

104164,325679,CPB,Campbell Soup  CPB  Q1 Earnings And Revenues Surpass Estimates,opinion,"Campbell Soup  CPB  came out with quarterly earnings of  0 79 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 69 per share  This compares to earnings of  0 92 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 14 49   A quarter ago  it was expected that this maker of canned soup  Pepperidge Farm cookies and V8 juice would post earnings of  0 25 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 25  delivering no surprise 
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times 
Campbell  which belongs to the Zacks Food   Miscellaneous industry  posted revenues of  2 69 billion for the quarter ended October 2018  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 63   This compares to year ago revenues of  2 16 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Campbell shares have lost about 20 1  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 0 6  
What s Next for Campbell 
While Campbell has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Campbell was unfavorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  0 74 on  2 71 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  2 41 on  9 78 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year

Crude slips toward  70 from near  72 last Thursday  after UAE says OPEC can cover Iranian supply glitches


Key Events
Equities in Europe drifted lower on Monday  after failing to pick up the momentum seen during the Asian session  Despite positive geopolitical developments today  optimism was spoiled by the declines posted by the energy sector  which tends to underperform when global tensions ease 
The STOXX Europe 600 opened flat  with oil shares losing ground  while health care shares followed their US counterparts higher  However  US futures on the S P 500  the Dow and the NASDAQ 100 seem to be taking their cue from Asian indices  which closed mostly higher 
Malaysian equities rebounded from an earlier decline after Mahathir Mohamad ousted Najib Razak s coalition after six decades of ruling an historic political shift that sparked the highest level of stock market volatility in almost three years  The FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI Index bounced off a 2 7 percent slump to climb 0 5 percent as of 12 26 p m  in Kuala Lumpur  That s the biggest intraday swing since early September 2015 for the Malaysian index  which breached through its 50  and 100 day moving averages  The ringgit also rebounded from a 0 95 percent plunge to a tiny 0 5 percent loss 

Emerging markets equities  which took a hit from the stronger dollar  are building on their first weekly advance in four weeks  just as the dollar continues to slide for a fourth straight day 
Other Asian equity benchmarks climbed to a near two month high on optimism that trade tensions between the US and China are finally easing  after US President Donald Trump said on Sunday that he s working with Chinese President Xi Jinping to help Chinese telecom company ZTE  HK 0763  get back on track  The group was heavily impacted by restrictions by the US Commerce Department on US companies selling supplies to ZTE 
Trump s announcement comes as a good will gesture ahead of a second round of talks  after Chinese officials reiterated last week that their trade position hadn t changed 
Global Financial Affairs
Trump s newfound spirit of compromise may be related to his upcoming meeting with North Korea s Supreme Leader Kim Jong un on June 12  Until that date  the White House will likely steer clear of any protectionist rhetoric against China  given that country s  and its nuclear program  Trump probably needs a geopolitical breakthrough to counterbalance the recent flood of negative headlines  after he withdrew from the Iran deal against the pleas of key European allies and signed off on a controversial decision to move the US embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem which takes place today  A more accommodative tone on trade matters and progress on North Korea s denuclearization would help keep further criticism at bay  as well as boost both US and global stocks 
Japan s TOPIX gained 0 6 percent  for a total of 1 85 percent on a three straight day advance  China s Shanghai Composite also climbed  by 0 3 percent  However  the index is currently posting three consecutive bearish signals as it is in the process of forming a Shooting Star after a Bearish Engulfing Pattern  which in turn had confirmed a previous Hanging Man 
Hong Kong s Hang Seng is up 1 1 percent  making for a 5 percent five day advance  but is also fluctuating between two bearish patterns  a Shooting Star and a High Wave Candle  Australia s S P ASX 200 is up 0 3 percent but remains below the two consecutive Shooting Stars it posted in the two previous sessions  South Korea s KOSPI ignored positive political headlines and closed 0 1 lower  weighed down by tech and telecom shares 
Today s session follows a complex US close on Friday  The S P 500 managed to end in positive territory   0 17 percent  only thanks to shares in Health Care  which jumped 1 49 percent  The second best performers  Consumer Staples and Industrials  came in far behind  with a 0 21 percent gain 
Health care stocks initially plunged on Friday  but then leaped almost 1 5 percent after Trump unveiled his long awaited plan to lower prices on prescription drugs  Shares of Express Scripts  NASDAQ ESRX  and CVS  NYSE CVS  surged 2 6 percent and 3 2 percent respectively  bouncing off session lows after Trump s speech  
Drug companies and investors were bracing for Trump s words after he recently attack unreasonable pharmaceutical prices  However  what the president didn t say rang loudest  he seemed to scrap his previous plans to let Medicare directly set drug prices a proposals loathed by the biopharma industry 

The jump last Friday for health care shares extends a breakout from a bullish Falling Wedge  which may be followed by a Double Bottom upside breakout  after the price neared the 84 0000 neckline  The sector also closed above the 200 DMA for the first time since April 26  A Double Bottom upside breakout would suggest a return to the upside of the most followed moving average  after it s been there for a full year  from February 2017 to February 2018 
WTI Crude slipped lower for a second day  faliing below  71 a decline that would seem unusual considering that a weaker dollar typically favors oil demand  However  WTI prices benefited from statements by the United Arab Emirates that OPEC members would be able to offset any possible drop in supply stemming from the reinstatement of sanctions against Iran

Key Events
Stocks in Europe followed their Asian counterparts lower during Tuesday s early trade  alongside US futures for the S P 500  the Dow and the NASDAQ 100 
Sentiment has shifted back to risk off  Economic growth  Middle East tensions and trade jitters have reignited investor worries 
While US President Donald Trump was once again in the eye of the storm on Monday  the market narrative has taken a surprising twist  Though Trump has adopted a more conciliatory stance toward China  in particular by offering a reprieve to China s ZTE  SZ 000063   which had previously faced US sanctions  US lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have criticized his apparent change of priorities  diminishing investor hopes that trade tensions would finally cool off 
However  last night the Wall Street Journal  that this reprieve might in fact be part of a quid pro quo  a way of easing  roadblocks in China faced by U S  semiconductor company Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM   whose proposed acquisition of NXP Semiconductors  NASDAQ NXPI  of the Netherlands has been held up by Beijing  
Trump s apparent diplomatic U turn went beyond our expectations that the White House would stay clear off any protectionist rhetoric in the run up to the meeting with North Korea s Supreme Leader Kim Jong un on June 12 
Global Financial Affairs
The STOXX Europe 600 slipped lower for a second day this morning  after fluctuating within a tight 0 1 percent range between the open and close in the previous three sessions  signaling that investors are struggling to gain traction in either direction  However  the continental index is inching slightly higher at the time of writing  to just above neutral levels 
Earlier in the Asian session  Japan s TOPIX ended a three day straight advance by slipping 0 5 percent  despite a 0 2 percent positive open followed by gains of 0 35 percent during early trade 
China s Shanghai Composite bucked the negative trend seen across Asian markets  boosted by optimism around the  to its equity indices of 234 China large cap A shares  The mainland benchmark index climbed 0 6 percent  closing at the top of the session and posting a total two day advance of 0 95 percent 
Upbeat sentiment overshadowed worries about China s economy and ongoing trade tensions with the US  However  investors initially shed their stocks  after China missed estimates on investment and retail sales for April and a decline in home sales exacerbated the country s murky economic outlook 
Shares listed on Hong Kong s Hang Seng missed out on investor optimism and posted a1 15 percent slump  wiping out nearly all of Monday s gains and halting a six day advance 

South Korea s KOSPI dropped 0 7 percent for a two day 0 8 percent loss  while increasing the potential of completing a small H S top since mid April  Australia s S P ASX 200 also slid 0 7 percent  almost erasing three days of gains  while forming a bearish engulfing pattern and therefore confirming two earlier consecutive shooting stars 
The downbeat mood visible in global trading today follows a markedly risk on US session yesterday that capped four days of consecutive gains for the S P 500 and a eight day winning streak for the Dow  US stock gains on Monday had been sparked by Trump s announcement that he would help ZTE get back on track after taking a hit from the recent US ban on its products 
Coming ahead of the June 12 US North Korea summit where China s leverage over Pyongyang and its potential denuclearization is crucial Trump s latest move signaled his willingness to compromise on a less pivotal element in order to win the broader geopolitical game  However  widespread criticism over the move offset its positive effects on the markets 

The dollar scaled back from an early 0 15 advance to gain less than 0 5 percent  as 10 year Treasury yields climbed above 3 percent once again as we had forecast last week 

The euro is extending losses to a second day  after yesterday s failed attempt at the 200 DMA  Single currency losses occurred against a backdrop of political uncertainty in Italy and dwindling economic growth in Germany  The latter country disappointed expectations by posting its weakest quarterly growth in a year  German GDP grew at a 0 3 percent pace half the figure of the prior quarter allegedly due to a loss of trade momentum  The slowdown in Europe s biggest economy underscores an increasingly evident trend that sees Europe as the weakest link in the synchronized global growth story in stark contrast to mid last year  when Europe replaced as the leader of global growth 

The Turkish lira hit a new low after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he intends to tighten his grip on the country s economy and take more responsibility for monetary policy if he wins presidential elections next month  The 4 1950 area is a presumed support  providing a potential entry for a USD TRY long position

104184,325699,CPB,Opening Bell  Global Stocks Whipsaw  U S  Yields Ease  Oil Above  71 ,opinion,"European stocks  US futures feel the heat after gaining traction in early trade


US shares yesterday posted worst performance in 2 weeks

US Treasury yields ease but remain above 3 percent mark

North Korea threatens to end ongoing talks with the US  reigniting investor worries


Miners outperform in Europe  oil remains high


Key Events
Equities in Europe eked out a gain in Wednesday s early trade  which was echoed by US futures on the S P 500  the Dow and the NASDAQ 100  as stock markets attempted a recovery from losses during the volatile Asian session  Yields on the 10 year Treasury are currently retreating from yesterday s spike  helping the equity market rebound  However  both European indices and US futures are flashing red at the time of writing 

The Stoxx Europe 600 opened this morning at its highest level since February 1 helped by the outperformance of miners boosting hopes that traders would finally break through the tight 0 1 percent range they ve been constrained to over the last four sessions 
The upbeat European open followed a volatile Asian session that saw most gauges slip lower  Japan s TOPIX began trade this morning in negative territory but managed to bounce back during the fourth hour with a 0 5 advance  settling at a 0 25 percent second day decline  trimming a total of 0 3 percent over the period 
China s Shanghai Composite opened 0 35 percent lower and extended the slide to 0 6 percent in the first hour of trade  From the second to the fifth hour it pared all intraday losses  but then lost ground again and closed 0 7 percent lower  wiping out most of its two day gains 
Hong Kong s Hang Seng opened 0 75 percent lower and was forced even lower  to negative 1 15 percent  during the first hour  after attempts to rebound ultimately failed  In the following three hours it turned losses into a 0 25 percent advance  but only to lose half of those gains in the fifth hour  It closed about 0 1 percent in the red 
South Korea s KOSPI fell half a percentage point during its opening hour  rebounded in the second hour    0 1   then fluctuated within a half percent range in the following five hours  It managed to end 0 05 percent higher to end a two day decline 
Australia s S P ASX 200 outperformed and had a much simpler trajectory  rising in the first three hours by 0 5 percent  only to shave gains to 0 15 percent in the second half of the session 
While the resilience posted by the KOSPI and Hang Seng is particularly surprising if we consider that the two benchmarks stand to take the hardest hit from diplomatic failures over North Korea s denuclearization  there is a method to this apparent madness  stock prices were boosted by falling FX 
An additional sign of optimistic sentiment  following a bloodbath in the US session yesterday  the small Asian losses earlier today  after which Europe opened higher  accompanied by rising US futures  no less  could signal a global rebound 
Global Financial Affairs
US equities ended a four day straight advance on Tuesday  with the S P 500 sliding 0 68 percent and dragging every sector into the red  Real Estate   1 69 percent  led the plunge  followed by Health Care   1 29 percent  and Technology    0 94 percent  
The NASDAQ Composite was the worst performer  losing 0 8 percent  followed closely by the Dow  which dropped 0 75 percent  Only the Russell 2000 managed to hold steady 

Yesterday s equity plunge  which was the heaviest in nearly two weeks  followed the strong rise of 10 year Treasury yields  once again above the key 3 percent mark  Yields registered an intraday high of 3 095 percent  scratching 3 1 percent for the first time since mid 2011  but ended at 3 07  Understandably  today s retreat from those highs helped the global equity rebound  However  we see a retrenchment of yields as a short term trend  their longer term trajectory points upward 
Moreover  the decline from yesterday s intraday high is also within a pattern of a bullish Falling Flag  on an hourly scale 
Higher yields  which underscore expectations of higher rates  is not the only factor playing on investor sentiment  Risk appetite was also dented by disappointed over a positive resolution of trade tensions between the US and China 
We predicted that US President Donald Trump and his administration would avoid stoking the fire with China in the run up to the June 12 summit with North Korea  given China s leverage Pyongyang and its nuclear plans  Trump went beyond expectations  publicizing his plans to save Chinese telecom ZTE  HK 0763  from the crippling effects of a recent US ban  Coming from the most prominent advocate of nationalism and detractor of China  this latest move alleviated a cumbersome headwind for traders  who therefore bid stocks up with a vengeance  However  a backlash from US lawmakers from both sides of the aisle reignited investor skepticism over an easy solution to the ongoing trade tussle 
But the story doesn t end there  Investors were dealt a tough blow last night when North Korea suddenly  if the US persisted with one sided demands that would set North Korea up for a political fate similar to that of Libya and Iraq 
However  the more positive market narrative  visible earlier today  underpinned investor resilience  Yet again  equity traders tend to disregard geopolitical risk  Perhaps  yields  spike yesterday  and their retreat today  is currently a stronger driver for equity performance 
The outlook for faster interest rate hikes was further boosted by upbeat US retail sales data posted yesterday  Sales rose 0 3 percent in April  matching the median forecast  after a 0 8 percent advance the previous month 
The results fuel expectations that consumer spending  one of the most crucial contributors to the US economy  is poised to rebound from its first quarter weakness  A strong job market and higher take home pay in the wake of tax reductions are buoying American purchasing power  compensating for the drag of higher fuel prices 
Bets that the Fed may raise rates three more times this year are on the increase  which in turn pushed the Dollar Index to its highest level since late December on Tuesday 
Elsewhere  Italian government bonds slumped as populist parties struggled to reach an agreement to form a new government  while notes from core European countries followed US yields higher 

In Emerging Markets  equities edged lower after dropping the most since March yesterday  currencies held on to declines after the biggest slide in a year  Emerging markets are on course to provide a downside breakout to a Descending Triangle Top  implying a double digit correction  akin to the one in late January 

Oil whipsawed wildly yesterday  a result of all the geopolitics currently dominating the commodity market narrative  However  it has been trading within a second consecutive bullish Falling Flag since the beginning of the month  to follow the Ascending Triangle between late January and mid April  An upside breakout of  72 would imply a  77 target  There are a number of fundamental reasons on the horizon that could boost oil prices as well

Global equities took a downturn in the Asian session as the 10 year Treasury yield moved past 3 1 percent  after closing above that level yesterday  for the first time since mid 2011  This multi year high signals the market expectation for rates to rise more quickly than expected namely another three times this year  As well  this outlook for higher rates makes risk assets such as equities less attractive 
Shares on China s Shanghai Composite declined for a second day  down 0 5 percent this morning  for a two day total loss of 1 2 percent  Hong Kong s Hang Seng dipped 0 4 percent  for a three day straight total loss of 1 9 percent 
South Korea s KOSPI dropped 0 45 percent  falling three days out of the past four  an cumulative decline of 1 2 percent  Australia s S P ASX 200 slipped 0 2 percent while the Aussie gained 0 15 percent
Japan s TOPIX  however  bucked the trend  It advanced 0 45 percent  even as the yen weakened by 0 15 percent  providing export sensitive local firms a stronger revenue outlook 
Global Financial Affairs
Positive momentum from yesterday s US session failed to carry through to Asia morning  The S P 500 gained 0 41 percent  bouncing off the 100 DMA  a nice recovery from Tuesday s bloodbath  The advance was led by Materials   1 19 percent   The only two sectors that closed in the red were Utilities   0 78 percent  and Real Estate   0 26 percent  
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied  up 0 25 percent  The NASDAQ Composite added 0 65 percent 

The primary focus though is on the Russell 2000  who posted a new high  the first among major US indices since late January  save for the NASDAQ Composite s mid March record  This singular achievement indicates that among the many complicated risks currently confronting markets  the most treacherous headwind for stocks right now is the escalating trade war between the US and China  the world s two largest economies  Small  domestic firms listed on the Russell are protected from the ongoing spat  allowing the index to soar to new highs  unimpeded 
Technically  the small cap index is the only one among the four majors that has been developing a bullish pattern  an ascending triangle  since the late January record  Although the breakout is still very small  an upside breakout implies a repeated move to the 11 percent late January February  downward  correction on the upside 
Most interesting to us is the juxtaposition between recent Asian sessions where advancing US yields consistently weigh on stocks  even after US investors  and markets  remain steadfast in finding reasons to remain positive 
The yield on the 10 year note renewed its upward push yesterday as industrial production signaled the US economy remains robust  Factory output rose 0 5 percent in April after a flat March  Uncertainties on the outcome of steel and aluminum tariffs were offset by solid consumer spending  After last year s corporate tax cuts  it seems business  which lagged earlier this year  is finally responding 
On the other hand  housing starts provides an alternate view of the US s economic outlook  Yesterday s release showed a 3 7 percent drop in the metric  for a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1 287 million units in April  versus the 1 310 estimated  Home building  as measured by permits took a tumble last month as well  Building permits declined  suggesting the housing market is drifting  amid shortages of land and skilled labor 
Once again  however  equity traders opted to focus on the positive economic news  bidding prices up  while ignoring the less optimistic numbers 
Still  we remain steadfast in our view that the focus should remain on bonds  Most European sovereigns followed the lead of US Treasurys  which rose last week after stronger than expected retail sales figures were released  While this clearly indicates the economic outlook is looking stronger  we re also betting investors will sell off when it becomes apparent that Fed accommodation will be tightening further 

The pound briefly rose this morning on a report that Britain might have reached an agreement on its approach toward the European customs union  but Cable tumbled after a source dismissed the news  Technically  the pound has been consolidating for an eleventh session after completing a double top 

Both WTI crude and Brent are extending their more than 3 year highs 
In the wake of the US renewing economic sanctions against Iran and threatening to levy secondary sanctions on European companies doing business with the Middle Eastern country  France s Total  NYSE TOT   one of the energy sector s seven  supermajor  oil companies  has announced it s pulling out of its deal with Iran  Other European businesses are ending agreements as well  while some are still weighing their options 
Up Ahead

US initial jobless claims are due later this morning 
Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester speaks on monetary policy at an ECB conference in Frankfurt on Friday

Walmart  NYSE WMT  is set to release its results on Thursday  before market open  for the quarter ending April The EPS estimate is  1 13  after last year s  1 00 for the same quarter  There s one key metric to focus on when the global retail giant reports

104186,325701,CPB,ANALYSIS Flu pandemic s impact seen as mixed for US stocks,news,"  Travel and leisure shares most at risk
   Healthcare  home entertainment shares could get lift
 By Lisa Baertlein and Deepa Seetharaman
 LOS ANGELES NEW YORK  Aug 30  Reuters    Investors worried
about a severe U S  swine flu outbreak this fall should
consider stocks that rise when people hunker down at home and
avoid companies that operate in crowded spaces 
 That might mean selling shares in airline  hotel and cruise
companies as well as mall based stores that sell discretionary
items  Buys may include healthcare stocks  online retailers and
companies that provide entertainment and in home comfort food 
 Retail and leisure analysts did not believe the spread of
H1N1 will be as dire as some health experts suggest  They also
said people could quickly adapt to living with the threat of
flu  particularly if the virus does not become more lethal 
 Still  a severe outbreak could set back the nascent
economic recovery and trigger an overall sell off in the U S 
stock market  analysts said 
  Most folks would agree that we re on a path to recovery  
said Deutsche Bank analyst Chris Woronka    A flu outbreak 
obviously makes the road to recovery even more difficult  
 White House advisers warned on Aug  24 that the H1N1 flu
virus  formerly known as swine flu  could infect up to half the
U S  population  leading to as many as 1 8 million
hospitalizations and 90 000 deaths    more than double the
number of fatalities seen in a typical flu season 
  Most of the market is a loser because any time you have a
pandemic  people just don t go out of the house   said Keith
Springer  president of Capital Financial Advisory Services 
 Yet the travel industry would be particularly hurt  said
Randy Bateman  chief investment officer at Huntington Funds 
  Your Deltas and your American Airlines   any company  that
hold people in a confined area   he said 
 The Arca Airline Index struggled to maintain gains for two
months after the initial flu crisis erupted in the spring  but
is now outperforming the Standard   Poor s 500 Index 
 Shares of hotelier Marriott International and cruise ship
operator Carnival Corp slumped in May due in part to the flu 
before recovering later in the summer 
 FOCUS ON HEALTHCARE
  Companies involved in making the vaccine are probably the
ones that stand to benefit the most   said David Rosenberg 
chief economist at wealth management firm Gluskin Sheff 
 Five companies are making a flu vaccine for the U S 
market  AstraZeneca s MedImmune unit  CSL Ltd  GlaxoSmithKline
Plc  Novartis AG and Sanofi Aventis SA 
 Sales of antivirals Tamiflu from Roche AG and
GlaxoSmithKline s Relenza likely would rise in a pandemic  but
potential gains may be priced in  with the Arca Pharmaceuticals
Index up 20 percent since late April 
 Sales volume in Kleenex tissue maker Kimberly Clark Corp s
healthcare business was up in the latest quarter after the flu
scare drove sales of face masks  Clorox Co s disinfecting wipes
also have been selling well 
 Other specialty paper makers also are reporting higher
flu related sales 
 Drugstore operators like Walgreen Co  CVS Caremark Corp and
Rite Aid Corp may benefit from sales of tissues 
over the counter flu remedies  prescriptions and face masks 
Walgreen aims to administer 5 million seasonal flu shots this
year  up from 1 2 million in 2008 
 CONSUMER STOCKS TO HURT
 There are hints that the U S  economy is on the mend from
the longest and deepest recession since the Great Depression 
but there are still few signs that consumer spending has
recovered  Widespread fears about getting seriously ill could
further delay a rebound in spending 
 Should there be a massive outbreak among school children 
 all that back to school buying disappears because they re at
home coughing   said Brean Murray  Carret analyst Eric Beder 
 A late fall rise in flu cases could dampen crucial holiday
sales or shift it online  benefiting names like Amazon com and
eBay Inc and hurting mall based chains such H M and Zara that
don t do Web sales 
 The recession already has driven consumers to more home
cooking and cheaper forms of entertainment  A serious flu
outbreak could amplify those trends  possibly boosting sales
for companies including Netflix Inc  an analyst said 
 Chuck E  Cheese s parent company recently said the
recession and flu fears kept people out of its kid friendly
restaurants  Hard hit U S  meat exporters remain vulnerable 
 Retailers like Wal Mart Stores Inc  which sells a range of
items  could get a boost because shoppers can make one visit
and buy enough provisions to last several weeks 
 Victor Schiller  president of Investors Observer  said he
would consider investing in Campbell Soup Co using conservative
call option techniques 
  Campbell soup is the ultimate comfort food and easy to
prepare   he said   People would be home more and turning to
that kind of food if they are sick or feeling a little low

104188,325703,CPB,High Yield Potential With Campbell Soup  Part 4 ,opinion,"Introduction
This is the fourth of what will be a long running series highlighting dividend growth stocks that have technically entered bear market territory  Many investors define a bear market as when prices fall at least 20   After coming out of the true bear market inspired by the Great Recession  stocks have generally been enjoying a very strong and long lasting bull market  Additionally  as interest rates have been in a steady freefall  high quality dividend growth stocks have become investor favorites  Consequently  high quality dividend growth stocks have for the most part become overvalued as a result 
However  this has selectively been changing as several quality dividend growth stocks have technically dropped in value by 20  or more over the last year or two  In previous articles in this series I have made the comment that this has been happening when fundamentals have really not changed very much  That comment generated some pushback from readers  Therefore  it might be fitting that I clarify my remark and perhaps put it in its proper context 
First  the fundamentals of virtually every company are constantly changing  To me this is simply another way of saying that fundamentals are dynamic  Individual companies will have good and bad quarters and good and bad years  Frankly  I have never witnessed any company that produced consistently perfect fundamental results  Therefore  what my comment was suggesting is that a moderate growing company tends to stay a moderate grower and a fast grower tends to stay a fast grower  Moreover  consistent dividend payers tend to remain consistent dividend payers  However  that does not mean to say that every company will grow at precisely the same rate every quarter or every year  nor does it say that every dividend growth stock will increase their dividend by precisely the same rate either 
Modest Variation
The point is that companies will generally maintain certain fundamental characteristics that will modestly vary from one year or one quarter to the next  but do not materially change  On the other hand  what can change dramatically over short periods of time is the valuation that the market is applying to any given stock  Consequently  valuations can become irrationally high or irrationally low when the stripes  so to speak  of the company have not materially changed  This is classically the Ben Graham metaphor   in the short run the market is a voting machine  but in the long run it s a weighing machine  
Therefore  in as plain English as I can  this series of articles has thus far been discussing dividend growth stocks where valuations have gone from irrationally high to either fair value or lower  Furthermore  in each case the primary reason is because valuations had become too high and are now moving to more rational levels  With that said  it is not uncommon to see a piece of bad or troubling news or information acting as a catalyst  However  as I have stated before  extremely overvalued stocks are vulnerable to even a hint of bad or negative information or news  Nevertheless  it is my contention that the primary factor causing the price drops of the companies covered thus far was overvaluation  Moreover  with each video I produce I will be providing what I consider clear evidence to support that contention 
Campbell Soup Is Not A Dividend Growth Stock
I have had several requests from readers to include Campbell Soup Company  NYSE CPB  in my current series on dividend growth stocks  I want to be very clear that I do not consider Campbell Soup a dividend growth stock  In addition to the reader requests  the reason I have decided to cover this company is because I believe it provides significant lessons on the importance of valuation 
Campbell Soup has paid dividends since it went public in 1954  However  it has not consistently increased its dividend  There have been numerous times when the company froze its dividend and it even cut the dividend by approximately 30  during the recession of 2001  Therefore  Campbell Soup is certainly a dividend paying stock  however  I do not consider it a dividend growth stock for the reasons cited above  On the other hand  and despite the dividend cut and the 2001 freeze  Campbell Soup s dividend has grown at an average of 3 4  since 1999  Stated more clearly  for me to classify a stock as a dividend growth stock  I need to see consistent uninterrupted dividend growth  Campbell Soup unfortunately fails that test 
Speculative Capital Gain Potential 
So far  you might conclude that I do not think Campbell Soup is currently an attractive investment  However  that assumption would be wrong  Based on an analysis of the fundamentals  I suggest that Campbell Soup is selling at a significant discount to its true worth valuation 
Said differently  I believe the market has significantly overreacted and driven the price far below reasonable or sound levels  Consequently  I believe the stock offers significant short  to intermediate term capital appreciation potential coupled with a high current yield  Much of my opinion is predicated on my belief that Campbell Soup is in no danger of not continuing as an ongoing concern  It might not grow very much  but I doubt that the company is in any danger of going out of business for a long time to come 
Morningstar s Take

Campbell has amassed a wide economic moat  resulting from both intangible assets and a cost advantage  But operating as a leading packaged food manufacturer  holding nearly 60  share of the U  S  soup aisle  Campbell is a valued partner for retailers  supporting the firm s intangible asset moat source 

Additionally  Morningstar assigns Campbell Soup a fair value of  48 50  which is significantly higher than its current  33 market value  As I note in the video below  several valuation measurements utilizing FAST Graphs would support fair value levels approximating Morningstar s calculation 
Also  as the following graphic from Campbell s website indicates  the company is more than just a soup provider  And Morningstar suggests that the company will be stepping up research and development as well as its marketing efforts going forward 

FAST Graphs Video
Although high future growth is not one of Campbell Soup s strengths  the company does possess more than adequate resources to continue as an ongoing concern  Consequently  I would argue that its current valuation represents an enticing short to intermediate term investment  However  that contention is driven more by P E ratio and price to cash flow expansion than it is on growth  The following video provides precise calculations supporting a best   worst  and most likely case scenario for the company over the next couple of years 

Summary And Conclusions
I consider Campbell Soup an extremely undervalued stock with speculative appeal  At current valuations  the company offers attractive short to intermediate term capital appreciation potential and its high current dividend yield pays you handsomely to wait  Moreover  I believe that both operating cash flow and free cash flow support a continuation of the dividend going forward 
On the other hand  I am not comfortable suggesting that Campbell Soup represents a great long term buy and hold opportunity  Nevertheless  today s low valuation might be too compelling to ignore  Finally  as always  I suggest that readers conduct their own research and due diligence and invest according to their own goals  objectives and risk tolerances

104220,325735,CPB,Lamb Weston  LW  Hits A 52 Week High  Can The Run Continue ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Lamb Weston Holdings   NYSE LW    Shares have been on the move with the stock up 14 1  over the past month  LW hit a new 52 week high of  66 75 in the previous session  Lamb Weston has gained 17 6  since the start of the year compared to the  9 4  move for the Consumer Staples sector and the  11 3  year to date return for its peer group 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises  having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on April 5  2018  Lamb Weston reported EPS of  0 91 versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 8 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 5 84  
For the current fiscal year  Lamb Weston Holdings is expected to post earnings of  2 6 per share on  3 38 billion in revenues  This represents a 12 07  change in EPS on a 6 56  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  3 03 per share on  3 57 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 16 54  and 5 62   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Lamb Weston Holdings may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for LW  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Lamb Weston Holdings has a Value Score of C  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are B and B  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of B 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 25 5X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 21 5X versus its peer group s average of 12 6X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 2 12  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective Lamb Weston Holdings Inc  Price and Consensus
    Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Lamb Weston Holdings currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2 and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Lamb Weston Holdings meets the list of requirements  Thus  it seems as though LW shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term 
How Does Lamb Weston Stack Up to the Competition 
Shares of Lamb Weston have been moving higher  and the company still appears to be a decent choice  but what about the rest of the industry  Some of its industry peers are also solid potential picks  including United Natural Foods   NASDAQ UNFI    Campbell Soup Company   NYSE CPB    and Nestle SA   OTC NSRGY    all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least  2 and a VGM Score of at least B  making them well rounded choices 
However  it is worth noting that the Zacks Industry Rank for this group is in the bottom half of the ranking  so it isn t all good news for Lamb Weston  Still  the fundamentals for LW are promising  and it still has potential despite being at a 52 week high ",2018-04-26,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/lamb-weston-lw-hits-a-52week-high-can-the-run-continue-200310119,200310119
104251,325766,CPB,Can RRPs   Solid Pricing Fuel Philip Morris  PM  Q4 Earnings ,opinion,Philip Morris International Inc    NYSE PM   is slated to release fourth quarter 2017 results on Feb 8  The question lingering in investors  minds is whether this major tobacco player will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported  Unfortunately  Phillip Morris has lagged earnings estimates in each of the past four quarters  with an average miss of 5 4  Philip Morris International Inc Price and EPS Surprise    However  the company is undertaking solid efforts to expand in the reduced risk products space  given the stringent regulations on tobacco products and consumers becoming more health conscious  Thus  let s see if the company can reverse the dismal trend this time Factors at PlayPhilip Morris has been bearing the brunt of lower cigarette volumes  which can be largely accountable to regulatory hurdles in the form of limitations on marketing  anti smoking campaigns and higher excise duties  Apart from this  rising health consciousness among consumers also resulted in lower cigarette consumption globally  Together  these factors have been weighing on cigarette industry volumes  Incidentally  Philip Morris  net revenues during third quarter 2017 were hurt by 3 6  in combustible products  Total shipment volumes in this category also fell 4 1   As a result  total cigarette and heated tobacco unit shipment volume dipped 0 5  To make matters worse  the court recently issued an order which guides cigarette companies to put up self critical advertisements circulated through television  newspapers  social media and store displays  Such headwinds plaguing the tobacco industry remain a concern for Philip Morris  combustible products category performance  Well  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter cigarette volumes is currently pegged at  207 million Reduced Risk Products   Pricing   Major Growth DriversGiven the aforementioned industry conditions  Philip Morris diverted its attention to reduced risk products  RRPs  to propel growth  Evidently  Philip Morris launched the iQOS  in 2014   a smokeless cigarette  in approximately 31 markets globally and catered to more than 3 7 million consumers globally  excluding the United States  The company expects to gain from increased volumes in reduced risk tobacco products  such as e cigarettes  HeatSticks and iQOS products  Philip Morris has also been making several investments to expand the capacity of its heated tobacco products Thanks to the growing popularity of such products  Philip Morris generated revenues worth  947 million from RRPs in third quarter 2017  up from  212 million in the year ago period  Also  revenues from RRPS  along with strong pricing more than offset soft cigarette volumes  helping Phillip Morris deliver year over year top and bottom line growth in the third quarter  While  revenues declined in Eastern Europe  the Middle East   Africa  EEMA   the same increased across Asia  and Latin America   Canada   largely fueled by greater revenues from RRPs  The consensus mark for net sales in Asia and Latin America   Canada is  6 648 million and  2 662 million  up from  5 517 million and  2 571 million  respectively In fact  the company s overall sales have been rising annually for more than a year now on the back of such efforts  Also  Phillip Morris enjoys a strong pricing power  which helps it maintain margins at the desired level  Though industry headwinds and unfavorable currency fluctuations remain the major killjoys for Phillip Morris  we expect the aforementioned growth initiatives to continue driving the company in the quarter to be reported Q4 Estimates as a WholeThe current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at  1 36  which represents nearly 24  growth from the year ago period  This estimate has remained stable over the last 30 days  Moreover  analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of  8 372 million  up 20 1  from the year ago quarter What the Zacks Model UnveilsTo top it  our proven model shows that Philip Morrisis likely to beat bottom line

preference toward natural and organic ingredients over packaged and processed food Business in North America WeakThe North America business accounts for about 68  of Kellogg s total revenues  Hence it is evident that the revenue generated from this segment largely impacts the overall revenues of the company  The segment is further categorized into U S  Morning Foods  U S  Snacks  U S  Specialty and North America Other In the prior quarter  Kellogg s total North America sales declined 1 6  year over year to  2 18 billion  owing to the exit from its U S  Snacks segment s Direct Store Delivery  DSD

expected to continue in the to be reported quarter  Overall  for the fourth quarter  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for North America segment revenues is pegged at  2 06 billion  implying a 3 2  decline North America Business by SegmentU S  Morning Foods   Kellogg s mainstay U S  cereal business  which accounts for 40 45  of sales  has been performing poorly for quite some time now  Lower demand for cereals due to competitive pressure from other breakfast alternatives  including yogurt  eggs  bread and peanut butter  has been hurting category growth  In the prior quarter  revenues slipped 3  and declined 5 3  in the first nine months  The trend is expected to persist in the to be reported quarter  with revenues likely to decline 3 4  per the consensus estimate U S  Snacks  This business has been struggling since 2013 due to weak volumes  In the prior quarter  sales declined 4 5  from the year ago level due to reduced merchandising and SKU rationalization  Also  in the first nine months of 2017  the segment s net sales dropped 3 6  year over year  The trend is expected to continue in the to be reported quarter with revenues likely to decline 8 1  per the consensus estimate U S  Specialty  This segment s sales rose 1 9  in the prior quarter  marking the ninth straight quarter of sales growth  given strength in the convenience and foodservice channels  such as K 12 schools  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for U S  Specialty segment revenues is pegged at  286 million  implying a 1 1  increase North America Other  Segmental revenues grew 4 4  in the prior quarter on contribution from frozen foods  The trend is expected to continue in the to be reported quarter with revenues likely to increase 3 2  per the consensus estimate Overall Earnings   Revenue ExpectationsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues of  3 11 billion indicates a 0 4  uptick on a year over year basis  In the first nine months of 2017  net sales declined 2   down 3 4  organically  with volumes down 4 1  as a result of soft consumption trends across most categories during the period Kellogg Company Revenue  TTM      Nonetheless  given the tepid sales growth  the company is making aggressive efforts toward improving its food offerings  The company is investing in brand building  in store capabilities along with product and packaging innovation  Also  revenues are expected to benefit from Pringles  improved performance in Europe  the Parati acquisition in Brazil  better shipments and improvement in pricing and mix in Mexico and Australia Earnings increased

missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and declined year over year  This marks the third consecutive quarter of negative earnings surprise with fourth straight revenue miss Per management  the underperformance was due to a volatile operating environment along with intense competition and fast evolving retail landscape  These have been pressuring the company s top line for a while now Consequently  shares of the company are down 8 8  in the pre market trading  owing to dismal first quarter results and unimpressive outlook for fiscal 2018  Overall  Campbell s shares have lost 7 5  in the last three months  wider than the  s decline of 2 2  Q1 HighlightsAdjusted earnings of 92 cents per share dropped 8  year over year and lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 97 cents  Including one time items  Campbell reported earnings of 91 cents per share that decreased 3  from the year ago quarter Net sales of  2 161 million slipped 1 9  and also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 179 6 million  mainly owing to soft organic sales  Organic sales dipped 2  on account of lower volumes  mainly in the Americas Simple Meals and Beverages segment Further  the company s adjusted gross margin contracted 2 1 percentage points to 36 5   The decline was mainly due to cost inflation  escalated supply chain expenses and adverse mix  somewhat negated by productivity improvements as well as gains from cost savings Moreover  adjusted EBIT for the quarter fell 14  to  417 million owing to lower gross margin  soft sales and increased adjusted administrative costs  partly compensated with lower marketing and selling costs  Campbell Soup Company Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    Segment AnalysisThe Latin America business is supervised as part of the Global Biscuits and Snacks segment starting from fiscal 2018  Earlier  this formed part of the Americas Simple Meals and Beverages segment Campbell reports its results under three segments  namely  Americas Simple Meals and Beverages  Global Biscuits and Snacks  and Campbell Fresh Americas Simple Meals and Beverages  In first quarter fiscal 2018  sales at the division dipped 5  year over year to  1 218 million  on account of softness in V8 beverages and soup sales  Sales for the U S  soup dropped 9  owing to a drop in condensed soups  broth as well as ready to serve soups  This was somewhat offset by benefits from Prego pasta sauces   Global Biscuits and Snacks  Sales at this division rose 3  at  709 million  Excluding the impact of currency tailwinds  sales grew 2  backed by Pepperidge Farm snacks strength  representing growth in Goldfish crackers and Pepperidge Farm cookies Campbell Fresh  Sales at this segment remained flat at  234 million on the back of greater Garden Fresh Gourmet sales  Bolthouse Farms salad dressings along with strength across carrot ingredients  This was partially offset by soft carrot sales  Also  sales of Bolthouse Farms refrigerated beverages remained

carrot sales and beverage products  Its solid focus on cost savings and core strategic imperatives are likely to drive growth in the long term Management updated its outlook for fiscal 2018  Given a

Campbell s fourth quarter revenues fell by 1  from the year ago period to  1 664 billion  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 689 billion  The company also failed to meet our earnings estimates  posting earnings of  0 52 a share against the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 55 
The canned soup giant s full year sales dipped by 1  to  7 890 billion  based mostly on an overall drop in organic sales due to lower volume and greater promotional spending  Campbell s now projects that full year revenues could fall by as much as 2  next year 
 The operating environment for the packaged foods industry remains challenging due to shifting demographics  changing consumer preferences for food  the adoption of new shopping behaviors and the dynamic retailer landscape   Campbell s President and CEO Denise Morrison said in a statement   In these times  sales growth remains a challenge  
The CEO noted that drastically changing consumer shopping trends have greatly impacted the company s non refrigerated canned and bottled goods sales  which are now seemingly outdated  Morrison also pointed to the rise of self cooking delivery companies  such as Blue Apron  APRN   as well as an increase of private label brands  as major reasons for Campbell s poor sales 
Campbell s biggest business sector  its soup and juice division  saw its sales sink 3  in its fourth quarter  Sales of its packaged snack segment  including Pepperidge Farm and Goldfish  were flat  On the bright side  Campbell s Bolthouse Farms fresh food sector experienced a 1  gain 
Still  Thursday s report marked Campbell s of falling sales  Campbell s stock tanked by over 7  and touched a new two year intraday trading low of  46 43 a share

 Right now  the retailers  they re doing better in this round of the fight   Warren Buffett said in a recent interview with CNBC

104436,325951,CPB,Can Campbell s  CPB  Growth Efforts Lift Its Performance ,opinion,"Like other manufacturers and marketers of convenience food products  Campbell Soup Company s   NYSE CPB   top line was dented by the changing preferences of consumers  Apart from tough macroeconomic conditions the company s C Fresh division has long been troubled by the Bolthouse Farms product recall 
This was witnessed in the third quarter of fiscal 2017  wherein Campbell succumbed to both earnings and sales miss  In addition to missing estimates  earnings and sales also fell year over year   Read More    
We observed that Campbell s shares have slipped 4 1  in the last one year  underperforming the Zacks categorized  industry s decline of 1 1  in the same period  These factors have compelled Campbell to tweak its fiscal 2017 sales view  Consequently  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal has trended downwards 

Nevertheless  this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company has been striving to revive sales through their stringent cost savings plan that had been announced in fiscal 2015  It anticipates cost savings worth  450 million by fiscal 2020 end  In this regard  Campbell generated savings of  20 million in the third quarter  which fared better than management s expectations  Confidence in the cost saving program led the company to raise the lower end of its EPS and EBIT views 
Further in an attempt to achieve profitable and sustainable growth the company has been undertaking efforts such as increased level of transparency in food manufacturing  portfolio diversification  advertising via mobile and digital devices  and globally strengthen the presence of its snacks brands  In line with such growth initiatives the company has recently invested  10 million in Chef d  an online meal store  The investment is expected to enhance Campbell s e commerce and data analytics business models 
All said investors need to wait and watch if Campbell s growth moves aid in improving its top line performance  amidst the tough consumer landscape

104438,325953,CPB,Campbell Down 10  In A Month  Can It Overcome Industry Woes ,opinion,Campbell Soup Company   NYSE CPB   has been losing investors  confidence of late   Shares of this premium food products provider have plunged 10 3  in the last one month  compared with the Zacks categorized  industry s drop of 5 4   The company has been bearing the brunt of a challenging macroeconomic scenario in the food industry  which was also the primary reason behind its dismal third quarter fiscal 2017 performance that was reported little over a month back Nevertheless  this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company has been striving to revive performance through its focus on strategic imperatives and robust cost savings plan Stock Falls Prey to Industry HeadwindsThe food industry business has been grappling with headwinds like food deflation  stiff competition  and aggressive promotional environment of late  Traditional grocery rivals are strengthening their franchises and outside players are offering alternative outlets for food and other staples  Ranked among the bottom 39  of over 250 Zacks industries  the Food   Miscellaneous Diversified industry has also lagged the broader market over the last one month  This is evident from the chart below While food and beverage is one of the most attractive and largely profitable markets in the world  it remains vulnerable to alterations in consumers  tastes and preferences  worldwide demographic changes and the adverse effect of technological advancements  Unfortunately  Campbell fell prey to these headwinds that plagued the industry in the third quarter The industry was troubled by a general softness in the consumption patterns  Notably  consumer spending grew at its lowest rate in about eight years  during Campbell s last reported quarter  This largely hampered the company s top line  Moreover  results were marred by continued competition from the rising e Commerce trends   a major retail hurdle that is expected to linger and pressurize grocery and mass networks Dismal Q3 Hurts the StockThe aforementioned obstacles and lingering softness in Campbell Fresh  C Fresh  division  weighed upon the company s third quarter fiscal 2017 performance  Both the top and bottom line declined year over year  alongside missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate  As mentioned above  results were also hurt by continued softness in C Fresh  which stemmed from lingering constraints from the Bolthouse Farms Protein PLUS drinks recall made in Jun 2016  While the company has been undertaking various initiatives to revive C Fresh s performance  management continues to expect capacity constraints through the final quarter  which we believe is likely to hurt the overall top line Given these factors  and a tough operating environment  management lowered its fiscal 2017 sales outlook  anticipating sales growth to range from negative 1  to flat  compared to the old forecast of flat to a 1  increase  Since the outcome  Campbell s shares have tumbled 7 1  on the index  Campbell Soup Company Price and Consensus     Can the Growth Strategies Provide Respite Talking of strategic imperatives  Campbell is on track with its four key plans aimed to achieve profitable and sustainable growth  The company intends to raise its level of transparency about the food that it produces and the ingredients used  Next  with respect to portfolio diversification  Campbell aims to focus on packaged fresh innovation  alongside enhancing organic and clean label product portfolio in center store  The company revealed plans to particularly invest in Campbell Fresh products  Thirdly  the company s shift toward advertising via mobile and digital devices highlights its focus on development of digital and e Commerce capacities  Finally  Campbell unveiled intentions to strengthen the presence of its growing snacks brands across geographies  mainly in the Asian region Moving to cost savings  Campbell is progressing well with its plan  which was announced in fiscal 2015  The company s strategy of concentrating on supply chain efficiencies  along with curtailing costs and reinvesting part of these savings in areas with high growth potential is likely to drive growth  Gaining from the solid progress on this front  the company anticipates cost savings worth  450 million by fiscal 2020 end  In this regard  Campbell generated savings of  20 million in the third quarter  which fared better than management s expectations  Also  this took the company s total savings to  295 million  as of May 19  Despite an overall drab quarter and curtailed sales view  management raised the lower end of its EPS and EBIT projections for fiscal 2017  reflecting confidence in its ongoing cost savings program We believe that all these factors  along with focus on achieving growth via acquisitions and introduction of innovative products  reflect Campbell s commitment toward establishing a differentiated and significant position in the consumers  community and the food industry  So  let s see if these solid growth strategies can boost the company s performance and help its stock revive 3 Key Picks in Campbell s

104439,325954,CPB,Can Pacific Foods  Takeover Drive Campbell s  CPB  Top Line ,opinion,Food products behemoth  Campbell Soup Company   NYSE CPB   has been undertaking several steps to diversify its portfolio and expand in the fast growing organic space  These endeavors became more prominent yesterday  when Campbell announced its contract to acquire leading organic broth and soup producer  Pacific Foods for  700 million in cash Well  Campbell Soup is striving to revive its top line  which hasn t witnessed a single year over year improvement for quite some time now Owing to waning sales the company underperformed the Zacks categorized  industry  in the last one year  Evidently  Campbell s shares have plunged 21 5  in the last one year  as compared with the industry s decline of 10 3  As Campbell is renowned for its canned foods  much of its sales debacle could be attributable to consumers  changing eating patterns and their evolving preferences for healthy  fresh and organic food products  Incidentally  the organic food space that surged at a compound annual growth rate of 15 3  in the last four years  has become an over  11 billion category in the country  Amid such a scenario  the buyout of the aforementioned organic foods company is deemed fit Deal with Pacific Foods Bodes Well Pacific Foods is a Tualatin  OR based company  which was founded almost three decades back  Apart from manufacturing organic broth and soup  the company also produces shelf stable plant based beverages and other meals and sides  With roughly 540 employees  Pacific Foods runs an authorized organic plant  where its namesake goods are manufactured Pacific Foods is a leading name in the natural foods space  with solid growth record and trailing 12 month sales of roughly  218 million  as of May 31  The company s organic credentials make it popular among consumers  which is likely to help Campbell deliver products as per the changing consumer needs  Further  Pacific Food s CEO   Chuck Eggert   will continue to supply the main ingredients for its products from his personal farms    Pacific Foods will form part of Campbell Americas Simple Meals and Beverages segment  joining its namesake brand and other existing brands like V8  Swanson  Prego  Pace and Plum Organics  Sales at this segment dipped 2  year over year  in the last reported third quarter of fiscal 2017  This was accountable to softness in V8 beverages and soup sales  somewhat compensated by strength noted in Prego pasta sauces  Nevertheless  the segment contributed 53  to net sales in the quarter  which underscores its importance  The addition of Pacific Foods to this division is likely to be a perfect fit for Campbell The conclusion of this deal remains subject to regulatory clearance  Also  management at Campbell doesn t expect any impact on its bottom line from this buyout in the first year  barring several expenses related to the purchase and integration of Pacific Foods Focus on Strategic Imperatives   BuyoutsClearly  this acquisition goes in line with Campbell s strategic imperatives  as part of which it had revealed plans to raise its level of transparency about the food that it produces and the ingredients used  Furthermore  with respect to portfolio diversification  Campbell decided to focus on packaged fresh innovation  alongside enhancing organic and clean label product portfolio in center store Also  this will mark the company s fifth buyout in the last five years  The company remains committed to achieving growth through acquisitions  Incidentally  Campbell purchased Bolthouse Farms in 2012  after which it acquired organic baby food firm Plum and biscuit firm Kelsen  in 2013  Finally  in 2015  the company added fresh salsa and hummus maker Garden Fresh Gourmet to its kitty  Both  Bolthouse Farms and Garden Fresh form part of the Campbell Fresh  C Fresh  segment Bottom LineWith both the companies working around the real food philosophy  Pacific Foods  buyout is likely to accelerate Campbell s efforts to undertake innovations in the health and well being space  This  in turn should expand Campbell s organic food customer base and network  which we believe should boost the top line of this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock Key Picks  Some better ranked stocks worth considering in the same space include Nomad Foods Limited   NYSE NOMD    SunOpta  Inc

The company s shares are seen to be loosing investor s confidence which is evident from its 14 2  decline over the last six months  underperforming the Zacks categorized  industry that fell 5 2  
Let s now look deeper into some of the aspects that have been pulling down Campbell Soup in the recent times 
Lower Sales at Campbell Fresh 
Sales at Campbell Fresh  C Fresh  division dropped 6  year over year in the third quarter of fiscal 2017  The lingering constraints related to the Bolthouse Farms Protein PLUS drinks recall  in Jun 2016  were largely accountable for the disappointing performance of the C Fresh division  Moreover  the management of Campbell Soup expects capacity constrains to continue through the final quarter  which we believe is likely to hurt the overall top line 

Consumer Shifts Impact Revenue
The food and beverage industry  being one of the most attractive is extremely prone to changing consumers  tastes and preferences owing to seismic and other shifts  Unfortunately  Campbell Soup succumbed to such industry headwinds in the third quarter of fiscal 2017  Consumer spending grew at its lowest rate  in about eight years  which considerably hampered the company s top line  Moreover  results were marred by rigorous competition from rising e Commerce trends  which is a major retail hurdle  is expected to linger and pressurize grocery and mass networks 
Outlook   Estimates Moving South  
Given a soft third quarter and the tough operating environment  management lowered its fiscal 2017 sales outlook  anticipating sales growth to range between negative 1  to flat  compared with the old forecast of flat to a 1  increase  Consequently  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal has trended downwards 
Strategic Initiatives to Revive Performance  
Nevertheless  Campbell Soup is progressing with its cost savings plan  which generated better than expected results in the third quarter  This also caused management to raise the lower end of its EPS and EBIT views for fiscal 2017  Also  the company is on track with its strategic growth initiatives  as is evident from its focus on acquisitions aimed at strengthening its brand portfolio  The recent acquisition of Pacific Foods is one such strategic endeavor 
With strong initiatives in place  all we can do is hope that Campbell Soup would soon revive its performance  Moreover  the company carries a  of  B  
Given the pros and cons embedded in the stock  Campbell Soup currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  hold

information on several attributes associated with food like ingredients  nutritional value and calories  Thus  partnership with Sage will enhance Campbell s food transparency to its customers  Notably  Campbell is also on track to bring its real food philosophy to its soups category  and achieve significant results by the end of this year  In fact  it s Well Yes  Soup will mark the company s first product on Sage s platform Robust Digital Endeavors Bode WellAmazon com  Inc  s   NASDAQ AMZN   takeover of Whole Foods Market  Inc    NASDAQ WFM   is testimony to the fact that e Commerce has gained significant ground in the food industry  That said  Campbell is on track to strengthen its digital operations  Incidentally  the company announced plans to build an e Commerce unit in North America  which will represent Campbell s all three segments  Management appointed Shakeel Farooque to lead this e Commerce team and anticipates delivering online sales of roughly  300 million in the next five years  Farooque s past experience with behemoths like Amazon  eBay Inc    NASDAQ EBAY   and Kohl s Corporation   NYSE KSS   is likely to benefit Campbell  given his combined knowledge of consumers and technology  Well  Campbell s focus on e Commerce is also evident from its recently announced  10 million investment in online meal kit firm  Chef d Adding Organic Foods to Portfolio Should Lure ConsumersThe organic food space that surged at a compound annual growth rate of 15 3  in the last four years has become an over  11 billion category in the country  This is mainly due to consumers  evolving preferences for healthy  fresh and organic food products  Thus  Campbell has been undertaking several steps to diversify its portfolio and expand in the fast growing organic space  In this regard  the company recently announced plans to acquire leading organic broth and soup producer  Pacific Foods  This marked the company s fifth buyout in the last five years  Other buyouts in this connection include Bolthouse Farms  Plums Organics and Garden Fresh Gourmet  Thanks to these buyouts  the company s organic kitty currently ranks among the top 10 in the industry  Also  annual fresh products sales have reached approximately  1 billion  reflecting prospects of this category Concentration on Growing Snacks UnitWith the growing demand for snacks  Campbell plans to undertake significant expansion at its Global Biscuits and Snacks  segment  in fiscal 2018  The company plans to solidify this segment s footprint geographically  and also go beyond its existing biscuits and bakes snack items  The company plans to prepare snacks using real food ingredients  which is also in sync with its first strategy  Also  the company plans to introduce soups  small meals and fresh snacks  which are expected to augment overall sales by about  200 million in the next five years We believe that these strategies reflect Campbell s commitment toward establishing a differentiated and significant position with the consumers  community and in the food industry  In addition to elaborating on its strategic imperatives  management reaffirmed its fiscal 2017 and long term goals  while it provided an update on its cost savings and cash flow targets for the fiscal Fiscal 2017   Long Term OutlookManagement anticipates sales growth for fiscal 2017 to range from negative 1  to flat  Adjusted EBIT is expected to rise 2 4  year over year  while gross margin is anticipated to be 38   Adjusted earnings for the fiscal are envisioned to grow in the range of 3 5  to  3 04  3 09 per share  Coming to cash flows from operations  Campbell expects generating roughly  1 25 billion this fiscal  Also  the company plans to achieve cost savings worth  310 million by the end of fiscal 2017 Moving to the long term  management still projects organic sales growth in a range of 1 3   Further  adjusted EBIT growth is envisioned in a band of 4  6  and adjusted EPS is expected to grow 5 7  over the long term  both on a constant currency basis   Finally  the company continues to project cost savings from its ongoing initiatives to be around  450 million  roughly 6  of sales  by the end of fiscal 2020  Management plans to issue its fiscal 2018 outlook  along with its fourth quarter fiscal 2017 results that are scheduled for Aug 31 3 Top Picks to Ride the Hottest Tech TrendZacks just

104442,325957,CPB,Will Soft Top Line Trends Hurt Campbell s  CPB  Q4 Earnings ,opinion,Campbell Soup Company   NYSE CPB   is slated to release fourth quarter fiscal 2017 results on Aug 31  The question lingering in investors  minds is whether this convenience foods behemoth will be able to post a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported  Campbell reported negative earnings surprise of 7 8  in the last quarter and has a mixed record of earnings surprises in preceding quarters  So  let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement Campbell Soup Company Price and EPS Surprise    What to Expect The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 55 cents  compared with 46 cents reported in the year ago period  We note that the Zacks Consensus estimate has remained stable over the last 30 days  Further  analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of roughly  1 7 billion  up marginally from the year ago quarter Factors at PlayCampbell Soup has been struggling to revive its top line  which hasn t witnessed a single year over year improvement for quite some time now  This has also caused the company s shares to decline 10 7  so far this year  compared with the  s 6 1  drop Incidentally  the company s results declined year over year and also lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last quarter  Management cited that the tough macroeconomic scenario in the food industry  wherein sales remained generally soft due to lower consumption led to the dismal quarter  In fact  consumer spending grew at its lowest rate  in about eight years   which considerably hampered the top line  Also  results were marred by continued competition from the rising eCommerce trends   a major retail hurdle that is expected to linger and pressurize grocery and mass networks Apart from this  persistent weakness across the Campbell Fresh  C Fresh  division has long been a deterrent  In this regard  the company has been undertaking various initiatives to revive C Fresh s performance  While these efforts are likely to help the segment recover  management continues to expect capacity constraints through the final quarter  which we believe is likely to hurt the overall top line  Given a soft quarter and the tough operating environment  management lowered its fiscal 2017 sales outlook  anticipating sales growth to range from negative 1  to flat  compared to the old forecast of flat to a 1  increase Nevertheless  the company is on track with its four core plans  including focus on real food philosophy and transparency  undertaking robust digital endeavors  adding organic foods to portfolio and concentrating on growing its snacks unit  Moreover  Campbell s strategy of concentrating on supply chain efficiencies  along with cutting costs is likely to drive growth  The company has generated solid results from its three year cost savings program  which led management to raise the lower end of its EPS and EBIT views for fiscal 2017  Adjusted earnings for the fiscal are envisioned to grow in the range of 3 5  to  3 04  3 09 per share  whereas Adjusted EBIT is expected to rise 2 4  year over year  However  we cannot ignore the aforementioned obstacles and thus prefer remaining on the sidelines for the time being What the Zacks Model Unveils Our proven model does not conclusively show that Campbellis likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our While Campbell has an Earnings ESP of  0 79   the company currently carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   Note that we caution against Sell rated stocks   4 or 5  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions  The combination of Campbell s unfavorable Zacks Rank and positive Earnings ESP makes surprise prediction difficult Stocks with Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings

104443,325958,CPB,Campbell  CPB  Misses On Q4 Earnings   Sales  Stock Loses 5 ,opinion,Campbell Soup Company   NYSE CPB   posted fourth quarter fiscal 2017 results  wherein both earnings and sales came below the Zacks Consensus Estimate  with sales marking its third straight miss  Management blamed the murky quarter on a difficult scenario in the packaged food industry  where sales remained soft due to consumers changing food preferences  evolving shopping trends and a tough retail environment Nevertheless  the company s stringent focus on cost savings initiates fueled year over year growth in the bottom line as well as adjusted EBIT  However  the lower than expected results and not so encouraging outlook for fiscal 2018 sent shares of the company down by nearly 5  in the pre market trading session  While Campbell has lost 10 7  in a year  it has fared better than the  s 12 4  decline Q4 in DetailsAdjusted earnings of 52 cents per share jumped 13  year over year  though it fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 55 cents  Including one time items  Campbell reported earnings of  1 04 per share  against a loss of 26 cents recorded in the year ago quarter  Campbell Soup Company Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    Net sales of  1 664 million slipped 1  and also lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 689 million  mainly owing to soft organic sales  Organic sales dipped 1  on account of lower volumes Nonetheless  the company s adjusted gross margin grew 80 basis points to 36 9   thus reverting to its expansion trend after last quarter s downside  The gross margin growth was mainly accountable to productivity enhancements and benefits from cost curtailing efforts  somewhat negated by cost inflation and escalated supply chain expenses Moreover  adjusted EBIT for the quarter advanced 11  to  282 million  thanks to reduced marketing and selling costs  and improved gross margin  This was somewhat marred by soft sales Segment AnalysisCampbell reports its results under three segments  namely  Americas Simple Meals and Beverages  Global Biscuits and Snacks  and Campbell Fresh Americas Simple Meals and Beverages  In fourth quarter fiscal 2017  sales at the division dipped 3  year over year to  815 million  on account of softness in V8 beverages and soup sales  During the quarter  sales for U S  soup dropped 4   on account of a drop in broth  ready to serve soups and condensed soups    Global Biscuits and Snacks  Sales at this division remained flat at  624 million  as Pepperidge Farm snacks strength across Australia was countered by weakness in Indonesia Campbell Fresh  Sales at this segment climbed 1  to  225 million on the back of greater Garden Fresh Gourmet sales  along with strength across carrots and carrot ingredients  This was partially offset by soft sales of Bolthouse Farms refrigerated beverages  which continued being hurt by supply constraints FinancialsCampbell ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of  319 million  long term debt of  2 499 million and total shareholders  equity of  1 645 million  Further  the company generated  1 291 million as cash flow from operations during fiscal 2017 Fiscal 2018 OutlookManagement remains impressed with some key achievements of fiscal 2017  These include raising the company s multi year cost savings goal to  450 million by 2020  The company also anticipates significant gains from its pending buyout of Pacific Foods  Finally  Campbell remains focused on getting its C Fresh division back to growth path  by solving the problems related to capacity constraints  With solid focus on cost savings and its core strategic imperatives  Campbell remains well placed for long term growth However  given a tough operating environment  management expects sales growth for fiscal 2018 to range from negative 2  to flat  Adjusted EBIT growth is anticipated in a range of negative 1  to 1  increase  Adjusted earnings per share growth is envisioned in the range of flat to 2  rise  to  3 04  3 11  The current Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged way higher at  3 21 Currency headwinds are expected to have a nominal impact on the company s fiscal

Additionally  the estimates have been moving south over the past 60 days  The Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 07 for fiscal 2017 and  3 24 for fiscal 2018 declined 3 cents and 2 cents  respectively  Also  management s adjusted earnings projection for fiscal 2017 are likely to grow in the range of 2 5  to  3 00  3 09 per share Moreover  the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 64 cents for the fiscal third quarter has decreased by 3 cents in the said time period  Also  the current estimate for the said quarter is down nearly 1 5  from the prior year quarter   Campbell s top line has missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in seven of the trailing eight quarters  In fact  in the fiscal second quarter  sales fell year over year mainly due to weakness across Campbell Fresh and V8 beverages  along with soft organic sales  The performance of the Campbell Fresh division has been disappointing of late because of weak carrot sales and lingering effect of the Bolthouse Farms product recall  In the quarter  sales at this division dropped 8  year over year  Moving ahead  management expects growth at Campbell Fresh division to remain sluggish Despite top line weakness  management at Campbell is striving hard to bring itself back on the growth trajectory  The company has undertaken strategic plans such as cost saving measures  enhancement of its brand portfolio and other initiatives to achieve profitable growth We note that Campbell remains on track with its cost savings plan  which is running ahead of schedule  Currently  management anticipates achieving its savings target of  300 million by the end of fiscal 2017  thereby marking a year in advance  In addition  the company raised its cost savings target from  300 million by fiscal 2018 end to  450 million by fiscal 2020 end  Moreover  the company s strategy of concentrating on supply chain efficiencies  along with curtailing costs and reinvesting part of these savings in areas with high growth potential is likely to drive growth Evidently  Campbell s four point strategy proves that it remains focused on achieving profitable and sustainable growth  These strategies aim at raising the level of transparency about the food that it produces and the ingredients used  portfolio diversification  shift toward advertising via mobile and digital devices and strengthening the presence of its snacks brands across geographies  particularly in Asia  Further  the company is also undertaking acquisitions and joint ventures in a bid to enhance its brand portfolio

104490,326005,CPB,Can Campbell  CPB  Q3 Earnings Sustain A Solid Surprise Trend ,opinion,"Campbell Soup Company   NYSE CPB   is scheduled to release third quarter fiscal 2017 results on May 19  The big question facing investors is whether this food products company will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported Campbell Soup has delivered back to back positive earnings surprises in the last two quarters  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter and fiscal 2017 has been stable over the last 30 days  However  the current Zacks Consensus Estimate of 64 cents per share for the third quarter reflects a year over year decline of 1 5   Nonetheless  analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of  1 9 billion  almost in line with the year ago quarter  Factors Influencing this QuarterCampbell Soup s shares have gained 5 1  in the last six months  outperforming the Zacks categorized  industry s growth of 2 3  

This could be attributable to the company s impressive growth efforts and robust cost savings  which helped it to top earnings estimates in the last two quarters  Notably  Campbell is ahead of schedule with its cost savings plan  which not only continued driving its gross margin expansion  but also encouraged management to raise its savings target  These factors  along with Campbell s prudent investment and strategic efforts toward product innovation and brand building  bode well for the upcoming results However  the performance of the company s Campbell Fresh  C  Fresh  division has been disappointing of late  This is mainly accountable to weak carrot sales and constraints arising from the Bolthouse Farms Protein PLUS drinks recall made in Jun 2016  Though the company has appointed a new management team for this segment  as part of its various initiatives to revive C Fresh s performance  it still expects recovery at the segment to be slower than anticipated 
In fact  it doesn t expect this segment to witness growth this fiscal year  which remains a major threat to the company s overall top line  Nonetheless  solid momentum across its core U S  soup business  new product launches and solid strategies led management to retain its fiscal 2017 view Given such mixed factors  let s wait and see if Campbell can manage to maintain its positive earnings streak this time around Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Campbell Soup to beat estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  This is not the case here  as you will see below Zacks ESP  Campbell Soup currently has an Earnings ESP of 0 00   This is because both  the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 64 cents  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Zacks Rank  Campbell Soup s Zacks Rank  3 increases the predictive power of ESP  However  the company s ESP of 0 00  makes surprise prediction difficult We caution against Sell rated stocks   4 or 5  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings EstimatesHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat Wal Mart Stores  Inc    NYSE WMT    scheduled to release earnings on May 18  currently has an Earnings ESP of  1 04  and a Zacks Rank  3 Lowe s Companies  Inc    NYSE LOW    slated to release earnings on May 24  currently has an Earnings ESP of  0 94  and a Zacks Rank  3 Best Buy Co   Inc    NYSE BBY    slated to release earnings on May 25  currently has an Earnings ESP of  10 00  and a Zacks Rank  2  You can see  5 Trades Could Profit  Big League  from Trump PoliciesIf the stocks above spark your interest  wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington s changing course Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals  tariffs  lower taxes  higher interest rates  and spending surges in defense and infrastructure ",2017-05-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-campbell-(cpb)-q3-earnings-sustain-a-solid-surprise-trend-200189290,200189290
104491,326006,CPB,Campbell  CPB  Stock Down On Drab Q3 Earnings  Sales View ,opinion,After back to back positive earnings surprises in the last two quarters  Campbell Soup Company   NYSE CPB   delivered a miss in third quarter fiscal 2017  Both earnings and sales declined year over year and lagged estimates Management blamed the murky quarter on the tough macroeconomic scenario in the food industry  where sales remained generally soft due to lower consumption  In fact  management stated that consumer spending grew at its lowest rate  in about eight years   which considerably hampered the top line  Though sales rebounded in March and April  the softness in February could not be compensated The disappointing quarter and current industry trends also compelled Campbell Soup to curtail its fiscal 2017 sales outlook  However  it raised the lower end of its earnings and EBIT outlook  reflecting confidence in the ongoing cost savings program  However  following a disappointing quarter  shares of the company declined 5 6  in the pre market trading session  Moreover  Campbell has lost 4 7  on a year to date basis  underperforming the Zacks categorized  industry s loss of 0 9  Q3 in DetailsAdjusted earnings of 59 cents per share dropped 9  year over year  falling short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 64 cents  Including one time items  Campbell s earnings fell 2  to 58 cents in the quarter  Net sales of  1 853 million slipped 1  and also lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 870 million  mainly owing to soft organic sales  Organic sales dipped 1  on account of greater promotional spending  whereas volumes remained flat  Further  weak organic sales across the Americas Simple Meals and Beverages and Campbell Fresh segments could only be partly compensated by improved results at the company s Global Biscuits and Snacks segment Further  the company s adjusted gross margin contracted 40 basis points to 36 6  in the reported quarter  thus crushing the gross margin expansion trend  The downside was mainly due to increased promotional expenditure  cost inflation and escalated supply chain expenses  somewhat offset by productivity enhancements and benefits from cost curtailing efforts Moreover  adjusted EBIT for the quarter declined 2  to  305 million  owing to soft sales and gross margin contraction  partly negated by reduced marketing and selling costs Segment AnalysisCampbell reports its results under three segments  namely  Americas Simple Meals and Beverages  Global Biscuits and Snacks  and Campbell Fresh Americas Simple Meals and Beverages  In

Stocks finished with triple digit gains but well off session highs as news headlines once again rattled traders  The Dow gave back more than 50 points and the S P 500 saw gains cut in half following an afternoon news dump  The Washington Post is reporting that a current White House official is a significant person of interest in the law enforcement investigation 
Separately the New York Times reported that Trump told Russian officials at the White House that firing FBI Director James Comey relieved  great pressure  from an ongoing probe into Russia and the election  The Times report cited a document summarizing the meeting 
Trump is on the first leg of a ten day overseas trip that starts in Saudi Arabia  then moves to Israel  the Vatican  Brussels  for a NATO summit   and then Sicily for a G7 summit  The Trump administration planned to announce  110 billion in sales of advanced military equipment and training in Saudi Arabia this weekend 
Despite the firing of James Comey  and a general sense from the mainstream media that the Trump White House is in disarray  and the lowest public approval ratings since the inauguration  Wall Street continues to trade near record highs  For the week  the Dow and S P dropped 0 4 percent and NASDAQ was down 0 6 percent 
The dollar index lost 1 6 percent in the five days  the worst week since July 2016  Gold  capped its best week in a month  The yield on 10 Year Treasuries climbed less than one basis point to 2 23 percent  after rising as much as three basis points earlier in the session  It fell nine basis points this week

OPEC and other producers including Russia are scheduled to meet on May 25  They are expected to extend output cuts of 1 8 million barrels a day until the end of March 2018  U S  crude production has climbed 10 percent since mid 2016 to 9 3 million barrels per day as shale producers have taken advantage of higher prices to boost activity 
Iran holds its first round of presidential elections this weekend  If President Hassan Rouhani remains in office  it should encourage Western investment and boost Iranian oil production  If the winner is Ebrahim Raisi  a critic of Iran s nuclear deal with the West  then it is possible that new sanctions could be imposed  which could reduce the oil supply from Iran 
After two weeks chock full of   largely disappointing Wall Street and missing analysts  expectations  the S P 500 s Retail ETF  XRT  finished the week down about 3 5   Leading the declines were names like Ascena Retail Group  NASDAQ ASNA   Foot Locker  NYSE FL   American Eagle  NYSE AEO  and Sears  NASDAQ SHLD  
Ascena  the parent of clothing companies such as Ann Taylor and dressbarn  saw its shares plunge more than 30 percent earlier in the week  after it adjusted its second half outlook to reflect worse than expected business conditions  Meanwhile  Foot Locker s same store sales fell short of expectations 
Off price retailer TJX  NYSE TJX   which operates T J  Maxx  Marshalls and HomeGoods stores  was expected to be an upbeat outlier for the week  but even its first quarter comparable sales couldn t match Street estimates  Gap  NYSE GPS  reported a surprise rise in quarterly same store sales  bucking the trend of dismal results in the U S  retail industry  as the company benefited from the robust performance at its Old Navy brand

While farmers in South America have been complaining about low prices  they have enjoyed big gains in corn and soybean output 
 released explosive plea bargain testimony today accusing President Michel Temer  along with former presidents Lula da Silva and Dilma Rousseff  of receiving millions in bribes  The testimony raises serious doubts about whether Temer  who replaced the impeached Rousseff last year  can maintain his grip on the presidency 
The testimony implicates both ruling and opposition parties and indicates that Temer  a conservative  accepted  4 6 million in bribes from JBS  which ranks as the world s largest meat processor  It also alleges that Lula  who is already facing five corruption trials  received  50 million in bribes in offshore accounts from JBS  while Rousseff took  30 million in bribes 
Temer said he would not resign from the presidency  The Supreme Court released an audio tape of Temer  approving the payment of hush money to former lower house speaker Eduardo Cunha  who last year orchestrated Rousseff s impeachment and was later convicted for corruption 
Many politicians fear that if Cunha should turn state s witness  his testimony could implicate scores of congressmen and members of the executive branch 
About 37 000 AT T  NYSE T  workers  or less than 14 percent of the company s total workforce  began a three day strike after failing to reach an agreement with the No  2 U S  wireless carrier over new contracts  This is the first time that AT T wireless workers are on strike  which could result in closed retail stores during the weekend 
The workers on strike are members of the CWA Communications Workers of America union  The workers are demanding wage increases that cover rising healthcare costs  job security against outsourcing  affordable healthcare and a fair scheduling policy 
Slightly over half of the workers on strike are part of the wireless segment and the rest wireline workers  including a small number of DirecTV technicians 
Fiat Chrysler  NYSE FCAU  plans to update software that it expects will resolve the concerns of U S  regulators about excess emissions in 104 000 older diesels  The software update would begin rolling out once the Environmental Protection Agency and California Air Resources Board approved 
In January  the EPA and California accused Fiat Chrysler of illegally using undisclosed software to allow excess diesel emissions in 104 000 U S  2014 2016 Jeep Grand Cherokees and Dodge Ram 1500 trucks in a notice of violation 
The Environmental Protection Agency and California Air Resources Board announced approval of a fix for about 84 000 older Volkswagen  DE VOWG p  diesel vehicles that can emit excess emissions  Volkswagen agreed last year to offer to buy back up to 475 000 2 0 liter diesel vehicles that had been sold in the United States or offer fixes if regulators approved 
Friday s announcement covers a fix for 84 000 2012 2014 Passat diesel vehicles with automatic transmissions  A fix for vehicles with manual transmissions has not yet been approved  In January  regulators approved a fix for 67 000 2015 model diesels  leaving around 325 000 older vehicles still awaiting approval for a fix 
The federal government has  in recent years  paid debt collectors close to  1 billion annually to help distressed borrowers climb out of default and scrounge up regular monthly payments  New government figures suggest much of that money may have been wasted 
Nearly half of defaulted student loan borrowers who worked with debt collectors to return to good standing on their loans defaulted again within three years  according to an analysis by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau  For their work  debt collectors receive up to  1 710 in payment from the Department of Education each time a borrower makes good on soured debt through a process known as rehabilitation 
They keep those funds even if borrowers subsequently default again  What constitutes rehabilitation  Nine months of on time payments  even if the borrower only pays  5 a month  That means that in many cases  the government pays  38 to collect one dollar  The department has earmarked more than  4 2 billion for payments to its debt collectors since the start of the 2013 fiscal year 
Seven years into an economic recovery  nearly half of Americans didn t have enough cash available to cover a  400 emergency  That s according to the latest findings from the Federal Reserve s annual economic well being of U S  households  which found 44  in 2016 said such an expense would have to be covered by borrowing or selling something 
That s a similar percentage to what was found in past Fed surveys  Of the group that can t pay in cash  45  would use a credit card to pay off the expense over time  about a quarter would borrow from friends of family  another 27  just couldn t pay the expense and smaller fractions would turn to selling items or using a payday loan 
We now know where all the money is hiding  Retirees who are usually expected to spend that hard earned nest egg are instead cutting their spending and living frugally  according to a University of Michigan survey analyzed by software company United Income  The median retiree spends 8 percent less than they comfortably could afford  the result  retirees now hold assets totaling more than  25 trillion 
Spending money  besides being a boost for the economy  could help retirees be more active  if they physically get out of the house to do it  Meanwhile  younger Americans  whose incomes are falling behind those of previous generations  aren t saving enough 
So  the moral of the story is get out and spend some money this weekend  you might feel younger ",2017-05-21,Marvin Clark,https://www.investing.com/analysis/go-placidly-200190376,200190376

104534,326049,CPB,Simpson Manufacturing  Acadia Healthcare  Hormel Foods And Campbell Soup Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day ,opinion,"For Immediate Release

	Chicago  IL   November 22  2016    highlights Simpson Manufacturing  NYSE     as the Bull of the Day and Acadia Healthcare  Nasdaq     as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Hormel Foods Corporation  NYSE HRL   NYSE    and Campbell Soup Company  NYSE CPB   NYSE     

	Here is a synopsis of all four stocks 

  

	Thanks to ongoing speculation over a coming construction and building boom  a number of big name stocks in these markets have been soaring since the election  Double digit percentage moves aren t uncommon in this sector  and there definitely seems to be potential for more gains here as well 

	However  while many investors have focused on the big  brand name companies in this market  there are several small caps that could be well positioned too  Take Simpson Manufacturing      for example  This  2 2 billion maker of construction products has been on the move since the election  and it could be poised for more gains in the near term as well  at least if we look to some recent earnings estimates on the stock 

Recent Estimates

	Analysts have been sharply increasing their expectations for Simpson earnings  including a move in the consensus from 33 cents per share 30 days ago to 40 cents per share today  an increase of over 21   The full year estimate and the next year estimate have also increased in the past month  moving higher by about 7  each 

	Thanks to these moves  the company is now expected to see double digit earnings growth for this year and the next  including a nearly 37  rate of earnings growth for this year  And considering there has been complete agreement among analysts about the short and long term nature of the company no analysts have reduced their earnings estimates in the past sixty days for any of the periods we study it is hard not to be a believer in the company right now 

Earnings History

	But sometimes  companies seem to have difficulty in living up to lofty expectations like this  as these can be too high for some stocks  leading to poor performances  That really hasn t been the case for SSD in the past though  as the company clearly knows how to manage earnings expectations 

	SSD has seen an average earnings surprise of about 18 8  over the last four quarters  and it hasn t missed estimates in the last year either  No wonder the stock is a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   and why we are looking for more outperformance from this company in the near term 

  

	While the surprise election of Donald Trump rocked a number of market sectors  few were hit as hard as the hospital health facility market  That is largely because a Republican clean sweep this year arguably puts the Affordable Care Act also known as Obamacare  on the chopping block  something that could undo years of gains for the hospital health facility market in particular 

	Why this area  Well  these companies have benefited tremendously from the ACA  as it has put millions of new insurance covered customers in their systems  boosting profits in the process  And with this likely taken away in the near future  it could be a very rough period for this space  And while most investors have been focused on HCA Holdings as the poster child for this new world  those looking for a more promising short candidate might want to go beyond the traditional hospital space and investigate Acadia Healthcare      instead 

ACHC in Focus

	Acadia  an operator of behavioral health services and facilities across the nation  and now with a UK presence as well   saw its share price peak long before the prospect of Trump winning the election was on anyone s mind  in August of 2015  Since then  shares have been on a sharp downward trajectory  with prices falling by more than 25  in the past three months alone 

	And while shares have actually done reasonably well since the election  the outlook for the sector at large remains poor  while there are still plenty of concerns over ACHC s health in the near term  As evidence for this  consider some of the recent earnings estimates for ACHC stock 

Recent Estimates

	Analyst opinion of the stock s earnings potential in recent weeks has gone almost straight down  and now the company is expected to see earnings contract year over year for the current quarter  The full year and next figures are arguably even worse  as we have seen seven analyst estimates go lower in the past thirty days for the full year  and then nine estimates go lower for the next year time frame too 

	The impact of these analyst revisions has pushed the consensus estimate down by about 20  in the past few months for the current quarter  and then down 8 7  for the full year and down 13 9  for the following full year  Add in a so so history in recent earnings reports and it becomes a rough outlook for the company in the near term 

	But that isn t all  as the company is actually in an industry that is in the bottom 10  overall  without a single company that is ranked as a  buy  or  strong buy  right now  No wonder shares of ACHC have a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  and why we are looking for more underperformance from the company in the weeks ahead

Food Stocks Reporting Earnings Tuesday  Nov  22nd

	The third quarter earnings season is in its last leg  with 470 S P 500 companies having already reported results as of Nov 17  We notice that results in the third quarter have improved remarkably from the preceding quarters  In fact  this is expected to be the first quarter to display bottom line growth after five consecutive seasons of earnings decline for the benchmark index 

Food Stocks  Safe Investment Bets

	U S  based food stocks are considered to be the safest investment bets at the moment  This is because these stocks are the least impacted by any sort of global macroeconomic turbulence 

	Improved job data and robust wage rates have driven demand for edible products in the U S  Apart from strong domestic demand  food stocks are likely to perform well on the back of new product launches and productive marketing programs 

Zacks Guidance

	According to the Zacks Industry classification  food stocks are broadly grouped under Consumer Staples  one of the 16 Zacks sectors 

	Here we briefly discuss the broader sectors  earnings trend so far in the July September quarter of 2016 

	Our latest  article  released on Nov 17  2016  reveals that roughly 87 5  of the Consumer Staples stocks in the S P 500 Group that have reported results for the July September quarter recorded 6 2  rise in earnings on 1 5  increase in revenues  both on a year over year basis  We believe that earnings of

	Consumer Staples stocks in the S P 500 Index will increase 6 6  year over year  while revenues are expected to inch up 1 1  from the prior year period 

What s in Store for These Two Food Stocks 

Hormel Foods Corporation      is slated to report fourth quarter fiscal 2016  ended Oct 31  2016  results before the opening bell on Nov 22  The company s average positive earnings surprise over the trailing four quarters is 9 05  

	Our proven model shows that Hormel Foods is likely beat earnings in the quarter  This is because the stock has the right combination of two key ingredients 

	Hormel Foods has an  of  6 52   as the Most Accurate estimate of 49 cents is above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 46 cents  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  

   

	Hormel Foods has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see   

	Conversely  we caution against stocks with Zacks Ranks  4 and  5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions 

	Higher demand for value added products  in both food service and retail channels  and the company s strategic marketing programs are expected to drive the better than expected earnings in the fiscal fourth quarter   Read more    

Campbell Soup Company      is set to report first quarter fiscal 2017  ended Oct 31  2016  results before the opening bell on Nov 22  The company s average positive earnings surprise over the last four quarters is 4 25  

	Our proven model does not conclusively show that Campbell Soup will beat estimates in the quarter  This is because the company has an Earnings ESP of 0 00   as the Most Accurate estimate is in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 95 cents   which complicates surprise prediction in spite of the company s favorable Zacks Rank  3  Hold  

   

	Meaningful product portfolio expansion and strategic cost cutting measures are expected to boost results in the quarter to be reported  However  headwinds like adverse foreign currency translation might limit growth   Read more

202 million were almost in line with both the year ago figure as well as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Benefits from favorable currency movements were offset by soft organic sales Organic sales dipped 1  on account of soft Campbell Fresh performance  somewhat compensated by strength noted in the Global Biscuits and Snacks segment Further  the company s adjusted gross margin expanded 120 basis points to 39 1  in the reported quarter  thus reverting to its gross margin expansion trend  The upside was mainly backed by improved margins in Americas Simple Meals and Beverages segment  Further  margin gained from productivity enhancements and benefits from cost curtailing efforts  partly negated by cost inflation and escalated carrot and beverage supply chain expenses at the Campbell Fresh segment Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes  EBIT  for the quarter inched up 1  to  486 million  thanks to improved gross margin and reduced administrative costs  somewhat offset by greater marketing and selling costs Segment AnalysisAs part of the efforts to align its business structure with its strategy  the company had realigned its business segments  with effect from the first

Beverages  In first quarter fiscal 2017  sales at the division were flat year over year at  1 297 million  Benefits from increased sales of Plum products were offset by a fall in V8 beverages  During

Sales at the division rose 3  to  671 million  On a currency neutral basis  sales for the segment inched up 1   backed by improvements in Pepperidge Farm products Campbell Fresh  Sales at this segment declined 6  year over year to  234 million  accountable to soft sales of carrots and Bolthouse Farms refrigerated beverages  Further  sales at the segment were hampered by persistent supply constraints related to the voluntary recall of Bolthouse Farms Protein PLUS drinks  which occurred in Jun 2016  CAMPBELL SOUP Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise     FinancialsCampbell ended the quarter

management remains focused on getting its Bolthouse Farms Protein PLUS drinks capacity on track  alongside striving to get old carrot consumers back by enhancing product quality  Given the endeavors

104538,326053,CPB,6 Great Dividend Growth Stocks For Higher Returns,opinion,"Though rising yields have dampened the appeal for dividend investing  a niche corner of this space is still in vogue  This is none other than the dividend growth strategy  Stocks with a strong history of dividend growth year over year form a healthy portfolio with greater scope of capital appreciation as opposed to simple dividend paying stocks or those that pays high yields Inside Dividend Growth StrategyDividend growth stocks generally act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as these belong to mature companies  which are less susceptible to large swings in the market while simultaneously offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts Additionally  these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term  These include a sustainable business model  a long track of profitability  rising cash flows  good liquidity  strong balance sheet and some value characteristics  Further  a history of strong dividend growth indicates that a future hike is likely  which makes the portfolio safer Although these stocks do not necessarily have the highest yields  they have outperformed for a longer period than the broader stock market or any other dividend paying stock Here are the screening parameters that could result in a winning dividend growth portfolio 5 Year Historical Dividend Growth greater than zero  This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history 5 Year Historical Sales Growth greater than zero  This represents stocks with a strong record of growing revenue 5 Year Historical EPS Growth greater than zero  This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history Next 3 5 Year EPS Growth Rate greater than zero  This represents the rate at which a company s earnings are expected to grow  Improving earnings should help companies to sustain dividend payments Price Cash Flow less than M Industry  A ratio less than M industry indicates that the stock is undervalued in that industry and that an investor needs to pay less for a better cash flow generated by the company 52 Week

104583,326098,CPB,Campbell  CPB  Misses On Q4 Earnings   Sales  Stock Down  ,opinion,After either meeting or beating estimates for a decade  Campbell Soup Company   NYSE CPB   succumbed to an earnings miss in fourth quarter fiscal 2016  Moreover  results declined year over year with the top line lagging estimates as well  Clearly  this instilled a negative sentiment among investors as shares of the company dropped 4 8  in the pre market trading session following the earnings announcement Adjusted earnings of 46 cents per share fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 50 cents and also dropped 6  from the prior year quarter figure CAMPBELL SOUP Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    Net sales of  1 687 million lagged both the year ago figure and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 693 million by 0 4   Benefits from the Garden Fresh buyout were more than offset by adverse currency movements and weak organic sales Organic sales dipped 1  on account of soft Campbell Fresh performance that in turned was a result of a fall in carrot and carrot ingredients coupled with the voluntary recall of Bolthouse Farms Protein PLUS drinks Further  the company s adjusted gross margin contracted 80 basis points  bps  to 32 4  in the reported quarter  thus breaking its five quarter long record of posting adjusted gross margin expansion  Factors that weighed upon gross margin were higher promotional expenditure  inflation  the impact of Bolthouse Farms product recall  greater carrot costs  somewhat compensated by productivity enhancements Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes  EBIT  for the quarter declined 2  to  253 million  owing to dismal gross margin  greater advertising and consumer promotion  partly offset by lower administrative costs Segment AnalysisAs part of the efforts to align its business structure with its strategy  the company had realigned its business segments  with effect from the first quarter of fiscal 2016  Campbell now reports its results under three segments  namely Americas Simple Meals and Beverages  Global Biscuits and Snacks  and Campbell Fresh Americas Simple Meals and Beverages  In the fiscal fourth quarter  sales at the division were flat year over year at  842 million  Benefits from increased sales of Plum and Prego pasta sauces were offset by a fall in V8 beverages and soup  During the quarter  sales for U S  soup fell 2  due to declines in ready to serve soups  somewhat compensated by an improvement in broth  Global Biscuits and Snacks  Sales at the division rose 1  to  622 million  On a currency neutral basis  sales for the segment inched up 2   backed by improvements in Pepperidge Farm Goldfish crackers and Arnott s biscuits Campbell Fresh  Sales at this segment declined 5  year over year to  223 million  Excluding the acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet  segment sales plunged 12   accountable to soft sales of carrot and carrot ingredients and Bolthouse Farms premium refrigerated beverages  This was somewhat compensated by strength noted in fresh soup and Bolthouse Farms salad dressings Fiscal 2016  At a GlanceCampbell s adjusted earnings for fiscal 2016 increased 11  year over year to  2 94 per share  However  the figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 97  Net sales of  7 961 million dropped 1  from fiscal 2015  while it exceeded our estimate of  7 952 million FinancialsCampbell ended the year with cash and cash equivalents of  296 million  long term debt of  2 141 million  and total shareholders  equity of  1 533 million  Further  the company generated  1 463 million as cash flow from operations during fiscal 2016 Despite being disappointed with its Campbell Fresh performance  management intends to bring the same on the right track to drive long term profitability  Also  it remains on track to boost its top line in fiscal 2017  Given these factors  the confidence in the company s long term potential and its solid fiscal 2016 profit performance  management announced a 12  hike in its quarterly dividend from 31 2 cents to 35 cents per share  This will be payable on Oct 31  2016  to shareholders on record as of Oct 12 Fiscal 2017 OutlookFurther  the company anticipates sales

104585,326100,CPB,Campbell Soup  CPB   Moving Average Crossover Alert,opinion,"Campbell Soup Company   NYSE CPB   could be a stock to avoid from a technical perspective  as the firm is seeing unfavorable trends on the moving average crossover front  Recently  the 50 Day Moving Average for CPB broke out below the 200 Day Simple Moving Average  suggesting short term bearishness 
This has already started to take place  as the stock has moved lower by 9 5  in the past four weeks  And with the recent moving average crossover  investors have to think that more unfavorable trading is ahead for CPB stock 
If that wasn t enough  Campbell Soup isn t looking too great from an earnings estimate revision perspective either  It appears as though many analysts have been reducing their earnings expectations for the stock lately  which is usually not a good sign of things to come 
Consider that in the last 30 days  8 estimates have been reduced  while none have moved higher  Add this in to a similar move lower in the consensus estimate  and there is plenty of reason to be bearish here 
That is why we currently have a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  on this stock and are looking for it to underperform in the weeks ahead  So either avoid this stock or consider jumping ship until the estimates and technical factors turn around for CPB

Food beverage stocks are particularly doing well this earnings season  Leading firms from the industry like Pinnacle Foods  Inc    NYSE PF    The J M  Smucker Company   NYSE SJM   and Sysco Corp    NYSE SYY   have delivered better than expected earnings in their recently reported quarters despite currency headwinds and the sluggishness in emerging markets 
We believe that strong brand portfolio  continuous innovation  cost savings initiatives and acquisitions have cushioned these companies against headwinds  and are expected to remain their strengths 
Let s see what awaits these three food stocks  which are scheduled to release their quarterly numbers early next week 
Tyson Foods  Inc    NYSE TSN   is slated to report fourth quarter fiscal 2016 results on Nov 21  before the market opens  Last quarter  this producer  distributor and marketer of chicken  beef  pork and prepared foods posted a positive earnings surprise of 13 08   It has delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 12 24  in the trailing four quarters 
The company has an  of  4 03  as the Most Accurate estimate of  1 19 is below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 24  It has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see 
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Tyson Foods is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  1  2  Buy  or 3 for this to happen  The company s Zacks Rank  3 increases the predictive power of ESP  However  we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Tyson Foods  processed food business has been showcasing a decent performance  Further  the Hillshire Brands packaged foods buyout and healthy liquidity impart strength to the stock  However  the sluggish beef segment remains a concern  Moreover  macroeconomic headwinds have been weighing upon its performance to an extent   Read    TYSON FOODS A Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
    Hormel Foods Corporation   NYSE HRL    one of the leading manufacturers and marketers of various meat and food products in the U S  and international markets  is expected to release fourth quarter fiscal 2016 results on Nov 22  before the market opens  The company currently has an Earnings ESP of  6 67  and a Zacks Rank  3 
This favorable combination makes the stock an attractive investment option  In addition  the stock promises a solid return of 20 1  on equity and 18 9  on investments  These prospects are again supported by the company s efforts to improve its products 
Last quarter  this meat company posted a positive earnings surprise of 5 88   In fact  it has delivered positive earnings surprises in all the past four quarters  translating to an average positive surprise of 9 05  HORMEL FOODS CP Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
    Campbell Soup Company   NYSE CPB   is slated to report first quarter fiscal 2017 results on Nov 22  before the market opens  Last quarter  the company posted a negative earnings surprise of 8   However  it has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 4 3  in the trailing four quarters 
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Campbell is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter  The company carries a Zacks Rank  3  which increases the predictive power of ESP  However  its ESP of 0 00  makes surprise prediction difficult  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first quarter earnings is pegged at 95 cents 
Campbell s exposure to the international markets keeps it prone to currency fluctuations  Though management expects this headwind to have a nominal impact on the company s fiscal 2017 performance  it still remains a hurdle  Nevertheless  Campbell s focus on its strategic initiatives like portfolio reorganization and cost cutting efforts can help it overcome these obstacles   Read   CAMPBELL SOUP Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

104629,326144,CPB,What s In Store For Mondelez  MDLZ  In Q2 Earnings ,opinion,"Mondelez International  Inc    NASDAQ MDLZ   is slated to report its second quarter 2016 results on Jul 27  before the opening bell  Last quarter  the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 20 0  
The global snacks company outpaced earnings estimates in three of the last four quarters with an average surprise of 10 52  MONDELEZ INTL Price and EPS Surprise
   Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement 
Factors at Play
Mondelez  volumes have been affected since 2014 by the elasticity impact from higher pricing and category weakness because of soft consumer demand  Moreover  the company generates around 80  of its sales from international markets  which exposes it to considerable currency related headwinds 
Nonetheless  Mondelez s organic sales trends have been improving since 2015  The improvement came on the back of marketing support funded by cost savings from the  3 5 billion restructuring plan  The savings are being used to fund marketing investments and capacity expansion to accelerate top line and gain market share 
In the first quarter  improved organic growth in developed markets like Europe and North America counterbalanced slower growth in emerging markets  Sales trends in emerging markets were impacted by softening category growth and elasticity impact from higher pricing  We expect the trend to continue in the second quarter as well 
Moreover  margins have remained consistently strong driven by cost savings and productivity gains  However  the second quarter is typically a low margin quarter  given seasonally lower revenues  Additionally  the first quarter benefited from the favorable timing of some overhead spending  which will reverse in the second quarter  thereby straining profits 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Mondelez is likely to beat earnings this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here  as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP for Mondelez is 0 00  as both the Most Accurate estimate as well as the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 40 cents 
Zacks Rank  Mondelez s Zacks Rank  3 increases the predictive power of ESP  However  we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings beat 
We caution against Sell rated stocks  Zacks Rank  4 or 5  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions

104630,326145,CPB,Campbell  CPB  Chalks Out Strategic Plans  Updates Outlook,opinion,Campbell Soup Company   NYSE CPB   made a number of announcements yesterday  which included its revised sales view for fiscal 2016  an update on its fiscal 2017 outlook  cost saving efforts and long term goals  and its four key strategic plans  Before delving into the company s strategic imperatives  let s take a look at its future views and targets Future ViewsFiscal 2016   Firstly  the company cut its fiscal 2016 sales outlook  to account for the latest recall of Campbell s Bolthouse Farms protein drinks and the unfavorable shift of a major carrot consumer to a twin source setup  Hence  management now anticipates net sales growth for the fiscal in a range of  2  to  1   down from the previous guidance of  1  to flat  The updated view also includes a nearly 1 point positive impact from the Garden Fresh buyout  along with the adverse effect of currency movements  to an extent of about 2 points While the sales outlook was trimmed  the company reiterated its earnings before interest and taxes  EBIT  and earnings per share  EPS  outlook  Management continues to project EBIT and EPS growth in a band of 11  13  each  with EPS envisioned between  2 93 and  3 00  for fiscal 2016 Further  the company is on track with its supply chain productivity plan  along with its other cost saving initiatives that are expected to generate annualized savings of roughly  300 million by fiscal 2018  Additionally  Campbell projects cash flow from operations in fiscal 2016 to be approximately  1 3 billion Fiscal 2017   Long term Targets   Backed by these solid cost savings and productivity gains that are anticipated to counter inflation  Campbell expects adjusted gross margin to climb marginally in fiscal 2017  While the company projects cost of products sold  COPS  inflation of about 2   it remains on track to achieve supply chain productivity benefits amounting to 3  of the COPS Moreover  management expects to procure additional savings worth  50 million in fiscal 2017  alongside making incremental share buybacks  only after meeting expenses related to other external developments for the future  Nonetheless  the company will offer a detailed financial view for fiscal 2017 with its fourth quarter fiscal 2016 earnings results  slated to release on Sep 1  2016 Backed by these solid growth plans and the impressive strategies discussed below  the company reaffirmed its long term organic sales and earnings goals  Organic sales are expected to rise in a range of 1  3  in the long term  whereas currency neutral EBIT and adjusted EPS are envisioned to jump 4  6  and 5  7   respectively      Four Core StrategiesThe company outlined four strategies  directed toward solidifying consumers  faith by increasing transparency  maintaining focus on diversifying its portfolio  developing digital capacities and expanding in developing markets Campbell intends to raise its level of transparency about the food that it produces and the ingredients used  Per its latest food philosophy  the company aims to use familiar and pleasing ingredients from plants or animals  and prepare the food products through safe means  In this regard  the company also came up with a scorecard known as Campbell s Real Food Index  This is designed to trace the progress on its ingredient commitments  which include plans to eradicate synthetic flavors and colors from its North American products  by 2018 end   and plans to use antibiotic free chicken  to be executed in the next few years  With respect to portfolio diversification  Campbell aims to focus on packaged fresh innovation  alongside enhancing organic and clean label product portfolio in center store  The company revealed plans to particularly invest in Campbell Fresh products  and remain on track with its new speedy innovations  an evidence of which was the introduction of Bolthouse Farms Plant Protein Milk Moving to the development of digital and eCommerce capacities  the company s shift toward advertising via mobile and digital devices is well evident from the fact that so far in fiscal 2016  around 40  of its advertising money was incurred on digital  compared with 19  in fiscal 2015  Finally  Campbell unveiled intentions to strengthen the presence of its growing snacks brands across geographies  mainly in the Asian region  The company plans to boost the penetration of its major brands like Goldfish  Kjeldsens and Tim Tam in their home countries  alongside extending them to new markets  It also intends to extend its Pepperidge Farm premium breads and rolls to new West Coast markets Campbell has been focused on achieving profitable and sustainable growth for more than five years now  by leveraging its robust strategic plans and constant moves to enhance consumer experience  We believe that these aforementioned strategies reflect the Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company s commitment toward establishing a differentiated and significant position in the consumers  community and the food industry   CAMPBELL SOUP Price    Stocks to ConsiderBetter ranked stocks worth considering in the same industry

104631,326146,CPB,Is Mondelez International s  MDLZ  Stock A Good Investment ,opinion,"We issued an updated research report on Mondelez International  Inc    NASDAQ MDLZ   on Aug 17  2016 
On Apr 27  Mondelez reported mixed second quarter 2016 results  Mondelez beat second quarter estimates for earnings  but missed the same for sales  Adjusted earnings of 44 cents per share grew 4 5  as cost savings and higher non operating gains mitigated dilution from the coffee divesture and soft sales 
Organic revenues inched up 1 5   less than 2 1  recorded in the last quarter owing to weak global category growth and disappointing market share performance  While emerging markets growth remained weak  sales trends slowed down fairly in North America due to aggressive trade spending by some competitors 
The macroeconomic environment remains challenging in the emerging markets  The emerging markets are experiencing softening category growth and elasticity impact from higher pricing 
Volume mix declined 0 1  in the second quarter due to elasticity impact from higher pricing  challenging category trends and increased competitive pressures 
The company reduced its organic revenue growth guidance moderately due to increasing global category challenges  Organic net revenue is estimated to increase approximately 2  in 2016 compared to previous expectations of growing at least 2    MONDELEZ INTL Price
 

   Notably  Mondelez s volumes have been falling since 2014 due to volume erosion caused by significant pricing actions and category weakness because of lower demand The company s key category   snacks   has slowed down on account of soft global retail and consumer demand 
Mondelez  like many other U S  food producers such as General Mills  Inc    NYSE GIS    Campbell Soup Co    NYSE CPB   and The Kraft Heinz Co    NASDAQ KHC    has struggled due to shifting consumer preference toward natural and organic ingredients over packaged and processed food  This has had an adverse effect on the top line of these companies 
Furthermore  with 80  of its sales coming from international markets  currency is a significant top line headwind  We believe that difficult macro conditions in emerging markets will continue to weigh on category and revenue growth this year 
Despite weak sales  Mondelez  margins have remained persistently strong backed by cost savings and productivity gains  The savings from the  3 5 billion restructuring plan is consistently enhancing margins  The program is accelerating supply chain cost savings and reducing overhead costs through layoffs  asset disposals and implementation of a zero based budgeting system  ZBB  to neutralize commodity and currency driven inflation 
The savings from the program is also funding growth initiatives  like streamlining infrastructure and internal processes  Mondelez hired consultant firm  Accenture  to help it implement the ZBB  which has already started yielding positive results 
The re structuring program is anticipated to generate annualized savings of at least  1 5 billion by 2018  By 2018  operating margins are expected to approach 17 18   an improvement of 400 bps from the 2015 levels 
The savings from the program are being used to fund marketing investments and capacity expansion to accelerate the top line growth and gain market share
However  Mondelez needs to show some considerable volume improvement to attract investor attention

CEO Comments
Denise Morrison  Campbell s President and Chief Executive Officer  said 

Despite what continues to be a very challenging consumer environment  Campbell remains focused on becoming a leaner  more effective and efficient company  We re unsatisfied with our third quarter organic sales growth  which was largely due to a weaker U S  soup season  some challenges in V8 beverages and a weather related disruption to our fresh carrot supply  Importantly  we understand the factors affecting our top line performance and are addressing them  Year to date organic sales are down slightly  We expect organic sales to grow in the fourth quarter and next fiscal year  behind more robust innovation and marketing  Third quarter adjusted EBIT declined  but was better than expected  Our year to date adjusted EBIT increase of 15 percent reflects our improved gross margin performance and the benefits of our three year cost savings program and organization redesign  Today we updated our guidance  raising our outlook for adjusted EPS  We continue to stay focused on driving sustainable  profitable net sales growth and creating shareholder value

104671,326186,CPB,Kellogg Forms Venture Arm To Invest In Emerging Businesses,opinion,"Kellogg Company   NYSE K   is establishing a venture capital fund that will take minority stakes in new emerging businesses in consumer oriented categories  The venture arm  called eighteen94 capital  1894   will also invest in start ups pioneering new ingredients  food products  packaging and game changing technology to help support their growth
The fund plans to invest approximately  100 million in growing businesses in Kellogg s core categories   cereals and snacks    as well as adjacent categories  The investments will be important to Kellogg s 2020 growth plans PEPSICO INC Price
   Kellogg s mainstay U S  cereal business  which accounts for 40 45  of its sales  has been performing poorly since 2012 due to sluggish category growth  Lower demand for cereals due to competitive pressures from other breakfast alternatives including yogurt  eggs  bread and peanut butter has been hurting the category growth  Moreover  changing consumer views on health and wellness with a shift in consumer attitude from dieting to health and wellness has hurt the sales of Kellogg s weight management cereal brands  like Special K and Kashi 
The company is trying to revamp this segment through brand building  in store capabilities and product and packaging innovation as well as reformulating many existing products The investments are being funded by cost savings from its re structuring program  Project K 
Amid the struggling cereal sales  the venture arm can support growth by investing in newer growth food categories  Consumers now prefer food with more nutritional benefits  such as protein  gluten free choices and with simpler ingredient lists 
Kellogg s executive for 10 years  Simon Burton  will be the managing director of 1894  Kellogg has also formed a partnership with Touchdown Ventures to assist in the fund management

104712,326227,CPB,United Natural  UNFI  Completes Haddon House Acquisition,opinion,"United Natural Foods  Inc   NASDAQ UNFI   has completed the acquisition of Haddon House Food Products  Inc   which was announced in late February 
The company has acquired all the outstanding shares of Haddon House and some affiliated entities apart from some real estate  Haddon is a distributor and merchandiser of natural and organic and gourmet ethnic products throughout Eastern United States 
The acquisition was funded with borrowings under the company s revolving credit facility  The final purchase price was subject to a customary post closing net working capital adjustment 
With this buyout  the company will gain greater operating scale and resources to further develop its product and service offerings 
As a result of the deal closure  Haddon will operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of United Natural  However  it would continue to function as Haddon House Food Products  Inc   which was established in 1960 by the Anderson family  The transaction is expected to be accretive to the company s earnings in fiscal 2017 
United Natural has been pursuing acquisitions over the years to grow its distribution network  customer base and boost long term growth 
Last month  this specialty foods distributor announced the acquisition of all the outstanding shares of Nor Cal Produce  Inc  and an affiliated entity as well as certain real estate  for approximately  68 6 million  Nor Cal is a family owned and operated distributor of conventional and organic produce and other fresh products in Northern California  with primary operations located in West Sacramento  CA 
The acquisition will provide United Natural a national presence and would help expand its existing produce operations  The transaction is expected to be accretive to the company s earnings in fiscal 2017 
The acquisition of Tony s Fine Foods  in Jul 2014   a specialty distributor of perishable food products  helped the company expand both its high growth perishable product offerings as well as distribution footprint in western U S  The company s revenues in 2015 benefited significantly from the buyout 
Its major acquisition was that of Minnesota based Trudeau Foods in Sep 2013  Trudeau Foods is a distributor of specialty perishables and dry products  The acquisition helped the company to enter the markets of Minnesota  North Dakota  Wisconsin and Michigan s Upper Peninsula 
Though encouraged by acquisitions and consumers  increasing demand for organic products  driven by a healthy lifestyle  food safety and environmental sustainability  we cannot ignore the fact that the company has been struggling due to persistently weak gross margin over the past few quarters  This is due to a shift in customer mix to lower margin supermarkets channel  Unfavorable currency is an added woe 
In such a scenario  the company s efforts to look for further opportunities seems to be a good way to enhance its position in the natural and organic industry in the U S  and Canada and gain traction in the specialty products space

104756,326271,CPB,Why Investors Expect Another Quarter Of Decline From Campbell ,opinion,"Campbell Soup Co   NYSE CPB  is set to report FQ3 2014 earnings before the market opens on Monday  May 19th   Campbell Soup is a producer of soups  snacks  and sauces  This quarter Wall Street expects Campbell Soup s earnings to come in 3 cents shy of FQ3 of last year while year over year revenue shrinks by 4   Last quarter the soup maker reported a revenue dip of 2  while profits beat expectations growing 6 cents per share  Here s what investors are looking for from Campbell Soup Monday morning 
The information below is derived from data submitted to theEstimize com platform by a set of Buy Side and Independent analyst contributors 

The current Wall Street consensus expectation is for Campbell Soup to report 59c EPS and  2 010B revenue while the current Estimize com consensus from 9 Buy Side and Independent contributing analysts is 61c EPS and  2 016B in revenue  This quarter the buy side as represented by the Estimize com community is expecting Campbell Soup report in line with Wall Street s revenue expectations while beating the profit consensus by a couple of cents per share 
Over the previous 6 quarters the consensus from Estimize com has been more accurate than Wall Street in forecasting Campbell Soup s EPS and revenue 5 and 3 times respectively  By tapping into a wider range of contributors including hedge fund analysts  asset managers  independent research shops  students  and non professional investors Estimize has created a data set that is more accurate than Wall Street up to 69 5  of the time 
More importantly it does a better job of representing the market s actual expectations  It has been confirmed by Deutsche Bank Quant  Research and an independent academic study from Rice University that stock prices tend to react with a more strongly associated degree to the expectation benchmark from Estimize than from the Wall Street consensus 
The magnitude of the difference between the Wall Street and Estimize consensus numbers often identifies opportunities to take advantage of expectations that may not have been priced into the market  Here we are seeing very little difference in revenue expectations while the Estimize profit consensus is slightly higher than Wall Street s  

The distribution of quarterly loss estimates published by analysts on the Estimize com platform range from 60c to 63c per share and from  2 000B to  2 039B in revenues  This quarter we re seeing a narrow range estimates on Campbell Soup 
The size of the distribution of estimates relative to previous quarters often signals whether or not the market is confident that it has priced in the expected earnings already  A narrow distribution of estimates signals more agreement in the market  which could mean less volatility post earnings  

The Wall Street EPS consensus started and ended the quarter at 59c while the Estimize consensus also dipped before recovering to its initial value of 61c  Meanwhile Wall Street reduced its revenue consensus from  2 019B to  2 010B while the Estimize consensus rose from  2 014B to  2 017B throughout the quarter   Timeliness is correlated with accuracy and the directionality of analyst revisions going into a report are often a leading indicator  In this case estimate revisions from Wall Street and the Estimize community were moving in opposite directions going into the report 

The analyst with the highest estimate confidence rating this quarter is 1nvestor who projects 60c EPS and  2 015B in revenue  1nvestor isranked 4th overall among over 4 450 contributing analysts  This season 1nvestor has been more accurate than Wall Street in forecasting EPS and revenue an impressive 80  and 65  of the time respectively throughout 120 estimates

104757,326272,CPB,4 Deceptively Expensive Dividend Stocks To Avoid,opinion,"The S P 500 Index may be up 6 9  this year on a total return basis  but the average Index member is only up 4 0   Surprisingly  174 of the 500 stocks are actually down for the year  and 31 stocks are down by double digit percentages  This goes to show how selecting the wrong stocks could dramatically affect portfolio performance  But these figures could get even uglier 
If the S P 500 were to suffer a correction of 10   which many investors think is beyond the realm of possibilities   then I would expect a significant amount of stocks to be down 30  or more  With this in mind  what s the best way to prepare for the unexpected and avoid these portfolio bombs 
Expensive Yield
Currently  the most dangerous stocks may very well be the ones that have benefited the most from the search for yield  You see  investors are attempting to make up for plummeting global interest rates by taking on more risk  Essentially  they re reaching for a higher yield wherever they can find it 
As a result  many stocks that look attractive based on dividend yield are actually dangerously expensive  To see what I mean  let s put four stocks to the test using the enterprise value to EBITDA ratio  I consider it to be one of the best valuation metrics around because it adjusts for cash and penalizes highly levered companies 

All of the companies in the list have EV EBITDA ratios above that of the median S P 500 constituent  It just doesn t make sense  considering that these firms are struggling with growth in one way or another 
Pharmaceutical giant Bristol Myers Squibb  NYSE BMY  has experienced a 20  decline in revenue since 2011  Sales at Iron Mountain  NYSE IRM   a provider of information management services  have stagnated for the past five years  And revenue at tax preparation services provider H R Block  NYSE HRB  peaked nearly a decade ago  As for Campbell Soup  NYSE CPB   it s growing revenue  albeit very slowly  Yet this consumer staple company has a valuation more suitable for a high growth tech stock 
With such dismal growth metrics  you d think the yields at these companies would actually be higher  since investors would be running away from shares  But the relentless search for yield has bid up their share prices instead   pushing down yields for all four companies 
What s more  all of these stocks have uninspiring total yields  None of these companies have reduced their share counts in the past year 
Perhaps the managements at these companies don t think their stocks are cheap enough to warrant stock buybacks  Or maybe the firms have insufficient free cash flow to implement a buyback 
Either way  this is not a good sign 
Bottom line  Stocks with high EV EBITDA ratios and low total yields should be avoided   even if they have high dividend yields  Remove these stocks from your holdings  as they ll act as a drag on performance in an up market and blow a hole in your portfolio during a market correction ",2014-06-10,Louis Basenese,https://www.investing.com/analysis/4-deceptively-expensive-dividend-stocks-to-avoid-215583,215583

104759,326274,CPB,Keeping Your Campbell s Soup Hot Through Earnings For 25 Cents,opinion,"Everyone likes a good bowl of hot soup on a dreary day  But for traders and investors it is equally as enjoyable to see a large gain in their portfolio from Campbell s Soup  N CPB   This stock showed some sighs of heating up in November as it moved over long term resistance at 51 80  It started to simmer as it moved over 54 in January and has been in a full on boil since then  If you bought the initial break at 51 80 you are up over 16  in 3 months 
Thursday morning the company reports earnings for their fiscal 2nd quarter  I have no idea how the report will turn out but I do know that I do not want to see that 16  gain evaporate into steam  This stock is a perfect candidate for a options collar into earnings 

First some information from the chart  Indications are that the stock is overheated into earnings  The momentum indicators are in overbought territory and starting to pull back  The price action is also showing signs of rolling over  After reaching the Measured Move on the break out the price has printed a few small body candles and is pulling back into earnings  With the declining volume on the pullback this could just be building strength again in a bull flag  But you have a 16  gain right 
Putting on a collar in this environment with downside risk is prudent  but will also let you sleep sounder Wednesday night  The collar is nothing more than a buying a put and selling a covered call  In this case buying the March 60 strike Put for  1 25 and then selling the May 65 Strike Call for 85 cents  This puts your out of pocket cost at 40 cents  or less than 1  of the stock price  If this is still too much then limit your downside protection by also selling the March 55 Put for 15 cents  for a net cost of 25 cents or less than 1 2  of the stock price 
This structure gives you  5 of down side protection and allows for  4 50 of upside over the next 3 months  If it moves higher faster the covered calls can always be adjusted higher  Isn t that worth 25 cents

104760,326275,CPB,Vermont Calls Big Food  Companies  Bluff,opinion,"Large food processors have long claimed that state laws forcing them to label foods containing genetically engineered ingredients would lead to 1  higher prices for consumers who would end up paying the cost of special labeling for one or just a few states and or 2  fewer food choices as processors simply withdrew some or all of their products from states requiring labeling 
It seems that the state of Vermont has now called their bluff and won 
Neither scenario appears likely when Vermont s  for products containing genetically engineered ingredients goes into effect on July 1  Instead  General Mills Inc  NYSE GIS   Kellogg Company  NYSE K   ConAgra Foods Inc  NYSE CAG   Mars Inc  and Campbell Soup Company  NYSE CPB   they will use one label that is in accordance with Vermont law for all markets for products containing genetically engineered ingredients and thus avoid the cost and logistical hassle of separate labels and special handling for products bound for Vermont  This was always going to be the simplest way to comply  and   Expect more companies to follow suit soon 
The fate of Vermont s labeling law for foods containing genetically engineered ingredients  commonly referred to as genetically modified organisms or GMOs  had hung in the balance as a court challenge and federal legislation threatened to overturn it 
But  last year a federal judge decided that Vermont s law was constitutional and refused to issue an injunction to prevent its implementation  This year the U S  Congress considered a voluntary GMO labeling law that would have pre empted the Vermont law  But  the federal legislation failed to pass the Senate 
It seems unlikely that the Congress will pass any bill soon enough to prevent the Vermont law from going into effect  making it the de facto GMO labeling standard for the nation  That doesn t mean Congress won t act later 
The industry argues that such labeling implies that there is something wrong with GMO foods when most scientists agree that they re safe  Of course  not all scientists agree  and that s not unusual in any area involving consumer safety 
But the word  safe  has been construed too narrowly in most cases to mean simply whether a GMO plant or animal is safe for human consumption  There are many other issues including the danger of herbicides  The widely used herbicide glyphosate  known by the trade name Roundup  is designed for use with glyphosate resistant GMO crops including corn  soybeans  canola  cotton  sugar beets  and alfalfa  Glyphosate kills unwanted weeds chemically while leaving the crops themselves unharmed  But glyphosate  which was once thought to biograde rapidly  turns out to be far more persistent in the environment than previously believed  It is now being found in significant quantities in soil  food and water 
The same pesticide is thought to have created superweeds that are now immune to it and have spread throughout areas where glyphosate has been used  The superweeds also affect farms growing conventional non GMO crops and those growing organic crops 
But perhaps most troubling is the claim by GMO seed companies that they know exactly what they are doing  All of GMO science is based on the notion that one gene produces one protein  If true  GMO seed companies might be correct that they know exactly what traits they are transferring from one species to another  But it has long been known that one gene can produce multiple proteins and that therefore gene expression cannot be so easily predicted 
It is this unpredictability and other factors that make GMO crops a global systemic risk  GMO crops are planted worldwide with little testing meaning any ill effects will be visited on the entire food system  This is the opposite of nature s careful culling of genetic varieties in local areas for fitness over many generations  Novel DNA introduced into the environment can manifest hidden risks that could result in crop failures  And  a worldwide failure of something as central to the current human diet as soybeans would be nothing short of catastrophic 
GMO plants are  of course  self propagating which means we can t limit their spread  In other words  we can t call them back from the environment if there is a problem  And  their genes contaminate non GMO species including organic crops which are by definition supposed to be free of GMO genetic material 
All of these factors beyond safety for human consumption are legitimate concerns for consumers  This is an age when consumers want to know not only what is in their food  but how it is produced and by whom  GMO labeling offers them an opportunity to choose based on these broader concerns 
It s quite possible that the Congress will pre empt mandatory labeling laws in states at some point  But if it doesn t act soon  GMO labeling may become such common practice that any act of Congress will be largely irrelevant ",2016-04-04,Kurt Cobb,https://www.investing.com/analysis/vermont-calls-big-food-39;s-bluff-on-gmo-labels-200123764,200123764

5 Strong Buy Dividend Stocks to Beat Sell in May Blues

U S  stocks did manage to eke out gains in April  but still booked their worst weekly loss since February last week  Lackluster corporate earnings were primarily responsible for such a debacle  A flurry of weak economic reports also continues to add to the woes  Moreover  we are in May  which is predominantly a bad month for investment  Investors tend to offload their stock holdings this month and tend to reenter the markets in fall 

However  it will be wise not to completely offload your portfolio during this phase  Instead  it s time to invest in companies that pay hefty dividends  Dividend stocks pay regular income irrespective of market movements  Moreover  the possibility of a rate hike ebbing in the near term makes dividend paying stocks more alluring 

Markets Volatile  Corporate Profits Weak

U S  stocks ended April with a whimper  which raised doubts whether the mid February rally is running out of gas  Sell off in technology and healthcare stocks curtailed gains  Companies from both these space were hit hard by losses following a bout of weak earnings reports 

This month  the broader markets did close the first trading session higher  But let s not forget that the markets have entered a period from May to October where stocks suffer the most losses for the year  This period has given rise to the old adage  Sell in May and go away   The strategy states that any investor who sells stocks in May and then gets back in November  thereby avoiding the volatile May to October period  make more moolah than those who remained steadfast throughout the year 

Economic Data Discouraging

With the corporate season winding down  all eyes will be on domestic economic data to determine the market s next move  However  on this front  things aren t looking bright either  The battered U S  manufacturing sector did stabilize a bit  but is yet to regain full health  The ISM manufacturing index dropped to 50 8 in April from 51 8 in March 

This data followed the U S  economy s weakest quarterly growth in two years between January and March  as spending levels declined considerably  The U S  economy expanded at an annualized rate of 0 5  in the first quarter  according to the Commerce Department  Business investment tumbled the most in almost seven years in the said quarter  while household purchases went up the least since early 2015  Retail sales  a key barometer of consumer spending  also dropped in March 

On the housing front  things are also looking gloomy  While housing starts declined more than expected in March  building permits touched a one year low  New home sales also fell in March suggesting some cooling in the housing market 

Fed Cautious on Rate Hikes

U S  inflation  on the other hand  barely rose due to lukewarm spending in the first quarter  This made it even less likely that the Fed will raise rates soon  The core personal consumption expenditures  PCE  price index  the Fed s preferred inflation measure  increased 0 1   below the consensus estimate of a 0 2  gain  This is also way below the Fed s desired target level of 2  

The Federal Open Market Committee had kept the interest rate flat within the 0 25 and 0 5 percent range in April  The Fed also said that it was in no hurry to hike rates further  It had hiked rates in December for the first time in nearly a decade 

Top 5 Dividend Stocks to Invest In May

U S  stocks not only failed to end in the green convincingly in April  but are also headed for a period of lull that will last until fall  A slew of weak economic data isn t helping matters either  As more volatility is in the cards and the economic outlook remains unstable  it is time to add top notch dividend stocks to your portfolio 

Companies that pay consistent dividends put a ceiling on market declines  These companies generate consistent cash flows irrespective of market conditions  They are generally financially stable and mature companies  which helps their stock prices to increase steadily over a period of time   Moreover  dividends are also less taxed as compared to interest income  They help your portfolio to grow at a compounded rate and offer protection from earnings manipulation 

As the possibility of an immediate rate hike has been ruled out  dividend payers are even more in demand  Dividend paying stocks suffer when rates are rising as investors focus on safe bonds  Most importantly  such stocks when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   are expected to boost your returns  The favorable Zacks Rank should help these stocks to continue gaining this year as well 

Darden Restaurants  Inc     NYSE DRI    through its subsidiaries owns and operates full service restaurants in the United States and Canada  DRI is headquartered in Orlando  FL  DRI carries a Zacks Rank  1 and offers a promising dividend yield of 3 2   DRI s 5 year historical dividend growth rate is 7 6  

KLA Tencor Corporation    NASDAQ KLAC    manufactures and markets process control and yield management solutions worldwide  KLAC is headquartered in Milpitas  CA  KLAC carries a Zacks Rank  1 and offers a promising dividend yield of almost 3   KLAC s 5 year historical dividend growth rate is 12 6  

Hasbro Inc     NASDAQ HAS    together with its subsidiaries provides children and family leisure time products and services worldwide  HAS is headquartered in Pawtucket  Rhode Island  HAS carries a Zacks Rank  1 and offers a promising dividend yield of 2 4   HAS  5 year historical dividend growth rate is 10 4

104799,326314,CPB,Mass Panic In Cyprus  The Banks Are Collapsing  ATMs Are Running Out ,opinion,European officials are openly admitting that the two largest banks in Cyprus are     and it is now being reported that Cyprus Popular Bank only has  enough liquidity to cover the next few hours   Of course all banks in Cyprus are officially closed until Tuesday at the earliest  but there have been long lines at ATMs all over Cyprus as people scramble to get whatever money they can out of the banks  Unfortunately  some ATMs appear to be  malfunctioning  and others appear to have already run out of cash  You can see some photos of huge lines at one ATM in Cyprus   Some businesses are now even refusing to take credit card payments  This is creating an atmosphere of panic on the streets of Cyprus  Meanwhile  the EU is holding a gun to the head of the Cyprus financial system  Either Cyprus meets EU demands by Monday  or liquidity for the banks will be totally cut off and Cyprus will be forced out of the euro  It is being reported that European officials believe that the     and that it would be okay to let the financial system of Cyprus crash and burn if politicians in Cyprus are not willing to do what they have been ordered to do  Apparently European officials are very confident that the situation in Cyprus can be contained and that it will not spread to other European nations  Unfortunately  European officials are losing sight of the bigger picture  If the largest banks in Cyprus are allowed to fail  it will be another  Lehman Brothers moment   The faith that people have in banks all over Europe will be called into question  and everyone will be wondering what major European banks will be allowed to fail next  Meanwhile  European officials have already completely shattered confidence in deposit insurance at this point  Everyone now knows that when there is a major bank failure that depositors will be expected to share in the pain  Expect to see  bank jogs  all over southern Europe over the coming weeks  The banks in Cyprus had been scheduled to reopen on Tuesday  but very few people expect that to actually happen at this point  In fact   is reporting that EU officials are actually thinking about shutting down the two biggest banks in Cyprus and freezing their assets    Finance ministers for the 17 euro countries are considering a plan to shutter the two biggest banks in Cyprus and freeze the assets of uninsured depositors  said the four officials  who asked not to be named because the talks are ongoing  The ministers are holding a teleconference tonight  Cyprus Popular Bank Pcl  CPB  and the Bank of Cyprus Plc would be split to create a so called bad bank  one of the officials said  Insured deposits    below the European Union ceiling of 100 000 euros   129 000     would go into a so called good bank and not sustain any losses  while uninsured deposits would go into the bad bank and be frozen until assets could be sold  said the four officials  Losses to unsecured creditors  including uninsured depositors  could reach 40 percent under the plan  which has support from the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank  The proposal  a version of which was rejected last week  is considered a better option than taxing insured deposits or allowing Cypriot banks to collapse in a disorderly fashion if they lose access to ECB aid  the officials said  Such a scenario would be an utter disaster  How would you feel if you woke up someday and 40 percent of your life savings was suddenly gone  According   European officials are also openly discussing the possibility of a Cyprus exit from the eurozone if a suitable bailout agreement is not worked out    The possibility of Cyprus exiting the eurozone was discussed during teleconference involving technocrats from the Euro Working Group on Wednesday  Kathimerini understands  A reliable source told Kathimerini that the technical implications of a euro exit  as well as the adoption of capital controls were debated by the Euro Working Group officials during the teleconference  As I mentioned above  European officials seemed resigned to the fact that there will be an economic collapse in Cyprus  no matter what   and so letting Cyprus leave the euro would not make that much of a difference  Either way  the banks are going to have to be  reorganized  and capital controls will be imposed    In detailed notes of the call seen by Reuters  the group s chair Austria s Thomas Wieser said   The economy is going to tank in Cyprus no matter what  Restrictions on capital will probably be imposed   Never before have we seen European officials impose such a harsh ultimatum with such a short deadline  It is almost as if they want to boot Cyprus out of the euro  The following comes from a recent  report In stark twin warnings on Thursday  the European Central Bank said it would cut off liquidity to Cypriot banks and a senior EU official made clear to Reuters that the bloc was ready to see the bankrupt island banished from the euro in the belief it could then contain damage to the wider European economy  And European officials are even publicly talking about the possibility that Cyprus will soon need to start using  their own currency     In Brussels  a senior European Union official told Reuters that an ECB withdrawal would mean Cyprus s biggest banks being wound up  wiping out the large deposits it has sought to protect  and probably forcing the country to abandon the euro   If the financial sector collapses  then they simply have to face a very significant devaluation and faced with that situation  they would have no other way but to start having their own currency   the EU official said  This is absolutely shocking  Everyone always thought that Greece would be the first to leave the euro  but now it looks like it might be Cyprus  However  there is still a chance that Cyprus may find a way to comply with EU demands  Politicians in Cyprus are frantically searching for a way to raise the needed cash without raiding private bank accounts  The following is what  about the latest efforts Leaders of Cyprus  political parties agreed Thursday to create an  investment solidarity fund   which would issue bonds backed by state and church assets  The plan was due to be discussed by the Cypriot government and parliament on Thursday evening  but few details were available and it was not clear how much the fund would be worth  According   other proposals have been under consideration as well    The government said a  Plan B  was in the works  Officials said it could include  an option to nationalize pension funds of semi government corporations  which hold between 2 billion and 3 billion euros  issuing an emergency bond linked to future natural gas revenues  and possibly reviving the levy on bank deposits  though at a lower level than originally planned and maybe excluding savers with less than 100 000 euros  At this point it is unclear whether any of those proposals will turn out to be acceptable to European officials  In fact  the tone of European officials has noticeably changed from previous bailout efforts  They now seem much more willing to play hardball  For example  just check out what  is saying about the situation in Cyprus    German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble told the ZDF public broadcaster on Tuesday night  19 March  he  took note with regret  of the Cypriot parliament s rejection of the bailout deal  but insisted that the terms will stay the same  Asked if the eurozone was willing to let Cyprus go bust  he answered   Well  we are much more stable in the eurozone   we took measures to protect ourselves from the risks of contagion     but I don t want to have any of this   He added   It is a serious situation  but this cannot lead to a decision that makes absolutely no sense  to rescue a business model that has failed  Cyprus has a banking sector that is totally oversized and this made Cyprus insolvent  And nobody outside Cyprus is to blame for it   Schaeuble knows that the EU is holding all of the cards and that Cyprus is doomed without their help     The Cypriot state cannot fund itself on the markets  Its two largest banks are insolvent and are being kept afloat with emergency funding from the ECB  but only on the condition that there will be a long term rescue programme  If this condition is no longer met  Cyprus will no longer be solvent and this is something Cypriot decision makers must know  But the truth is that the EU can t really afford to allow major banks to fail or for a single member to leave the eurozone  If either of those things happen  the confidence game that has been holding the European financial system together will begin to rapidly evaporate  If the EU thinks that they can abandon Cyprus without the crisis spreading to the rest of southern Europe they are just being delusional  At least there are a few politicians in Europe that understand what is happening  Nigel Farage  a very outspoken member of the European Parliament  is telling people to get their money out of banks in southern Europe as quickly as they can  He is warning that a great collapse of the European financial system is coming and that people need to get prepared for it    So what do you think  Do you believe that we are on the verge of a major financial collapse in Europe Below you may find the video ,2013-03-22,Michael T.

104841,326356,CPB,Kraft Foods Group New In Dividend Yield Passive Income Portfolio,opinion,Last Friday I put 40 Kraft Foods Group  KRFT  shares into the dividend yield passive income portfolio at a cost of  44 41 per share  The total amount was  1 778   Kraft Foods is the major diversified food company within the United States  Roughly 20  of sales are generated outside the United States   The shares are weighted at 1 7  of the total yield income portfolio and they will generate an annualized dividend income of 76 bucks per year  The total income is now around  700 per year  My investment costs were  18 000 and the yield on cost is 3 68    The portfolio was funded with  100 000 virtual  3 months before and has now 13 stock holdings  I tried to put every Friday one stock into the portfolio   What I try to do is to invest money into mid yielding stocks  stocks with a dividend yield of around 2 4   It is hard to find stocks that pay a yield over 3  and have a high quality and proven business model Because the portfolio is 1 45  down since I funded it  the current portfolio yield is 3 72   That is a bad performance you would say  You are right for the time being  But the strategy is to buy slowly and over a long period  Returns are realized over a long investment horizon and not over months and hours By the end of 2013  I d like to increase the amount of stock holdings to 52   70 in total  This should be realistic  All I need to do is to buy one stock each week  If I should realize this  the full dividend income should be around  3 500 per year So why did I buy Kraft Foods shares for the dividend yield passive income portfolio There are several reasons  Kraft Foods manufactures and markets food and beverage products  including convenient meals  refreshment beverages and coffee  cheese and other grocery products  in the United States and Canada  under a stable of iconic brands  The Company s product categories span breakfast  lunch and dinner meal occasions  both at home and in foodservice locations  It sells its products to supermarket chains  wholesalers  supercenters  club stores  mass merchandisers  distributors  convenience stores  drug stores  gasoline stations  value stores and other retail food outlets in the United States and Canada The first reason is that the dividend yield is around 4 5   That s a pretty high figure for a food company with great value and strong brands  In addition  the new Kraft Foods Group is one of the biggest food players in North America  The company is nearly dept free and has enough potential to be a consolidation leader Kraft Foods Group generates roughly 2 6 billion cash from operating activities at 400 million capital expenditures  Calculated on this amounts I expect that the company will become around 4 billion in debt in order to finance further growth  repurchase own shares or even to increase dividends If we take a look at competitors like Heinz  HNZ   General Mills  GIS  or Campbell Soup  CPB  we would see that Kraft s valuation is not cheap but also not expensive  The reason why KRFT shares are cheaper than the competitors is their low amount of dept The current P E ratio from Kraft Foods is 13 53  Heinz has a P E ratio of 17 94  General Mills P E ratio is at 14 78 and Campbell Soup is traded at 14 65 times of earnings I ve no idea how fast the company can grow in the near future  For the next five years  earnings per share are expected to grow by 6 3   That s one of the top values from its peers Here are the current holdins in my Passive Income Portfolio ,2013-01-01,Dividend Yield,https://www.investing.com/analysis/kraft-foods-group-new-in-dividend-yield-passive-income-portfolio-149232,149232
104842,326357,CPB,I Bought Campbell Soup Shares In Compensation For My Heinz Stake ,opinion,Yesterday was a bad day because Warren took one of my long term investments  Heinz  HNZ   to take the company private  He paid a price of  72 50 and gave me a total return including FX Gains of 24 percent  The total purchase price is 23 25 billion  Most of the value goes on Buffett s accounts Warren buys Heinz at a P E of 22 73 and a yield of 2 84   All price ratios are not cheap especially when you look at mid term growth rates  But more interesting is the alternative in a low interest environment  I believe that the current yield covers a big part of the long term loan of the deal and as a private company  there are much more possibilities However  as I heard the news yesterday  I needed to search alternatives for the free money  I decided to pull the trigger for a buy of 100 Campbell Soup  CPB  shares  My CPB stake is worth a little bit more than the old Heinz position  I am really worried about the lower possibilities on the market  In my niche  good investment vehicles getting rare and I must focus or concentrate more money on less stocks The whole industry realized a quick cash injection yesterday  I don t know why exactly  Mostly because Warren s buy is a clear signal from one of the most trusted investors  Beyond  there are now  23 billion of additional cash in the market which must be invested on the rest of the industry players  As a result  prices for all competitors must increase Heinz was bought for an EV EBITDA ratio of 13x  CPB has a ratio of 9 64x  The current P E is 16 41 and the yield amounts to 3 0 percent  I still own several major players from the industry  CPB was a lack in my portfolio  That s the main reason ,2013-02-17,Dividend Yield,https://www.investing.com/analysis/i-bought-campbell-soup-shares-in-compensation-for-my-heinz-stake-155543,155543

104885,326400,CPB,Volatility Slows as Markets Await Monday s European Finance Ministers Meeting,opinion,Market volatility has slowed as investors await the results of the next meeting with European finance ministers  set for February 20  where the second bailout agreement for Greece will be discussed   Comments from officials have suggested that the European Central Bank  ECB  plans to exchange its old Greek treasury bonds with newer treasuries as the bank looks to reduce losses as debt holdings are restructured In macro data  the next major figures will be the Producer Price Index  PPI  out of Germany and Current Account numbers out of the Eurozone   Yesterday s economic figures out of the US were positive  so we will need to see similar results if markets are going to shift the focus from the Greek story   FTSE 100 futures are pointed to a higher open  but only by about 20 points    Monthly Retail Sales numbers will be released in the UK and this will be followed by earnings results from Spectris and Anglo American Asian equities markets are also seen higher on the back of the positive performance in stocks during the New York session and this is being aided by rallies in Bridgestone Corp   which was higher after the company made a large upward revision in its yearly income forecasts   Export sector companies were also higher  with Nikon and Honda Motor posting gains on the improved currency outlook in Japan   For most of last year  this was one of the bigger issues in the region as gains in the Yen were seen weighing on exporters but the BoJ continues to implement policies that are expected to bring down the value of the currency throughout 2012 In the US  today will see some volatility following the release of the monthly Consumer Price Index  CPI  and the Leading Indicators report  and this will be preceded by earnings reports from Heinz  EOG Resources  Campbell Soup and Ventas   Yesterday  Applied Materials was one of the main stories  posting gains of 5 6 percent during the aftermarket session on stronger earnings for the first quarter   Sun Power had an even bigger rally  up 11 9 percent  on better earnings during the fourth quarter of 2011   In other news  Congressional Republicans made comments discussing the possibility of a debt crisis in the US  similar to what is being seen in Europe  if President Obama s 2013 budget proposal is passed but this had little effect on markets given that it is only a concern for one political party The EUR GBP continues to be caught within a familiar range we have discussed previously  with resistance coming in at 0 84 and support coming in at 0 8260   Prices are now approaching support along with oversold hourly indicator readings  making this a good buy at current levels   Since the range has held for most of this year  this is one of the clearer trade entries we have seen for range traders Oil is showing a strong rally and is not pressuring major resistance at 103 50   Short term sell positions can be taken into this region but stops should be kept tight as the higher lows we are seeing are indicative of an upside break   A break of support at 96 will turn the bias back to neutral and likely send prices drifting back to 92 30 ,2012-02-17,Spread Betting,https://www.investing.com/analysis/volatility-slows-as-markets-await-monday’s-european-finance-ministers-meeting-114329,114329
104886,326401,CPB,If Things Are So Bad In Europe  Why Is The Euro Still Above Parity ,opinion,Things are not so good across the pond  The European Central Bank  ECB  is unable to make the PIIGS pretty even with 1 Trillion Euro lipstick   LTRO   Spain s bailout is not a matter of if but when  Italy has just announced that their target for reaching budget targets will be postponed by one more year  Given all that bad news  why is the euro still above parity  Why are the commercials long euro week after week for as many months as you can see in the COT report  What do they know that we are missing ZH and all the other proponents of doom and gloom are predicting the imminent end of the world and urging us to load up on gold  guns and canned food  But Gold is refusing to go up  Campbell Soup  CPB  shares are down in the dumps and only gun sales are up  What gives I think the answer can be found in the following graph  It shows the liquidity pumped in by all the central banks around the world  And Obama will do anything to get re elected  If he can make a side deal with the Russians regarding missile defense  do you think he would feel shy of pumping the market One might ask  if so much money is being pumped in the system  why do we not see much inflation  let alone hyper inflation  There are two reasons  First  inflation is rampant in BRIC countries  It is officially around 10  in India and 9  in China  Actually it is much more  Second  in developed countries like USA  it is hidden from the direct public eye  If you are doing your groceries  you definitely feel the pinch and see either prices of milk  bread and other essentials are going up every year or package sizes are reduced by the companies who charge the same price as before  It is just because the way they calculate CPI in USA that they are able to show inflation below 2  But most important  there is a huge erosion of asset values which is deflationary  So basically what we have in USA is stagflation  How does that affect stock prices  In the long run  not the way Bernanke wants them  But that is another story I have been writing not to short the market yet  although the upward momentum is almost over  Because we might go in sideways for some time before any correction and even then the correction may not be very deep That s it for today  Trade safe and do not front run  Remember  we do not always have to be in the market ,2012-04-19,BB Finance Blog,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/if-things-are-so-bad-in-europe,-why-is-the-euro-still-above-parity-120620",120620
