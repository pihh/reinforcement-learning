2207,223722,CYAN,Forget About Finding The Next Apple  Here s A Small Caps Strategy For Your Portfolio,opinion,What is the Truth of Small Cap Investing   Small cap stocks have earned the reputation as the  wild card  of the stock market game  But do these tiny firms deserve the notoriety and can investors mitigate some of the risk  While definitions may vary  a small cap stock is often defined as having a market capitalization  outstanding shares multiplied by share price  between  300 million and  2 billion  What other characteristics do we generally associate with this type of stock Illiquid tradingOver the counter exchangesExtreme price volatilityLow quality firms with higher risk of bankruptcyInvestors desiring to buy into these smaller companies often look for the next Microsoft  MSFT  or Apple  AAPL  in its infancy stage  They investigate the company s story looking for the David that could take out Goliath for a long term upside gain of 10 or even 100 times their original investment Let s examine these caveats and myths one at a time to see if we can devise a small cap strategy with less risk and more upside gain than a traditional buy and hold approach Volatility Can Be Your FriendSmall cap volatility is often used in the same sentence as risk and potential loss  While huge gains are made during good markets  you can expect prices to plummet in bad ones  There are many ways to mitigate much of this risk but the first technique will turn the volatility foe into a friend  The process lies in timing the market Before we take another step  is market timing really possible  Many analysts say no  They claim that statistical testing has not yet proven the ability to time the market  Others claim that  black swans  or individual days of extreme market moves  cannot be forecast in advance  But is this what market timing is about The Truth about Market TimingFor me  market timing is not cherry picking isolated days of large price advance   quite the opposite actually  I look for broad market trends that may last years  And when analysts claim that the jury is out with quantitative testing  I like to point out the difference between economic and statistical significance  Standard Student t statistics require market timing models to produce returns three times higher than buy and hold methods  Yet market timing is not synonymous with market outperformance  but it is closely linked to risk reduction  You will achieve identical gains with market timing in a bull market  but reduce your holdings when a bear market is probable You are not dealt better cards than other poker players  but you are more adept at knowing when to hold and fold them  If market timing achieved twice the annual gains with half the downside risk of traditional buy and hold investing  most of the current tests would reject this as null  If some stubborn mathematician wants to invest with higher risk until his statistical model delivers three times the gain  I ll let him do so  I m sticking with market timing There are a variety of market timing approaches that include analyzing company earnings  price trends  fundamental valuations  institutional activity  sentiment indicators and more  By applying a market timing filter to your small cap strategy you will be investing when the upside is more likely  thus making the volatility work for you instead of against you  And you will be sitting on cash when a downside is most probable   thus lowering your downside risk The market timing model I use analyzes broad market earnings trends in conjunction with a secondary confirmation signal on the S P 500 price chart  When enough companies slash forward earnings estimates for an extended period of time  this signals a soft market and a price drop is likely  I confirm this with a price trigger Liquidity and Exchange RiskAre you worried about the risk of thinly traded stocks on exchanges of ill repute exacerbating downside volatility  Then don t buy these illiquid over the counter stocks  Limit yourself to companies on major exchanges that have enough liquidity so your  1 000 trade doesn t make the price double and selling a small amount won t drop the share price to its knees This strategy requires that a minimum of  250 000 worth of shares traded daily   but usually a whole lot more  This will mitigate some of the volatility risk associated with illiquid stocks Low Quality Firms with High Bankruptcy Risk While there may be some low quality firms in the small cap mix and a higher percentage of small firms fail than do larger established ones  this need not be a risk factor on your small cap plate  What makes a firm low quality  Are you concerned about a lack of cash flow  low intrinsic value  thin margins or meager growth prospects  Stock screening tools are common nowadays and they allow you to separate the wheat from the chaff  If you purchase low quality firms  the fault usually lies with the lack of due diligence and screening where the investor buys the story but fails to dig into the reality In addition to targeting higher quality firms you can reduce your holding period from years to weeks or months  Thus  if you purchase a strong stock today  it is unlikely that it will turn belly up next month without any warning But What Is the Story Behind It Some investors feel the need analyze the company s distant future to determine the potential upside  Consider another view  If you purchased Apple in the mid 80s for  3 per share and sold it recently for  600  you have a compound annual growth rate of 23 61   Not bad  especially since you achieved this by holding a single stock  It is unlikely  however  that you can repeat this success over and over Instead of attempting to sift through thousands of companies looking for the one that might make it big  why not trade using a strategy for repeatable results  Small cap strategy does not depend on discovering the next Microsoft  you buying a certain breed of small cap stock when a small upside is probable over the next 4 weeks  You re balance every month for an annual return that rivals the investor who discovered Apple  While past gains do not dictate future ones  the sub  15 small cap strategy has averaged robust returns over the past 11 years without the need to read a single story Investor ProgressionIn years past  strategizing with small caps could only be executed by a market professional  But the investing world has changed putting technology  institutional data and computing power within the reach of everyone  Sophisticated screening software allows the strategist to quickly scan for high quality small cap stocks during bull markets when a short term price rise is most likely  Innovative brokerages allow for low cost basket trading which means you can trade multiple portfolios with daily re balancing  if you so choose  for a flat monthly rate that costs the same as a take out pizza Technology has come a long way in reducing the complexities of investing to a simple point and click interface  You can now build your own custom  dynamic  small cap hedge fund with market timing rules for less than buying a traditional under performing mutual fund Back Testing the Sub  15 Small Cap SystemThe sub  15 small cap system targets liquid stocks on major exchanges that are of high quality with decent price performance  It includes market timing and monthly rebalancing of an optimum 15 stocks  How well has this strategy performed historically This back tested strategy generates a theoretical return of 17 656  in 11 years while the broad market has risen 21  during the same time frame  This translates into a compound annual growth rate of over 60  What sorts of stocks are singled out for purchase  Last month  February to March 2012  the strategy picked up 15 companies that included ChipMOs  IMOS  with a 60  profit  Heska Corporation  HSKA  with a 31  gain  CYANOTECH CORP  CYAN  with a 27  rise and ClickSoftware Technologies  CKSW  with a 24  jump  The biggest loser was Richmont Mines Inc   RIC  with a loss of less than 22 56   The 4 week return for the model was 7 81  which beat the market by 5 48  The New Small Cap InvestorSophisticated screening software  discount basket trading  and clever strategy are tools of the new small cap investor  Instead of looking at small cap stocks as a long term speculation where you hope to find the next Facebook  consider buying baskets of small quality firms with methodical rebalancing when the market is not in a downtrend  The rules are slowly changing in the markets where strategy is trumping story and the excess gains of small cap stocks are on the table for the taking ,2012-04-25,Portfolio
