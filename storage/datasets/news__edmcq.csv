1416,222931,EDMCQ,For Profit Education  Is An Entire Industry Going Away  ,opinion,This is an industry wide note on for profit education after a scathing review and analysis from the US Senate was made public  Let s start with the news  and move through the review in bits and pieces  then  we ll look at the vol and stock  But  as a motivator to get through all the text below  check out some stock and vol stats  So  we re talking about a group that is down more than 50  in the last six months  with vols spiking even more than that  I raise this question at the conclusion of the analysis  but I might as well put it up front as well   If the federal government pulls funding for student loans at these institutions  could they all just go away overnight   The source for all of the following Senate report  stuff  is a great  written by John Hechinger and Oliver Staley  published on Jul 30  2012 1 32 PM PT  To set the stage  here s the overview  For profit college chains including Apollo Group Inc   APOL  pressured students to enroll while dodging questions about costs  according to a Senate report that cites a trove of internal e mails and training documents   The schools received  32 billion in tuition aid in 2009 2010 and aren t a good investment for taxpayer money  according to the study released yesterday  In its probe  the Senate Committee on Health  Education  Labor and Pensions  led by Iowa Democrat Tom Harkin  examined 30 companies over two years    In the absence of significant reforms   the report said   the sector will continue to turn out hundreds of thousands of students with debt but no degree  and taxpayers will see little return on their investment    To be fair  there was a counter argument put forth in a minority report in yet another example of how divisive our own political system has become  In a minority report  Senate Republican staff members criticized the report s findings  saying that Democrats repeatedly refused to work in a bipartisan manner and expand the scope of the investigation to include nonprofit and state universities  raising  substantial doubt about the accuracy of the information    The majority report  on the other hand  openly accused the for profit education companies   In this report  you will find overwhelming documentation of exorbitant tuition  aggressive student recruiting and abysmal student outcomes   Harkin    said   These practices are not the exception  They are the norm    Apollo recruiters are trained not to provide direct answers about costs when speaking with recruiters  according to materials cited in the majority report    If a prospect says   You re too expensive   the recruiter could respond   Can you afford not to go    or  If you are going to making more money  wouldn t these loans be easier to pay back    according to a 2007 training manual cited in the report   The manual urges recruiters to  create urgency in your students  so they don t wait to sign up  It counsels recruiters   Do not tell the student we have classes running every week unless you can agree on a start date  or rolling start dates is a selling point    Here are some incredible statistics  The report  more than 1 000 pages long  takes aim at Apollo s University of Phoenix  Education Management Corp   EDMC   Washington Post Co   WPO  s Kaplan Higher Education and other for  profit colleges  which as a group spend more on marketing than instruction   For profit colleges  rely on federal financial aid money for as much as 90 percent of their revenue  The schools also devote more staff to recruiting new students than ensuring the success of their existing ones  according to the study        As a result  596 556 students who enrolled in the 2008 2009 school year dropped out by mid 2010  the report said  In two  year associate s degree programs  64 percent dropped out   For profit college students take on more debt  with 96 percent receiving loans compared with 48 percent at four year public schools  They also default at a higher rate than their counterparts at nonprofit institutions  Almost half of federal student loan defaults came from students at for profit schools   Consider some of those stats    if 90  of the industry s revenue comes from the government  and the government just concluded that these firms  and I quote   aren t a good investment for taxpayer money   well  to use a technical term  the may be screwed  With data that shows    a lmost half of federal student loan defaults came from students at for profit schools   maybe the Senate is right  But the colleges are not taking the attacks lightly and have pushed back stringently on the conclusions of the analysis  Here is some of that  Steve Gunderson  president of the Association of Private Sector Colleges and Universities  which represents for profit schools  said his members provide education to 3 8 million students  including working adults and veterans    The report twists the facts to fit a narrative  proving that this is nothing more than continued political attacks on private sector colleges and universities   Gunderson in a statement   The report noted  as an example of  significant reforms   a Kaplan program that lets students try out classes before committing to take out loans    The bulk of the report repeats prior criticisms and relies on dated  isolated situations to characterize current practices   Kaplan said today in an e mail   In a letter to Harkin  ITT said the complaints in the report  are not representative of typical student experiences    The training manual is outdated and doesn t reflect Apollo s approach to enrolling students  Rick Castellano  a spokesman  said in an e mail   Apollo Group in 2009 began offering a mandatory orientation program that lets students try programs before committing to taking on debt  The U S  Education Department and the Harkin report both praised that program  Castellano said   The Bloomberg article shines some light on actual recruiting processes  At Education Management  which runs a chain of Art Institutes and other programs  the company pushed recruiters to meet enrollment targets  according to e mails   Please everyone hit the phones      a manager wrote in a 2008 e mail   We are far behind where we need to be      Supervisors offered prizes such as company paid trips  including to Hawaii  according to the report  EDMC told investigators that it never sponsored such a trip   Jacquelyn P  Muller  an Education Management spokeswoman  said the company hasn t had the chance to review the full report   OK  so there s all that stuff  n stuff  Let s turn to the stock and vol charts  six months  for four of these companies  The top portion is the stock price  the bottom is the vol  IV30    red vs HV20    blue vs HV180    pink  APOL CECOEDMCESIUltimately  we can see very poor stock performance over the last six months as well as an abrupt rise in IV30  over the last month  recall the stats at the top of the article   I do note that CECO has earnings due out today  AMC I haven t included the skews  but suffice it to say  while they have all maintained a fairly  normal   shape  the front expiries are elevated to the back in a monotonic relationship  In English  the option market reflects the fact that the near term risk is elevated relative to the medium term  The question I ask is   can these companies lose a substantial piece of their federal aid  for loans   and if so  do they just go away   Disclaimer  This is trade analysis  not a recommendation ,2012-08-01,Ophir Gottlieb,https://www.investing.com/analysis/for-profit-education:-is-an-entire-industry-going-away-131620,131620
