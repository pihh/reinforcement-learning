In a bad year for travel stocks  Expedia  NASDAQ EXPE  did not escape the headwinds in the industry  which include the rise of Google as a major player in travel bookings  Brexit fears  and slowing growth due to market saturation 
Expedia shares finished 2019 down 4   which is only a slight decline  but significantly below the S P 500  which returned 29  last year  The chart below show how the two investments diverged 

EXPE data by YCharts 
As you can see  Expedia tracked near the S P 500 for much of the year  but fell off a cliff after it badly missed earnings estimates in its third quarter report  the seasonally busiest time of the year 

So what
Expedia shares plunged 27 4  on Nov  7 as the company blamed issues with search engine optimization  SEO  for a weak quarterly performance  saying that traffic had shifted to higher cost marketing channels with Google making a bigger play for hotel bookings  In addition to its namesake site  Expedia also owns Orbitz  Travelocity  Hotels com  Hotwire  VRBO  HomeAway  and several other online travel agencies  giving the company diversified exposure to the online travel industry   
Overall revenue in the quarter rose 9  to  3 56 billion  but the main problem was that adjusted earnings per share declined 7  to  3 38  well below estimates at  3 80  Expedia s report also came at the same time as weak results from Trivago and TripAdvisor  showing that the threat from Google extends to the broader industry  Management lowered its guidance for adjusted EBITDA growth to 5  to 8   though it also said that it was realigning teams to improve operational efficiency   
Now what
Expedia shares did recover some of those losses over the remainder of the year  and the stock looks reasonably priced at a P E of less than 20  But Google is a formidable foe in search related businesses  so Expedia and its investors may have to readjust their growth expectations ",2020-01-08,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pfh2t,2055080

130904,352419,EXPE,Amazon sued for marketing charcoal produced on land seized by Cuba in 1960s,news,"By Sarah Marsh
HAVANA  Reuters    A Florida resident is suing Amazon  O AMZN  for marketing charcoal produced on land he says Cuba confiscated from his grandfather after the 1959 revolution  the latest in a recent slew of lawsuits regarding the island piling up in U S  courts 
The lawsuit was filed in Florida on Thursday  the day after another was filed accusing American Airlines  O AAL  and the  Latam Airlines  Group  SN LTM  of trafficking in stolen property for using Havana s international airport 
Such lawsuits were allowed by U S  President Donald Trump s activation in May of a controversial provision of the 1996 Helms Burton Act that had been waived by every previous president due to opposition from the international community and fears it could create chaos in U S  courts 
So called Title III allows U S  citizens  including Cuban Americans  to file lawsuits against both Cuban entities and foreign companies over property seized after 1959 
In the lawsuit filed on Thursday  Daniel Gonzalez says he is the rightful owner of 2 030 acres of land in Cuba s eastern Granma province that were nationalized in 1964 
Authorities gave his family only seven days to leave with just their personal belongings  he says 
 The communist Cuban Government     has not paid any compensation to Plaintiff for its seizure   the filing reads 
Gonzalez claims Amazon promoted the sale of Marabu charcoal produced on that property  meaning it was trafficking in stolen property  Amazon declined to comment because it is an active lawsuit 
Gonzalez is also suing Florida based Fogo Charcoal for importing the charcoal 
 Will the next defendant be Crowley Liner Services  which transported the charcoal from Cuba to the United States  FedEx that delivered some of the charcoal   asked John Kavulich  president of the U S  Cuba Trade and Economic Council  underscoring how many companies could potentially be sued under Title III 
The U S  State Department has said Title III could produce up to 200 000 claims reaching a value in the tens of billions of dollars given the scale of expropriation after the Cuban revolution and of exile to the United States 
The Cuba government  as well as traditional U S  allies the European Union and Canada  say it violates international law 
So far  around 11 lawsuits have been filed under Title III against 19 defendants  14 of which are foreign firms doing business with Cuba directly or indirectly  according to Kavulich 
The latter include U S  cruise lines  Royal Caribbean   N RCL   Norwegian Cruise  N NCLH  and Carnival Corp  N CCL   U S  travel website operator  Expedia  Group Inc  O EXPE  and Spanish hotel operator Melia Hotels International  MC MEL  
Five of the defendants are Cuban companies 
Five of the lawsuits are by multiple plaintiffs seeking class action  Kavulich said  In the largest  nearly 40 plaintiffs are suing Melia for  trafficking  in properties they say rightfully belong to them 
It remains unclear how these lawsuits will fare in the courts  given the lack of precedent 
Moreover  it is doubtful how plaintiffs could collect if they win against foreign firms  given many countries have implemented laws blocking the law s implementation 
But the lawsuits are worsening Cuba s already weak business climate 
The Trump administration activated the long dormant Title III as part of a campaign to increase pressure on Cuba to reform and drop its support of leftist Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro 
Some analysts say the Trump administration is also seeking to win over the influential Cuban American community in the swing state of Florida ahead of the November 2020 presidential election ",2019-09-26,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/amazon-sued-for-marketing-charcoal-produced-on-land-seized-by-cuba-in-1960s-1987452,1987452

3  Oil prices slip on record U S  output  stock build
Crude oil prices fell below  63 a barrel after a stronger than expected rise in U S  inventories last week that left them at their highest in 19 months  coupled with the Fed s reluctance to engage in pump priming the global economy 
Government data released Wednesday also showed U S  output at a new record high of 12 3 million barrels a day  The increase in U S  supply has largely outweighed production cuts by Saudi Arabia and others so far this year  although markets continue to price in a geopolitical risk premium as President Donald Trump tries to close the loopholes that allowed Iran to keep exporting some of its oil until now

130952,352467,EXPE,Investors Bet Big on Zillow s Big Move  Stock Soars,news,"By Charley Blaine
Investing com   Zillow Group  NASDAQ ZG  changed CEOs on Thursday and announced it sees big things ahead for its home buying and selling business 
And investors were buying into the idea in a big way on Friday  with the stock up 22  on the news  approaching  43  But that s still down nearly 35  from its  65 42 peak last June 
The risks of the strategy are large  which even co founder Rich Barton conceded  In retaking the reins from Spencer Rascoff  Barton said his challenge will be  getting investors really excited about taking this journey over the chasm with us  
In three to five years  Zillow sees itself buying and selling  after some fixing up  upwards of 5 000 homes a month  generating revenue of some  20 billion a year  which would translate into a 1 2  market share nationally  based on sales of about 5 million homes 
Plus  it will originate the mortgages to finance a third of the purchases  a whole new business 
The plan assumes a fairly affluent set of customers  The average house price looks around  333 000  At the end of the fourth quarter  the company owned 509 homes worth roughly  320 000  according to the company s fourth quarter earnings statement  The median price for an existing home  according to the National Association of Realtors  was  
The idea is to use Zillow s technology to streamline the home buying process  right down to the closing  Zillow s online site revolutionized how agents do their business  The goal is to take the revolution to the logical conclusion 
Well and good  but so far the program  available in seven markets  is costing Zillow  It sold homes for  52 4 million and lost  62 4 million doing it  Even on an adjusted basis  where Zillow s main business generated  236 million in adjusted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and other charges  the homes business lost  45 million 
And even if profitable  the business of buying and selling homes is a low margin business  around 2   But generating home sales of  20 billion would mean a potential gross profit of  400 million    if all goes well and business overall is stable  But as the 2008 2009 crash showed  the business can be very volatile and sales in recent months have slowed 
Zillow s revolution is generating growth  Fourth quarter revenue was up 29  and full year revenue of  1 3 billion was up 24  from the year ago period  Results for the fourth quarter mostly met expectations 
Zillow was started by Barton  Rascoff and Lloyd Frink  who started  Expedia   NASDAQ EXPE   which wildly disrupted the travel business ",2019-02-22,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/investors-bet-big-on-zillows-big-move-stock-soars-1788136,1788136

131016,352531,EXPE,U S  FCC fines Florida man  120 million in  robocall  case,news,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON  Reuters    The U S  Federal Communications Commission on Thursday voted to issue a  120 million fine to a Florida man alleged to have made almost 100 million robocalls to trick consumers with  exclusive  vacation deals from well known travel and hospitality companies 
In 2017  the FCC first alleged that Adrian Abramovich made 96 million robocalls during a three month period in 2016  The commission proposed a  120 million fine but did not finalize it until Thursday 
Abramovich and his legal representatives could not be immediately reached to comment on the fine  In April  he told a Senate panel that he was  not the kingpin of robocalling that is alleged  
He denied engaging in  fraudulent activities  and said  it was always my intent with the FCC to negotiate toward an appropriate fine within my ability to pay such an amount  
Abramovich declined to answer some questions about his case  invoking the U S  Constitution s Fifth Amendment right against self incrimination 
The FCC said the calls  which violated U S  telecommunications laws  appeared to offer vacation deals from companies such as Marriott International Inc   Expedia   NASDAQ EXPE  Group Inc  Hilton Inc and TripAdvisor Inc  NASDAQ TRIP  
TripAdvisor complained to the FCC in 2016 after getting complaints from consumers claiming it was robocalling them 
Consumers who answered the calls were transferred to foreign call centers that tried to sell vacation packages  often involving timeshares 
These call centers were not related to the major companies  the FCC said 
Abramovich told the Senate he had been engaged in legitimate telemarketing for more than 15 years and that the calls were offering real vacation packages 
The FCC said in June  Abramovich is the perpetrator of one of the largest   and most dangerous   illegal robocalling campaigns that the Commission has ever investigated  
Those robocalls impacted other people and services  the FCC said  Abramovich  engaged in regular mass robocalling campaigns during 2015 and 2016  that  repeatedly disrupted a critical telecommunications service used by hospitals and emergency medical providers   it said 
U S  consumers get nearly 2 5 billion monthly robocalls   automated  prerecorded calls that regulators have labeled a  scourge   according to FCC estimates 
FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said last year  Americans are mad as hell  at robocalls and the agency gets more than 200 000 complaints annually

Shares of GoDaddy   NYSE GDDY   as the Bull of the Day  GameStop   NYSE GME   asthe Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Zumiez Inc    NASDAQ ZUMZ    Signet Jewelers Limited   NYSE SIG   and lululemon athletica inc    NASDAQ LULU   Here is a synopsis of all five stocks  GoDaddy has been able to sport double digit topline growth since it went public in 2015 combined with margin expansion  2019 was no exception to this  but over the last 52 weeks  these share traded effectively sideways  GoDaddy has been actively buying back its own stock on the notion that it is undervalued  and I am inclined to agree  Following robust Q3 earnings  analysts  drove up EPS estimates and pushed GDDY into a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  The world is digitalizing fast  and attaining an online presence is becoming essential for any business  no matter the size  GoDaddy is a one stop shop for small businesses  online needs  helping with everything from setting up an initial website to implementing a dynamic data driven ecommerce platform GoDaddy has dominated the web hosting industry for 20 years and continues to drive growth  The company has accumulated over 19 million customers in more than 50 different markets  with 8 5 million being international New ManagementThis company had a change in management after Scott Wagner was forced to step down for health related reasons late last year  Aman Bhutani took the helm in September  and analysts are optimistic about his leadership ability  Bhutani was previously the President of Brand Expedia  NASDAQ EXPE  Group  who proved himself as a tremendous leader that is able to deliver operational excellence in a complex global business  according to GoDaddy chairman Charles Robel Bhutani s first significant move on the job was to launch bundled deal Website   Marketing  which replaced the previously known as GoCentral and pushed the number of subscribers to north of 1 million  This bundled package gives entrepreneurs the ability to create an attractive website that they can effectively monetize FinancialsThe firm just began turning a profit in 2017 and is expected to aggressively expand its net margins as it dives deeper into profitability GoDaddy has been driving robust unlevered free cash flow  FCF  over the past 8 quarters  with year over year growth not falling below 20   These substantial cash flows combined with the almost a billion in cash give this firm a sizable amount of financial flexibility for investment in its current platform and further acquisitions in this consolidating segment  The continued integration of recent acquisitions like Host Europe Group and Main Street Hub should create progressively stronger synergies Take AwayGoDaddy s low cost and highly capable platform makes it an easy decision for any starting business  and its international presence still has a lot of room for growth  8 out of 11 analysts are calling GDDY a buy right now with an average price target representing an over 18  share price appreciation This company is reporting Q4 earnings Thursday  February 13th and analysts are estimating an EPS of  0 37 on sales of  2 99 billion  according to Zacks Consensus  This would represent year over year growth of 32  and 12   respectively Look for any innovative plans in the earnings call presentation from CEO Aman Bhutani  who just recently took the helm of GoDaddy  This will be Bhutani s first full quarter as the head of the company  so his leadership ability will be assessed  The gaming industry is rapidly evolving  with the next generation of gaming underlined by mobile devices  and augmented virtual reality  AR   VR   Local video game shops no longer have the appeal they did as physical video games are no longer a necessity  GameStop and its cohorts are on their way out  and this firm s stock price reflects this  EPS estimates for GME have been trending down  pushing this stock into a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  GameStop was a staple in the gaming community for years  with new video game debuts inciting hordes of dedicated gamers to line up outside  ensuring they secured a copy before it was sold out  The video game market continues to soar  but GameStop has been unable to adapt to the rapidly changing landscape  People no longer have any need to go to the store to buy their games  Everything is now done online through a marketplace portal on your console  PC  or mobile device  GameStop is another brick and mortar victim of the retail apocalypse Recent PerformanceGME hit its all time high at the end of 2007 of  63 30 then took a nosedive during the great recession  which is expected for any consumer discretionary retailer  but this stock never fully recovered  The shares hit another high of  56 50 at the end of 2013  but have since broken down  Today GME is trading at less than a tenth of its 2013 price In the last 52 weeks GME has lost over 70  of its value  and still I see no price at which I would purchase these shares  GameStop debt is in junk bond territory  and I only see this trend continuing as the companies antiquated business model eventual fizzles into bankruptcy GME has had an adverse price action from the last 6 quarters due to misses on estimates and soft guidance  GameStop is slipping into quarterly losses  Analysts are anticipating a continued drop in sales and income for the projected years to come  The company has been forced to put on increasingly more debt every quarter in order to maintain its current operations  which is not a sustainable strategy The only segment in GameStop s Q3 report that saw growth was collectibles  which now makes up over 13  of its sales in Q3  The company is slowly turning into an antique shop GameStop has closed over 600 stores since the end of 2014  10  of total store count   and more are closing ever quarter Take AwayGameStop is a quintessential retail apocalypse business  The company has been unable to adapt to the digitalizing economic landscape  I see these shares as toxic and would stay away Additional content 3 Retailers that Made the Most Out of 2019 Holiday SeasonThe holiday season turned

GoDaddy has dominated the web hosting industry for 20 years and continues to drive growth  The company has accumulated over 19 million customers in more than 50 different markets  with 8 5 million being international 
New Management
This company had a change in management after Scott Wagner was forced to step down for health related reasons late last year  Aman Bhutani took the helm in September  and analysts are optimistic about his leadership ability  Bhutani was previously the President of Brand Expedia  NASDAQ EXPE  Group  who proved himself as a tremendous leader that is able to deliver operational excellence in a complex global business  according to GoDaddy chairman Charles Robel 
Bhutani s first significant move on the job was to launch bundled deal Website   Marketing  which replaced the previously known as GoCentral and pushed the number of subscribers to north of 1 million  This bundled package gives entrepreneurs the ability to create an attractive website that they can effectively monetize 
Financials
The firm just began turning a profit in 2017 and is expected to aggressively expand its net margins as it dives deeper into profitability 
GoDaddy has been driving robust unlevered free cash flow  FCF  over the past 8 quarters  with year over year growth not falling below 20   Below is a graphic from GoDaddy s Q3 earnings presentation illustrating its FCF expansion 

These substantial cash flows combined with the almost a billion in cash give this firm a sizable amount of financial flexibility for investment in its current platform and further acquisitions in this consolidating segment  The continued integration of recent acquisitions like Host Europe Group and Main Street Hub should create progressively stronger synergies

This company is reporting Q4 earnings Thursday  February 13th and analysts are estimating an EPS of  0 37 on sales of  2 99 billion  according to Zacks Consensus  This would represent year over year growth of 32  and 12   respectively 
Look for any innovative plans in the earnings call presentation from CEO Aman Bhutani  who just recently took the helm of GoDaddy  This will be Bhutani s first full quarter as the head of the company  so his leadership ability will be assessed

However  based on its market cycles  we believe the stock has hit near term resistance and will fade in the coming months 







Expedia  EXPE  announced the resignation of CEO Mark Okerstrom and CFO Alan Pickerill  which are effective immediately  Chairman Barry Diller and Vice Chairman Peter Kern will take their places in the near term  The company also announced a  20 million share buyback program  
Diller explained that   Ultimately  senior management and the Board disagreed on a strategy that resulted in a material loss of focus on our operations  led to disappointing third quarter results  and left us with a lackluster near term outlook

The company  which includes brands Expedia com  Hotels com and Hotwire  said selling and marketing costs jumped 16 percent to  1 12 billion in the fourth quarter 
 The year did not end up as we planned from a financial perspective   Chief Executive Mark Okerstrom said in the company s quarterly earnings call 
Through 2018  the company forecast that selling and marketing costs would continue to outpace revenue growth 
This is the first full quarter under Okerstrom  who succeeded Dara Khosrowshahi after he left to take the top job at car ride provider Uber Technologies Inc last year

Expedia s previous quarterly report was equally disappointing to investors when reported last year  though that period included headwinds from a rash of disruptive hurricanes off the Atlantic in addition to brand shortcomings 
Trivago GmbH  majority owned by Expedia  reported a bigger than expected fourth quarter loss on Wednesday as the hotel search platform spent more on sales and marketing 
 Trivago does face extremely tough revenue and profitability comps through the first half of 2018   Okerstrom said on the Thursday call

131059,352574,EXPE,Stymied by regulators  Airbnb looks to luxury vacations  hotels for growth,news,By Heather Somerville SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters    Airbnb is rolling out new services aimed at attracting travelers looking for luxury accommodations and traditional hotels  the latest move to contend with sputtering growth in its original home renting business  The company on Thursday will unveil a new product that bundles Airbnb s poshest properties with high end travel services  as well as a separate category of homes guaranteed to be clean and comfortable  Airbnb will also make it easier for boutique hotels and bed and breakfasts    once its arch enemies    to list their rooms on its online booking site  The company is billing the effort as a way to win over travelers who have shied away from the risks and quirks that are part of renting a stranger s apartment  But it is also an acknowledgement that its core business has hit roadblocks around the world  Regulators in key cities such as Berlin  London  New York and even its hometown of San Francisco have cracked down on short term rentals  blaming Airbnb for exacerbating already tight housing markets  The company has been forced to slash its listings in certain popular cities as part of its concessions to regulators  Airbnb has compensated by adding services such as restaurant reservations and guided trips of local sights  part of a roster of offerings the company is betting will someday generate more revenue than it earns from renting homes   Thursday s event in San Francisco builds on this effort  with Airbnb Chief Executive Brian Chesky set to announce changes that put the company in closer competition with the likes of  Expedia  Inc  O EXPE   Planned moves include a new way of categorizing listings  Airbnb will specify whether the property is a home  bed and breakfast  hotel or something more eccentric  like a houseboat or yurt  And it will give guidance on the best properties for certain types of travelers  such as whether a house is most appropriate for families  newlyweds or colleagues on a work retreat  according to an Airbnb spokesman  who spoke with Reuters prior to the Thursday event  Another new category is made up of homes that Airbnb has inspected for quality and cleanliness  Landlords will be able to charge a premium for those properties  enabling Airbnb to earn more too  Airbnb charges fees of up to 15 percent for guests and about 3 percent for hosts on the price of each rental   There is a sense of urgency for Airbnb to get it right  The privately held company is valued at  31 billion and needs a predictable business with steady growth to hold a successful initial public offering  expected in 2019   Airbnb  is  figuring out how do we grow at the same levels that investors are expecting us to grow  given some of the regulatory headwinds   said Christopher Anderson  a professor at Cornell University s School of Hotel Administration   That comes down to more breadth of inventory   Airbnb  which does not release its financial data  said last year it had achieved its first full year of profitability  The company continues to increase its number of listings and visitors  but growth has slowed  Since its launch in 2009  the company at least doubled the number of bookings for its properties every year until 2017  when bookings grew by 62 5 percent to 130 million guests  The slowdown is due in part to the company s larger size as well as the harsher regulatory climate  LOSING THOUSANDS OF LISTINGS In San Francisco  for example  which passed a 90 night limit on rentals and issued licensing requirements  the number of short term rentals fell to 3 500 in January from more than 8 500 in August  according to government figures  Several European cities have cracked down too  In Berlin  3 953 homes were removed last year from vacation rental listings  a government report shows  although it was not clear how many of those were specific to Airbnb  Available Airbnb listings for Paris stood at 35 825 last month  down from 40 484 in January 2017  according to market tracker AirDNA  Tougher rules in Amsterdam have caused Airbnb listings to stabilize at around 18 000  a city official said  Those numbers could fall further when new restrictions capping Amsterdam home shares at 30 days go into effect next year  Airbnb continues to expand outside of traditional city centers  and its new offerings will appeal to more diverse users and changing travel patterns  according to Chris Lehane  head of global policy for Airbnb  Founded as a way for homeowners to make a bit of cash renting spare rooms to penny pinchers  Airbnb now operates in 191 countries    It s just a very different business that existed in 2009 when Airbnb was primarily in the U S  and in urban markets   Lehane said  The company sees particular promise in hotel listings  There are currently 24 000 hotel rooms already listed on Airbnb  up 520 percent from a year ago  While big chains are not likely to be on the site anytime soon  Airbnb is eager to attract more small  independent hotels to lure travelers who want predictable accommodations  Henry Harteveldt  founder of travel industry research firm Atmosphere Research  said it is a recognition that Airbnb and hotels  seemingly at odds  might actually help each other s business    That is the lion laying down with the lamb   Harteveldt said   Airbnb may become a bona fide online travel agency just like Priceline   But whether Airbnb can succeed in that segment remains to be seen  There is a slew of competition  from giants like Expedia  which owns Airbnb competitor HomeAway  to luxury home booking company onefinestay  which is backed by a large European hotel group   The company also risks alienating homeowners  who were the first to use Airbnb and are among its fiercest advocates   Airbnb host Stephen Barefoot is a bit wary of the company s growth plans  Partially retired  Barefoot rents out a floor of his home in Durham  North Carolina  to supplement his income  He enjoys the personal connections with guests and wonders if that could change   It just loses it a little bit when I think about it in the same terms as Expedia   he said

131060,352575,EXPE,Expedia Stock Disappointed  Elliott Wave Analysis Did Not,opinion,"Expedia   NASDAQ EXPE  stock is down 25  today after the company s Q3 results missed expectations  GAAP EPS fell 57 cents short of analysts  estimates  The revenue figure was anticipated to be  10 million higher than reported  as well  On top of that  Expedia cut its full year guidance which annoyed Wall Street even more 




That is the official explanation for today s slump  which of course makes perfect sense  But there is one other possible way to look at things and it involves the Elliott Wave chart below  It was published in May 2018  when we warned our readers that   Expedia   NASDAQ EXPE  investors cannot feel safe yet  
A year and a half ago   Expedia   NASDAQ EXPE  stock was hovering around  113 following a plunge from  161 to  98  The structure of this selloff formed a textbook five wave impulse  labeled 1 2 3 4 5 in wave  1 A   To an experienced Elliott Wave analyst this pattern meant one thing  the larger trend is down  but a three wave recovery should first occur 
 Expedia   NASDAQ EXPE  Crash was Long Overdue 
With that in mind we concluded that a recovery to roughly  130 can be expected  but as long as the stock trades below  161   Expedia   NASDAQ EXPE  investors cannot feel safe  It took a little more time than anticipated  but now it looks like it was a correct conclusion 




Wave  B  took the shape of a w x y double zigzag correction which eventually lifted  Expedia   NASDAQ EXPE  to  144 in late July  2019  At that point the negative 5 3 wave cycle was complete and all the bears needed was a catalyst 
After the company s weak earnings report on Wednesday  there was nothing left to wait for  The current sharp plunge fits in the position of wave 3 of  C   assuming no bigger bearish pattern is going to develop  If this count is correct  we can prepare for waves 4 up and 5 down to complete the decline from  161  Targets near  80 remain plausible ",2019-11-08,EWM Interactive,https://www.investing.com/analysis/expedia-stock-disappointed-elliott-wave-analysis-did-not-200483737,200483737
131061,352576,EXPE,Watch For Near Term Choppy Action Ahead In Stocks ,opinion,"The stock market edged out some gains last week  as the S P 500  SPX  rose 27 points to 3120  an increase of 0 9   For this week  market cycles suggest choppy price action  as I pointed out in the latest Market Week show 
In last week s testimony to Congress  Fed Chair Jerome Powell identified debt as a source of risk but noted   I think possibly the day of reckoning could be quite far off   Thanks for that opinion  but our view is that the Fed does not have a good record of assessing when such risks will manifest 





Our approach to technical analysis uses market cycles to project price action  Our analysis is that the S P 500 is in the rising phase of its current cycle  For this week  we expect it to chop around before it approaches the declining phase of its new cycle  which could bring a brief drop in to early December 
Let s also look at  Expedia   NASDAQ EXPE   which fell 26  in the previous week after missing on earnings   and continued to fall last week 





Based on its market cycles  we believe EXPE has nearly bottomed here  Our expectation is for the stock bounce in the near term future  This would begin the rising phase of its next market cycle  for which our upside target is around  105  This is a sell zone  before the next downwave hits

131105,352620,EXPE,Online travel firm GetYourGuide raises  75 million,news,"By Douglas Busvine
FRANKFURT  Reuters    Berlin based online travel booking firm GetYourGuide has raised  75 million to expand its offering that helps tourists book activities at their destinations ranging from the Eiffel Tower in Paris to shark diving in Cape Town 
GetYourGuide specializes in so called in destination activities and says it is experiencing explosive growth with nearly half of the 10 million tickets ordered through its platform being booked this year 
 We are opening the next era of online travel   which is what I can do at a destination   CEO Johannes Reck said in a telephone interview 
 We re a new kid on the block that doesn t sell air fares or hotel rooms  We focus on the experience  
European venture capital investors are shifting away from price comparison sites to new areas of travel  as airline and hotel brands begin to take back control of bookings at the expense of intermediaries like eDreams   Expedia   NASDAQ EXPE   TripAdvisor and Trivago 
The later stage   Series D  round was led by Battery Ventures  a technology focused investor that was joined by all of GetYourGuide s existing backers including KKR  Spark Capital  Highland Europe  Sunstone Capital and Nokia s venture capital firm Nokia  HE NOKIA  Growth Partners 
The funding round  which brings the total amount raised by GetYourGuide to more than  170 million  according to Crunchbase  comes at a time when some other online travel companies have hit a rough patch 
GetYourGuide operates on commission  which Reck said is a more robust model than advertising driven price comparison sites like Trivago  He said it creates  lock in  with GetYourGuide s 10 000 suppliers  while its customers can get their money back if they find local prices to be cheaper 
The company provides access to more than 31 000 tours and attractions in 7 300 destinations around the world 
It estimates the size of the global market for sightseeing tours and other activities at around  150 billion   or 10 percent of total leisure travel spending  It cited forecasts that the market could be worth  183 billion by 2020 
 We think that 20 25 percent of the global market can move online   said Reck  noting online spending is no more than 1 5 percent currently 
GetYourGuide did not disclose its financial performance  nor the valuation put on the business by this funding round  but Reck did say he wanted to focus on investing in long term growth over achieving near term profitability 
Commenting on a possible initial public share offer  Reck said   We are definitely considering this   it s the primary option at this time  But we have a ways to go before we can talk about that 
 Why not stay private for a couple more years and really invest

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Southern Company  NYSE SO   Prologis  PLD  and Delta Air Lines  NYSE DAL   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Outperform rated Southern Company s shares have outperformed the Zacks Electric Power industry year to date  gaining  26 7  vs  14 8   The Zacks analyst thinks the stock is poised for further capital appreciation  riding on its healthy earnings growth prospects  It is one of the largest and best managed electric utility holding companies in the United States  dominating the power business across the southeastern region  
With good rate base growth and constructive regulation  it is expected to generate steady earnings and dividend growth in the coming years through long term power contracts  Additionally  SO s  12 billion AGL buy has significantly increased its customer base and diversified offerings  Investors have also welcomed the U S  federal government s approval of  3 7 billion in loan guarantees for the Vogtle nuclear plant in Georgia that will help the utility to reduce its costs

Shares of Prologis have outperformed the Zacks REIT and Equity Trust industry in the year to date period   38 7  vs   19 9    The company has agreed to acquire warehouse owner Industrial Property Trust  in a deal valued at about  3 99 billion  from Black Creek Group  
The Zacks analyst thinks the move will expand the company s position in key submarkets  Further  backed by high period end occupancy  Prologis delivered a healthy performance in Q2 and also raised its outlook  In a rising e commerce market  industrial real estate assets continue to play a pivotal role  
Companies are making immense efforts to improve supply chain efficiencies  spurring demand for logistics infrastructure and efficient distribution networks  Given Prologis  balance sheet strength  it remains well poised to capitalize on this favorable trend  But rising supply and protectionist trade policies are key concerns 
 You can   
Delta Air Lines  shares have gained  26 6  year to date  outperforming the Zacks Airline industry s  14 3  increase  Delta delivered an impressive performance in second quarter 2019  wherein earnings and revenues surpassed expectations  Both the metrics also improved year over year  
Similar to the past few quarters  quarterly results were aided by uptick in passenger revenues on account of strong demand for air travel  Moreover  Delta raised its current year earnings projection  Also  the company s board approved a 15  dividend hike  The Zacks analyst thinks initiatives to reduce debt are also impressive  
However  increase in operating expenses mainly due to high non fuel unit costs remain a concern  Notably  non fuel unit costs are projected to increase 1 2  in the third quarter  Moreover  technological glitches have been hurting Delta s operations quite regularly

131118,352633,EXPE,Expedia  EXPE  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Expedia  NASDAQ EXPE  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 25  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This online travel company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 70 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  22 5  
Revenues are expected to be  3 14 billion  up 9 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Expedia 
For Expedia  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 50  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination indicates that Expedia will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Expedia would post a loss of  0 36 per share when it actually produced a loss of  0 27  delivering a surprise of  25  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Expedia appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/expedia-expe-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200441476,200441476

131120,352635,EXPE,Is Expedia  EXPE  A Great Value Stock Right Now ,opinion,"Here at Zacks  our focus is on the proven Zacks Rank system  which emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find great stocks  Nevertheless  we are always paying attention to the latest value  growth  and momentum trends to underscore strong picks 
Looking at the history of these trends  perhaps none is more beloved than value investing  This strategy simply looks to identify companies that are being undervalued by the broader market  Value investors rely on traditional forms of analysis on key valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are undervalued  leaving room for profits 
Luckily  Zacks has developed its own Style Scores system in an effort to find stocks with specific traits  Value investors will be interested in the system s  Value  category  Stocks with both  A  grades in the Value category and high Zacks Ranks are among the strongest value stocks on the market right now 
One stock to keep an eye on is Expedia  NASDAQ EXPE   EXPE is currently holding a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  and a Value grade of A  The stock has a Forward P E ratio of 17 66  This compares to its industry s average Forward P E of 41 11  Over the past year  EXPE s Forward P E has been as high as 24 54 and as low as 15 44  with a median of 17 62 
Investors will also notice that EXPE has a PEG ratio of 1 44  This popular figure is similar to the widely used P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also considers a company s expected EPS growth rate  EXPE s industry currently sports an average PEG of 1 91  EXPE s PEG has been as high as 1 67 and as low as 0 99  with a median of 1 26  all within the past year 
Another notable valuation metric for EXPE is its P B ratio of 3 50  The P B ratio is used to compare a stock s market value with its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  EXPE s current P B looks attractive when compared to its industry s average P B of 4 11  Within the past 52 weeks  EXPE s P B has been as high as 3 71 and as low as 2 75  with a median of 3 21 
Value investors also love the P S ratio  which is calculated by simply dividing a stock s price with the company s sales  This is a popular metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement  so they are often considered a better performance indicator  EXPE has a P S ratio of 1 77  This compares to its industry s average P S of 1 93 
Finally  investors should note that EXPE has a P CF ratio of 11 48  This figure highlights a company s operating cash flow and can be used to find firms that are undervalued when considering their impressive cash outlook  This stock s P CF looks attractive against its industry s average P CF of 32 51  Over the past 52 weeks  EXPE s P CF has been as high as 14 73 and as low as 9 68  with a median of 11 01 
These figures are just a handful of the metrics value investors tend to look at  but they help show that Expedia is likely being undervalued right now  Considering this  as well as the strength of its earnings outlook  EXPE feels like a great value stock at the moment ",2019-07-18,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-expedia-expe-a-great-value-stock-right-now-200442046,200442046
131121,352636,EXPE,Expedia  EXPE  Is An Incredible Growth Stock  3 Reasons Why,opinion,"Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market s attention and produce exceptional returns  But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task 
By their very nature  these stocks carry above average risk and volatility  Moreover  if a company s growth story is over or nearing its end  betting on it could lead to significant loss 
However  the task of finding cutting edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects 
Expedia  NASDAQ EXPE  is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system  In addition to a favorable Growth Score  it carries a top Zacks Rank 
Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market  And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  
While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this online travel company is a great growth pick right now  we have highlighted three of the most important factors below 
Earnings Growth
Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth  as surging profit levels is what most investors are after  And for growth investors  double digit earnings growth is definitely preferable  and often an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Expedia is 8 6   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 19 4  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 0 4  
Cash Flow Growth
While cash is the lifeblood of any business  higher than average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for Expedia is 24 9   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 8 2  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 21 6  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 15 6  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Superiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is of course favorable here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
The current year earnings estimates for Expedia have been revising upward  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0 2  over the past month 
Bottom Line
While the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Expedia a Zacks Rank  2 stock  it has earned itself a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above

Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is Expedia due for a breakout  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts  Expedia Reports Loss in Q1  Revenues Up Y YExpedia Group reported first quarter 2019 adjusted loss of 27 cents per share  narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 36 cents  Further  the reported figure is also narrower than the loss of 46 cents per share in the year ago quarter  Notably  the company reported earnings of  1 24 per share in the prior quarter Revenues increased 4  year over year and 1 9  on a sequential basis to  2 61 billion  Notably  the figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 69 billion The top line was driven by robust performance of Vrbo which was previously known as HomeAway  Brand Expedia and Expedia Partner Solutions  Further  improving stayed nights and strengthening lodging platform continued to contribute to the results  Expedia recorded gross bookings of  29 41 billion in the first quarter  which came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  29 38 billion  Moreover  the figure improved 8 1  year over year and 33 9  sequentially However  sluggishness in the Trivago segment and Easter shift acted as headwinds during the reported quarter Revenues by SegmentCore OTA segment revenues  78 1  of total revenues  increased 5 8  year over year to  2 04 billion  The segment witnessed gross bookings of  23 03 billion  reflecting year over year growth of 9   Robust growth in stayed room nights and expanding international footprints of Core OTA brands drove the segment s top line Egencia revenues  5 9  of revenues  increased 1 3  on year over year basis to  153 million  This can be attributed to strong performance in quarterly bookings which came in  2 22 billion  up 7  from the prior year quarter The company s strong supply acquisition efforts acted as a tailwind in accelerating room nights growth within this segment  which in turn drove the top line  Further  Expedia s continued focus toward delivering enhanced product experience remained positive in attracting customers to this platform Vrbo  10 2  of revenues  generated  267 million in the fourth quarter  advancing 14 1  from the year ago quarter  This segment witnessed year over year growth of 5  in its gross bookings  which came in at  4 16 billion  Further  Vrbo experienced growth of 8  in the stayed property nights on a year over year basis

the prior year quarter Advertising   Media yielded  264 million of revenues  10 1   of revenues   declining 6 4  from the year ago quarter  This was primarily owing to currency headwinds and weak performance by trivago Moreover  HomeAway  10 2  of revenues  generated  267 million in the reported quarter  climbing 14 1  from the year ago quarter Revenues by GeographyExpedia generated  1 48 billion revenues  56 6  of total revenues  from domestic regions  up 9 2  from the prior year quarter  This was primarily driven strong domestic room nights which improved 8  from the year ago quarter  This led to acceleration in gross bookings in these regions  which surged 11  year over year Further  revenues generated by international regions were  1 13 billion  43 4  of revenues   down 2 1  on a year over year basis  Excluding the impact of trivago headwinds  revenues would have reflected growth of 2  from the year ago quarter  Further  foreign exchange fluctuation remains a concern  Nevertheless  Expedia witnessed solid growth of 11  in room nights in international regions during the reported quarter  Further  gross bookings rose 4  from the prior year quarter Revenues by Product LineLodging revenues  66  of total revenues  came in  1 73 billion  rising 7  from the prior year quarter  This can be primarily attributed to year over year growth of 9  in stayed lodging room nights

2019 Air revenues were  248 million  10  of revenues   up 3  year over year  This was driven by 11  increase in air tickets sold Operating DetailsAdjusted EBITDA improved massively by 42  year over

131167,352682,EXPE,Why The Earnings Surprise Streak Could Continue For Expedia  EXPE ,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  Expedia  NASDAQ EXPE   which belongs to the Zacks Internet   Commerce industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
This online travel company has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 15 51  
For the most recent quarter  Expedia was expected to post earnings of  1 07 per share  but it reported  1 24 per share instead  representing a surprise of 15 89   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  3 17 per share  while it actually produced  3 65 per share  a surprise of 15 14  
Price and EPS Surprise

For Expedia  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Expedia has an Earnings ESP of  9 01  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on May 2  2019 
With the Earnings ESP metric  it s important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power  however  a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-04-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-the-earnings-surprise-streak-could-continue-for-expedia-expe-200409620,200409620
131168,352683,EXPE,Expedia  EXPE  Expected To Beat Earnings Estimates  Can The Stock Move Higher ,opinion,"The market expects Expedia  NASDAQ EXPE  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on May 2  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This online travel company is expected to post quarterly loss of  0 35 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  2 8  
Revenues are expected to be  2 69 billion  up 7 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Expedia 
For Expedia  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  9 01  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Expedia will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Expedia would post earnings of  1 07 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 24  delivering a surprise of  15 89  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Expedia appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/expedia-expe-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates-can-the-stock-move-higher-200410982,200410982

131214,352729,EXPE,Indonesian travel site Traveloka to expand tourist attraction booking service,news,"By Eveline Danubrata and Stefanno Reinard
JAKARTA  Reuters    Indonesian travel start up Traveloka  which has raised nearly  500 million from investors including  Expedia  Inc  NASDAQ EXPE  and China s JD com Inc  plans to ramp up its new tourist attraction booking service next year  a senior executive said 
Investors have been pouring money into start ups in Indonesia  home to a population of 250 million and some of the world s most avid users of social media and online marketplaces 
JD com s investment in Traveloka is another example of Chinese investment in online businesses in Indonesia  Sources said last month that Tencent Holdings Ltd had invested around  100 million to  150 million in ride hailing start up Go Jek 
Jakarta based Traveloka was co founded in 2012 by Indonesian engineer Ferry Unardi as a site to search for flights  It has since set up partnerships with more than 100 airlines and expanded to five other countries in Southeast Asia 
Early this year  it began providing ticketing for tourist attractions in Indonesia ranging from theme parks to zoos  and plans to double the number of such options on its site to 2 000 by the end of 2018  Traveloka s Chief Financial Officer Henry Hendrawan told Reuters 
As well as Expedia and JD com  Traveloka also raised funds over the last year from East Ventures  Hillhouse Capital Group and Sequoia Capital 
Traveloka plans to use the money to hire more people and for other investments  Hendrawan said in an interview in a West Jakarta area dubbed  Slipicon Valley  as it houses many start up offices 
U S  travel company Expedia  which invested  350 million in Traveloka  said it will work with the Indonesian start up to grow their global hotel supply 
 There is strong interest from investors coming from many different types of region   Hendrawan said   Not only can they bring the capital  but they can also bring the knowledge  experience and the network

131216,352731,EXPE,Expedia to expand U S  passenger rail booking presence  CEO,news,"By Sophia Kunthara
 Reuters    Online travel provider  Expedia  Inc  NASDAQ EXPE  is looking to build up its rail booking services in the United States  Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi said in an interview with Reuters on Tuesday 
The Bellevue  Washington based company  which offers online bookings of hotels  flights and cars for travelers  is working to expand those capabilities to passenger train service on a global basis  Khosrowshahi said  looking to key markets like Europe  where it has already started offering rail bookings in the United Kingdom and Germany 
 Rail in Europe is incredibly important as far as a transportation medium   Khosrowshahi said in an interview   It s becoming increasingly important in the Asia Pacific markets  And I think in the U S   rail isn t quite as strong  but we are certainly building up infrastructure on the back end to be able to expand our rail offering on a global basis  
Plans for expanding its U S  rail booking options are in the early stages  Khosrowshahi said  declining to provide further details 
In June  the company acquired a majority stake in SilverRail Technologies Inc  an unlisted retailing and distribution platform for rail  at an undisclosed price 
Although SilverRail is based in London  Expedia actually began partnering with the firm in 2010 for its corporate travel brand  Egencia  to provide rail options in the United States  where nearly all long distance passenger train service is provided by U S  government owned Amtrak 
 With all the talk about being environmentally friendly  you know we do think it is a good way for people to get around  it s a good transport mechanism and it s one that we want to promote   Khosrowshahi said

Low EV EBITDA RatiosPrice to earnings  P E   given its apparent simplicity  is the most commonly used metric in the value investing world  The ratio enjoys greater popularity among valuation metrics in the investment toolkit and is preferred while uncovering stocks trading at a bargain  But even this straightforward  easy to calculate equity valuation multiple is not devoid of  is a Better Approach  Here s WhyWhile P E is by far the most popular valuation metric  a more complicated metric called EV EBITDA does a better job in working out the fair market value of a firm  Often viewed as a better substitute to P E  this ratio offers a clearer picture of a company s valuation and its earnings potential Also dubbed as the enterprise multiple  EV EBITDA is essentially the enterprise value  EV  of a stock divided by its earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  EBITDA   EV is the sum of a company s market capitalization  its debt and preferred stock minus cash and cash equivalents  Essentially  it is the total value of a company EBITDA  the other component of the ratio  gives the true picture of a company s profitability as it eliminates the impact of non cash expenses like depreciation and amortization that depress net earnings  It is also often used as a proxy for cash flows Generally  the lower the EV EBITDA ratio  the more enticing it is  A low EV EBITDA ratio could signal that a stock is potentially undervalued   However  EV EBITDA takes into account the debt on a company s balance sheet that P E ratio does not  Given this reason  EV EBITDA is usually used to value possible acquisition targets  as it shows the amount of debt the acquirer has to assume  Companies with a low EV EBITDA multiple could be seen as attractive takeover candidates P E also can t be used to value a loss making firm  A company s earnings are also subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation  On the other hand  EV EBITDA is difficult to manipulate and can also be used to value companies that are making loss but are  is also a useful tool in measuring the value of firms that are highly leveraged and have a high degree of depreciation  It also allows the comparison of companies with different debt levels But EV EBITDA is not without its shortcomings  The ratio varies across industries  a high growth industry typically has higher multiple and vice versa  and is usually not appropriate while comparing stocks in different industries given their diverse capital requirements Hence  a strategy entirely based on EV EBITDA might not fetch the desired results  But you can combine it with other major ratios such as price to book  P B   P E and price to sales  P S  to screen value stocks For the rest of this Screen of the Week

131235,352750,EXPE,Expedia begins offering online booking for hotels in Cuba,news,"By Sarah Marsh
HAVANA  Reuters    U S  online travel services company  Expedia   O EXPE  said on Tuesday it had started offering online booking for hotels in Communist run Cuba  hoping to capitalize on a boom in tourism to the Caribbean island 
Expedia joins a dozen U S  airlines and cruise operators that have already ventured into the Cuban market since the United States announced a detente with its former Cold War foe in 2014 and eased travel and trade restrictions 
 I see a lot of potential  We are talking about the largest country in the Caribbean with significant hotel expansion plans   Veronica Vega  Expedia area manager for Caribbean  said in an interview 
The number of visitors to Cuba rose 13 percent to a record 4 million in 2016  driven by a 74 percent jump in U S  travelers  A survey recently showed the number of American visitors alone could multiply sevenfold to 2 million by 2025 
Expedia s move comes as U S  President Donald Trump s administration conducts a full review of U S  policy toward Cuba  During his campaign  Trump had threatened to roll back the normalization of relations 
That does not seem to have dampened U S  interest in the Cuban market  Analysts and corporate executives said it was hard to imagine Trump  a former businessman  taking measures that would harm U S  companies already in Cuba 
U S  law still bans general tourism to Cuba  but former President Barack Obama s administration allowed Americans to travel more easily to Cuba for educational  cultural and other authorized purposes without having to go on organized group tours 
Expedia said Americans would simply have to certify that their trips fell under one of the 12 categories of authorized travel 
 We are very excited about being able to facilitate travel and give people the independence to select their itinerary   said Vega 
Expedia said it would offer both hotel and BnB options and that customers would be able to pay online at the time of booking 
Americans previously had to reserve Cuban hotels principally through travel agencies or tour groups 
Since 2015  American tourists have also been able to book properties in Cuba on Airbnb Inc  The online home rental marketplace said last year the island had become its fastest growing market ever 

Expedia said that for U S  travelers  it was operating under a general license right for all travel service providers  For non U S  travelers  it was operating under a specific license granted by the U S  Treasury s Office of Foreign Assets Control in December 2016 ",2017-05-23,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/expedia-begins-offering-online-booking-for-hotels-in-cuba-487462,487462

 Citizens of seven mainly Muslim countries banned from the United States by President Donald Trump can resume boarding U S  bound flights  major airlines said on Saturday  after a Seattle judge blocked the executive order  The ruling gave hope to some Middle East travellers but left them unclear how long the new travel window might last  Trump denounced the judge on Twitter and said the decision would be quashed   The opinion of this so called judge  which essentially takes law enforcement away from our country  is ridiculous and will be overturned   the president said  The travel ban  which Trump says is needed to protect the United States against Islamist militants  has sparked travel chaos around the world and condemnation by rights groups who have called it racist and discriminatory   Interesting that certain Middle Eastern countries agree with the ban  They know if certain people are allowed in it s death   destruction   Trump tweeted   When a country is no longer able to say who can  and who cannot  come in   out  especially for reasons of safety   security   big trouble   In the wake of Friday s ruling  Qatar Airways was the first to say it would allow passengers from Iran  Iraq  Libya  Somalia  Sudan  Syria and Yemen to resume flying to U S  cities if they had valid documents  Fellow Gulf carriers Etihad and Emirates said they would do the same  as did Air France  Spain s Iberia and Germany s Lufthansa  Officials in Lebanon and Jordan said they had received no new instructions on the issue  The White House said it planned to appeal as soon as possible  Ibrahim Ghaith  a Syrian barber who fled Damascus in 2013  told Reuters in Jordan   Today we heard that the measures may have been abolished but we are not sure if this is just talk  If they go back on the decision  people will be overjoyed   Iraqi refugee Nizar al Qassab told Reuters in Lebanon   If it really has been frozen  I thank God  because my wife and children should have been in

phone call from U N  officials overseeing their case   It s in God s hands   he said   RACE AGAINST TIME  Two Sudanese travellers told Reuters they were trying to travel as soon as possible  fearing the ban might be reinstated   I m in a race against time   said a 31 year old female academic who declined to be named for fear of any consequences    Today I face a real problem in Khartoum because

of Trump s executive order  Judge James Robart  a George W  Bush appointee  explicitly made his ruling apply across the country  while other judges in similar cases have so far issued orders concerning only specific individuals  The challenge in Seattle was brought by the state of Washington and later joined by the state of Minnesota  The judge ruled that the states have legal standing to sue  which could help Democratic attorneys general take on Trump in court on issues beyond immigration   Washington s case was based on claims that the state had suffered harm from the travel ban  for example students and faculty at state funded universities being stranded overseas  Amazon com  NASDAQ AMZN  and  Expedia   NASDAQ EXPE   both based in Washington state  had supported the lawsuit  asserting that the travel restrictions harmed their businesses  Tech companies  which rely on talent from around the world  have been increasingly outspoken in their opposition to the Trump administration s anti immigrant policies  Judge Robart probed a Justice Department lawyer on what he called the  litany of harms  suffered by Washington state s universities  and also questioned the use of the Sept  11  2001  attacks on the United States as a justification for the ban  Robart said no attacks had been carried out on U S  soil by individuals from the seven countries affected by the travel ban since that assault  For Trump s order to be constitutional  Robart said  it had to be  based in fact  as opposed to fiction    The White House said in a statement   At the earliest possible time  the Department of Justice intends to file an emergency stay of this outrageous order and defend the executive order of the president  which we believe is lawful and appropriate   It added   The

131253,352768,EXPE,Justice Department appeals judge s immigration order,news,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON  Reuters    The U S  Justice Department filed an appeal late Saturday to restore President Donald Trump s immigration order barring citizens from seven mainly Muslim countries and temporarily banning refugees  even as travelers raced to enter the country while the ban was lifted 
The government moved to reverse a federal judge s Friday order that lifted the travel ban and warned the decision posed an immediate harm to the public  thwarted enforcement of an executive order and  second guesses the president s national security judgment about the quantum of risk posed by the admission of certain classes of  non citizens  and the best means of minimizing that risk  
Friday s ruling prompted Trump to denounce the  so called  judge in a series of tweets on Saturday  
The appeal now goes to a three judge panel which can act at anytime to uphold the order or suspend it pending a full appeal  A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment beyond the filing 
A ruling could come at any time 
Seattle U S  District Judge James Robart s decision barred the administration from enforcing the sweeping order that also indefinitely barred Syrian refugee admissions and prompted large protests across the United States 
Trump  whose personal attack on Robart  decrying his opinion as  ridiculous   went too far for some who said the president was undermining an institution designed to check the power of the White House and Congress  said he was confident the government would prevail 
 We ll win  For the safety of the country  we ll win   he told reporters in Florida 
Robart s ruling came in a case brought by the state attorney general of Washington state and was backed by major state employers Amazon com Inc  NASDAQ AMZN  and  Expedia  Inc  NASDAQ EXPE    The lawsuit is one of several now filed against the Trump executive order around the United States  but it was the first case leading to a broad decision that applies nationwide 
The Justice Department appeal criticized Robart s legal reasoning  saying it violates the separation of powers and steps on the president s authority as commander chief 
The appeal said the state of Washington lacked standing to challenge the order and denied that the order  favors Christians at the expense of Muslims  
Congress gave the president  the unreviewable authority to suspend the admission of any class  of visitor  the Justice Department wrote 
 Courts are particularly ill equipped to second guess the president s prospective judgment about future risks   the appeal said  calling the decision  vastly overbroad  
Washington state lawyers worked around the clock last weekend against the backdrop of turbulent scenes at U S  airports  where immigrants were detained by federal officials unprepared to implement the president s directive 
A spokesman for Washington state attorney general Bob Ferguson didn t immediately comment early Sunday 
The U S  State Department and Department of Homeland Security said they were complying with Robart s order and many visitors are expected to start arriving on Sunday  while the government said it expects to begin admitting refugees again on Monday 
A decision to reinstate Trump s order could again cause havoc at U S  airports because some visitors are in transit  as was the case when the order took effect on Jan  27 
As the ban lifted Friday  refugees and thousands of travelers from Iran  Iraq  Libya  Somalia  Sudan  Syria and Yemen who had been stopped in their tracks last weekend by the executive order scrambled to get flights to quickly enter the United States 
The panel that will decide whether to immediately block the ruling includes three judges appointed by former Republican president George W  Bush and two former Democratic presidents  Jimmy Carter and Barack Obama 
U S  immigration advocacy groups including the American Civil Liberties Union on Saturday in a joint statement urged those with now valid visas from the seven nations  to consider rebooking travel to the United States immediately  because the ruling could be overturned or put on hold 
A U S  State Department email reviewed by Reuters said the department is working to begin admitting refugees including Syrians as soon as Monday 
Trump s Jan  27 order had barred admission of citizens from seven majority Muslim nations for 90 days  suspended all refugee admissions for 120 days and indefinitely barred Syrian refugees 
SEPARATION OF POWERS
It is unusual for a president to attack a member of the judiciary  which the U S  Constitution designates as a check to the power of the executive branch and Congress 
Reached by email Saturday  Robart declined comment on Trump s tweets

131255,352770,EXPE,Several states jointly sue to block Trump s revised travel ban,news,"By Mica Rosenberg  Reuters    A group of states renewed their effort on Monday to block President Donald Trump s revised temporary ban on refugees and travelers from several Muslim majority countries  arguing that his executive order is the same as the first one that was halted by federal courts  Court papers filed by the state of Washington and joined by California  Maryland  Massachusetts  New York and Oregon asked a judge to stop the March 6 order from taking effect on Thursday  An amended complaint said the order was similar to the original Jan  27 directive because it  will cause severe and immediate harms to the States  including our residents  our colleges and universities  our healthcare providers  and our businesses   A Department of Justice spokeswoman said it was reviewing the complaint and would respond to the court   A more sweeping ban implemented hastily in January caused chaos and protests at airports  The March order by contrast gave 10 days  notice to travelers and immigration officials  Last month  U S  District Judge James Robart in Seattle halted the first travel ban after Washington state sued  claiming the order was discriminatory and violated the U S  Constitution  Robart s order was upheld by the 9th U S  Circuit Court of Appeals  Trump revised his order to overcome some of the legal hurdles by including exemptions for legal permanent residents and existing visa holders and taking Iraq off the list of countries covered  The new order still halts citizens of Iran  Libya  Syria  Somalia  Sudan and Yemen from entering the United States for 90 days but has explicit waivers for various categories of immigrants with ties to the country  Refugees are still barred for 120 days  but the new order removed an indefinite ban on all refugees from Syria  Washington state has now gone back to Robart to ask him to apply his emergency halt to the new ban   Robart said in a court order Monday that the government has until Tuesday to respond to the states  motions  He said he would not hold a hearing before Wednesday and did not commit to a specific date to hear arguments from both sides   PROVING HARM Separately  Hawaii has also sued over the new ban  The island state  which is heavily dependent on tourism  said the executive order has had a  chilling effect  on travel revenues  In response to Hawaii s lawsuit  the Department of Justice in court papers filed on Monday said the president has broad authority to  restrict or suspend entry of any class of aliens when in the national interest   The department said the temporary suspensions will allow a review of the current screening process in an effort to protect against terrorist attacks  There is a hearing in the Hawaii case set for Wednesday  the day before the new ban is set to go into effect   The first hurdle for the lawsuits will be proving  standing   which means finding someone who has been harmed by the policy  With so many exemptions  legal experts have said it might be hard to find individuals who would have a right to sue  in the eyes of a court  To overcome this challenge  the states filed more than 70 declarations of people affected by the order including tech businesses Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  and  Expedia   NASDAQ EXPE   which said that restricting travel hurts their revenues and their ability to recruit employees   Universities and medical centers that rely on foreign doctors also weighed in  as did religious organizations and individual residents  including U S  citizens  with stories about separated families  But the Trump administration in its filings in the Hawaii case on Monday said the carve outs in the new order undercut the state s standing claims   The Order applies only to individuals outside the country who do not have a current visa  and even as to them  it sets forth robust waiver provisions   the Department of Justice s motion said   The government cited Supreme Court precedent in arguing that people outside the United States and seeking admission for the first time have  no constitutional rights  regarding their applications  If the courts do end up ruling the states have standing to sue  the next step will be to argue that both versions of the executive order discriminate against Muslims    The Trump Administration may have changed the text of the now discredited Muslim travel ban  but they didn t change its unconstitutional intent and effect   California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said in a statement on Monday  While the text of the order does not mention Islam  the states claim that the motivation behind the policy is Trump s campaign promise of  a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States   He later toned down that language and said he would implement a policy of  extreme vetting  of foreigners coming to the United States  
The government said the courts should only look at the text of the order and not at outside comments by Trump or his aides ",2017-03-13,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/washington-state-moves-to-block-trump's-new-travel-ban-in-court-465747,465747

131292,352807,EXPE,Expedia  EXPE  Is Up 7 24  In One Week  What You Should Know,opinion,"Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock s recent trend in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will be essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   With this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving that way  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks  this can be very tough to define  There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance  The Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Expedia  NASDAQ EXPE   which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B  We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score  like price change and earnings estimate revisions 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Expedia currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
Let s discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for EXPE that show why this online travel company shows promise as a solid momentum pick 
A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short term price activity  as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand  It is also useful to compare a security to its industry  as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area 
For EXPE  shares are up 7 24  over the past week while the Zacks Internet   Commerce industry is flat over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 8 44  compares favorably with the industry s 5 88  performance as well 
Considering longer term price metrics  like performance over the last three months or year  can be advantageous as well  Over the past quarter  shares of Expedia have risen 13 4   and are up 24 39  in the last year  In comparison  the S P 500 has only moved 1 12  and 5 31   respectively 
Investors should also pay attention to EXPE s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  EXPE is currently averaging 1 669 883 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions  in addition to price changes  Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well  A nice path here can help show promise  and we have recently been seeing that with EXPE 
Over the past two months  10 earnings estimates moved higher compared to 2 lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost EXPE s consensus estimate  increasing from  6 84 to  7 11 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  5 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 3 downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Taking into account all of these elements  it should come as no surprise that EXPE is a  2  Buy  stock with a Momentum Score of B  If you ve been searching for a fresh pick that s set to rise in the near term  make sure to keep Expedia on your short list ",2019-02-12,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/expedia-expe-is-up-724-in-one-week-what-you-should-know-200387331,200387331

131319,352834,EXPE,EXPE Or AMZN  Which Is The Better Value Stock Right Now ,opinion,"Investors looking for stocks in the Internet   Commerce sector might want to consider either Expedia  NASDAQ EXPE  or Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now  We ll need to take a closer look 
There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks  but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns  The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions  while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits 
Right now  Expedia is sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while Amazon has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold   This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions  so investors should feel comfortable knowing that EXPE is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent  But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in 
Value investors are also interested in a number of tried and true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics  including the popular P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors 
EXPE currently has a forward P E ratio of 17 08  while AMZN has a forward P E of 62 28  We also note that EXPE has a PEG ratio of 1 04  This figure is similar to the commonly used P E ratio  with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company s expected earnings growth rate  AMZN currently has a PEG ratio of 2 31 
Another notable valuation metric for EXPE is its P B ratio of 2 88  The P B ratio is used to compare a stock s market value with its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  AMZN has a P B of 20 50

131320,352835,EXPE,Why Expedia  EXPE  Is Poised To Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  Expedia  NASDAQ EXPE   which belongs to the Zacks Internet   Commerce industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
When looking at the last two reports  this online travel company has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates  The company has topped estimates by 33 40   on average  in the last two quarters 
For the most recent quarter  Expedia was expected to post earnings of  3 17 per share  but it reported  3 65 per share instead  representing a surprise of 15 14   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  0 91 per share  while it actually produced  1 38 per share  a surprise of 51 65  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Expedia lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Expedia has an Earnings ESP of  0 21  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on February 7  2019 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-01-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-expedia-expe-is-poised-to-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200379018,200379018
131321,352836,EXPE,Expedia  EXPE  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"The market expects Expedia  NASDAQ EXPE  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 7  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This online travel company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 06 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  26 2  
Revenues are expected to be  2 54 billion  up 9 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 12 08  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Expedia 
For Expedia  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 21  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Expedia will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Expedia would post earnings of  3 17 per share when it actually produced earnings of  3 65  delivering a surprise of  15 14  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

131325,352840,EXPE,Week Ahead  Treasurys  Gold  Dollar To Climb As Markets Discount Fed ,opinion,"U S  stocks show signs of weakness but mostly eke out gains to close the week
Demand for Treasurys and gold shows that investors elected to believe foreign central bankers over the Fed
Oil slumps on outlook for economic slowdown and rising U S  production
U S  stocks managed to mostly eke out gains on Friday  rebounding from losses earlier in the day and throughout the week  A rally in tech shares during the final minutes of the session boosted averages both for the day and the week 
The S P 500 Index manage to squeeze out a meager 0 07  increase on the final day of last week s trade  The benchmark s initial weakness was triggered by the Australian Central Bank  the Reserve Bank of Australia  RBA   which announced it was lowering growth expectations from 3 25  to 2 75  

The yield on the U S  10 year Treasury note fell on Friday for the fourth straight day  the result of growing fears of an economic slowdown  Technically  the yield closed below a continuation pattern  It s also the third straight week during which yields have been falling  as investors amass Treasury holdings  perhaps on fears that equities will be heading lower too 

The dollar climbed for a seventh straight session its longest rally since U S  President Donald Trump won the election in 2016 to its highest level since Jan  2  It was also the USD s biggest weekly percentage gain in six months  Technically  the price  which found support off the 200 DMA from Jan  31  for the second time  since Jan  9  jumped back over the 100 and 50 DMAs during the week 
In case investors are confused as to why the dollar would have its longest winning streak since the Trump bump over two years ago  specifically after the Fed turned dovish  it s because markets don t seem to be buying into Fed Chair Powell s reassuring comments of a positive economic outlook  The sharp uptake of U S  sovereign bonds  considered the world s most secure and liquid  attract foreign investors  who buy the dollar in order to pay for the bonds  It could also signal that rather than heed the Fed  investors are finding foreign central banks more credible 
The RBA s reduced GDP forecast for the 12 months to June 30 was accompanied by it similarly slashing its inflation forecast for the same period from 2 to 1 25 per cent  As well  its annual GDP and inflation forecasts for the year to June 2020 were cut from 3 25 and 2 25 per cent to 2 75 and 2 per cent respectively 
Better Than Expected Earnings Provide Friday s Boost
From a sector perspective  Communication Services   0 58   and Technology   0 58   saved the SPX from its worst weekly drop since the pre Christmas rout  spurred by better than expected earnings  It s noteworthy that defensive sectors Consumer Staples   0 47   and Utilities   0 43   were not far behind 
Financials   0 50 t  underperformed  in tandem with the dimming prospects of further rate hikes  Australia s warning reinforcing the Fed s recent perceived dovishness  Energy shares   0 46   tracked slumping oil prices back below  53 

Technically  the S P closed back above the 100 DMA  following its Wednesday selloff  after the benchmark bumped its head against the bottom of the 200 DMA on Tuesday 
On a weekly basis the index fared a bit worse than its Friday performance  gaining just 0 05   Defensive Utilities   2 07   led the pack 
However  cyclical Technology shares   1 98   were right behind  thanks to Friday s earnings beats for sector stocks including Expedia  NASDAQ EXPE  and networking equipment maker Ubiquiti Networks  NASDAQ UBNT   which helped to avoid a nearly flat week  Energy   3 01   fell the most since December on a weekly basis  mirroring WTI s fortunes for the same period 
Technically  the S P s paltry weekly advance  which whipsawed about 1 8  between an approximate 1 2  gain and a 0 75  loss on Friday  developed a high wave candlestick  after it found resistance at the 50 week MA  The candlestick s wild swings with no meaningful change in the closing price suggests that investors are more than just confused  they lacked guidance as to leadership  Therefore  the candle connotes the potential for a change in course for the market 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0 25  for a third straight day for an accumulated 1 2  loss  as a global trade resolution appears to be elusive  weighing on the mega cap index whose listed companies rely on foreign markets to support the robust growth shareholders have come to expect  Technically  the 30 component index closed off the lows of the day on Friday  finding support by a convergence of the 100 and 200 DMAs  as well as the downtrend line since Oct  3  after scaling above it on Monday  On a weekly basis  the Dow climbed 0 17   posting its seventh straight weekly advance  its longest since the 8 straight weekly advance that ended during Nov  2017 
The tech heavy NASDAQ Composite advanced 0 14  on Friday  making it the day s outperformer  Technically  the index found support for the second straight day at the 100 DMA  after  like the S P  falling since Wednesday and nearing the 200 DMA from below  On a weekly basis  the NASDAQ gained 0 47   for its seventh straight weekly increase  an accumulated 15 24  advance  Technically  the benchmark touched the 50 week MA and dropped  giving up a 2 02  advance 
The Russell 2000 eked out a 0 06  gain on Friday  which failed to rebound back above the 100 DMA  On a weekly basis  the small cap index advanced 0 29  for its seventh straight weekly gain  with a total advance of 16 82   Once again the Russell proves that its small cap stocks can outperform larger cap peers  It has provided the best results post Christmas  even as the financial media broadcast optimistic headlines on U S  Sino trade talks  Technically  the price attempted  but failed  to overcome the 100 week MA 
Friday s price action provides a classic example how in the markets   it ain t over till it s over   as stocks rebounded during the week s final minutes of trading 
Slowing Growth  Trade Worries Will Continue to Weigh on Markets
The primary reason Australia s economy had such a profound impact on U S  equities is that it underscored the writing already on the wall  which has been previously emphasized by European and British economic policy officials  who have all already lowered their growth outlooks  Last month the European Central Bank  ECB  said risks to the eurozone s economic outlook had shifted to the downside  while the European Commission this week slashed its outlook for growth across the region 
On Thursday  the Bank of England forecast 2019 U K  gross domestic product would grow at the slowest pace since 2009  Friday s RBA release deepened the negative prognosis for global growth now being delivered by global central banks 
As if these dimming growth prospects weren t enough  the U S  China trade front added additional pressure to the situation  On Friday  speaking at an event in Michigan  Cui Tiankai  China s ambassador to the U S  said the competition between the two countries shouldn t be considered a  zero sum  game  in which the  winner takes all   but rather should focus on cooperation  so that the results will be  win win  
Dan Clifton  head of policy research at Strategas forecasts that even if the U S  and China do reach some sort of resolution  that won t be the end of the trade war threat  He believes President Donald Trump will likely hit European autos with a 25  tariff 

Supporting our argument that dollar strength does not project an outlook for U S  economic growth right now  gold has been finding support at the  1 300 level during four of the last seven sessions  This occurred at the same time that the dollar rose  including the last two sessions 
Why would gold climb  even as the dollar strengthens  The two normally trade inversely  The dollar tends to gain when investors are willing to assume risk  meaning they clearly have have faith in further economic expansion 
Conversely  gold is buoyed when investors seek to preserve capital  when they become risk averse because the outlook for growth becomes gloomy  We d argue  therefore  that gold s rise ascent follows the same path as Treasurys  which boost the dollar when investors are in search of safe havens 
Furthermore  technically  gold is gearing up to continue climbing  The yellow metal may have completed a falling flag  bullish in an uptrend  and the 100 DMA is about to cross above the 200 DMA  after the 50 DMA already did so last month  triggering a Golden Cross 

Oil s rise and fall has echoed the outlook for global economic expansion  As such  its current slump is another nail in the coffin for the longest equities bull market on record 
The negative press the U S Sino negotiations continue to garner exacerbates the outlook for a slowdown  In addition  the number of active oil rigs in the U S  increased to 854  another headwind for slumping oil prices  Finally  the longest dollar rally since Nov  2016 further pressures the commodity  Technically  the price is retesting the uptrend line since the post Christmas risk on rally  which the 50 DMA protects from below  above the  50 50 level

131333,352848,EXPE,Bitcoin  miners  face fight for survival as new supply halves,news,"By Jemima Kelly KEFLAVIK  Iceland  Reuters    Marco Streng is a miner  though he does not carry a pick around his base in south western Iceland  Instead  he keeps tens of thousands of computers running 24 hours a day in fierce competition with others across the globe to earn bitcoins  In the world of the web based digital currency  it is not central banks that add new money to the system  but rather computers like Streng s which are awarded fresh bitcoins in return for processing blocks of the latest bitcoin transactions  Bitcoin can be used to send money instantly around the world  using individual bitcoin addresses  free of charge with no need for third party checks  and is accepted by several major online retailers  The work Streng s computers and others do serves two purposes  they record and verify the roughly 225 000 daily bitcoin transactions and   because they earn new bitcoins for the work they do   steadily increase the currency in circulation  currently worth around  10 billion  The process has come to be known as  mining  because it is slow and intensive  reaping a gradual reward in the same way that minerals such as gold are mined from the ground  But on Saturday  the reward for miners will be slashed in half  Written into bitcoin s code when it was invented in 2008 was a rule dictating that the prize would be halved every four years  in a step designed to keep a lid on bitcoin inflation  From around 1700 GMT on Saturday  instead of 25 bitcoins up for grabs globally every 10 minutes  worth around  16 000 at the current rate   there will be just 12 5  That means only the mining companies with the leanest operations will survive the ensuing profit hit    The most important thing is to be the most efficient miner   said Streng  the 26 year old co founder of German firm Genesis Mining  which has  mining farms  in Canada  the United States and eastern Europe  as well as in Iceland   When the others drop out  that means that they leave the market and give you a bigger share of the pie    SOLVING PUZZLES The currency was founded eight years ago by a person or group using the name Satoshi Nakamoto  whose real identity has not been established  It was set up to operate independently of any single authority  instead relying on a decentralized global network  Because the bitcoin miners operate autonomously  it is hard to track their numbers and size  But in terms of computing capacity it was estimated earlier this year that the network is 43 000 times more powerful than the world s top 500 supercomputers combined  Computers like Streng s solve complex  automatically generated mathematical puzzles to help secure each block of transactions and keep the bitcoin network safe from hacking or manipulation  For bitcoin users  that security is one of the currency s main attractions  After the first miner secures a block of transactions  its work is verified by the other miners in the network  and that block is added to the  blockchain    a shared record of all the transaction data   which is virtually impossible to tamper with  The mining  therefore  keeps the whole system going  Bitcoin is now accepted by major organizations including U S  online retailer  Overstock com   NASDAQ OSTK  and travel company  Expedia   NASDAQ EXPE   The speed and anonymity of bitcoin transactions  and lack of a central authority overseeing the currency  has drawn in many users  including those who want to get around capital controls  It has also attracted investors who see it as a potentially lucrative commodity in itself  KEEPING COOL Bitcoin mining started out as a hobby for tech geeks using their home computers in the early years of the virtual currency  but has become more specialized as bitcoin usage expands   As the bitcoin price has risen  as transaction numbers have grown and as the computers have become so specialized that they can only perform the function of bitcoin mining  a whole industry has emerged  It can be profitable if firms are able to keep their expenses low  But the costs of running these machines  which cost around  1 800 each  and keeping them cool are fiendishly high   Streng reckons that  on average  it costs about  200 in electricity  including cooling power  to mine one bitcoin  Equipment  rent  wages and business running costs are on top   On Saturday  all else being equal  the halving of the reward will double that cost  to  400  leaving a small margin for profit at the current exchange rate of around  640 per bitcoin   In the same remote region of Iceland as the Genesis mining farm  on a former Cold War U S  military base lies a bitcoin mining facility belonging to U S  firm Bitfury  A nearby sub station means electricity transmission costs are minimal  In the farm s two vast buildings  tens of thousands of mining machines whir away  producing a huge amount of heat  so the buildings are open to the cold Icelandic air at either side  save for particle filters to trap dust   Fans in the ceiling allow hot air to escape  but spin so fast that no rain or snow can enter during the winter  The noise produced by computers and fans is deafening  It is no coincidence that so many mining companies have chosen to build farms in Iceland   Chinese giant Bitmain also has a huge farm there  The volcanic island s cheap  bountiful  renewable energy supply  good internet connectivity  and cool temperatures make it an ideal location   The Icelandic authorities welcome the boost to the economy that the bitcoin miners have brought    Bitmain opened its farm after an approach by the Icelandic embassy in Beijing  Genesis s Streng says he is such a valued client that the Icelandic energy companies fly him around in helicopters   Bitfury CEO Valery Vavilov  who estimates electricity makes up between 90 and 95 percent of bitcoin mining costs  says one way his firm stays competitive is by making its own hardware   He also says the company  founded in 2011  is prepared for the mining reward cut   We re prepared   we already went through one halving event in 2012   he said   You can forecast this   so you have time to prepare  and if you re prepared you can live quite easily   Vavilov  and other miners  say the prospect of new supply halving has already helped drive bitcoin up over 50 percent this year  which should help ease the pain  COMPETITION FROM CHINA Despite the fact that the halving was expected  and that the price has risen  it has already claimed one casualty  Sweden s KnCMiner filed for bankruptcy at the end of May  citing the hit to its profits that the reward cut would bring  Daniel Masters  who runs a Jersey based bitcoin hedge fund and who bought a part of KnC s business  said the Swedish firm  like everybody else  had faced competition from miners in China  which are estimated to make up more than two thirds of the bitcoin network s computing power  or  hashpower    It turned out that the Chinese  who really stormed into the mining market in the last couple of years  could just do this whole thing cheaper   Masters said  Some Chinese miners get hydroelectric power from disused dams  while others use cheap coal powered electricity   Bitfury and Genesis  though  say their lean operations allow them to fight off the competition  Genesis  for example  keeps cost down by remotely monitoring conditions in its mining farms and adjusting its fans and cooling accordingly  And the next time the mining reward is halved  in 2020  they hope the number of bitcoin transactions will have grown sufficiently to mean that the small fees paid by users will make up enough of their income to smooth out the profit cut  
 By 2020 we will definitely have had the tipping point   said Bitfury s Vavilov ",2016-07-08,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/bitcoin-'miners'-face-fight-for-survival-as-new-supply-halves-413326,413326

131376,352891,EXPE,5 Stocks In The Spotlight On Solid Relative Price Strength,opinion,"Earnings growth and valuation multiples are indeed important for investors to determine a stock s ability to offer considerable returns  But these are also essential in determining whether a stock s price performance is better than its peers or the industry average 
If the stock s performance is lacking that of the broader groups despite impressive earnings growth or valuation multiples  then something must be wrong 
It s always advisable to stay away from these stocks and bet on those that are outperforming their respective industries or benchmarks  This is because betting on a winner always increases the odds of winning 
Then again  it is imperative that you determine whether or not an investment has relevant upside potential when considering stocks with significant relative price strength  Stocks delivering better than the S P 500 over a period of 1 to 3 months at the least and having solid fundamentals indicate room for growth and are the best ways to go about this strategy

Coming to price performance  Amazon has outperformed the  it belongs to on a 12 month basis  The company s shares have gained 73 97  compared with the industry s growth of 37 21  

Amazon s Two Hour Whole Foods Delivery
This February  Amazon rolled out its two hour delivery from Whole Foods stores to Prime members in four cities   Austin  Dallas  Cincinnati and Virginia Beach  Currently  this service is available in a few countries and will continue to expand across the United States 
The company pulls items from Whole Foods stores  bags them and gets the goods delivered by its own drivers  Moreover  delivery is absolutely free and within two hours  Customers in these cities can order Whole Foods groceries through Amazon s Prime Now app or website between 8 a m  to 10 p m  daily  The items include fresh produce  meat  seafood  flowers and other necessities that local Whole Foods stores stock 
The move came within a year of the e commerce giant s  13 7 billion acquisition of the supermarket chain  Whole Foods  The deal was certainly a strategic move by Amazon as it immediately gave the latter an access to Whole Foods  450 stores across the United States  thus giving it enough power to compete with brick and mortar giants like Walmart  NYSE WMT   Target  Dollar Tree  NASDAQ DLTR  and Dollar General

131410,352925,EXPE,Iranian Americans forge a rare bond to support nuclear deal,news,"By Yeganeh Torbati WASHINGTON  Reuters    On the day U S  and Iranian negotiators reached a historic nuclear agreement last month  Hadi Partovi threw an impromptu party in his backyard outside Seattle  setting in motion a rare expression of solidarity among the country s most prominent Iranian Americans  Partovi  who has invested in or advised some of the most well known global companies  including Facebook  O FB   Airbnb  and Uber  invited fellow Iranian Americans to his home to celebrate the agreement  which if implemented  would restrict Iran s nuclear program in exchange for lifting economic sanctions on the country   Roughly 100 strangers I d never met came to my house to celebrate  and I realized this was a unique moment for Iranian Americans to stand up together   said Partovi  who immigrated to the United States as a child in 1984  Afterward  Partovi organized the drafting of a public letter to the American people from prominent Iranian Americans in technology  business  literature  the arts and entertainment  Published this week as an advertisement in The New York Times  the letter   signed by current and former executives from Twitter  N TWTR   Google  O GOOGL   Dropbox and  Citigroup   N C   among others   expressed support for the nuclear agreement as a  unique opportunity for Americans and Iranians to connect   The 24 original signers spanned the political spectrum and would likely disagree on other issues  Partovi said  By Wednesday  the list of signatories had swelled to 1 500   The letter  in part  read   Diplomacy with Iran has the potential to do much more than prevent a war      It creates a chance for Americans and Iranians to create a brighter future that benefits all of our children   The nuclear deal between Iran and six world powers is a major achievement for President Barack Obama and could reset Iran s relations with the West  but it has opponents in the U S  Congress  where Obama has work to do   Graphic     The letter s organizers and signers said it was significant for being perhaps the first unified  non partisan statement of its kind by Iranian Americans  who can be reticent about embracing their background and speaking up on political issues   We wanted to make this personal   said Hamid Biglari  56  a former executive at Citicorp  who helped organize the letter   What struck many of us was the massive campaign that was being waged against the deal by many lobby groups  and we felt that much of that campaign was misguided   Biglari said he returned to Iran in 2014 for the first time in 35 years  following the election of President Hassan Rouhani  a moderate elected on a platform of lifting sanctions on Iran and improving its relations with the world   I came to the conclusion that this was real and that the time had come to break through this logjam that had existed for so long   Biglari said   If this opportunity goes by we will always regret it   NO SINGLE POLITICAL VIEWPOINT Estimates of the Iranian American population range from half a million to 1 million  according to the Public Affairs Alliance of Iranian Americans  an advocacy group  Significant communities reside in southern California  the San Francisco Bay area and New York   Many came to the United States after the 1979 Islamic revolution  In interviews  signers of the letter said the community is deeply fractured over Iranian politics   We don t mention in the letter President Obama  because some of the people signing the letter are not fans of President Obama   Partovi said   It was very important to me to not make it a letter by Democrats or by fans of any regime or any single political point   Those who have added their names to the letter include the inventor of LASIK eye surgery  a state senator  a NASA engineer  start up founders and professors  Maz Jobrani  a comedian who signed the letter  said it was one of the first times so many Iranian Americans had come together   There are Republicans and Democrats  scientists and performers  all kinds in this   he said  Another signer  Mark Zandi  chief economist at Moody s Analytics and who has advised both the Obama administration and Republican Senator John McCain s presidential campaign  said that while he comments often on economic affairs  this was the first time he was venturing into foreign policy   I signed on because I think the deal is in the best interest of the United States   said Zandi  who is a registered Democrat and whose father is Iranian   It s not a perfect deal  but it s infinitely better than no deal  and will significantly reduce the odds that Iran will obtain or even want a nuclear weapon in the future   he said  Congress has until Sept  17 to act on the agreement  If lawmakers disapprove it  they could take away Obama s ability to waive many U S  sanctions and implement key provisions  Anti deal activist groups are expected to spend millions of dollars lobbying lawmakers on the deal  Dara Khosrowshahi  chief executive of online travel company  Expedia  Inc  O EXPE   said he does not normally take public political stances but this issue had special personal resonance for him  He immigrated to the United States from Iran in the late 1970s  
 For the Iranian people not to have the chance to experience what America has to offer  the spirit and the openness  would be a real shame   said Khosrowshahi  46   There is a chance to open the dialogue between the people of Iran and the West  and it s a point in time that s unique  ",2015-08-13,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/iranian-americans-forge-a-rare-bond-to-support-nuclear-deal-355776,355776

131412,352927,EXPE,U S  DOJ says it will not challenge proposed  1 3B Expedia Orbitz merger,news,"Investing com    U S  federal regulators cleared the way for a  1 3 billion merger between two prominent online travel booking companies when the U S  Department of Justice said on Wednesday afternoon that it will not challenge  Expedia  s  NASDAQ EXPE  acquisition attempt of Orbitz  NYSE OWW   
The companies announced the proposed merger in February  shortly after Expedia completed its acquisition attempt of Travelocity  In the six months that have ensued  a spate of trade groups  legislators and consumer watchdog agencies have condemned the deal  issuing stark warnings on how it could stifle competition in the travel business  Some estimates claim that a deal could provide the newly created company with approximately three quarters of internet bookings through online travel agents 
Last month  Rep  Hank Johnson  D   Ga    the ranking member of the Regulatory  Reform  Commercial and Antitrust Law subcommittee  expressed further concern on the ramifications of a deal  noting that an already thin marketplace could be reduced to only two primary competitors   Expedia and Priceline   if the acquisition is completed 
Still  the Department of Justice dismissed the concerns after careful consideration  During a six month investigation  the Department met with lawyers and economists from the Antitrust Division  reviewed tens of thousands business documents  analyzed transactional data from the merging companies and interviewed more than 60 industry participants  it said on Wednesday in a statement 
 We uncovered no evidence in our investigation that the merger is likely to result in new charges being imposed directly on consumers for using Expedia or Orbitz   So we focused our investigation on the commissions Expedia and Orbitz negotiate with airlines  car rental companies and hotels   U S  Assistant Attorney General Bill Baer said in a statement   We  also  found that Orbitz is only a small source of bookings for most of these companies and thus has had no impact in recent years on the commissions Expedia charges   Many independent hotel operators  for example  do not contract with Orbitz  and those hotels that do often obtain very few bookings from its site

131427,352942,EXPE,EXPE Vs  AMZN  Which Stock Is The Better Value Option ,opinion,"Investors with an interest in Internet   Commerce stocks have likely encountered both Expedia  NASDAQ EXPE  and Amazon  AMZN   But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now  We ll need to take a closer look 
The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends  while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits 
Both Expedia and Amazon have a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  right now  Investors should feel comfortable knowing that both of these stocks have an improving earnings outlook since the Zacks Rank favors companies that have witnessed positive analyst estimate revisions  But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in 
Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional  tried and true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics  including the popular P E ratio  as well as the P S ratio  earnings yield  and cash flow per share  as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use 
EXPE currently has a forward P E ratio of 22 50  while AMZN has a forward P E of 126 76  We also note that EXPE has a PEG ratio of 1 55  This popular metric is similar to the widely known P E ratio  with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company s expected earnings growth rate  AMZN currently has a PEG ratio of 4 20 
Another notable valuation metric for EXPE is its P B ratio of 3 06  The P B ratio pits a stock s market value against its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  AMZN has a P B of 25 06 
Based on these metrics and many more  EXPE holds a Value grade of A  while AMZN has a Value grade of F 
Both EXPE and AMZN are impressive stocks with improving earnings outlooks  But considering the above metrics  value investors will likely feel that EXPE is the better option right now ",2018-05-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/expe-vs-amzn-which-stock-is-the-better-value-option-200320872,200320872
131428,352943,EXPE,Insight Enterprises  NSIT  Hits Fresh Highs  Is There Still Room To Run ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Insight Enterprises   NASDAQ NSIT    Shares have been on the move with the stock up 33  over the past month  NSIT hit a new 52 week high of  48 73 in the previous session  Insight Enterprises has gained 24 2  since the start of the year compared to the 8 9  move for the Retail Wholesale sector and the 21  year to date return for its peer group 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises  having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on May 2  2018  Insight Enterprises reported EPS of  0 94 vs the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 6 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 14 94  
For the current fiscal year  Insight Enterprises is expected to post earnings of  4 38 per share on  7 2 billion in revenues  This represents a 35 19  change in EPS on a 7 37  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  4 65 per share on  7 4 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 6 09  and 2 81   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Insight Enterprises may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for NSIT  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Insight Enterprises has a Value Score of A  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are A and C  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of A 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 10 9X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 10 6X versus its peer group s average of 10 6X  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective Insight Enterprises  Inc  Price and Consensus   Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Insight Enterprises currently has a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy  thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Insight Enterprises passes the test  Thus  it seems as though NSIT shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term 
How Does Insight Enterprises Stack Up to the Competition 
Shares of Insight Enterprises have been moving higher  and the company still appears to be a decent choice  but what about the rest of the industry  Some of its industry peers are also looking good  including Lithia Motors   NYSE LAD    Burlington Stores   NYSE BURL    and Expedia   NASDAQ EXPE    all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least  2 and a VGM Score of at least B  making them well rounded choices 
The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 4  of all the industries we have in our universe  so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for NSIT  even beyond its own solid fundamental situation ",2018-05-31,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/insight-enterprises-nsit-hits-fresh-highs-is-there-still-room-to-run-200320922,200320922

131440,352955,EXPE,Many big companies live in fear for their future in digital age,news,"By Eric Auchard FRANKFURT  Reuters    The top executives of many a corporate giant must feel like the fictional character Gulliver  waking up to find themselves under attack from modern day Lilliputians  small start up companies which overwhelm their established rivals with new technologies  The old powers of market incumbents   massive scale  control over distribution  brand power  millions of customer relationships   are no longer seen as the obstacles they once were to agile rivals with innovative business models      A new survey finds business leaders believe four out of 10 top ranked companies in their industries worldwide won t survive the next five years   They blame the accelerating change in technology  shifting business models and a need to merge to cut costs in order to ensure they don t become footnotes in someone else s corporate history       Not just lone companies  but entire industries are being side swiped by these effects   said James Macaulay  co author of the study  which polled 941 business leaders from a dozen industries in the world s 13 biggest economies       Digital disruption now has the potential to overturn incumbents and reshape markets faster than perhaps any force in history   the survey states  The report can be found at      The survey was conducted by a research center at top ranked Swiss business school IMD  the International Institute for Management Development  with backing from Internet equipment maker Cisco  where Macaulay works as a consultant        INDUSTRIES AT RISK     Industries with the highest number of top rated companies at risk were hospitality travel  media and entertainment  retail  financial services and consumer goods manufacturing  in that order  the survey showed      Meanwhile  industries which still largely deliver physical products or services such as pharmaceuticals  utilities and the oil and gas sectors were rated the least likely to be disrupted      Michael Wade  another co author of the survey  said there were some things software could not replace   Consumers are still unlikely to take an app if they get a headache   joked Wade  a professor of strategy at the Lausanne based IMD business school      But even for industries such as pharmaceuticals  where regulatory protections  high capital costs and complex production processes still rule  Wade said new threats are coming from start ups analyzing  big data  to offer a personalized approach to medicine  for example       Meanwhile in travel e commerce aggregators have taken millions of customers from direct bookings with hotels and airlines already struggling with a decade of decline in business travel amid the economic and structural challenges       Disruptive players are coming from out of nowhere   says Macaulay   Now it s individuals who want to rent their homes and vehicles   he said  referring to home rental service Airbnb  office sharing firm LiquidSpace and similar  sharing economy  start ups      Karl Ulrich Garnadt  chief executive of the German Airlines division of Deutsche Lufthansa  XETRA LHAG  AG  told venture investors in Berlin this month that his industry still spends too much time worrying about direct competitors in Asia or the Mideast      He noted how the industry missed the rise of mobile travel apps  the top dozen of which now collectively have a valuation around 88 billion euros   99 billion   while the market capitalization of Lufthansa  Europe s largest airline group  has shrunk to 5 5 billion euros from double that a decade ago       Today we are too limited in our thinking  We need to widen our horizon  we need to think like the customer   the airline industry veteran said      Toward that end  Lufthansa is seeking ways to woo back customers who expect them to deliver more than boarding passes to their mobile phones  With free on board Wi Fi soon to be available on every plane  he wants flight attendants to use new apps to help frequent travelers make new travel bookings in mid air       In banking big lenders are now all at giving board level attention to the rapid growth of  fintech  start ups in markets from mortgage lending to wealth management to small business loans      In an era of cloud computing and services delivered to smartphones  fintech start ups have no need to duplicate the retail branch networks that tied customers to banks  And new players aren t saddled with making heavy investments in creaky  decades old back office banking systems        Lending remains pretty much an archaic process for banks  largely based on paper forms that are designed to give customers a poor experience   said Martin McPhee  a senior vice president at Cisco who heads the company s consulting arm        Research shows that four out of five banking customers will happily leave their banks for a better customer experience   he said  HUNT OR BE HUNTED      In corporate circles  the most common sobriquet for these digital threats is Google  NASDAQ GOOGL  or  less frequently  Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN        But  depending on the industry  the big threat goes by different names  for automakers and transport companies  it is Tesla  the luxury electric car company  or Uber  the online taxi service  For hotels and airlines  it s Airbnb or Trivago  now majority owned by  Expedia   NASDAQ EXPE        Tesla has also hit the radar of utilities with its announcement in April on its  energy storage  business  which aims to produce batteries capable of solving the elusive problem of storing electrical energy produced at optimum times for use at other times   Everyone thought  Tesla founder  Elon Musk was building a car company  but now we find he is building an alternative energy company   McPhee said      There is also mounting wave of digitally inspired  cross border mergers  stepped up corporate venture funding and a willingness to place bigger bets on risky business models that can undermine a company s existing activities   BMW owned British carmaker Mini said this week customers would in the future be able to offer their private vehicles for car sharing  mindful of a trend amongst younger drivers to not have their own cars      The challengers offer massive improvements in how customers use the products or services of established businesses  They combine that with finding ways to slash costs and enter markets without investing heavily to own physical assets or distribution infrastructure  says McPhee       Uber  the online taxi hailing service is now applying similar strategies to sign up drivers to deliver everything from groceries to heavy equipment  in a challenge to logistics giants like FedEx  NYSE FDX  and UPS  
McPhee notes the historical parallel to what occurred after the advent of the Web in the mid 1990s  Just 25 percent of the Fortune 100 top U S  companies were still in existence 15 years later ",2015-06-25,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/many-big-companies-live-in-fear-for-their-future-in-digital-age-348195,348195

For the last few years  the company has been spending heavily on its new fulfillment centers  These are important in order to provide the level of service that customers have started expecting from Amazon 
In addition  there is exciting news for Amazon s Prime members  The company has announced that it will now offer exclusive discounts to Prime members who shop at Whole Foods  as well as deep discounts on select  best selling products  Those are in addition to the incremental 10  off already saled items  The Prime benefit at Whole Foods Market  NASDAQ WFM  will rollout nationwide  starting this summer 
Meanwhile  the company has been implementing perks for its Prime members in Whole Foods since it acquired the grocery chain last year for  13 7 billion  It already offers 5  cash back benefit to the prime members who use Amazon Prime Rewards Visa card while shopping at any Whole Foods store 
We believe  the company s continuous efforts in making Prime more customer friendly will continue to drive subscription base of the service  improving the top line further 
Over the last year  the company has outperformed the industry it belongs to  Shares of Amazon have gained 63 3  compared with the  s growth of 46 3  

Amazon s strong focus on enhancing the Prime service aided by exciting discounts  free delivery within a short period of time  expanding movies   video portfolio and many more  has helped the company achieve this feat 
More on the Headlines
The latest fulfillment center spans more than 855 000 square feet and will create 1 500 new full time jobs
Apart from that  this new facility will be primarily focusing on smaller items such as electronics  books  housewares and toys 
The world s largest online retailer has been strengthening its presence in Ohio where it has invested over  2 billion in the state  both in customer fulfillment infrastructure and compensation to its employees in the state  In the last few years  Amazon has announced multiple facilities in the state with healthy business environment and skilled manpower 
The online giant has created more than 6 000 full time jobs in Ohio  Using methodology developed by the U S  Bureau of Economic Analysis  Amazon estimates its investments in Ohio have created an additional 9 000 indirect jobs on top of the company s direct hires 
Bottom Line
We feel  Amazon must maintain its U S  market share  while expanding globally in order to retain its leading position  For this  the company needs to invest more in fulfillment as well as technology and content  especially in international markets with less penetration and higher growth rates 
Although increased expenses might hurt the company s bottom line in the near term  we believe this is necessary for the company to maintain its dominance in this highly competitive market Amazon com  Inc  Price and Consensus

131475,352990,EXPE,Ahead Of Zuckerberg s Testimony  Should You Buy Facebook  FB  Stock ,opinion,"Shares of Facebook   NASDAQ FB   rebounded about 0 5  on Monday  but the recently embattled stock is still down more than 14  over the past month as investors punish the social media company for its role in a data scandal that has raised serious questions about the safety of user information and personal privacy on the internet 
Facebook shares have been hammered after several media reports exposed an incident that gave Cambridge Analytica a political consulting firm with ties to Robert Mercer  Steve Bannon  and President Trump inappropriate access data on up to 87 million Facebook users 
Exactly what type of regulatory pressure Facebook will feel from the scandal will become more apparent after Mark Zuckerberg testifies in front of Congress on Tuesday  and investors got their first taste of what the CEO would say with the release of his prepared remarks today 
 It s clear now that we didn t do enough to prevent these tools from being used for harm as well  That goes for fake news  foreign interference in elections  and hate speech  as well as developers and data privacy   Zuckerberg wrote in the remarks   We didn t take a broad enough view of our responsibility  and that was a big mistake  It was my mistake  and I m sorry  I started Facebook  I run it  and I m responsible for what happens here  
Facebook has also reminded investors that it plans to increase its headcount to tackle data security issues  although Zuckerberg did recently mention that it would take three years for his company to fix the problems it is currently having 
Meanwhile  Facebook said it will both support the Honest Ads Act a proposed rule change that would apply the same regulations to ads on social media as currently apply to TV  print  and radio and reduce the information it shares with data brokers 
But with all sorts of uncertainty still looming  Facebook feels risky for the time being  Has the stock s recent selloff sent its valuation into a value territory that would outweigh this risk  Let s take a closer look 
Valuation
Facebook is currently trading with the lowest forward 12 month earnings multiple it has ever seen  It is also presenting a noticeable discount compared to its peer group  which includes internet giants like Alphabet   NASDAQ GOOGL    Baidu   NASDAQ BIDU    and Liberty Expedia  NASDAQ EXPE  Holdings   NASDAQ LEXEA   
Others in the internet space  especially Alphabet  will face the same regulatory scrutiny that threatens Facebook as data privacy comes to the forefront of our national attention  But that spotlight is firmly planted on Facebook right now  and although the stock is trading at a discount  investors must seriously consider whether that sale price is worth the risk 
Outlook
Facebook was poised to be one of 2018 s strongest tech stocks  with analyst sentiment remaining remarkably sound until just a few weeks ago  In fact  FB spent has spent a combined 13 weeks as either a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy  already this year 
However  that snapshot has changed in recent weeks  In just the past seven days  the company has witnessed two downward revisions to its current year EPS estimates and fiscal 2019 EPS estimates  That negative revision activity has dragged the stock down to a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  
While the proven Zacks Rank system is not screaming for investors to ditch the stock just yet  investors with any sense that we have just scratched the surface of this data privacy issue might see this recent activity has confirmation to avoid Facebook for now

Prices of the virtual currency have moved higher in recent sessions  following sharp losses suffered earlier in the month 
Market analysts have blamed various events for the downward trend  including a recent U S  government report that highlights the risks associated with virtual currencies  New York s BitLicense proposals  and the introduction of new sophisticated trading techniques 
A number of traders and market participants also attributed the recent decline to price manipulation by short term profiteers who are deliberately driving prices down to eventually buy them back at lows 
Global financial services provider Citigroup  NYSE C  said in a research note published Tuesday that bitcoin s price is poised for  acute instability  due to an oversupply of coins from miners and large merchants  along with a weak growth in demand 
The analysis points to the increased sophistication and cost of mining as a major driver for growth in bitcoin supply 
The reports adds that merchants that accept Bitcoin payments  such as Dell and Expedia  NASDAQ EXPE   are converting any bitcoin they receive from customers into dollar or euros  putting further selling pressure on the bitcoin price

131494,353009,EXPE,Travel Restrictions  Rising Costs Challenge U S  Hotel Space,opinion,"The hotel industry continues to be one of the fastest growing industries  Even during the economic recession  it showed little sign of weakness  However  given the recent technological advancements  barriers to entry have decreased leading to an influx of new participants 
In addition  unfavorable governmental policies  uncertainty in certain markets and RevPAR pressures pose challenges for industry players  The sum total of these headwinds will likely weigh on the industry s growth trend this year 
Below we discuss some of the headwinds that hotel stocks may face in the going forward
Stringent Immigration and Tourism VisaPolicies
On Dec 4  2017  the U S  Supreme Court allowed President Donald Trump s travel ban barring inbound travelers from six Muslim majority countries to go into full effect even in the face of legal challenges in lower courts 
Continuous efforts to impose travel ban targeting predominantly Muslim nations  along with the ban on a broad range of electronic devices in the cabins of U S  bound aircraft from certain countries and talks of expanding the same to other regions threaten travel demand to and from the United States  The administration has also talked about building a wall along the southern border to stop Mexican immigrants from entering the country illegally 
Trump s stringent policies on immigration and tourist visas appear to have made international visitors rethink their vacation plans in the United States  Notably  there has been a continued slowdown in U S  bound air travel bookings ever since Trump took office  Also  online searches by prospective travelers to the United States have also been witnessing a sharp decline 
In fact  per Tourism Economics  an industry research and forecasting firm  the drop in tourism is anticipated to result in 6 3 million lesser visitors in 2018  This adds up to a potential loss of  10 8 billion in revenues for the United States 
Thus  as tourists plan to steer clear of America  the local travel industry is bearing the brunt of his unpopular policies   With the United States losing some of its appeal as a destination  hotel businesses and the overall industry stare at billions in lost revenues 
Increasing Supply and Lower Visitation Weigh on RevPar
Most of the hotel companies in the United States have been witnessing slowing revenue per available room  RevPAR  trends of late because of muted international visitation  Moreover  an increase in supply of hotels in the domestic market is limiting room rents  thereby hurting RevPAR 
Operating margins for industry players are yet to reach the industry peak of 2007 in the United States  given the spike in costs  The companies are looking to differentiate themselves and keep pace with changing consumer taste through investments in technology  quick customer service and real time marketing  These are denting margins even further 
Additionally  most of these companies plan to gain competitive advantage and differentiate their brands through renovation  This will come at the cost of near term margins 
Meanwhile  as the economy improves and unemployment levels drop  the industry players will struggle to control their largest operating expense   labor costs  Rising salaries  wages and benefits  as well as increased staffing levels will add to their labor costs 
Moreover  the companies are unable to increase room rates consistent with the rising cost of operations  This makes it all the more difficult to match up to growth rates achieved in the last four to five years 
Additionally  online booking sites like The Priceline Group s  PCLN   TripAdvisor  TRIP  and Expedia Inc  NASDAQ EXPE    EXPE  are limiting the pricing power of these hotels  thus remaining an overhang on margins  Higher commission rates charged on hotels are also hurting margins  With lower overhead costs and relatively less stringent regulations than hotel companies  home sharing companies like Airbnb  Inc  are competing head to head with traditional players in certain segments of the market and even seizing share from them 
Uncertainty in Certain International Markets 
In spite of immense growth potential  industry players are still apprehensive of several macroeconomic issues like the social political impact of Brexit and decelerating growth in certain parts of Asia  Though Trump s stringent policies might make travelers opt for Europe and Asia  instead of the United States  these regions have their own share of concerns 
Notably  a sluggish economy and oversupply in Brazil are weighing on demand in the Latin American region and checked overall sales  In fact  a weak Latin American economy  aggravated by political turmoil led to softer tourism numbers in 2015  2016 and 2017  This is not expected to change much in 2018  Continued uncertainty in Africa and macroeconomic factors in Venezuela are likely to limited revenues hotel industry players 
In Europe  economic political conditions are expected to be challenging after U K  s exit from the 28 member economic bloc  Business in Europe is clouded by economic uncertainties in the Northern region and deflation in the Eurozone 
Terror assaults in key European cities like London  Paris  Zurich and Brussels have also affected tourism  Challenging market dynamics in France is a potent headwind  Additionally  concerns of further terror attacks and violence against foreign tourists are increasingly hurting trade in many African countries such as Kenya and Nigeria 
Meanwhile  in the Middle East  political unrest  lower government spending  new hotel supply and a tough oil market continue to hurt tourism and RevPAR trends  Any respite from these ills in the region is not expected in the near term 
Most of the leading hotel companies have considerable presence in the abovementioned markets and are thus vulnerable to adverse economic conditions in these regions 
Stocks to Avoid
A player in the space that induces our cautious to bearish outlook is China Lodging Group  Ltd   HTHT   The company carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  
You can see  
To Conclude
Continuous efforts to impose inbound travel ban from certain countries and stringent policies on immigration and tourist visas are clouding the prospects of the U S  hotel industry  Additionally  various geopolitical and economic woes  oversupply and higher costs are wreaking havoc on the hotel industry  Thus  softness in the lodging industry s growth is expected to continue in the near term

131506,353021,EXPE,Bitcoin Exchange Raided By French Authorities,news,"By    After a four month investigation  French authorities say they re the first to shut down a bitcoin exchange in Europe  The move comes as virtual currency advocates are calling for clear and modern regulatory guidelines in Europe and the United States 
Two men are in custody for trading the virtual currency without approval from France s banking authority  They also face charges of undeclared work  money laundering and pirating computer games  according to a report Monday in the Paris newspaper Liberation 
Prosecutors seized 388 units of the virtual currency  worth about  700 apiece  as well as computer equipment used to operate the exchange 
 This is the first time that an illegal exchange platform for bitcoins like this one has been dismantled in Europe   Olivier Caracotch  prosecutor in the southern town of Foix  said in a statement published by AFP 
Last week  police raided locations in the Riviera cities of Cannes and Nice and arrested the men  One was identified as a 27 year old Tunisian who set up the electronic exchange that traded bitcoins and euros  The other suspect was identified as a 36 year old French national 
The status of the five year old virtual currency lies in regulatory limbo in many countries  France allows the trade in bitcoins  but requires traders to be authorized by the ACPR  the country s banking authority 
In France  bitcoin related revenue wired to personal bank accounts without authorization can lead to money laundering charges  according to report last December from the Bank of France  The country charges sales tax on bitcoin transactions  but doesn t consider it an official currency because vendors aren t compelled to accept it as legal tender as they would the euro 
Advocates for bitcoin and other forms of virtual currency that are traded outside of any centralized banking authority have been calling for updated laws and more uniform rules 

 One of the challenges is that without clear guidance from the EU  from the UK  it will limit industry development   Jeremy Allaire  head of Circle  a consumer finance company that allows people to use and store virtual currencies online  recently told Reuters

131514,353029,EXPE,Take The Path Less Trodden   Buy These 5 Rising P E Stocks,opinion,"The common investing practice is to chase stocks with a low price to earnings  P E  ratio  That s because this basic measure of how much investors are spending for  1 worth of earnings speaks of undervaluation  The logic is simple   a stock s current market price does not justify its higher earnings and therefore leaves room for upside 
But have you ever given it a thought that stocks with a rising P E can also be worth buying  We ll tell you why 
Power of Increasing P E
The concept is that as earnings rise  so should the price of the stock  As forecasts for expected earnings come in higher  strong demand for the stock should continue to push up its prices  After all  astock s P E gives an indication of how much investors are ready to shell out per dollar of earnings 
Suppose an investor wants to buy a stock with a P E ratio of 30  it means that he is willing to shell out  30 for only  1 worth of earnings  Now if the P E ratio becomes 35 within a short span of time  it means that the person is now ready to pay  35 for only  1 worth of earnings  It shows that the investor expects earnings of the company to rise at a faster pace in the future owing to strong fundamentals 
So  if the P E of a stock is rising steadily  it means that investors are assured of its inherent strength and expect some strong positives out of it  Also  studies have revealed that stocks have seen their P E ratios jump over 100  from their breakout point in the cycle  So  if you can pick stocks early in their breakout cycle  you can end up seeing considerable gains 
The Winning Strategy
In order to shortlist stocks that are exhibiting an increasing P E  we chose the following as our primary screening parameters 
EPS growth estimate for the current year is greater than or equal to last year s actual growth
Percentage change in last year EPS should be greater than or equal to zero
 These two criteria point to flat earnings or a growth trend over the years  
Percentage change in price over four weeks greater than the percentage change in price over 12 weeks
Percentage change in price over 12 weeks greater than percentage change in price over 24 weeks
 These two criteria show that price of the stock is increasing consistently over the said time frames  
Percentage price change for four weeks relative to the S P 500 greater than the percentage price change for 12 weeks relative to the S P 500
Percentage price change for 12 weeks relative to the S P 500 greater than the percentage price change for 24 weeks relative to the S P 500
 Here  the case for consistent price gains gets even stronger as it displays percentage price changes relative to the S P 500  
Percentage price change for 12 weeks is 20  higher than or equal to the percentage price change for 24 weeks  but it should not exceed 100 
 A 20  increase in the price of a stock from the breakout point gives cues of an impending uptrend  But a jump of over 100  indicates that there is limited scope for further upside and that the stock might be due for a reversal  
In addition  we place a few other criteria that lead us to some likely outperformers 
Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Only companies with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  can get through 
Average 20 day Volume greater than or equal to 50 000  High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity 
Just these few factors narrowed down the universe from over 7 700 stocks to just 13 
Here are five of the 13 stocks that passed the screen 
Valley National Bancorp   NYSE VLY    This is a bank holding company whose principal subsidiary is Valley National Bank  The company belongs to an industry that has a Zacks Industry Rank in the  top 8  and carries a Zacks Rank  2  You can see  
JinkoSolar Holding Company Limited   NYSE JKS    This  2 Ranked company is a solar product manufacturer with operations based in Jiangxi Province and Zhejiang Province in China  It belongs to a Zacks Industry Rank in the top 25

131528,353043,EXPE,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  Marriott International  Hilton Worldwide Holdings  Choice Hotels International And Intercontinental Hotels Group,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   November 14  2017   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include Marriott International   NASDAQ MAR    Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc    NYSE HLT    Choice Hotels International  Inc    NYSE CHH   and Intercontinental Hotels Group  LON IHG    NYSE IHG   Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations   Here are highlights from Monday s Analyst Blog  Disappointed by Travel Service Performances  Buy These Hotel StocksOnline travel booking companies like Priceline  Expedia  NASDAQ EXPE  and TripAdvisor all reported mixed quarterly results  but investors punished the shares regardless In Priceline s case  the company s reported revenue and earnings of  4 43 billion and  35 22 a share  represent double digit growth from the year ago quarter and are ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate  While Priceline usually guides conservatively to come back and beat the lowered expectations  this time investors weren t willing to give it the benefit of the doubt   Expedia on the other hand  reported revenue and earnings that missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues still managed to grow from last year  What s worse  it lowered its EBITDA outlook for the year from 10 15  to a mid  to high single digit percentage rate TripAdvisor missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on the top line while beating on the bottom line  Earnings were below the year ago level When all the major players in any market produce unsatisfactory earnings reports  there s very likely to be a common factor hitting them  In this case  it s the hotels themselves Hotels generally share their inventory with online travel companies to facilitate the distribution of room nights for a fee  But as they grew larger and started enjoying the benefits of scale  these OTAs charged higher and higher fees  such that smaller hotels couldn t afford it  while larger hotels had to part with a good amount of their profits Or at least that is what hotels are saying through the American Hotel   Lodging Association  The association is looking to lobby people in the new administration and those serving in the ITC  objecting to what they call the companies  monopolistic business Another gripe with hotels is the online travel agents  refusal to pay occupancy tax  thus forcing hotels to pay Google  NASDAQ GOOGL  is also eating their lunch  The leading search engine is gaining on all fronts  first through advertising fees that companies like Expedia and Priceline pay and second  through services like Book on Google that lead customers directly to the hotel s app or web portal The hotel  then  offers loyalty points and other incentives to encourage customers to come directly to them instead of through an online travel agent  A recent report from Skift estimates that Google s travel business is now worth a  100 billion  or more than Priceline OTAs can t afford to sit and wait until all the business is lost  So they are investing heavily in marketing  This  again  is hurting their profits If this is a depressing picture  it luckily isn t the only alternative for investors looking for travel exposure  And indeed  since hotels are pitted against OTAs in this battle  why not invest in hotels themselves  So here is a list of hotels that are worth investing in right now Marriott International Marriott International is the world s largest hotel company  Marriott

131546,353061,EXPE,Sizable Declines In A Few Individual Stocks  Time To Review Allocations,opinion,"Much is going right as it relates to the equity markets around the globe  however  this past week saw the market punish companies that reported earnings that did not match market expectations  The below 2 week chart only lists a few of those companies  but companies like Celgene  NASDAQ CELG  down 28 1  and Expedia  NASDAQ EXPE  down 17 5  suffered much of their losses on one or just a few trading days   These sharp declines have impacted a handful of stocks  but investors should evaluate their own reaction to this type of decline in a single stock in the event a double digit decline materializes for the entire market  The S P 500 Index has gone 338 trading days without a pullback of more than 5  which began in June of last year   In a recent article by Alan Steel    he notes 
 historically speaking  markets eventually go down  And a look at double digit losses in the S P 500 from 1928 to 2016 shows the following averages  5  losses three times a year  10  losses once a year  15  losses once every two years  and 20  losses once every three to four years  In other words  once every four years an asteroid destroys part of the village  
Given the strength in the equity markets since the end of the financial crisis  now is a good time for investors to review the allocation of their investments as it relates to target levels they are comfortable with  As noted above  5  and 10  equity market declines occur more frequently than investors have recently experienced  These out sized pullbacks by a few individual stocks may serve as a cautionary variable for investors  Also  the Advance Decline Volume Line  a breadth indicator based on Net Advancing Volume  which is the volume of advancing stocks less the volume of declining stocks  is showing some negative divergence  When declining volume exceeds advancing volume  this can be an indication of a potential reversal in the respective index   Importantly  company fundamentals seem to be improving at a time economies around the globe seem to be in   Not only are companies generating positive earnings growth  expected to grow low double digits this year and low double digits again in 2018 in the U S   but top line revenue growth is now being realized  Friday s U S  GDP growth for the third quarter was reported at 3 0  marking back to back quarters of 3 0   GDP growth for the first time since 2014  This and other economic data suggests the economy is strengthening as well  These positive factors have not gone unnoticed by many investors resulting in strong year to date equity returns around the world  
The strongest equity returns are being generated in markets outside the U S  as can be seen in the above performance chart  The emerging market index return is almost double the S P 500 Index return  The strong returns being generated in non U S  markets are supported by improving company fundamentals  As the below chart shows  where U S  earnings  maroon line  exhibited strength since the end of the financial crisis  emerging market and EAFE related earnings growth is now accelerating relative to the U S  as can be seen by the steeper slope of the their lines  the blue and green lines below  
The point for investors is a market pullback is overdue and could be of the magnitude experienced recently by a few individual stocks  Given the strength of equity returns  especially in the U S   now is a good time to review ones overall asset allocation  However  based on what we see today we do not anticipate a recessionary environment near term and believe a pullback would be healthy and a part of normal equity market action

payment services  AppFolio  Inc  is headquartered Goleta  California Recent News and EarningsThe company recently reported Q2 17 earnings where they beat both the Zacks consensus earnings and revenue estimates for the fifth consecutive quarter   Total revenues grew by  37   and total billings were up  32 2  on a year over year  YoY  basis   The Value  services saw the biggest YoY improvement in revenues as they were up  43    The Property Management arm of the business saw the number of customers increase by  17  YoY  and the number of units under management rise by  22  YoY   The Legal segment saw customer growth improve by  21  YoY to almost 9 000 customers   The average revenues per unit jumped up by  38  as management streamlined sales  improved marketing performance  and targeted higher value customers   Due to the impressive quarterly performance  management increased FY 17 guidance from a range between  136 138 million to a range between  138 139 million indicating a  31 32  YoY increase   The Board of Directors also announced that the current CEO Brian Donahoo will be retiring and that Jason Randall will take over the position   Mr  Donahoo will be available through the end of the year to ensure a smooth transition   Mr  Randall was the SVP  and has been with the company for over nine years   While the retirement was not expected  the street viewed the transition as a positive    Cree Inc  NASDAQ        a Zacks Ranked  5  Strong Sell  company is a market leading innovator and manufacturer of semiconductors that enhance the value of solid state lighting  power and communications products by significantly increasing their energy performance and efficiency  Key to Cree s market advantage is its world class materials expertise in silicon carbide and gallium nitride for chips and packaged devices that can handle more power in a smaller space while producing less heat than other available technologies  materials and products Recent Earnings ResultsLast week  management announced both F4Q17 and FY 17 results and overall it was a mixed bag   First the positives  both the LED and Wolfspeed businesses did better than expected on a year over year  YoY  basis  LED product revenues were up almost 10  while Wolfspeed revenues were up  8 4    Now the negatives  on a YoY basis the company saw declines in revenues  8   non GAAP net income  78 9    On a fiscal year basis for 2017 revenues were down  9  while non GAAP net income was down  43 2    The big drag on the company was the lighting segment which saw revenues fall by almost  21  YoY  due to increased competition   This is not just a quarterly event as the segment has been underperforming for over a year   Another issue facing the company is the search for a new CEO as the previous CEO announced his departure in May   But there has been little to no movement on this front   Further  the current management team announced significantly increased capex plans  rising to an estimated  220 million from just  87 million in FY 2017   This increase in spending is almost solely focused on the Wolfspeed segment with the goal of doubling its capacity over the next 12 months   Given the increased expenditures  management was forced to reduce F1Q17 revenue guidance from an expected consensus of  361 million to a range of  353 367 million   But EPS is expected to

131590,353105,EXPE,Bitcoin Has No Yield  But Gold Does ,opinion,"Last week  we said 

It is commonly accepted to say the dollar is  printed   but we can see from this line of thinking it is really borrowed  There is a real borrower on the other side of the transaction  and that borrower has powerful motivations to keep paying to service the debt 
Bitcoin has no backing  Bitcoin is created out of thin air  the way people say of the dollar  The quantity of bitcoins created may be strictly limited by Satoshi s design 

We referred to the dollar as being borrowed into existence  to make our point that the dollar s value is pretty firm  due to the struggles of the debtors  By contrast  bitcoin is created ex nihilo  yes  yes  at a limited rate and subject to an ultimate cap on its quantity  
A reader took exception to the idea  and asserted that bitcoin is borrowed and lent all the time  We would like to address this  though first noting that this reader failed to address our point  A bitcoin is not  itself  a debt  It is not borrowed into existence  Now we will consider the reader s point whether there is any real borrowing in bitcoin at all 
The problem with borrowing a currency which its proponents tell us will go up another 30 times  and which has gone up 6 6 times in the past year  is that your payment is going up  Would you buy a house with a monthly payment of  1 000 a month  knowing this payment would go up to  6 000 by the end of the year and to  180 000 in a few more years 
That reader dismisses such concern by noting that all transactions have risks  But this is not an ordinary risk  This is the risk of shorting a once in a generation technology boom  Anyone who borrowed bitcoin a year ago at  585 would be bankrupt today at  3850  The last time we had such a craze was the dot com boom of the late 1990 s  Few would have shorted the NASDAQ  Perhaps nimble and aggressive traders  but certainly not ordinary businesses who were just trying to finance building a new retail store or buying a machine 
We say  shorting   because that is the simplest and clearest way to understand borrowing in a foreign currency  If you borrow bitcoin  or Argentinian pesos  then you owe the return of that same quantity of bitcoin  or pesos  plus interest  If you borrow to finance a dollar expense in a dollar generating business  then you have in fact established a short position in bitcoin  You are betting it will go down  or at least not go up  When it has gone up 660  so far and promises to go up another 3 000   you suffer huge capital losses 
Any dollar generating business should borrow in dollars  That way its short position is in the same currency as its long position  Its short position is its debt  and its long position is its revenue stream  When the currencies of liability and asset match  then the business has no net currency exposure  Its risk is purely entrepreneurial will customers want its products at a price it can profitably sell them 
Thus we say that  in theory no one  except a bitcoin miner  should borrow in bitcoin  And in practice anyone who borrowed a year ago is now certainly bankrupt  Only a bitcoin miner has a primary bitcoin income  We say primary to distinguish from something that is common today  Many businesses  from Overstock to Expedia  NASDAQ EXPE   accept bitcoin in transactions  but this is something else entirely 
They are businesses with dollar expenses  and set their prices in dollars  They just calculate a bitcoin amount  based on the dollar total in the shopping cart divided by the current price of bitcoin  When the customer pays  the bitcoin is immediately sold into the market  and the merchant gets the precise dollar amount that it wanted  Typically  a third party earns a small fee on the transaction 
The customer might swear that he paid in bitcoin  But that s not accurate  What really happened is four party transaction 
Customer has bitcoin  wants Merchant s goods
New Bitcoin Speculator has dollars  wants bitcoins
Merchant has goods  wants dollars
Bitcoin payment processor enables parties  1 through  3 to transact by selling Customer s bitcoins to New Bitcoin Speculator for dollars to pay to Merchant
The merchant who accepts bitcoin does not receive the bitcoin  The merchant receives the dollars  A bitcoin buyer out there in the world receives the bitcoin 
It is no different than if a money changer loitered near a merchant stall in a market bazaar in the ancient world  A foreigner wants to buy spices  but has the wrong kind of coins  The money changer figures out the exchange rate  takes the foreigner s coins and pays the merchant in domestic coins 
Only  today on the Internet  this is done instantaneously and without the awareness of the customer 
We can think of only one kind of business with primary revenues in bitcoin  A miner  A miner could finance the purchase of more computer equipment by borrowing in bitcoin  as its income is in bitcoin  It has no currency risk  and indeed would have a currency risk if it borrowed in dollars  
Yet  this reader persisted  Bitcoin has a futures market now  Look at the term structure  he said  Now  we were really interested  A futures market and a forward curve  Hmmmm 
We did some looking around  and found some bitcoin futures exchanges  Each is different  Settlement on contract maturity is not clear to us at this point 
But one thing is clear  The purpose of these exchanges is to allow speculation on bitcoin with leverage  They are not warehousing markets as we see in commodities  coordinating seasonal production with year round consumption 
According to our reader  there is a forward curve  in 30 minutes of Googling  we were not able to find a web page that showed prices of various contracts perhaps because we are looking on the weekend   He offered  on Monday  Aug 7  that when bitcoin was  3 370  the Sep 29 contract  53 days  was  3 435 2  This is a difference of  65 20  Contango 
It is important to note that this is a dollar profit  to be made on one s dollars  If one had  3 370 one could use the bitcoin market to make more dollars  One would simultaneously buy 1 bitcoin and sell 1 bitcoin contract forward  about two months to maturity   One would end with the same dollars  plus pick up an additional 65 bucks  or about 12  annualized  This 12  is not based on any move in the price of bitcoin  and in fact one would have no exposure to change in price 
Regular readers will note that this is a carry trade  which occurs in the gold market all the time 
There is no way to start with 1 bitcoin  and end with 1 12 bitcoins  Try to work out how this could be done  If you sell the bitcoin and buy the future  that is a decarry  Decarrying would lose money  more than carrying could make  
The bitcoin futures market would seem  we are taking the reader s price quotes at face value  to offer a rich interest rate on your dollars  We assume this is because of the risks of these fledgling bitcoin futures markets  Does anyone even know if they are calculating margin correctly  segregating it properly  and managing the clearinghouse with an appropriate level of financial controls 
If there were no risk  then anyone with access to borrow at LIBOR  about 1 25  for two month duration  could crush this spread  Instead of  3 435 20  a two month contract should sell for  3 377  based on  3 370 bitcoin   Instead of  62 20  one should be able to make around  7 
So as it stands  we see no real evidence of bitcoin lending and borrowing  We looked and found one open request to   this borrower says he will use the loan proceeds to buy machines to mine bitcoin  
We see that even if there is a working bitcoin futures exchange  it offers a dollar yield on dollars  not a bitcoin yield on bitcoin  Like with gold  The gold forward rate is not a gold yield  It s a dollar yield to carry gold 
Gold offers an arbitrage that is not available in bitcoin  One can borrow dollars  buy gold  sell a future  and lend the gold out to a business that is using gold  As gold is a physical good  there are businesses that do things to transform its purity  shape  and location  For example  refiners and jewelers  It s simpler and less expensive for them to  needs in gold directly from Monetary Metals  than it is to borrow dollars and hedge the price risk 
Thus  bullion banks perform the arbitrage described above all day long  In theory one could do similarly with bitcoin  but that would only make sense if there were bitcoin generating businesses who borrowed in bitcoin 
And  back to our original point  the bitcoin itself is not borrowed into existence  It is printed  again  at a controlled rate with an ultimate cap on quantity   Therefore  bitcoin s value is set purely by speculators only  So long as speculators expect the price to keep rising  they will keep buying and fulfill their own prophecy  When the chart begins to look ugly all speculators are looking at the same chart then the price action will turn 
Behind each bitcoin  there is not a debtor bidding up bitcoin with the products of his labor 
As of this writing  the price of bitcoin is now  4 150  This is a gain of  780 from the time of our discussion with the reader  If one had borrowed bitcoin at that time  as the reader insisted one could reasonably do  one already suffers a monthly payment 22  higher than it was earlier this week 
We believe principles of economics can be examined and validated this week  Find a concrete example  and see how the theory works out  If borrowing a rising currency is hazardous to your wealth  what does that say about bitcoin s suitability for borrowing  When its price begins to fall again  it has happened before  then the destruction occurs on the other side  Borrowers  gains will come from speculators  pain  we insist it s speculators  not savers bitcoin is not a suitable vehicle for savings  
The prices of the metals was up sharply this week  especially on Wednesday  Was it manipulation  Yes  we know  we are not supposed to ask if price rises are manipulation  Only price dips can be manipulation  and rises are just nature taking its course  But we ask anyways 
Ok  no  No  it was not manipulation  We saw exactly the change in the gold and silver bases that we would expect in a rising market  We will show graphs of the basis  the true measure of the fundamentals 
But first  here are the charts of the prices of gold and silver  and the gold silver ratio 

Next  this is a graph of the gold price measured in silver  otherwise known as the gold to silver ratio  The ratio moved down sharply this week 

In this graph  we show both bid and offer prices for the gold silver ratio  If you were to sell gold on the bid and buy silver at the ask  that is the lower bid price  Conversely  if you sold silver on the bid and bought gold at the offer  that is the higher offer price 
For each metal  we will look at a graph of the basis and cobasis overlaid with the price of the dollar in terms of the respective metal  It will make it easier to provide brief commentary  The dollar will be represented in green  the basis in blue and cobasis in red 
Here is the gold graph 

The dollar fell this week  the mirror image of the rising price of gold   now down to not much over 24mg gold  And the basis rose a bit  11bps  Gold became a little more abundant  but not a lot  at the higher price  About  28 higher 
Our calculated gold fundamental price rose about  15     About half as much as the market price went up 
Now let s look at silver 

In silver  the move up in the basis is greater  Keep in mind that we are approaching the expiry of the September silver contract  so a rising basis is a move against the pressures of the contract roll which is ongoing 
Our calculated silver fundamental rose  0 46  chart    Whereas the market price is up  0 80 
Speculators are pushing up the price a bit more than the firming fundamentals would justify  Are they manipulating the price of the metal  Of course not  All buying causes price to rise  And speculators are hoping to profit  as they reckon it  in dollars  from the rise  They don t care  or mostly know  that the price is being driven more by speculators than by buyers of metal  They just want to sell at a higher price than they bought 
Last week  we asked rhetorically 

So is the silver selloff over  It s hard to tell  The fundamentals were firming this week the fundamental price did not move down much during the move    0 09 from Thursday to Friday  On the other hand  speculators may be putting in sell orders over the weekend and may decide to bail out on Monday  Momentum can be self fulfilling 

Clearly the selloff was over  Fundamentals beat momentum  It happens every time  though the timing of the victory and the elasticity of the speculation is impossible to predict 
One thing is for sure  If the fundamentals don t continue to firm up further  or at least hold at the present level  then this rally is doomed like all of the others in the last 6 years ",2017-08-14,Keith Weiner,https://www.investing.com/analysis/bitcoin-has-no-yield-but-gold-does-report-13-august-2017-200207039,200207039

131619,353134,EXPE,3 Reasons Why Expedia  EXPE  Is Poised To Beat Earnings,opinion,"Expedia  Inc    NASDAQ EXPE   is set to release its quarterly earnings report after the closing bell on July 27  Expedia is one of the world s leading travel services companies  The company provides wholesale travel to offline retail travel agents  Expedia s main businesses and brands include  Expedia com  Hotels com  Hotwire  Expedia Corporate Travel  and Trip Advisor 
Expedia currently sports an impressive Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and has defeated its earnings projections in three of its past five operational quarters  including a whopping beat of 50  last quarter  Additionally  Expedia operates within the Internet Commerce industry  which currently sits in the top 23  of the Zacks Industry Rank 
The company possesses a respectable Zacks Rank  a strong earnings history  and an astounding Earnings ESP of 16 67   These factors should contribute to a sense of optimism for investors as we approach Expedia s report 
If that s not enough  here are 3 other reasons why you should be bullish on Expedia as earnings season continues 
1        Expansion via Acquisitions
First  Expedia acquired Venere  Trivago and Wotif in order to increase inventory all over Europe and other territories  especially in the business travel segment  The company continues to collect smaller hotel agencies in an effort to establish a legitimate campaign and brand in Europe  Wotif significantly increased Expedia s presence in Australia and New Zealand  and integration into the existing business is also expected to yield multiple cost synergies 
Furthermore  Expedia closed acquisitions of Travelocity  Orbitz  and HomeAway  The acquisition of Travelocity eliminated a key competitor to Expedia  while also lowering the company s overall operating costs  Orbitz has added important flights technology  particularly on the business side  and helped the company consolidate its leading position in the domestic market  Finally  the latest acquisition of HomeAway allows Expedia to offer vacation rental apartments  a completely new area for the company with significant growth prospects 
These deals were announced in 2015  so Expedia has had some time to full incorporate the new companies into its own business  We re finally starting to see how Expedia can benefit from the improved efficiencies these acquisitions offer 
2        Intriguing Growth Prospects
Expedia features numerous characteristics of a company that has the ability to continue growing  which is underscored by its  A  grade for Growth on our Style Scores System  Expedia possesses current cash flow growth of 49 61  and projected sales growth of 15 52   both of which defeat the industry averages of 40 54  and 7 17   respectively  Also  Expedia holds a net margin of 3 36   which also looms over the current industry average 
Furthermore  Expedia is projected to real in  2 54 billion in revenues  which would constitute strong year over year growth of 15 82   Also  Expedia is expected to report earnings of  0 60  which would represent an impressive 49  year over year growth 
3        Growth in Sales Within Key Divisions
Expedia has also shown promising growth potential in several key segments  For example  according to our consensus estimates  domestic revenues are projected to increase by a respectable 14 2  year over year to  1 45 billion  These consensus estimates are also calling for international sales to jump to an impressive  1 12 billion  which would signify year over year growth of 21 1  
Additionally  sales from many of Expedia s subsidiaries are expected to greatly increase this quarter  For instance  revenues from HomeAway are projected to increase by a whopping 31 2  to a total of  225 7 million  Also  the company is expected to report revenues from Trivago of  305 03 million  which would represent year over year growth of 51 7   
These consensus estimates are from our exclusive non financial metrics estimate file  These estimates are updated daily and are based on the independent research of expert stock analysts

131649,353164,EXPE,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  Expedia  TripAdvisor  Priceline Group  Marriott International And Hilton Worldwide Holdings,opinion,"For Immediate Release

	Chicago  IL   July 14  2017   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Industry  Hotels  Part 1  including Expedia Inc  NASDAQ EXPE    NASDAQ         TripAdvisor  NASDAQ         Priceline Group Inc   NASDAQ         Marriott International  Inc   NASDAQ        and Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc   NYSE        

	Industry  Hotels  Part 1

	Link  

	The U S  hotel industry started 2017 on a strong note with solid demand supporting modest growth in both occupancy and average daily rate  ADR  in first quarter 2017  Revenue per available room  RevPAR  also increased 3 4  

	This is reflected in the industry s stock price performance  Over the past six months  the Zacks Hotels and Motels industry has fared better than the broader S P 500 index  While the industry has gained 12 5   the broader index has added only 6 9  

	Despite moderate first quarter GDP growth of 1 2   low oil prices  rising employment  higher real income  and increased household net worth reinforced consumer confidence and sentiment  This has resulted in a steady rise in business and leisure travel  and higher transaction volumes  which is likely to continue 

	Positive economic outlook  GDP projected to rise 2 2  in 2017  is also expected to keep the mood upbeat  supporting continued albeit decelerating growth for the U S  hotel industry for the rest of the year  Even then  peaking supply growth is expected to put pressure on pricing power  thereby tempering the performance somewhat 

What Do Numbers Say 

	Statistics underscore the expectation of moderating but positive performance by the hotel industry  A recent report by PricewaterhouseCoopers  PwC  shows that new supply is likely to rise 2  in 2017  slightly below the anticipated demand growth of 2 1   This is likely to result in a 0 1  rise in occupancy rates in 2017 to 65 5  

	Though both ADR and RevPAR are projected to climb 2 3  in 2017  the rate of increase will likely be less than the average growth recorded in the past few years 

	Additionally  as per CBRE Hotels  Americas Research  ADR and RevPAR are expected to rise 2 9  year over year in 2017  while occupancy is projected to inch up 0 1  

	Meanwhile  the Baird STR Hotel Stock Index  which comprises 20 of the largest market capitalization hotel companies publicly traded on a U S  exchange and attempts to characterize the performance of hotel stocks  fell 2 4  in Jun 2017  However  in the first six months of the year  the index rose 25 4   much higher than its 19 6  rise in the same period last year 

	Thus  while overall demand in the U S  is likely to remain strong  driven in part by firming group travel  increasing supply growth is anticipated to lead to stabilizing occupancy levels  ADR and RevPAR are expected to continue to increase  but at a slower pace than earlier expected  impacted in part by comparatively lower growth in the overall economy 

What s Hurting the Hoteliers 

	Uncertainty  both international and domestic  continues to weigh on the performance of the U S  lodging industry 

	On the one hand  the strengthening U S  dollar and its impact on inbound  international travel is expected to keep the industry s growth at check On the other hand  negative sentiment related to traveling to and from the U S  given the Trump administration s stringent policies on immigration and tourism visasis bad for hotels 

	Additionally  higher costs  increased supply along with pockets of geopolitical instability and economic slowdown are likely to continue to pose headwinds 

	Though prospects of lower taxes  reduced regulations and updated trade policies proposed by the Trump administration should contribute to economic improvement  capital market surge and rising business and consumer confidence  the majority of these changes are unlikely to take effect until at least 2018 

	Meanwhile  hoteliers have been focusing on renovation and digital and marketing initiatives to boost traffic and capitalize on growing tourism numbers  However  to do so  steep costs incurred by leading hoteliers are taking a toll on profits  Moreover  high labor costs will continue to be a major concern for hoteliers  and as they won t be able to boost ADRs as much as they would like  their profits may be dented further  In fact  online travel agents like Expedia Inc   NASDAQ         TripAdvisor  NASDAQ        and The Priceline Group Inc   NASDAQ        are also limiting the pricing power of these brands 

	Another major threat comes from home sharing companies  like Airbnb  Inc   which offer digital service allowing travelers to book homes at holiday destinations  With lower overhead costs and far less regulations than what hotel companies have to comply with  these firms have made steady inroads into the industry and are grabbing share from giants likeMarriott International  Inc   NASDAQ        and Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc   NYSE        

Strong Stocks that Should Be in the News

	Many are little publicized and fly under the Wall Street radar  They re virtually unknown to the general public  Yet today s 220 Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buys  were generated by the stock picking system that has nearly tripled the market from 1988 through 2015  Its average gain has been a stellar  26  per year

131689,353204,EXPE,Alliance MMA  Meet The Newest MMA Superstar,opinion,"Alliance MMA Inc  NASDAQ AMMA 
Finally  for those investors that have been patiently waiting to grab an investment into the multi billion dollar mixed martial arts  MMA  market  the opportunity is now  Alliance MMA  in Q4 of 2016  has become the first and only MMA company that is publicly listed and actively traded on the NASDAQ marketplace  Despite the acquisitive momentum generated during the previous six months  current share prices hardly reflect the intrinsic value already created by AMMA management 
Thus  for fans and investors alike  to borrow the phrase   iiit s tiiime  to introduce investors to a ground floor investment opportunity into a rapidly emerging MMA stock  Alliance MMA  AMMA  
The AMMA story and business plan are strong  and the acquisition and roll up strategy implemented since October of 2016 is beginning to deliver the intended results  a basis for a recurring revenue stream that provides both visibility and significant growth potential  And  because the market has apparently ignored the recent spree of acquisitions  shares may represent a bargain at current levels  a statement based on the unreflected value of the ten revenue producing fight promotion companies recently purchased or in LOI agreements by Alliance  each expected to generate revenue in 2017  But  to be clear  revenue generation won t end with this initial tranche of acquisitions  Alliance has intentions to acquire quite a few more revenue generating companies before the end of 2017  So  stick with me 
In AMMA s current form  mixed martial arts fight promotion will provide the biggest bang in revenues for the company  but the AMMA strategy goes well beyond one dimensional reliance on fight promotions as their only source of income  Already  Alliance MMA is quickly taking advantage of its post IPO status  creating what many believe will lead to the company becoming a lucrative value proposition within the broad scope of MMA production  Through their aggressive and strategic  roll up  strategy  AMMA is rapidly embarking on its multifaceted business plan  designed to build a substantial multi regional footprint  Focused not only on fight promotion  but AMMA is also intent on recruiting a dedicated and formidable emerging fighter talent pool  as well as continuing to rapidly and efficiently build its media and services production capability 
First and foremost  let me make one thing clear  Few companies  AMMA included  are looking to go head on against the major league promoters  Instead  smart companies like AMMA are putting themselves into the role of being an active and complementary niche player  with a goal to recruit and develop competitive fight talent that may one day be promoted to compete in the main championships under the UFC or Bellator label  The more fighters that AMMA can advance  the stronger the demand will become for emerging fighters wanting to be represented by AMMA promotions 
Developing its niche space  Alliance MMA has been pushing a concentrated effort toward the promotion of mid level events  introducing and featuring emerging talent that can ultimately position AMMA as a premier  feeder league   with AMMA intent on promoting its fighters to compete within the mega name promotion companies in the industry  The company is well on their way to accomplishing this goal  already setting into motion a plan designed to facilitate orderly and consistent growth  AMMA has been active in acquiring prominent and successful local and regional promotion companies and attracting and signing the most promising emerging talent  fighters   Additionally  AMMA is taking advantage of its well diversified executive team who can exploit opportunities of different scale and direction  whether it be fight promotion  media  or distribution and sales based production 
Even though the company has only recently emerged as an influential multi regional promoter  AMMA is demonstrating to competitors in the industry that it has both the ambition and firepower to quickly develop and acquire the pieces required to perpetuate the aggressive  but managed growth strategy  And  it s for that reason that AMMA has been extraordinarily successful in the acquisition of small  but influential regional promoters  A colleague familiar with the industry made it simple to understand  He said that promoters are not  selling out  to AMMA  they are  selling in   knowing that becoming a part of the greater good can have a long standing and mutual benefit  And  he added that at the pace at which AMMA is rolling up these regional companies  it wouldn t take long for them to establish a significant and respectable position in the MMA industry 
Alliance MMA Using A Roll Up Strategy
With highly capable management in place  the mission and focus at AMMA are well defined  providing the strategic road map for what the company intends to achieve during 2017  Utilizing a  roll up  strategy  AMMA is committed to creating a premier promotional showcase for emerging mixed martial arts fighters  in particular for those competitors who have aspirations of advancing to the sport s highest level of professional competition 
Since becoming a public company in Q4 of 2016  AMMA has been aggressive but disciplined  in taking advantage of its new capitalization  acquiring or retaining the services of seven regional fight promotions  a fighter management firm  an electronic ticking platform  and a media production company  Each component at AMMA will be fully developed and is expected to provide a synergistic platform that will have every business soon contributing to current operations  These significant promotion acquisitions have proven their value by producing MMA events that have generated intense fan interest  have led to the signing and representation of a diversified stable of recognized and emerging fight talent  and have shown consistent ability to provide profitable event cards on a local and regional basis 
With the first tranche of acquisitions complete  AMMA is showing no signs of slowing down or losing its deal making momentum  To the contrary  AMMA is continuing its quest to identify and acquire successful regional promotions  as well as expanding their MMA fan base by simultaneously acquiring and developing a world class media production and distribution business  In other words  management is showing that they will not be content until they successfully develop an all encompassing company  one that can promote fights  create and market media opportunities  and facilitate the ticketing and venue partnerships for each of its events  For AMMA  once these synergies become more mainstream to each event  the more likely it becomes for unencumbered dollars to fall to the bottom line After closing its IPO  AMMA was purposeful and strategic right from the start  acquiring Hoosier Fight Club  Cage Fury Fighting Championships  Combat Games MMA  Shogun Fights  V3 Fights  GoFightLive  and CageTix 
The good news for investors is that AMMA had no plans to slow down  To the contrary  AMMA has continued to press on the accelerator by acquiring additional MMA promotions and then integrating them into a seamless and efficient AMMA business platform  With each acquisition  the intent is to realize significant cost savings by taking advantage of synchronized business platforms that will not only provide economies of scale but will also strengthen AMMA s ability to leverage their growth quickly  These savings may also become a tool to advance the vision of AMMA s aggressive growth model that can transform AMMA into a prominent  fully integrated promotions and media company 
Where AMMA Wants To Position
Recall what was noted earlier  AMMA is not developing a business model to go head to head with the giants in the industry  However  don t insinuate that management is not entirely committed to getting deeply entrenched in the fight business because they are 100  focused in that endeavor  And  better yet  investors can expect that management will also play it smart  finding the niches between those giants and scooping up many of the dollars that these jumbos gave gotten too large to see  And for a company like AMMA  with strict cost controls and a small float of shares  it does not take too many of these shrewdly found dollars to turn a profit 
To get those dollars  though  they need good events  For AMMA  a huge priority is to identify and attract the best of the best from the emerging fighter pool  Just as top athletes tend to go to the best sports programs throughout the United States  AMMA s intent is to position themselves as the top  mid level promoter   From there  they can sign and eventually promote high performing fighters  albeit likely a small number  to the next level of competition  which in the best case scenario for a fighter would be the UFC  So  whereas the UFC is keen to sign and keep its high profile fighters  AMMA s goal is to nurture rising fighters through the development phase and get them promoted to the next level of competition  For AMMA  even though they lose a top fighter and potential event favorite  there is value in doing so 
Consider it this way  to exploit the potential value in bringing up competitive fighters  AMMA is  in essence  intending to build a  super mid level conference   Now  I use the term for example purposes to illustrate the business model for AMMA as it relates to their mid level event concentration  As a top promoter of developing talent  AMMA is working to become the primary conduit to the highest competitive level in the sport in the eyes of professional prospects  Each of the promotions acquired by AMMA has already proven capable of moving fighters to the next level  specifically to the UFC  These  up listing  placements then create a well established reputation that creates real demand for fighters to sign exclusive promotion agreements with AMMA properties  As more competitors rise in class  to the UFC or Bellator  for instance  it becomes a marketing windfall for AMMA in their continuing ability to attract emerging new talent 
While in most cases the best talent tends to get acknowledged in the fight game  it s important to note that even the best competitors are often at the mercy of their promoter  Consequently  if not provided prime time opportunities to showcase their skills  the short career window for advancement slowly begins to close  as the longevity in the fight business is not a long term proposition  For a fighter to maximize their potential and to prosper in the fight business  it is imperative that they align their career ambitions with a promoter that has both credibility and a proven track record to move fighters up in class 
With that said  AMMA is proposing that its acquisition and development strategy will aid in building a substantial and sustainable development system to the top MMA promotion companies  The greater the intrinsic value provided to fighters by AMMA  the greater the likelihood that the company will continue to sign and represent top emerging talent  At that point  AMMA can leverage their success by attracting top  developmental stage competitors and becoming an in demand promotion company attracting those fighters that have the ambition and determination to fight at the highest levels 
As the talent recruitment and regional acquisition strategy continue to materialize  AMMA will simultaneously focus on expanding its national sponsorship opportunities  and also intensify its local and regional sponsorship agreements  By capitalizing on core strengths to generate higher sponsorship rates based on its fight talent and premium fight cards  AMMA creates an intrinsic opportunity for increased event exposure and sponsorship demand  creating an additional revenue segment from their core business 
MMA growth is also organic  and AMMA will be a clear benefactor  It s undisputed that MMA is one of the fastest growing sports in the world  and with the sport sanctioned in all 50 states  there is also no shortage of demand for MMA on a global basis  So  while considering the value proposition here at home for AMMA  investors should not discount the opportunities that will present themselves through both domestic and international distribution agreements 
Building Upon History
With ten acquisitions already completed  two more acquisitions pending with LOI agreements and additional purchases anticipated before the end of 2017  AMMA will be positioned to promote over 125 events per year  with the potential for that number to be considerably higher based on the company s business strategy 
Additionally  banking on the experienced management in place at AMMA  the focus will be on increasing revenue from each acquisition by expanding the average annual number of events for each promotion  with targeted increases of between 10  20  at each company  The financial benefit of promoting additional events becomes more cost accretive based on AMMA s consolidated business platform  taking advantage of economies of scale  reducing redundancies  and capitalizing on venue partnership opportunities that offer substantial compensation opportunities from locale s or sponsors looking to host events 
Over the next eight months  AMMA will be managing the expansion of events held by its acquired target companies  as well as from prospective target acquisitions  The current plan calls for a total of 20 regional promotion companies to be rolled up under the AMMA umbrella  Once in place  AMMA has publicly stated their intent to maximize revenue opportunity from each by orchestrating over 125 MMA events per year  highlighting over 1 000 of the nation s top emerging fighters under promotional contract  Remember  AMMA is not trying to be an  average promoter   it is their intention to be the  highest performing mid level promoter  in the industry  attracting the best of the best from an enormous pool of available fighters  And don t expect AMMA to fill it s event cards with just any low ranking competitor  AMMA intends to promote quality  not quantity during their sanctioned events  solidifying AMMA s reputation as they continue to build the brand 
Once the regional pieces are connected to create a national market presence  AMMA then will look to leverage its name and credibility to secure sponsorship arrangements with many prominent consumer name brands  In addition to sponsorship revenue  AMMA will seize upon its sizable library of media content  taking advantage of assets within the target companies to monetize film  print  and online media  At that point  the profitability equation becomes apparent  and the sum of the parts may become the product for substantial revenue growth and bottom line profitability 
The AMMA Management Can Deliver Results
Like any emerging company  active and experienced management is essential  and AMMA is not short on executive talent by any means  AMMA is led by a diversified and well experienced team of professionals  including 
Paul Danner  Chairman   Chief Executive Officer  Former CEO of three publicly traded companies  including a Nasdaq listed roll up venture  A broad based executive with Fortune 50 experience who has conducted business operations on five continents  Mr  Danner formerly served as a Naval Aviator flying the F 14 Tomcat

AMMA Building A Sizable Portfolio Of Promotions
After completing its IPO  AMMA has embarked on a steadfast journey to begin the process of maximizing shareholder value  Now  being just six months old as a publicly traded company  AMMA has quickly built a stable of revenue generating promotions  each having strength on a regional and national scale  Of the ten post IPO acquisitions made  seven are MMA promotion companies  one is a digital media sports platform  another specializes in facilitating an electronic ticketing platform optimized for marketing MMA events  and one provides a significant boost in its fighter management division with the acquisition of SuckerPunch Entertainment  A brief introduction to each is certainly warranted

Going forward under the Alliance MMA umbrella  each of these regional promotions and acquisitions will continue to operate under their respective names  leveraging the valuable brand equity they ve built over the years 
Capital Structure And Liquidity
Beyond the significant opportunities already being realized at AMMA  the emerging story would not be complete until the specifics of both the capital structure and cash liquidity details are noted  In that respect  if  as an investor  you are looking to take a position in the only publicly traded MMA stock  it will be reassuring to know that AMMA is about as clean as they come regarding capital structure and cash liquidity 
AMMA is carrying no historical baggage  Unlike many newly listed small cap stocks  AMMA did not reverse split into a former shell of the past  taking on no legacy issues or past reputation  The most recent 10 K shows nothing but clean agreements  no disgruntled legacy shareholders  and an outstanding share count that sits at only 9 022 308 shares  Importantly  of those roughly  9 million shares  only 2 222 308 shares are not being held tightly by insiders  These metrics leave a tidy capital structure at AMMA  free of debt and in a strong position to capitalize on the direct revenue models being brought forward by the recent spree of accretive acquisitions  Investors should pay little attention to those outspoken investors  or legal eagles  who point to the delay in the first 10 K filing as a red flag 
To them  I say  what better way for management to expressly show their commitment to full disclosure than to delay their first 10 K filing until they were 100  comfortable with their accountant s confirmation of opinion  Despite the headlines made by incentivised commission based legal teams  AMMA did the right thing 
They completed  without deceit  each obligation outlined and mandated by the SEC  Investors should praise management and use those conspicuous legal headlines as a part of next years firewood 
On a liquidity basis  AMMA reported over  4 7 million in cash under their 2016 10 K report and a stock treasury that enables the company to issue up to a total of 45 000 000 shares on a fully diluted basis  No worries about the O S climbing to the hundreds of millions here  with a cap at 45 million shares  the Treasury holds ample firepower to continue the acquisition process without serious near term dilution to current shareholders 
With no skeletons in the closet and a cash balance that offers near term growth opportunity without the fear of significant dilution  investors may find an entry at these levels a welcome opportunity  Keeping in mind that each promotion acquisition is immediately accretive to current revenues  the purchases made by the company also come with the near term financial benefit  Thus  while there may be some sporadic near term dilution to continue the build out  shareholders should also recognize the value of those assets almost immediately  and according to the business model  investors should model their yearly projections at between 10  20  higher than current revenue and event figures show 
The Scorecard
AMMA is interesting on several fronts  each of which may offer significant and near term value appreciation to shareholders  First  the low share count and the immediate impact of acquisitions plays directly into bringing the company to profitability in relatively short order  Second  with no debt  and a management team that is bent on building shareholder value  the pace at which the company is delivering on its stated goals is quite encouraging  While investors should not necessarily expect the company to become profitable in the next few months  there is certainly the strong likelihood that AMMA is clearly positioning themselves for a strong 2017  taking advantage of the significant momentum gained at the end of 2016 
Finally  from an investment perspective  finding an opportunity like AMMA  with no legacy issues  a clean balance sheet  a low share count  and experienced management in place  is a comforting spot for investors to consider a position in the company  With the company demonstrating the ability to make all of the right moves  I expect that the shares will soon knock out the stubborn resistance  and work their way higher  Once investors catch a clue as to what AMMA is actively building  shares may indeed show the strength to recapture all its IPO price of  4 50 and more  From there  guidance and acquisition are the keys  and as long as the deals continue to be accretive to growth  I believe that the share price will win the bout  moving higher in knockout fashion

131707,353222,EXPE,Well Founded Optimism Around Trivago IPO,opinion,"Television watchers may recognize Trivago advertisements plastered on their screen  and the travel company will be launching more of them  The Dutch travel tech company recently released additional details about their IPO  which will launch this week and stated they hope to raise up to  by selling shares at a price ranging from  13 to  15  Trivago will file under the NASDAQ with the label TRVG 
Investors may be put off by the fact that Trivago has never made a profit  as well as how travel company behemoth Expedia will continue to retain control over Trivago  But  there is a lot to like about this company  Trivago s advertising has continued to be a success  its revenue has dramatically grown  and the market for online bookings should only continue over time  For now  Trivago looks like a solid investment  Can it be profitable 
In its most recent   Trivago calls itself a  global hotel search platform  and states that

Our brand positions us as a key starting point for travelers searching for their ideal hotel 

Trivago is different from Expedia  NASDAQ EXPE   as it does not let users book hotels directly  Instead  it lets them search and compare hotels and their prices  at which point Trivago forwards the user to another website from which they can book 
Trivago makes money through advertising and by accruing referrals  It states that 

In the twelve months ended September 30  2016  we had 487 million qualified referrals and offered access to approximately 1 3 million hotels in over 190 countries 

Online hotel booking has become more popular as customers continue to search for the best deals  and Trivago has gained brand recognition through a heavy advertising campaign  Their tight jean wearing  middle aged spokesman with the full head of hair has become an icon on TV  The result is that its total revenue jumped from  535 million in all of 2015 to  657 million for just the first nine months of 2016  However  its net loss increased from  42 5 million to  57 8 million over the same period due to heavy expenses associated with such an advertising campaign 
Trivago cannot just pull back on the advertising front because it needs to build its brand awareness  The company s goal is to become the premier search destination for bookings  but this means competing with both regular search engines like Google  in addition to other travel related search engines like Booking com  Consequently  it may be difficult for this company to make an immediate jump to profitability  Potential for Growth
But while Trivago may not be profitable for now  it can report that its advertising spending is proving effective   notes that

the return on advertising spending by region were 88 percent in the Americas  131 percent in developed Europe and 114 percent in the rest of the world 

Trivago has indicated that it intends to use the proceeds raised in the IPO to continue its advertising campaign  which is a solid use of its funds and indicates the company s willingness and desire to grow 
Furthermore  there is a lot to like both about the shape of the travel industry and the ways in which it can benefit Trivago  National Thanksgiving travel numbers reached record highs since 2007  and we can expect similar positive number over the holidays  Furthermore  while online booking has been around for a long time  it will continue to grow more popular 
Discerning customers will look for the best deals  which should make travel search websites like Trivago more popular  Combine that with its heavy focus on improving its brand and there is every reason to believe that Trivago very well could reach its goal of becoming the top travel search website despite the intense competition  Look into this IPO
The two main concerns with Trivago should be its lack of profitability  as well as the control which Expedia will retain over the company  Expedia bought Trivago in 2012 and will retain over 60 percent of the shares  with an additional 30 percent going to Trivago s founders  This will limit shareholders  ability to influence the company  and Trivago s searches are heavily biased both towards Expedia as well as its rival Priceline  And over the short term  Trivago s heavy focus on improving its brand through advertisement means that the company will continue to be unprofitable 
But as long as Trivago continues to grow and travel numbers continue to look good  investors should be interested and not worried  Customers will want a search engine beyond Google to find the best booking deals  and Trivago offers that service and boasts a relatively widespread brand appeal thanks to its advertising campaign  As long as its revenue numbers continue to grow as it has  investors should look into this company and expect good short term to medium term growth ",2016-12-10,Alex Newman,https://www.investing.com/analysis/well-founded-optimism-around-trivago-ipo-200169280,200169280

131721,353236,EXPE,Trivago IPO  Are Tech and Travel Rising Again ,opinion,"In a bit of good news for the tech IPO market  hotel search engine company Trivago has filed for an IPO which could see the company raise up to  400 million  Trivago has not determined the number of shares nor their price  and will list their shares on the NASDAQ with the symbol  TRVG    among other sources reports that Trivago could debut before the end of 2016  and the company appears to want to debut as soon as possible given earlier reports of a Thanksgiving IPO  Trivago s debut as well as the upcoming IPOs of bigger companies like Snapchat could indicate a revival of a tech IPO market which has been moribund through most of 2016 
Trivago s high revenue growth and increasing return on advertising are good signs  but investors have reasons to be concerned about the future state of the travel industry in general  Still  Trivago looks to be a good buy in the near future  Traveling Up or Down 
In its SEC filing  Trivago calls itself a  global hotel search platform  which helps travelers find their ideal hotel  It was founded in Germany over a decade ago and has much stronger name brand recognition in Western Europe and Canada compared to the United States 
This emphasis on Europe is important given how recent political events could shake up the travel industry  U S  travel to Mexico could increase given how the peso has fallen to the dollar since Trump s election  but travel to and from the United States could decrease as Europeans may be convinced that the United States is no longer as welcoming a country 
Travel industry experts indicated a  towards the election result  with some suggesting that fears are overblown while others pointing out positive and negative effects of a Trump and Republican administration  However  this mixed reaction in and of itself points to uncertainty as so many wonder just what precisely will come out of a Trump administration  which is not good for the industry as a whole 
But while there may be uncertainties about the travel industry  Trivago itself has grown a great deal over the last few years  The company s revenue has increased from  209 1 million in 2014 to  378 7 million in just the first nine months of 2016  It should be noted that Trivago has not actually managed to make a profit during that time frame and its losses have increased from  23 1 million to  51 million in the same time span  While these increased losses may be concerning  taking into consideration   Trivago does not have a debt problem and could become profitable if it was less focused on expanding its growth 
I also like the fact that Trivago intends to use the proceeds collected from the IPO for largely general corporate purposes and to  increase our public profile and awareness   Further expansion of their search capabilities and ability to pick up both hotels and advertisers is a sign of Trivago s commitment to growth  Don t Forget Expedia  NASDAQ EXPE 
That last reason to launch an IPO is interesting when investors remember that Trivago is not actually an independent company  Travel company Expedia bought a majority share of Trivago in December 2012 and currently owns more than 60 percent of the company 
This is important because this is not the first time Expedia has placed part of its company in an IPO  In December 2011  Expedia spun off TripAdvisor Inc  NASDAQ TRIP   TripAdvisor steadily grew in value for the next two to three years  though the stock has struggled since as TripAdvisor has faced challenges trying to go into instant booking 
But even if TripAdvisor has struggled recently  Expedia and Trivago can look at what they have done and use it for their IPO  Trivago is also testing bookings like TripAdvisor and is primarily focusing on making the experience easier for consumers  While TripAdvisor s struggles may worry investors about Trivago s efforts  instant booking does have significant potential which could make this pay off in the long term  A probable buy
This year has been incredibly chaotic and unpredictable  but that has not stopped people from travelling  In fact  experts predict that we will see a record number of travelers for this holiday season partly due to lower fuel prices 
Trivago is popular outside the United States with both users and advertisers  is debt free  and analysts should feel confident about the travel industry s prospects in the short term future  Since the IPO is launching soon  my conclusion is that Trivago could be a pretty good buy over the short term and may very well end up following TripAdvisor s pattern at the start 
Keep an eye out for general economic news  especially the number of Americans who travel abroad over Thanksgiving and the holidays  That should be a good initial sign for Trivago s prospects ",2016-11-18,Alex Newman,https://www.investing.com/analysis/trivago-ipo:-are-tech-and-travel-rising-again-200165578,200165578

Top Research Reports for Today

Today s must read reports are for Qualcomm     Priceline    and Walgreens     

Shares of Qualcomm declined over the last trading session due to broader market concerns  But the analyst still likes the buy rated stock for its leadership position in the global wireless baseband chipset market and its growing presence in related opportunities such as mobile computing and IoT  The company s new patent license agreements with Chinese smartphone makers should boost Qualcomm s top line and also solidify its footing in the Chinese market   You can  

Priceline  s shares also moved lower over the last trading session due to rate hike related concerns  However  the analyst remains optimistic about the buy rated stock since its strong quarterly report has helped sustain the stock s positive momentum  which reflect the online travel vendor s impressive execution and strong growth in an otherwise tough macro environment  With almost 80  of its bookings coming from international markets  Priceline s guidance shows none of the issues that we saw with peers Expedia  NASDAQ EXPE  and tripAdvisor   You can   

Walgreens   shares were down by over 2  following the U S  FTC s update regarding the Walgreens store divestment  needed for the Rite Aid acquisition to be closed  The analyst still likes the stock since the proposed buyout of Rite Aid  should expand Walgreens Boots  business realm in the U S  over the long term  Walgreens continues to hold a strong cash position  which is evident from its increased cash flow reserve in the last reported third quarter   You can

Nevertheless  Everbridge s first day of trading once again proves that investors are accepting of tech IPOs right now  With recently public tech stocks like Acacia Communications   NASDAQ ACIA    Twilio   NYSE TWLO    and Line   NYSE LN   all up big since their debuts  it looks like the time for tech companies to IPO is now

Our TakeTripAdvisor is an online travel research company that features reviews and advice on hotels  resorts  flights  vacation rentals  vacation packages and travel guides  to name a few  The company reported a weak second quarter with both the top line and the bottom line missing our estimates The company s solid fundamentals  growth initiatives  partnerships to boost hotel bookings  strong focus on developing its mobile products  expansion into the international restaurant reservation space and improvement in user growth and engagement  especially related to mobile devices will help the company to achieve desired results Additionally  TripAdvisor s acquisitions complement its travel product portfolio  These also improve efficiency and expand user base  on one hand  while increasing traffic  hotel shoppers and profits  on the other  Over the long term  the company is well positioned to grow  given its expanding user base  improving margins and increasing monetization of social and mobile platforms However  mounting expenses due to new initiatives and investments are hurting the company s profits  Also  lack of visibility and intensifying competition from Priceline  Expedia   NASDAQ EXPE   and Alphabet   NASDAQ GOOGL   remain future growth concerns Currently  TripAdvisor has a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   A better ranked stock in the same space is PetMed Express  Inc     NASDAQ

131841,353356,EXPE,What s In Store For Thomson Reuters  TRI  In Q2 Earnings ,opinion,"Thomson Reuters Corporation   TO TRI   is slated to report second quarter 2016 results on Jul 28  In the previous quarter  the company s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 9 1  
Notably  in the trailing four quarters  the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate with a positive earnings surprise of 8 9   However  it remains to be seen if Thomson Reuters will be able to keep its positive earnings surprise alive 
Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Zacks Model Shows Unlikely Earnings Beat
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Thomson Reuters is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  2 or 3 for this to happen  Thomson Reuters has an Earnings ESP of 0 00  as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 49 cents  The company carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   which when combined with ESP of 0 00  makes a surprise prediction difficult    
Factors Influencing This Quarter
Management remains optimistic about the company s future performance  given its constant endeavors to implement core strategies and progress toward achieving its financial goals  We believe that its cost containment efforts  share buyback plan and impressive performance of the underlying subscription revenues  which account for most of the total revenue  bode well  On the other hand  adverse currency fluctuations may play a spoilsport in the quarter to be reported 
Thomson Reuters remains focused on its financial objectives  The company has been working tirelessly to achieve its earnings target for 2017  The company also intends to keep improving its  free cash flow per share as it did in 2015  Further  the company continues to boost its organic growth via strategic investments in its highest growth market THOMSON REUTERS Price and EPS Surprise

131895,353410,EXPE,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  Expedia  TripAdvisor  Priceline Group  Starwood Hotels   Resorts And Steel Marriott International,opinion,"For Immediate Release

Chicago  IL   July 21  2016   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Hotels  including like Expedia Inc  NASDAQ EXPE       TripAdvisor     Priceline Group Inc      Starwood Hotels   Resorts Worldwide  NYSE HOT  Inc     and Marriott International  Inc      

Industry  Hotels

Link  

The U S  hotel industry slowed down in the first half of 2016 compared to 2015 levels  Apart from a decline in occupancy levels in the first half  negative currency translation and pockets of geopolitical instability and economic slowdown raised concerns 

However  business and leisure travel increased on the back of an improving economy and positive employment numbers  Moreover  hoteliers have realized that franchising their brand and services is better than owning real estate to counter economic volatility 

The Positives

Notwithstanding the macroeconomic hurdles  the lodging sector is expected to grow in the second half of 2016  thanks to strong investor appetite  increasing travel demand and higher transaction volumes 

As per the summer forecast from Smith Travel Research  STR   a leading information and data provider for the lodging industry  the U S  hotel industry is expected to experience record high room demand during the Jun to Aug 2016 phase  STR stated that the number of rooms sold during the summer months is estimated to inch up roughly 2 1  on a year over year basis  banking on the current trend in the U S 

However  a healthy supply pipeline is anticipated to lead to a 1 7  increase in the number of rooms available and is likely to keep occupancy growth subdued at 0 4   Moreover  hoteliers are not likely to raise prices to match 2015 levels 

Nonetheless  as per STR  the average daily rate  ADR  at U S  hotels is expected to go up 4  in 2016  Further  mega sporting events like the Olympics in Brazil in August should boost tourism in the second half 

Thus  as hoteliers strive to enhance value and competitiveness  industry best practices such as sustainability  brand refreshment and increased visibility through technological innovation and social networking   especially among millennials   will remain their priorities 

What s Hurting the Hoteliers 

Hoteliers have been focusing on renovation and digital and marketing initiatives to boost traffic and capitalize on the growing tourism numbers  However  to do that  steep costs incurred by leading hoteliers are taking a toll on profits  Further  online travel agents like Expedia Inc       TripAdvisor    and The Priceline Group Inc      are limiting the pricing power of these brands 

Statistics further underscore the slowing down in the hotel industry  A recent report by PricewaterhouseCoopers   PwC   shows that occupancy levels at U S  hotels have begun to stabilize after reaching peak levels in 2015  PwC also lowered the 2016 and 2017 revenue per available room  RevPAR  growth outlook for hotels to 4 6  and 3 7   respectively  Notably  RevPAR growth in 2015 was 6 2  

The slowdown in China  lingering uncertainty in various international markets  and increased supply growth are expected to pose headwinds  Moreover  in Europe  economic political conditions are expected to be challenging post Brexit 

Another major threat comes from home sharing companies like Airbnb  which offer a digital service allowing travelers to book homes at holiday destinations  With lower overhead costs and far less regulations than what hotel companies have to comply with  these firms have made steady inroads into the industry and are grabbing shares from giants like Starwood Hotels   Resorts Worldwide Inc     and Marriott International  Inc

131950,353465,EXPE,Bull Of The Day  Zendesk  ZEN ,opinion,"Zendesk  ZEN  is a  2 5 billion software as service company that provides a customer service platform to small and medium sized businesses and large enterprises 

The company offers applications that allow clients to manage incoming support requests from end customers from any Internet connected computer 

You may have encountered Zendesk contact forms or chat windows on sites like Trivago  Dropbox  Groupon  GRPN   Vodafone  LON VOD  and parts of the Expedia  NASDAQ EXPE  Affiliate Network 

And you may see the profile of Zendesk rise even higher as the largest Silicon Valley IPO of the year  Twilio  TWLO   is also one its customers 

Meditate On This

Zendesk provides customer service through its platform in approximately 40 languages to customers in various industries  such as business technology  telecommunications  education non profit  consumer technology  media entertainment  and retail ecommerce  

Other customers include Redfin  the upstart real estate broker leveraging the web  FourSquare  the mobile social restaurant mash up  and the Wharton School which uses Zendesk s iPad app to allow their IT team to answer tickets on the go  

Zendesk is projected to hit  300 million in revenue this year and analysts at investment bank William Blair  after recent meetings with management  are confident the company can meet its goal of  1 billion in sales by 2020 

Hello Twilio

I suspect that the Wall Street debut of Twilio will significantly raise the profile of Zendesk as they dwell in similar technologies like voice recognition and activation 

Here s the Twilio company description from Bloomberg com   

Twilio provides a cloud communications platform that enables developers to build  scale  and operate communications within software applications through the cloud as a pay as you go service in the United States and internationally  It offers programmable communications cloud software that enables developers to embed voice  messaging  video  and authentication capabilities into their applications through application programming interfaces  API   

And here s a more hands on way that Zendesk describes their customer and what they do for them   

 Twilio is a cloud based communications company that provides its 40 000 customers a mix of developers and non developers with basic building blocks for building voice and text messaging capabilities into their web apps  regardless of their level of technical experience 

 Most of Twilio s customers begin with trial credit and then start hacking away  It is only when they have built something useful that they decide to invest more in Twilio  So it is critical that the company s support team helps all of its customers building something as quickly and seamlessly as possible  otherwise it s a bad reflection on how easy Twilio is to use  

Given this context  Twilio could IPO at less than half the value of Zendesk  Twilio said in its updated IPO prospectus last week that it plans to sell 11 5 million shares at a preliminary range of  12 to  14  placing its market capitalization as high as  1 15 billion  The company s last private investors paid  11 31 a share in 2015 

According to Lauren Thomas writing on CNBC com   San Francisco based Twilio has grown rapidly   88 percent last year   by selling software that helps companies communicate with their customers using voice  video and messaging in anonymized fashion  For example  OpenTable uses Twilio to send reservation notifications  while the technology lets Nordstrom  NYSE JWN  salespeople chat with customers who are waiting for a specific product to arrive 

 Uber is also a big client  The ride hailing company facilitates one on one conversations between drivers and riders without divulging personal phone numbers  Airbnb does the same for hosts and guests  

Pricey By Any Measure

Zendesk trades at over 8 times this year s projected sales  The company is also not profitable and not expected to be so any time soon 

This year s projected earnings are   1 20 which represents a 27 66  loss vs  last year  And 2017 profit estimates call for   1 27 

Why is the stock a Zacks  1 Rank then  Because it s the direction that recent estimate revisions are moving that count  And that 2016 estimate of   1 20 is up from   1 29  while the 2017 number is up from   1 40 

And investors have rewarded the company for this improved outlook by moving shares 20  higher since their May 3 earnings report  It also helped that the company hosted an analyst day in mid May where management detailed their long term targets  including gross margins of 75  to 77  by 2020 and non GAAP operating margin of 8  to 12  by 2020 

William Blair analysts had this to say after the analyst day   

 We believe the company s transition to modular product offerings will allow it to attract a wider customer base and increase its average selling price across both smaller customers and enterprise organizations  Further  we believe the market for customer services remains large and underpenetrated  In our opinion  Zendesk is well positioned in the market as more organizations are now competing on customer service    driving continued adoption for the company s products  

While the stock is certainly no bargain  and trades at a definite premium to many of its software as service and cloud peers  Zendesk is one to buy on pullbacks near  20  But it s quite possible that somebody else scoops them up all at once in a very hot industry

132016,353531,EXPE,Travel Industry Stocks Can Remain Strong Despite Terrorism Threats,opinion,"Like you  I woke up Tuesday morning to horrific news of twin terrorist attacks at the Brussels Airport and the Maelbreek Metro Station that have killed at least 34 and wounded hundreds more  My heart is heavier than I can convey as I think about the lives savagely cut short 
Still  the world will go on 
Whatever we wish would be the case  war  terrorism  and ugliness are not going to go away any time soon  Unfortunately  all three are  growth industries  at the moment  and that means every investor needs to understand how to navigate his or her money through a world that will be increasingly shaped by terrorism 
Admittedly  that sounds callous  But I learned something during the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami that helps me keep things in perspective   the best way to honor those who have perished is to redouble your efforts to live fully and to the best of your abilities 
From an investing perspective  that means seizing on opportunity  even if it s barbarity that creates it 
Today I want to share with you one such recommendation that terrorism will NOT beat into submission  contrary to what most people think 
Let s get started 
Terrorism and cyberwarfare cost the global economy an estimated  452 3 billion last year alone  according to Bloomberg  causing many investors to cut and run from  that are obviously at risk 
What they don t realize is that for every single dollar destroyed by terrorists plying their deadly trade   100 gets spent trying to prevent future attacks and overcome the risks associated with survival 
Anybody who can navigate the new reality stands to a  protect their hard earned retirement funds and  b  make enormous profits 
When Markets Shrug Off Terrorist Threats
In January 2015  when terrorists raided the offices of Charlie Hebdo  a French satirist weekly publication  in a murderous effort to suppress speech  observers fretted that it was the first salvo of a radical terror movement that could eventually impose its will over the Western world  But I saw things very differently 
On a    I pointed out that the global markets had greeted the news of the attack  and the swift threats by ISIS for more to come  with a collective shrug  I observed that the Dow s 23 point gain alongside the S P 500 s 37 point surge didn t represent indifference  either  Rather  the rally signaled resolve 
 That says to me that the collective psyche of the markets is stronger than individual terrorists want to believe and that they will not win at the end of the day   I noted at the time 
Fifteen months later  despite two historic attacks in Europe  ISIS and other terror groups are no closer to winning than they were in January 2015  Tuesday the Dow and S P 500 both made small but symbolically important gains as Belgian and French authorities pursued terror suspects and world leaders pledged renewed resolve in overcoming the threat 
Still  not all sectors faired equally  American Airlines Group  NASDAQ AAL   Expedia  NASDAQ EXPE   Delta Air Lines Inc  NYSE DAL   and other  travel stocks   for example  suffered short term dips driven by the commonly held wisdom that terrorism tamps down on traveling and tourism  and therefore the bottom line of any company tied to it 
And that s your entry for reasons that will become clear in a moment 
To be clear  terrorist events are awful  horrible things that nobody should have to witness  let alone live through  Yet  they re a fact of life at the moment  which means you ve got to confront them head on if you want to build your wealth and live the life of your dreams 
That sounds like a tall order  but in reality doing so successfully comes down to two things we talk about all the time at Total Wealth 
First  you ve got to  
Doing so allows you to think clearly when everybody else around you isn t  That s important under normal conditions but doubly so when there s a terrorist event 
That s because what you re actually counting on is the fact that taking emotion out of the equation is something the majority of investors won t do  In fact  what you want to see is everybody else s emotions running unchecked in the heat of the moment because that s how you will make your move  calmly  coolly  and with absolute clarity  and buy stocks that are temporarily on sale based on nothing more than a knee jerk reaction 
And  second  the markets have a defined upward bias over time 
The vast majority of investors cannot put two and two together when it comes to understanding this nuance  They think about investing as a one and done activity meaning that they tend to freeze frame whatever s happening at a specific moment  often in complete ignorance of the bigger picture 
The fact that their emotions are running unchecked when this happens only makes the problem worse  Coincidentally  though  this also makes the opportunities you find potentially that much more lucrative 
Let me give you a few examples that will put this into perspective 
A third rate terrorist named Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab tried to blow Northwest Airlines Flight 253 out of the sky by lighting his explosive packed underwear on fire back on Dec  25  2009  When the news broke  other airline  travel  and hotel stocks took hits ranging from JetBlue Airways Corporation s  NASDAQ JBLU  3 3  loss over the next few days to a 6 6  slump in the case of American Airlines Group Inc  Yet  only 10 days later  both were trading higher than they had been in the days before the terror attacks  Even more significantly  they were on their way to gains of 694 80  and 256 91  as of March 22  versus only 67 13  from the Dow over the same time frame 

My point is that airline  travel  and hotel stocks can get creamed in terror stricken moments as nervous investors panic and hit the sell button  But the fear driven sell off always passes  And  not surprisingly  share prices rise in the following days as cooler headed investors  like us  exploit the emotional mistakes made by others 
Or  how about last November  when the world gasped in horror as terrorists assassinated more than 130 people in Paris and injured another 368 in combined attacks at the Bataclan theatre  the Stade de France  and several restaurants 
Predictably  the markets fell when the headlines hit and the first graphic pictures crossed the wires  Yet  by the end of the day  the DJIA rose 1 4  to close up 238 points  while the S P 500 and Nasdaq tacked on 1 5  and 1 2   respectively 
Contrary to what a lot of people think  history shows beyond any shadow of a doubt that terrorist events  horrible though they are  result in a short term hit that sees losses quickly recouped 
You owe it to yourself and to your money to analyze the risks professionally   and rationally 
An Ideal Stock for the Moment
Right now I m inclined to look to Ryanair Holdings PLC  NASDAQ RYAAY   a low cost airline based in Dublin  Ireland 
That name may ring a bell   this was the company that made worldwide headlines in 2011 when CEO Michael O Leary contemplated charging passengers to use the sole remaining toilet on Ryanair flights  after he took the rest out   A  fat tax  and taking away seat pockets   two ideas discussed but never implemented   didn t help them win any favors in pursuit of profits at all costs  And neither did charging passengers an extra  40 to print boarding passes at the airport   I remember because I swore there was no way that I was gonna pay that at the time 
Then  in 2014  the company decided to play nice and get serious about dominating European airline travel while charting a course to industry wide domination by achieving a milestone of 180 million passengers by 2024  Now I can t wait to fly Ryanair when I m in Europe and I m not alone 
The company carried more than 101 million passengers in 2015  an industry first  And the rate at which it s growing its yearly passenger load   up 16  last year alone   makes me believe that the company will reach its goal of 180 million passengers years ahead of schedule  Earnings  no doubt  will follow  as will share prices 
In closing  make no bones about it  Terrorism is ghastly  but it s not the end of the world  nor the financial universe as we know it  If anything  it strengthens resolve 
And that s your opportunity ",2016-03-27,Keith Fitz-Gerald,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/war,-terrorism,-and-ugliness-will-not-beat-this-stock,-despite-what-ever-200122893",200122893
132017,353532,EXPE,Earnings Watch  Time To Short Expedia ,opinion,"Expedia  NASDAQ EXPE   Consumer Discretionary   Internet   Catalog Retail   Reports April 28  After Market Closes
Key Takeaways 
The Estimize community is calling for a loss of 4 cents on  1 824 billion in revenue  slightly higher than Wall Street s estimates   0 06 and  1 823 billion
The Expedia Traveler Preference Program  ETP  provides a more comprehensive agency model that has made payments easier
Decelerations in average daily rate  ADR  in US and Europe could signal an issue for Expedia
Online travel agent  Expedia  is scheduled to report first quarter earnings after the closing bell  The Estimize community is calling for a loss of 4 cents on  1 824 billion in revenue  slightly higher than Wall Street s estimates   0 06 and  1 823 billion  Expedia has missed revenue expectations in each of the previous 3 quarters  The stock has been just as poor and is down 13 3  since the start of the year 
Expedia has always had a presence internationally  but today those markets have never been more important  With expanding international trade and a rise in global travelers  Expedia has focused its efforts on increasing foreign revenues  By adding new inventories and working with local businesses  the company has a chance to benefit from travel trends abroad  Furthermore  Expedia has strategically acquired several big name European travel companies like Trivago and Venere  Both names will add to Expedia s ever growing catalog of inventories and consolidate the online travel industry  
Customers have been raving over the Expedia Traveler Preference Program  ETP   ETP is an extension of the traditional agency business model  and allows guests to pay when checking out rather than beforehand  This avoids costly credit card processing fees and provides Expedia with a hefty commission  So far  the program has been successful in domestic markets with limited feedback from international markets 
While Expedia is focused on expanding revenue and inventories  decelerating travel trends in Europe and the U S  has been a cause for concern  In the United States  hotel occupancy rates declined 0 6  YoY in the first two months of Q1  ADR  the metric illustrating the average realized room rental per day  was also down 3 2  over the same period  European occupancy growth was down 1 5  while ADR fell 2 6  compared to a year earlier  These dips indicate that the hotel markets in the US and Europe may be slowing down  Meanwhile  currency headwinds and stiff competition particularly from Priceline continue to be a problem for Expedia

132018,353533,EXPE,Expedia  EXPE  Shares Soar On Record Revenue Growth  Earnings Beat,opinion,"Expedia Inc    NASDAQ EXPE   shares gained 10 8  in extended trading yesterday  as quarterly revenue growth was the strongest in several years and earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate The company saw extremely strong volumes in the last quarter across hotel  air and car product lines  It is apparent that management s acquisition strategy is beginning to pay off 
Management said going into the year that full year ex eLong adjusted EBITDA will be up 35 45   although the first half will be weak  likely because of ongoing integrations  Both Orbitz and HomeAway are expected to make a nice contribution 
The offloading of eLong and the Ctrip deal has clearly been a good deal for Expedia because it could exit the business at a profit while at the same time ensuring dollar denominated revenue flow  Not only that  but the Chinese market is highly competitive  so Expedia s strategy enables it to maintain margins 
The other thing worth mentioning is Exedia s growing strength in mobile where management says growth rates are very high although there will be tougher comps going forward  Penetration varies by brand  with Hotwire one of the highest at 40   As app downloads have increased over time  management is now tracking transactions via apps  So they will probably tell us more about transactions made through mobile apps in the future  App transaction growth can show loyalty  which is a good indicator of growth  
Revenue
Revenue for the quarter was  1 90 billion  down 12 1  sequentially  up 38 6  year over year and topping the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4 5   This is the strongest year over year growth ever and significantly better than normal seasonality 
Revenue by Segment
Core OTA segment revenue was up 2 3  sequentially and 31 6  year over year 
trivago was up 60 0  sequentially and 47 9  from last year  While awareness in the U S  continues to increase  trivago is seeing very strong growth in international markets  trivago s revenue from the relatively mature European market also grew 33  compared to 2015 s 20   Other international markets grew 69  
Egencia grew 2 8  on a sequential basis and 12 2  year over year  Egencia still has a large business in Europe  especially the Nordic region because of the integration of Via  Other than the currency situation  oil prices are negatively impacting client signups in the region  Management said that the business signed up over 1 1 billion new clients in 2015  The plan going forward is to integrate the Orbitz business into Egencia 
HomeAway  which was added last quarter  jumped 610  sequentially from  20 million to  142 million 
Core OTA  trivago  Egencia and HomeAway contributed 78   9   6  and 7  of gross revenue  before inter company eliminations   respectively 
Revenue by Channel
Around 56  of total revenue was generated through the merchant business  direct sales   another 27  came through the agency model  where Expedia operates as an agent of the supplier  and roughly 9  came from Advertising and Media with HomeAway accounting for the remaining 7   The three channels were up 5 7   2 0  and 25 2   respectively from the December quarter of 2015  Growth from the year ago quarters were 39 8   21 4  and 42 6   respectively 
Revenue by Geography
Around 59  of Expedia s quarterly revenue was generated domestically  with the remaining 41  coming from international sources  The domestic business grew 14 0  sequentially and 45 2  from a year ago  The international business grew 9 4  sequentially and grew 37 9  from last year 
Management estimates that the company has a 45  share of the global online travel market  While its share of the North America and EMEA region is quite high  Asia Pac and Latin America are growing fast 
Revenue by Product Line
Hotel and Air  the two main product lines grew 25  and 54   respectively from the year ago quarter  The increase in Hotel revenue came from a 37  increase in room nights  acquisitions added 13 percentage points of this growth   But this was offset by a 3  decline in the average daily rate   ADR    Revenue per night dropped 9  
While management doesn t break out car volume yet  they mentioned on the call that it was up 39   Car days were up 48   partially offset by a 6  decline in revenue per day  Orbitz contributed 27 percentage points to car volume growth 
In the last quarter  international room night growth of 44  trumped the domestic room night growth of 32   
The 54  increase in ticket revenue was attributable to a 52  increase in ticket volumes  offset by an 8  decline in airfares  Revenue per ticket grew 1   the first time the number grew since December 2013  Organic room night growth was 24  with Orbitz alone contributing 34 percentage points to air volume growth   
Bookings and Revenue Margin
Gross bookings were  18 88 billion in the last quarter  up 26 3  sequentially and 32 3  year over year  The revenue margin was 10 1   down 127 bps sequentially but still 46 bps above the year ago level 
Conversions were weaker in both Core OTA and Egencia  so all of the strength came from trivago and the addition of HomeAway  Both domestic and international grew from last year although international conversions were stronger  The year over year increase in conversions was about even across agency and merchant channels 
Margins
The pro forma gross margin for the quarter was 78 8   down 123 bps sequentially and up 228 bps year over year  The year over year expansion in gross margin was because of higher volumes which offset related costs of customer operation  data center operation  credit card processing as well as acquisitions  This led to a 42 8  year over year increase in gross profit dollars 
The operating expenses of  1 49 billion were up 21 3  sequentially and 38 9  from last year  The operating margin shrank 714 bps sequentially and expanded 215 bps year over year to 0 8   with technology   content growing from both previous and year ago quarters and G A declining from both periods  Selling   marketing costs grew 821 bps sequentially as a percentage of sales while remaining 93 bps below year ago levels    
Adjusted EBITDA as reported by the company was  176 6 million  up 73 5   31  excluding eLong  from the year ago quarter 
Net Income
On a pro forma basis  Expedia generated a net loss of  25 6 million  or 1 3  net loss margin compared to net income of  67 0 million  or 3 9  in the previous quarter and loss of  28 4 million or 2 1  net loss margin in the same quarter last year 
Our pro forma estimate excludes intangibles amortization charges  restructuring charges and other charges on a tax adjusted basis but includes deferred stock compensation  Our pro forma calculations may differ from management s presentation due to the inclusion exclusion of some items that were not considered by management 
Including the above special items  as well as non controlling interests  the GAAP loss attributable to Expedia shareholders was  121 9 million   0 81 a share   in the last quarter compared to loss of  12 5 million   0 09 a share  in the previous quarter and income of  44 1 million   0 34 a share  in the year ago quarter 
Balance Sheet
Cash and short term investments totaled  2 09 billion at quarter end  up  381 9 million during the quarter  The net debt balance was  1 12 billion  compared to net debt of  1 49 billion going into the quarter  Including long term liabilities  the debt to total capital ratio was 50 6   Days sales outstanding  DSOs  went from 58 to 65  We note that nearly 49  of assets is goodwill  not a real asset  
In the last quarter  Expedia generated  1 10 billion of cash in operations and spent  167 6 million on capex   400 4 million to pay off HomeAway convertible notes   36 2 million on dividends and  187 0 million on share repurchases

Anadarko Petroleum  NYSE APC 
Anadarko Petroleum  APC  fell hard with oil over the back half of 2014  It rose then along trend support to test the October 2014 highs before starting back lower  July found another support zone  a possible double bottom  and the price has been rising since  The action recently has been in bull flags following moves higher  Friday saw another building with the RSI holding over the mid line and the MACD rising in support of the upside plan  A move over the 50 day SMA would trigger a buy 
Expedia  NASDAQ EXPE 
Expedia  EXPE  has been moving higher all year  After a consolidation through June and July  it jumped higher following its earnings report and ran to a Shooting Star top two weeks ago  It is now consolidating that move after a short pullback  Into the week  the RSI has just started to turn back up and the MACD looks to be leveling  The volume pattern looks like a classic Bull Flag 
Huntington Bancshares  NASDAQ HBAN 
Huntington Bancshares  HBAN  has been rising with the financial sector since the October 2014 market low  Since May  rising trend support has been in place  and in mid July  it met up with resistance  forming an ascending triangle  Friday found the price back at that resistance following two strong up days  The RSI is bullish and rising and the MACD is turning up  with a positive cross this week sealing the deal for more upside 
Old Dominion Freight Line  NASDAQ ODFL

Perrigo  PRGO  had a steep rise off of a low in February that included a large jump in April on news of an FDA approval of new drug application  Since then  though  it has consolidated and is tracing out an Adam and Eve bottoming pattern  The RSI remains in the bullish zone  while the MACD moves sideways in the consolidation  A break over the current resistance looks like a good place to buy for continuation 
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad Market Macro picture reviewed Friday which  heading into August Options Expiration week  sees the equity markets looking to consolidate in the short term and looking better long term 
Elsewhere  look for gold to continue the bounce in its downtrend while crude oil just continues lower  The US dollar index seems content to move sideways  but with a short term downward bias  while US Treasuries are biased higher  The Shanghai Composite looks to continue to consolidate in the longer uptrend  while Emerging Markets look ugly with more downside to come 
Volatility looks to remain subdued  keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETF s ARCA SPY  ARCA IWM and NASDAQ QQQ  despite their failure to move higher last week  Their charts show weakness continuing in the IWM and consolidation in the SPY and in QQQ short term  All look better longer term  with the QQQ strongest followed by IWM and then SPY  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

Ctrip   
Consumer Discretionary   Internet   Catalog Retail   Reports November 18  after the close 
The Estimize consensus calls for EPS of  0 14  7 cents above the Wall Street consensus  Revenues of  491 52M are also above the Street s expectation for  487 19M 

What to watch  Technically  this one falls under  internet retail   but it s certainly not a traditional retailer  Ctrip is China s largest online travel booking site  owning about 34  of that market  It s closest competitor  Qunar Cayman Islands  owns closer to 20  and caters to more value driven customers  The travel market is rapidly expanding in China  as people begin to increase the number of trips they go on  with Ctrip being one of the main beneficiaries of that trend  and ready to capitalize on the expansive growth potential in the space  Another benefit to Ctrip is the consolidation of the online travel industry in China  beginning with its purchase of a 36  stake in eLong  another Chinese travel site  from Expedia  O EXPE  in May  While it is still very early  current analyst estimates predict that Ctrip could be earning  5 share by 2019  The stock is up 110  so far this year 

Workday

The Estimize consensus calls for EPS of   0 02  50  higher than the Wall Street estimate  Revenues of  305 00M are also above the Street s expectation for  303 41M 

What to watch  Workday provides enterprise cloud solutions to businesses  mainly to assist in managing human resources and critical business functions  Since debuting in late 2012  the software has been coming for the big guys  mainly Oracle  N ORCL  and SAP  N SAP   Workday software is targeting two main areas  human resources and financial departments  Cloud software is becoming much more appealing to customers as it costs less in the long run  Workday is working to differentiate itself with the addition of such new tools as Collaborative Anytime Feedback  which allows users to commend a colleague s good work in a public forum  Despite having more than 1 000 clients  Workday is still far off from Oracle s customer base of 10 000   and while 2016 revenues are expected to surpass the  1B mark  that still pales in comparison with Oracle s estimate of  38B  Year to date the stock is nearly flat 

Splunk

132052,353567,EXPE,Market Drifts Down As Uncertainty Grips World,opinion,"If you have been around a while  you get used to certain things happening at certain times  For example  on the second weekend of February  the world celebrates Valentine s day  which typically brings the rush of romantic feelings for those of us who are participating in a relationship  Investors in the world s capital markets can be forgiven for not feeling much love these days as 2016 has seen the stock market drop no fewer than 10  over the last month and a half  Usually  Valentine s day gifts revolve around chocolates and hearts  This year  you might want aspirin and a blindfold to stop you from looking at the brokerage statement  So  what could be the cause of such a swoon 
The world seems a flutter with questions about everything  Will the United States dip into recession  Will China devalue it s currency  Will oil continue to drift even lower  Will negative interest rate policies put further pressure on bank earnings  How much exposure do European banks have to oil and commodity producers  What do European derivative books look like and how much are they tied to U S big banks  What affect does currency volatility have on the unwinding of the carry trade tied to the euro and Japanese yen  carry trade is borrowing in a low interest rate currency to invest in a higher interest rate country   Will the current frontrunners in the U S  presidential race  Donald Trump  Hillary Clinton  and  gulp  Bernie Sanders  continue to lead the way and presage an ominous change to populist policies or even worse  radical financial regulations  Are corporate earnings under pressure from a weakening global economy  All or any of these could be reasons for what is troubling those who might put capital to work  At least for the last six weeks or so  it might be more appropriate to say  to investors seeking shelter in an uncertain world 
Last week  in her semi annual testimony to Congress  Janet Yellen seemed to indicate she was not inclined to rule out negative interest rate policies  but the mechanics of implentation would make such a scenario difficult  In fact  the Fed head seems committed to the course of of a gradual climb to interest rate normality  Yesterday s better than expected  2  increase of retail sales bolsters this policy argument  as well as the upward revision to December retail sales  The bottom line is there remains plenty of questions  which further reinforces Nitezche s long standing belief 
Elsewhere in the market  the earnings parade continued non stop  PepsiCo Inc  N PEP  reported a nice number  and Twitter  N TWTR  met expectations as the market yawned  Yelp Inc  N YELP  produced a shakey figure  while Jamie Dimon  highly regarded CEO of Chase Corporation  N CCF   decided to buy 26 million of Chase stock after it got hammered during the thursday thrashing  Other notables joining the buying spree include David Tepper of Appaloosa and Seth Klauman of Baupost  Both purchased sizable stakes in energy concerns like pipelines and exploration and production entities  Pepsi  Coke and Davita met expectations  which only shows people continue to have to drink and receive dialysis  In the travel world  Expedia  O EXPE  and TripAdvisor Inc  O TRIP  posted strong growth and had good outlooks  The deal space saw Leapfrog Enterprises Inc  N LF   mentioned in the column a while back  acquired by VTech Holdings Ltd  OTC VTKLY  for the whopping price of  1 dollar a share  Kroger  N KR  is rumored to be acquiring The Fresh Market Inc  O TFM  in consolidation of the grocery and natural foods industry  Finally  there were rumors Chesapeake Energy  N CHK  may be looking at restructuring their large debt obligations  There will be plenty more of these kinds of speculations in the energy industry so get used to it

132090,353605,EXPE,News From 3 Top Internet Stocks Rated This Week,opinion,"By Sarah RodenFrom lawsuits to mergers  Internet stocks had a busy week  Find out what analysts are saying about 3 of the most popular Internet stocks 
Google  NASDAQ GOOGL 
This week  the European Union formally accused Google of antitrust violations  claiming the search engine favors its own services over others in search results  The lawsuit is aimed at Google s shopping comparison website and Android software  The EU claims that Google unfairly directs shopping search queries to their own platform and that the company unfairly pre installs its applications onto Android platforms  Google faces the potential of paying billions in fines 
On April 15  Google executive Amit Singhal posted a blog refuting the antitrust accusation  Singhal noted that Google now competes with more search engines than ever before and Google s specialized results for traveling and leisure have actually helped boost profits for Yelp  TripAdvisor  and Expedia  NASDAQ EXPE   Furthermore  Singhal offered a graph illustrating that several European shopping sites garner more unique visitors than Google s shopping platform 
Despite the legal battle  analysts remain bullish on the stock  On April 14  top analyst  of Cantor Fitzgerald maintained a Buy rating on Google with a  635 price target  Squali noted   We continue to see Google as one of the best plays on global online ad and commerce growth at a compelling valuation  Youssef Squali has a 75  success rate recommending stocks with a  26 1  average return per rating 
On average  the top analyst consensus for Google on is Moderate Buy 
Alibaba  NYSE BABA On April 15  Alibaba announced a  2 5 billion deal to publicly list its online pharmacy on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange  This move positions the Chinese e commerce giant to benefit from China s growing healthcare sector  The pharmaceutical arm of the company will be traded in Hong Kong under Alibaba Health Information Technology Ltd  The company is hoping the move will morph the pharmaceutical platform into a retailer of over the counter drugs into a platform for prescription drugs  pending Chinese legislation This comes as good news for the Chinese e commerce retailer as Alibaba was recently hit with negative publicity surrounding a counterfeit goods scandal and the abatement of online lottery ticket sales 
On April 14  analyst  of Pacific Crest maintained a Buy rating on Alibaba with a price target of  101  Cheng noted several near term headwinds  such as the crackdown on online lottery ticket sales  which is predicted to hurt Alibaba s sales  Additionally  Cheng increased his operating expense estimate and noted that Alibaba is continuing to regain public trust after negative publicity surrounding counterfeit goods  Cheng commented   Despite the negative estimate revision and lower price target on Alibaba  We continue to see Alibaba as the dominant player in a rapidly growing e commerce market  and see improving take rate trends for Alibaba as the platform provides more value to both consumers and merchants  
Cheng Cheng has a 42  overall success rate recommending stocks with a  10 9  average return per recommendation On average  the top analyst consensus for Alibaba on is Strong Buy 
Yahoo  NASDAQ YHOO Yahoo is reportedly ironing out the details in a deal to purchase Foursquare for  900 million  Foursquare  a social media platform that sends your location to friends  would add a strong social mobile platform to Yahoo s portfolio  Although some sources are disputing the acquisition rumor  others are pointing to a friendship between Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer and Foursquare CEO Dennis Crowley as an indicator of the deal 
On April 13  analyst  of Citigroup reiterated a Buy rating on Yahoo  though he did not provide a price target  May noted that once you disregard Alibaba  Yahoo s core business is undervalued  The analyst commented   We believe core YHOO remains undervalued and that the multiple will re rate when the BABA stake is spun out in 4Q15  We see opportunity for investors that are willing to be patient  especially if they employ a strategy to hedge the BABA risk   He added   We also note that our estimated 2 5x EBITDA multiple may in fact be high  and could prove to be conservative as the company appears to have accelerated headcount reductions and  management  recently discussed company efforts to deliver EBITDA ahead of analyst expectations  
Mark May has an overall success rate of 66  recommending stocks with an average return of  11 3  pre recommendation On average  the top analyst consensus for Yahoo on is Moderate Buy ",2015-04-16,Sarah Roden,https://www.investing.com/analysis/news-from-3-top-internet-stocks-rated-this-week-248682,248682

132092,353607,EXPE,Top Trade Ideas For The Week June 29  2015  Expedia,opinion,"Here is your Bonus Idea with links to the full Top Ten 
Expedia  NASDAQ EXPE   has been in a long uptrend since March  The gap higher in May was backfilled with a touch at support and a hammer reversal candle in June before a run higher  That move up has consolidated  created a Cup and Handle pattern  With a move over resistance the pattern would target a move to 118 
The momentum indicators are supportive of a move higher  The RSI is rising and bullish with the MACD flat after a pullback  but looking to move higher now  The Bollinger Bands  also are opening higher to allow a move 
There is resistance at 111 25 and then 113 45 before free air above and the Measured Move from the pattern to 118  Support lower comes at 109 and 107 followed by 104 60  Short interest is high at 9 1   The company is expected to report earnings next July 30th 
Looking at the options chains shows the weekly July 2 Expiry options with moderate open interest below at 105 and 106  But the July monthly options favor the Call side with large open interest at the 110  115 and 120 Call Strikes 
Expedia
Trade Idea 1  Buy the stock on a move over 111 25 with a stop at 109  A straight stock trade  Trade Idea 2  Buy the stock on a move over 111 25 with a July 31 Expiry 111 106 Put Spread short July 31 Expiry 118 Call collar for free  Protecting the stock trade through the earnings report and retaining upside to the target 
Trade Idea 3  Buy the July 111 115 Call Spread  offered at  1 70 late Friday  and trade them like the stock trade  Using options to define your risk and participate in upside in the short term to the high open interest above  Trade Idea 4  Buy the July 111 115 Call Spread and sell the July 109 Puts for free  Adding leverage to the options trade to finance the trade  with risk under 109  Trade Idea 5  Buy the July 111 115 119 Call butterfly and sell the July 108 Puts for free  Gives a little more downside protection but with risk on the upside if the 115 strike is exceeded 
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad  picture reviewed Friday which  heading into the holiday shortened week sees the equity markets continuing to look better on the longer timeframe with some vulnerability on the short timeframe 
Elsewhere look for gold to continue consolidation with a downward bias while Crude Oil consolidates with an upward bias  The US Dollar Index continues to move sideways in broad consolidation after the uptrend while US Treasuries are biased lower  The Shanghai Composite may finally be in the long awaited correction while Emerging Markets are biased to the downside 
Volatility looks to remain subdued keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETF s ARCA SPY  ARCA IWM and NASDAQ QQQ  Their charts continue to show the SPY and QQQ moving similarly on the shorter timeframe while the IWM was stronger until late in the week  The rotation may be starting out of the small caps again  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

132093,353608,EXPE,Commodities Touch 13 Year Low,opinion,"Life is full of uncertainty  Many have a hard time living with this  especially those of us who do not like surprises  As such  looking at the past and noticing common  recurring patterns might provide a reference point to apply to current circumstances  Such is the case in today s business climate  which investment decisions about the future are based on 
This week  it came to pass that many commodities fell to thirteen year lows  The grand poo bah of all commodities is oil  Like it s fellow brethren  the current price is nothing to write home about  under  50 bucks for West Texas Intermediate   47 12  and  52 21 for Brent  So  it should not have been any surprise when the big boys of oil  Exxon  NYSE XOM   Shell  LONDON RDSa   Chevron  NYSE CVX   and BP  LONDON BP   reported far lower profits than last year  For example  in this quarter last year  Exxon makes  8 billion  this year  4 billion  Chevron earned  5 billion last year  this year  500 million  As a result of the far lower price  Shell is cutting 6 500 jobs  and Chevron 1 500  Life is tough in the oil patch  yes  indeed  I know  you feel terrible for the oil boys  I do  too 
As someone who admires good mathematicians  the oilies certainly are  As such  they know they cannot keep their capital expenditures at current levels with the end product price at 50 bones and below  They have turned their wrath on the industries suppliers steel  hoses  drillers  rigs  ships  you name it  Also  it appears they are working with each other to standardize equipment across the industry  so in the future  incompatible systems will not exist  You see  there are plenty of partnerships in energy as nobody wants to take the risk of spending billions by themselves  The oilies may be hated by the politicians and public  but they are sharp  As for the future  our oil leaders report lower for longer is the status quo for as long as the eye can see 
Another part of the business cycle is reporting season  and are we ever in the midst of it  especially in technology  The two most notable reports came from Facebook  NASDAQ FB  and Twitter  NYSE TWTR   In many ways Twitter is very similar to Facebook  with a few very important differences  Both are loved by the world  and very much integrated with our society  Both struggled during their first year as public companies  Both are investing in applications centered around the mobile experience and video  Both are highly acquisitive  buying younger  promising entities for enormous sums  Many believe the prices they pay are too high  in a few cases  dramatically so  What gives 
First  Facebook has shown they can grow their user base and earn increasing amounts of money on mobile devices  Not so for Twitter  Second  and this is crucial  Facebook is led by a focused management team of Zuckerberg  Twitter s current CEO  Jack Dorsey  is also the leader of Square  which will now have an IPO in the near future  Focus and clarity of purpose is important for any businesses success  and even more so in the hyper competitive world of technology  Facebook has it  Twitter doesn t  at least in the current cycle 
There were a few other reports this week as well  Skechers crushed the estimates  as did Expedia  NASDAQ EXPE   and both stocks jumped  Yelp  NYSE YELP  caused shareholders to do more than yelp after missing and guiding down  and then the stock fell 25   It looks like there is a good chance Yelp will be acquired by some company as the CEO resigned  More to come on that one 
I was reading on Bloomberg about how the largest investment banks are encouraging their hedge fund customers to use swaps as a substitute for large stock trades  There are all kinds of swaps for investors to use  interest rates  indexes  commodities  currencies  even weather related  for insurance companies   The banks are doing this so they can keep the lending commitments off of their proprietary trading books  I am sure Elizabeth Warren  Bernie Sanders  and Barney Frank will be impressed 
Speaking of the Democratic leadership  just had to remark on Nancy Pelosi s interesting comment that the nuclear agreement with Iran is a  Diplomatic Masterpiece   If you are Iran it is  Just goes to show you Nancy still remains one of the best available sources if you want a chuckle out of life  The only problem is the topic is so serious  there may be no more cycles for anyone if the big zero and his partners in crime  democratic cheerleaders  are wrong

132125,353640,EXPE,Bitcoin Fails To Maintain Upward Momentum,opinion,"The price of Bitcoin  BTC USD   after having taken out the previous top of 605  failed to maintain its upward momentum and has retraced more than 1  from its high of 615 and has even retested the near term support of 600  The pair is facing bouts of profit taking at higher levels and is currently consolidating after breaking down from the upward sloping trend line  marked on the hourly chart  
Traders can look forward to building long positions now and on successive declines up to 600 for a primary target of 620 and a final target of 630  maintaining a stop loss around 595  Aggressive traders may hold their positions till 630 is achieved while traders with a low risk appetite can book partial profits  60   near the primary target of 620 and the remaining near the strong resistance zone of 630 
Short positions should be considered only after either the price has broken below 595 or if the pair is near 630  A close below 595 could puncture all positive momentum and only short positions should be considered  keeping a stop loss of 600 for an initial target of 580 and a final target of 560  Similarly  the levels of 625 630 can act as strong resistance for BTC USD and should be used to sell for targets of 600 610 
Traders and investors must note that there are important events lined up next week such as the second meeting of the Italian Parliament on the June 26  and the auction of 30 000 Bitcoins by the US Marshals Service  USMS  on June 27  which the FBI seized last October from the Silk Road site  Positions must be built and stop losses must be strictly followed  keeping in mind that each event can trigger a spike in the value of the digital currency 
British grooming brand King of Shaves has announced that it will accept Bitcoin payments through BitPay  joining the likes of world renowned companies such as DISH Network Corporation  NASDAQ DISH   eBay Inc  NASDAQ EBAY  and Expedia Inc  NASDAQ EXPE  adding further credibility and long term support to the digital currency ",2014-06-19,Ben Myers,https://www.investing.com/analysis/bitcoin-fails-to-maintain-upward-momentum-216679,216679
132126,353641,EXPE,5 Stocks To Watch This Week ,opinion,"We ve got a huge week ahead for social media stocks  Over the next 5 days we will be getting earnings releases from Twitter  NYSE TWTR   Facebook  NASDAQ FB   and LinkedIn  NYSE LNKD   Other highly anticipated reports will be coming from Hepatitis C drugmaker Gilead Sciences  NASDAQ GILD  and travel site Expedia  NASDAQ EXPE  

Monday
Twitter kicks off the week for social media earnings on Monday  After struggling for awhile to meet analyst expectations on monthly active user  MAU  growth  Twitter finally put up a satisfactory quarter this summer  With 271 million MAUs at its back Twitter has been focusing on product improvements to increase the amount of time users spend on its platform  increasing the value of its advertisements  Most notably this quarter Twitter launched Audio Cards  a feature which enables music and podcasts to be played directly on Twitter via Soundcloud  Twitter has a great track record of beating the Street s EPS consensus and the Estimize consensus believes that pattern will hold on Monday 
Tuesday
Just as Twitter was boosted by mobile engagement last quarter  Facebook posted a monstrous quarter  In July Facebook reported earnings of 42 cents per share while Wall Street was estimating 33 cents and the Estimize community forecast 36 cents  For many investors last quarter was a watershed moment where Facebook finally shed the poor reputation it acquired from its disastrous IPO and grabbed the world s attention with its massive profitability  This week analysts on Estimize are predicting Facebook will beat the Street by 5 cents per share on the bottom line and  45 million on revenue 
Gilead Sciences is also scheduled to release earnings on Tuesday  Last quarter Gilead posted one of the largest beats against the Estimize consensus ever recorded by earning  2 36 per share while Estimize was at  1 94  For comparison the Wall Street consensus was just  1 80  Gilead s earnings spike was driven by its new Hepatitis C drug  Sovaldi  On October 10 Gilead won approval to sell a new Hepatitis C drug  Harvoni  Harvoni did not go on sale during Gilead s 3rd quarter  but investors will look for management to provide commentary on the new drug s highly anticipated launch during the conference call 
Thursday
LinkedIn  NYSE LNKD  reports Thursday after the close  LinkedIn has a great record of beating the Wall Street consensus  Thursday the Estimize the community expects the social network for professionals to maintain its streak and top the Wall Street consensus by 4 cents  8 5   per share  Analysts on Estimize also forecast that LinkedIn will beat the Street s revenue consensus by  7 million  1 2    a difference of lower relative magnitude  Over the past 2 years the Estimize consensus has been more accurate than Wall Street every quarter on LinkedIn and we are seeing a fairly wide differential again this period  Keep a close eye on the Estimize consensus going into the report on Thursday 

Expedia is also set to report on Thursday  Throughout the quarter Wall Street has brought its earnings consensus down for the travel company from  1 80 to  1 75  The Estimize consensus climbed slightly throughout the period settling at  1 80  Both groups have similar revenue expectations  but the Estimize community expects Expedia to report 5 cents more in profit per share  Expedia has been a hot stock this year increasing in price from roughly  69 to  81 50  On Thursday Expedia will need to beat the Street by a nickel per share to match investors  expectations ",2014-10-27,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/5-stocks-to-watch-this-week-230300,230300

 While domestic bookings may be tracking in line to light for 4Q  it seems consensus has yet to pick up the mid November acquisition of Wotif  which leaves us comfortable with a 23  global bookings growth target  

Fuller has made 33 successful ratings out of 51 total this year  earning him a 65  overall success rate and a  13 2  average return per recommendation

132128,353643,EXPE,Activision And Twitter  Trade Setups,opinion,"High profile companies reported their quarterly earnings on Thursday  Most posted better than expected earnings  Still  there were exceptions  Expedia being one of them  Let s see what technical analysis can predict for their price action following the reports 
1  Activision Blizzard
That was another successful quarter for Activision Blizzard  Yet  the earnings  surprise might not be enough for ATVI stock price to break out above the  22 level  Shares have been on the rise since mid January  But they are now trading inside a strong resistance zone 
61 8  Fibonacci level is nearby at  21 70  adding more selling pressure to the stock 

How I d trade ATVI stock  Selling short at  22 and setting a tight stop loss of half a dollar  I d set the profit target at recent low of  18 50  hoping to hit a 7 1 risk reward trade 
2  Expedia
Next up  Expedia posted a lower than expected EPS of  0 86  estimate  1 02   EXPE shares traded inside the resistance zone on Thursday  likely favoring bearish positions  Now that the report is out  buyers would have more trouble to push the price above  89 

How I d trade EXPE stock  Again  I d opt for a short selling position  In fact  I m betting on the continuation of the ranging market  Entry price is  88 with one dollar stop loss  aiming for a downfall towards eighty two dollars  If successful  the reward would be six fold the risk 
3  LinkedIn
Another company that surprised with their earnings  LinkedIn shares are trading at key resistance level  That is still lower that the all time high  I d bet on breaking out and testing those highs over the next week  Yet  I d avoid trading this stock  due to the low reward high risk conditions 
4  Twitter
Twitter earnings beat estimates  yet only for 6 cents  Currently  Twitter shares are trading at a key resistance previous support level  I d be surprised if there s enough bullish sentiment to overcome the resistance 

How I d trade Twitter  I posted my prediction yesterday at TradingView  Check out  at the chart I shared 
5  Yelp
Yelp  NYSE YELP  earnings were almost in line with estimates  Traders are recommended to take a look at the weekly chart  Long term Yelp price action justifies a long position  given the 2 year old support level at  50  The round number also helps point out the support s strength  Although the entry might come a bit late  the high reward would appeal to position traders 

How I d trade Yelp  I d buy Yelp shares at  58 with a ten dollar stop loss  Profit target could be set at either  85 or close to all time high   100   Question is whether we are patient enough to hold this position for months to come ",2015-02-06,Jim Makos,https://www.investing.com/analysis/activision-and-twitter-stock-analysis-after-earnings-241102,241102

132166,353681,EXPE,Expedia Inc  Two Potential Plays,opinion,Expedia  EXPE  is going on the watch list as it has two plays  a potential bearish play if it can break support  with a potential long play as well  EXPE has been trending lower since February and not making highs with the market  it is now closing near a swing low and key support at 61 43  EXPE has tested this level a few times since January and once again it is here  the more the support line is tested the weaker it becomes  If EXPE were to negate this bearish looking chart it would have to get above 63 65 which has capped all rallies since the swing low at 61 43  What makes the 63 65 level significant is that there is very little short term resistance till about 65 80 so a break of that resistance could mean a nice 3  move  EXPE right now is in a short term range with the bottom of the range being a long term support holding EXPE up from a potential 6  and a short term resistance holding EXPE from a 3  rally  The risk reward favors the bears but they need to break below 61 43 first ,2013-03-26,PikerTrader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/expedia-inc:-two-potential-plays-160452,160452

132229,353744,EXPE,Is Priceline A Deal ,opinion,Priceline  NASDAQ  PCLN  is an online travel company that provides hotel reservation services  retail airline tickets and rental car reservation services on a worldwide basis  It also offers vacation packages and optional travel insurance packages as well as its  Name Your Own Price demand collection system  Priceline s stock has recently taken a tumble but is still up 37 8  YTD  Despite the pullback  Priceline continues to be a good investment and is still the strongest player in the travel industry     Positives   Priceline uses a unique business model known as the reverse auction pricing model  Not only has Priceline pioneered this business model  but it has also patented it  This business model allows Priceline to separate itself from its competitors by allowing consumers to purchase travel services at discounted prices through the Name Your Own Price system  which has been offered in Priceline s travel  automotive and personal finance categories  Moreover  the patents ensure that Priceline s success with the Name Your Own Price system can t be replicated  at least for now  by its competitors    Due in large part to its innovative Name Your Own Price system  Priceline has been extremely appealing to value conscious consumers who are attracted to their ability to negotiate prices on Priceline  This appeal has turned Priceline into a haven for travelers and has largely shielded Priceline s earnings from the effects of the recession     Another significant positive for Priceline is that it has been aggressively expanding its international presence  international bookings currently account for 78  of its total business  Moreover  there is huge opportunity for Priceline in the international online travel booking business  which is still nascent and relatively untapped  Thus  Priceline has been aggressively pushing into  Europe and the emerging markets  As Piper Jaffray s Michael Olson    We performed a hotel search query in 34 emerging markets and found Priceline s paid ads were in 97  of the results vs  62  for Expedia ads   International bookings currently account for only 39 percent of Expedia s  NASDAQ  EXPE  total bookings     Priceline is significantly gaining share in the European hotel bookings market through its Booking com site and its Agoda com site is gaining market share in the Asian travel market  Recently  one of Priceline s subsidiaries  Egencia   the acquisition of VIA Travel  the largest travel management company in the Nordics  Moreover  Priceline is also  for the U K travel site thetrainline com  an online ticket agent that has approximately 12 million users in the UK  Priceline s international strategy is much more aggressive than that of its competitors and will serve it well in the future     Finally  Priceline has been destroying its competition in terms of generating revenue  As   Priceline has increased its revenues by more than 209  from 2008 to February of 2012  compared to 29 4  for Expedia and  10 73  for Orbitz  NYSE  OWW    Priceline also trumps its main competitors in other areas of growth  It has a 3 Year Sales Growth rate of 35   compared with 7  for Expedia and  1  for Orbitz  Moreover  the average EPS growth of Priceline s last 3 quarters is 68   compared with 39  for Expedia     Negatives   Although Priceline definitely has factors going its way  there are some significant developments that can be potentially detrimental to Priceline s future performance  For one  the ongoing European sovereign debt crisis is having an impact on Priceline s growth  As  in Priceline s 2012 Q1 earnings call   Growth rates were impacted by slowing growth in Southern European markets     Also  economic conditions in Europe are forcing many Europeans to tighten their budget and thus limit their vacations  a phenomenon which is also adversely affecting not only Priceline  but the entire European travel industry  Moreover  the weakness of the euro is negative for Priceline  as it puts pressure on the company s dollar denominated results    As more and more companies become attracted to the lucrative travel industry  one which has relatively low barriers to entry  Priceline will face increasing competition and potentially lower profit margins  Microsoft  NASDAQ  MSFT  has launched Bing Travel while Google  NASDAQ  GOOG  has acquired ITA Software Inc   a major flight information software company  and HomeAway  a vacation home rental service  Moreover  Priceline is facing increased domestic competition in terms of discounted hotel prices  Travelocity and Expedia are growing their opaque price disclosed booking services  which also result in significant discounts for customers  These discounted services can result in more difficulty for Priceline to effectively differentiate its products and services to its domestic costumers     The Verdict   Recently  Goldman Sachs  its Q1 2012 Hedge Fund Trend Monitor report  one which reveals the 50 most important stocks to hedge funds  Priceline was No  8  with 29 hedge funds including it in their Top 10 holdings  and with good reason  Although Priceline faces increasing competition and may be adversely impacted by the crisis in Europe  it is in an unparalleled position to benefit from international travel  Overall  Priceline has much more upside potential and is a solid investment ,2012-06-11,George Liu,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-priceline-a-deal-126049,126049

Luntz on Newt Gingrich   He s thought about everything  he s considered everything  he has an opinion about everything 85  of the time that s a good thing  15  of the time it s not    New Jersey Gov  Chris Christie was stumping for Mitt Romney in Iowa and was met by about 20 protesters  who interrupted his speech for several minutes  chanting  among other things   Make Wall Street pay  To which Christie responded  You re so angry  aren t you  Work it all out   Christie then blasted Obama   They represent an anger in our country that Barack Obama has caused  Because he is a typical  cynical Chicago ward politician who runs for office and promises everything and then comes to office and disappoints  And  For the last three years  we ve had a president who doesn t know how to lead  doesn t know who he is  won t fight for what he believes in and will not   will not   make America greater  In fact  he has made America smaller in the eyes of the rest of the world  Ah yes  Christie will be the Republican s best attack dog  He d be the perfect running mate for Romney   As for President Obama  he gave a long planned speech in Osawatomie  Kansas  that outlined his populist theme for 2012  part of which is why I said long before everyone else that next year s campaign is going to be comparable to 1860  Obama in part proclaimed  This is the defining issue of our time  This is a make or break moment for the middle class and all those who are fighting to get into the middle class  At stake is whether this will be a country where working people can earn enough to raise a family  build a modest savings  own a home and secure their retirement   The free market has never been a license to take whatever you can from whomever you can   Their philosophy is simple  We are better off when everybody is left to fend for themselves and play by their own rules   Millions of working families in this country are now forced to take their children to food banks for a decent meal  As the Wall Street Journal s Daniel Henninger opined  Mr  Obama says everyone has to play by his new rules   Unless you re a financial institution whose business model is built on breaking the law  cheating consumers and making risky bets that could damage the entire economy  you should have nothing to fear from these new rules   Really  Citigroup on Thursday said it will eliminate 4 500 jobs  In the third quarter alone  2 500 U S  banks cut 20 332 jobs  Let  em go  In the coming Obama economy  they can  make wind turbines and high powered batteries   But I would be intellectually dishonest myself if I didn t acknowledge that income disparity is indeed an issue  as outlined in this space over the years  such as comparisons on CEO pay vs  the average worker today vs  30 years ago  Yet  it s also an issue throughout the developed world As the Washington Post editorialized  Obama s policy prescriptions  don t match the gravity of the problems he describes  In addition  to the extent he finds villains in American corporate greed or weak regulation  he misses the  Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development s  point that the phenomenon  fueled in large measure by globalization and new technology  transcends borders and political systems  And then the Post nailed it  Of most concern is what the president omitted or played down  He made glancing reference to the need to  get our fiscal house in order  and immediately pivoted to the imperative of extending the payroll tax holiday  The economic growth that will be essential cannot happen with the dampening overhang of ever mounting debt  Nor can the spending Mr  Obama rightly prescribes for education  research and infrastructure    I was watching CNBC and two business titans  Richard LeFrak and Wilbur Ross  were talking about how the  future is brighter than the past   Oh  give me a break  Just look at the above paragraph  or the Europe discussion of the last 19 months   Donald Trump on Karl Rove   Rove gave us George W  Bush  who crashed and burned  and because of Bush we have Barack Obama   Advantage Trump   George Will on Herman Cain   He had a fundamentally disrespectful approach to the presidency   Other than that  good riddance  Herman Cain   New York lawmakers unanimously passed Democratic Gov  Andrew Cuomo s tax package which would raise billions in additional revenues from wealthier residents  while aiding the middle class  a bit So how did Cuomo get Republicans to go along  Jacob Gershman of the Wall Street Journal explains   For  antitax Senate Republicans  all 32 of whom voted for the tax package  the measure represented a turnaround on tax policy that required some delicate explaining  On Wednesday  Senate Majority Leader Dean Skelos   a Long Island Republican who in May called an expiring personal income tax increase on the wealthy  dead    framed the action as a tax cut     We re cutting taxes  in my opinion   Mr  Skelos said  alluding to the fact that even those earning  2 million or more will see their tax rate fall to 8 82  from 8 97   That s still nearly two percentage points more than the 6 85  they paid before the temporary tax increase  the so called millionaire s tax  passed in 2009    Framing  the tax code changes as a tax break had Republicans sounding much like their political opponents who favor higher taxes for the rich    Former Illinois Gov  Rod Blagojevich was sentenced to 14 years in prison for corruption  or basically the 15 to 20 years prosecutors sought  Plus under federal rules  he ll have to serve at least 85 percent of the sentence  Heh heh   I glance at my site traffic just every 4 6 months  because  frankly  it doesn t change  which isn t great but since I m doing zero advertising these days  isn t all bad either  But I m always curious as to traffic outside the U S   about 20  of the total  and the nation giving me the second most hits is India  followed by New Zealand  Canada and Pakistan  I love you  my Pakistani fans   Assuming they aren t with the ISI    So now we know there is a planet out there  a new discovery called Kepler 22b  where the average temperature is said to be 72 degrees  Then again  scientists don t know as yet whether the planet has a surface  so don t go booking trips to Kepler through Expedia just yet  It could just be a big gas bag like Neptune  Plus its 600 light years away  or 600 Xs 6 trillion miles  which isn t exactly convenient in terms of coordinating everyone s vacation schedules   Uh oh From Marthe Fourcade of Bloomberg  Marathon runners and others engaging in extreme endurance exercise may temporarily damage the right ventricle of their hearts  researchers found  The impact on the ventricle was reversed after a week in most of the 40 athletes who took part in a study published in the European Heart Journal  Five of them showed more lasting damage  Good thing I m just running a half today  It was here in Kiawah  two years ago  that I was witness to a death near the finish line  a 40 year old seemingly in good shape   The Washington Post reported that  The Air Force dumped the incinerated partial remains of at least 274 American troops in a Virginia landfill  far more than the military had acknowledged  Ed  per a previous Post story   before halting the secretive practice three years ago  records show  The landfill dumping was concealed from families who had authorized the military to dispose of the remains in a dignified and respectful manner  Air Force officials said  There are no plans  they said  to alert those families now   Records show that the Air Force hired  private  contractors to dispose of medical waste and did not specify that cremated body parts were included    Finally  Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day was a bit more touching  this 70th anniversary  than some others due to the fact that the Veterans organization for the survivors is being disbanded because so few are left But as the New York Post editorialized  This time  America understood and embraced its responsibilities  Despite occasional foot dragging  it lived up to them   providing good example and necessary stability to the world in the process  Whether the nation retains the will to look after its interests properly is an open question  There is cause for concern  But on Dec  7  1941    a date which will live in infamy    all doubts were dispelled  History knocked  America answered  I also can t help but muse that with so few survivors of World War II remaining  I wonder how many of them think of a certain song that was popular back in the day as they sit on the porch  staring at the horizon  thinking of times past  friends lost  That haunting Vera Lynn song from 1943 that I myself think of anytime I see a World War

132259,353774,EXPE,ECB Monetary Policy Meeting to Set Today s Trading Tone,opinion,The Euro continues to press higher ahead of today s ECB monetary policy meeting where most of the attention is going to be placed on the statements released at the press conference after the meeting   The extent to which the ECB will be involved in the final Greek debt swap agreement is the main issue  given that markets are not expecting any changes to the base interest rate in the Eurozone   Recent price activity in the Euro is indicative of a generally optimistic tone so it looks unlikely that there will be any news today that will send prices much higher   Downside risks in equity markets and high yielding currencies is a much more likely scenario given that most of the potential good news has already been priced in In the UK  the Bank of England will also hold its monetary policy meeting today and markets are generally expecting an announcement of additional quantitative easing stimulus  which will come in the form of a 50 billion GBP increase in its asset purchase program   Any announcements less than this figure will weigh on the FTSE 100 and lead to a modest rally in Sterling   We will also see some important macro data for the region  with the NIESR Gross Domestic Product GDP survey  Industrial Production and Trade Balance all scheduled for release   Earnings figures will be reported by Rio Tinto  BG Group  Rolls Royce and Landsdown The main stories out of Asia overnight related to macro data which showed that Japanese machinery orders were negative in December and Consumer Price figures in China were seen higher in the month of January   Both of these reports are a negative for regional equity markets and most of the Asian indices were seen lower on the session   Nissan Motors added to the downside pressure in the Nikkei 225  on weaker results in its third quarter earnings report In the US  S P futures are showing an essentially unchanged open  with macro data today coming in the form of Initial Jobless Claims and Wholesale Inventories   Earnings reports will be the bigger story today  however  as Pepsi Co   Philip Morris  Coca Cola and Expedia are all scheduled to report quarterly profits   These earnings report will create additional volatility during the New York session but the general tone for the day is more likely to be determined by the ECB press conference today and the concluding comments from central bank President Mario   title  EUR JPY  width  752  height  393    The EUR JPY has formed a very clear range on the hourly charts but the top side resistance levels are coming under pressure and the higher lows are suggestive of an upside break   The MACD reading is also supportive of this  as it is showing a fresh cross into positive territory   All we need to see is a daily close above 102 35 to confirm the break and this will target the next Fibonacci level on the daily charts The S P 500 is still grinding higher but we are coming into some major long term resistance levels and momentum is slowing  which is suggestive of a topping formation   Any breaks in the 1350 level are unlikely to see much follow through as a result of this  so risk to reward favors sell positions at current levels   A break of support at 1330 will take immediate pressure off of the topside ,2012-02-09,Spread Betting,https://www.investing.com/analysis/ecb-monetary-policy-meeting-to-set-today’s-trading-tone-113548,113548
132260,353775,EXPE,Expedia  Earnings Today  Order Flow Bets on a Move    Possibly Bullish,opinion,Expedia  Inc    EXPE  is an online travel company  The Company makes available  on a stand alone and package basis  travel products and services provided by numerous airlines  lodging properties  car rental companies  destination service providers  cruise lines and other travel product and service companies The company has earnings due out today  AMC  This is an order flow note ahead of that call  The company has traded over 29 000 contracts on total daily average option volume of just 2 613  Calls have traded on a 1 9 1 ratio to puts  The action has been in the Feb 35 calls where over 12 800 have traded  The Stats Tab and Day s biggest trades snapshots are included  below  The Options Tab  below  illustrates that the Feb 35 calls are mostly opening  compare OI to trade size   The flow looks like mostly buyers  but there is a touch of ambiguity for sure  On a side note  look at the Feb 38 calls    over 2 00 have traded and they all look like purchases  It is important to recognize that stock has already surpassed the daily average  so a bunch of these options might be going up tied to stock  so the delta is potentially muted or reversed    maybe  The Skew Tab snap  below  illustrates the vols by strike by month We can see the front is elevated to the back    but that s normal and expected  The Feb options essentially represent the volatility of the earnings reaction as they expire in less than seven trading days Finally  the Charts Tab  six months  is below  The top portion is the stock price  the bottom is the vol  IV30    red vs HV20    blue vs HV180    pink  On the stock side  we can see the upward price evolution of late    EXPE was in the high 20 s a month ago and is now up more than 18  from those levels  It is a bit weird that the vol has reacted so abruptly today  Usually there s an orderly upward trend as earnings approach  but instead we see a  20  pop right in front of the news It ll be interesting to see the results as the order flow reflects premium buyers  bets that the stock will move  and it feels like bullish order flow    at least in part This is trade analysis  not a recommendation ,2012-02-09,Ophir Gottlieb,https://www.investing.com/analysis/expedia:-earnings-today;-order-flow-bets-on-a-move----possibly-bullish-113602,113602
132262,353777,EXPE,Powerful Rally Still A Possibility,opinion,The VIX struggled to stay above its10 week moving average at 16 65  but closed the week below it  It made a near Fibonacci retracement of 72   It was due for a Primary Cycle low on April 27 and it appears ready for the rally to resume  This week it appears that several indexes I follow had inverted cycles  including the VIX  That does not negate the powerful rally that I have been predicting  It merely postponed it another week       SPX closed above its 10 week moving average   The SPX closed back above the 10 week moving average at 1386 62  This counts well as an extended wave  ii   which leaves the door open for a wave  iii  decline starting next week  The appearance of the Orthodox Broadening Top at hourly  daily and weekly degrees is a harbinger of a Flash Crash that could take the SPX to its Cycle Bottom at 1042 61 in very short order       Retailers in the S P 500 climbed 3 5 percent for the biggest gain among 24 groups    the largest Internet retailer  and Expedia Inc   an online travel company  surged at least 15 percent as earnings beat estimates    NDX makes a more complex weekly reversal signal   The NDX closed 10 points above its weekly Cycle Top resistance at 2731 54  completing a more complex weekly reversal top than we saw a week ago  It appears that the markets are extending their retracements  possibly hoping for new highs  The Cycles Model suggests that the decline will resume early next week  The Broadening Wedge  red  indicates that once NDX drops below Cycle Top resistance at 2670 00  the initial decline may quickly decline an average of 20  with a target near 2100 00  This Master Cycle may be in overtime  as it was last July  Most cycle practitioners believe that a right translated cycle may offer only a mild decline  Last year s Broadening Top says differently  This year the cycle is stretched again  The cycle profiles in virtually all assets suggest something dramatic is about to happen       Global investors this month pulled the most money from stock funds in any April in at least 17 years amid escalating concerns that  s economy is faltering    Is the Euro ready for a collapse   The Euro continues to consolidate within its Broadening Wedge formation since its January 13 high  there is no change so far  It closed on Friday just above its 10 week moving average at 132 15  A decline below its trendline at 130 00 will confirm the resumption of the downtrend  There is a Head   Shoulders neckline at 126 24 with a minimum target near parity for the Euro  This combination of formations presages a crash in the Euro with an average target near 100 00       For the third week in a row  European equity and credit markets have remained range bound  Equities broadly ended the week in the green with the BE500  Bloomberg s broad S P 500 equivalent for Europe  ending near the top of the recent range   around the pre NFP levels from 4 5  Spain and Italy have seen improvements this week in their equity indices but they remain down notably on the month and perhaps surprisingly only the UK s FTSE 100 is in the green for the month    The US Dollar is stepping up the triangle trendline  The US Dollar closed yet another week above its triangle trendline and weekly mid cycle support at 78 69 in a consolidation pattern  It closed below 10 week resistance at 79 44  but just below weekly mid cycle support resistance at 79 40  Today it had its Trading Cycle low  This cycle was also inverted  but sets up  USD for a Primary Cycle high near May 15  Generally the first Trading Cycle out of a Master Cycle low ends in a high  This Trading Cycle had a higher low  which opens the door for the next  Primary  cycle to go much higher        The dollar remained lower against the yen and the euro after a report showed the  grew less than forecast in the first quarter  Gold continues to weaken below its 10 week resistance  Gold has continued to dwell beneath its 10 week moving average  currently at 1678 79  since March 12  The weekly chart shows a breakdown beneath its uptrend line at 1800 00  The massive Head   Shoulders pattern seen in the chart hasn t yet broken  but gold is slowly drifting toward the neckline  This could trigger yet another cataclysmic decline toward the Cycle Bottom show in the chart  What conspiracy theorists call  price suppression  may  in fact  be judicious selling at the top of a cycle    We are still seeing articles touting gold as a    in ZeroHedge and other places  Ultimately  they may be right  but the cycles call for another kind of experience first  deflation    U S  Bonds have broken above its triangle pattern   The USB gapped up to its 10 week moving average at 139 74 three weeks ago and has remained above it since  USB has started its launch above the triangle formation to its Cycle Top resistance at 147 52  It may go much higher  if a panic in equities causes a parabolic blow off in treasuries  Let it be known  however  that this will be the final rally to a 30 year top      Treasury 10 year note yields rose from a 12 week low as a report showing first quarter growth increased tempered a rally triggered in Europe by concern that the region s sovereign debt crisis will worsen    Crude closed below 10 week support   West Texas Crude remained below its 10 week moving average at 105 47 this week after trading in a narrow range  This sets up West Texas Crude is destined to fall as far as Cycle Bottom support at 68 56 possibly in a flash crash in the coming Master Cycle low  This may well trigger the Head   Shoulders pattern near 79 00       Oil fell from the highest level in almost four weeks in New York  trimming a second weekly gain  after a cut in  s credit rating renewed concern that  s faltering economy may curb fuel demand    Are China stocks ready to take the plunge   The Shanghai index remained above its 10 week moving average at 2382 57 this week and extended its retracement to 73 5   A reversal below its 10 week line would trigger a sell signal  The next level of support is the Cycle Bottom support at 2175 32  which would give way to the Head   Shoulders neckline at 2125 00    This may put the Shanghai in the position of losing about half of its value in the next decline  which appears to have started this week and may last another two months  It appears that the Shanghai Index may be leading world equities in their decline  Read     The India Nifty is losing ground  The India Nifty continues to consolidate above mid cycle support at 5158 04 but berlow its 10 week moving average at 53902 57  It seems as if the entire world has been on hold for the past two months  A drop below mid cycle support would certainly test the Head   Shoulders neckline and may bring downside acceleration to the India 50 index  Normally when the right shoulder of a Head   Shoulders pattern is complete  it doesn t pause very long at the neckline       The Bank Index tested mid cycle support and bounced  BKX tested mid cycle support at 46 91 on Monday  where it bounced  It retraced above its 10 week m a  where it closed near the 54  retracement level  A reversal beneath the Bearish Wedge formation strongly suggests that  when the reversal happens  it will be likely plunge beneath the neckline very quickly  Bearish Wedges are always completely retraced    Right beneath the Bearish Wedge formation is an enormous Head   Shoulders pattern  The intial decline to or beneath the Head   Shoulders neckline may take place no later than mid May       In perhaps the most courageous  and likely must read for future economists  speech ever given inside the New York Fed s shallowed hallowed walls   delivered the truth  the whole truth  and nothing but the truth to the monetary priesthood  Gracious from the start  Wenzel takes the Keynesian clap trappers to task on almost every nonsensical and oblivious decision they have made in recent years ,2012-05-01,Anthony M.
