3150,224665,CFBK,Money in America,opinion,The National Monetary Commission in 1908 Informing the public via a predetermined public relation campaign  with surveys and solutions of a predetermined outcome worked well  Keeping the scheme going for a decade took time  effort  and investment  With the passage of the Aldrich Vreeland Act in 1908 contained two important but little known provisions  the emergency currency potential and the establishment of the NMC  The former provision would have expired in 1914 but curiously  was used for the one and only time that year  However  Aldrich had packed his commission in June of 1908 with senators and representatives but  more significantly  powerful banking leaders  This junket headed for Europe in the fall  studying and gather information with heads of private European banks and central banks  They concluded European banking was more efficient and the European currencies had more gravitas compared to the dollar  By December   back in the U S   Aldrich added Paul Warburg and others to the inner circle  Charles A  Conant was chosen for  research and public relations   Warburg consulted with many academic economists at top tier universities  The American Bankers Association recommended a U S  Central bank along the lines of the German Reichsbank  Hesitant heads of national banks were assured the business model would not be adversely affected by the origin of a U S  Central bank  Regional banking districts in the country  under control of a central board  was a recommentation in November  1909  Throughout this whole era  the Morgan and Rockefeller banking interests had agreed to agree on a central bank  Yes  Incidentally  William Howard Taft was elected president  a friend of Aldrich and others since 1900  On September 14  1909  President Taft spoke in Boston and gave a big boost to the notion of a central bank  Wow  And a week later  The Wall Street Journal gave space to various op eds  unsigned  praising that great idea of  elastic currency  and other benefits  Actually  these letters were crafted by Charles Conant  He also recommended the regulation of interest rates by the central bank as a useful tool  The Washington Bureau of the Associate Press was also co opted  Another significant speech by Paul Warburg in New York on March 23  1910 impressed the Merchants  Association of New York  They had printed 30 000 copies of the transcript and distributed these far and wide  For public consumption  a monetary conference in New York in November 1910 presented a specific recommendations for a central bank and an appeal for all part of the country to support the Bill that Alrich would soon craft    The Private Railroad Car G  Edward Griffin  1  sets the scene at a New Jersey railroad station like the opening of a thriller movie  it s 10 p m  on November 22  1910 as a handful of important men board a private car  Unlike the numbered cars of the rest of this train  this one has no number  only a small plaque with the inscription  Aldrich   The senator greets his guests by first name only   and this rule is adhered throughout the trip and the week at Jekyll Island  Georgia  The private club on the island is part owned by J P  Morgan  The personnel lineup Senator Nelson P AldrichPaul Warburg  various banking connectionsAbraham Andrew  Assistant Secretary of the U S  TreasuryHenry P  Davison  senior partner  J P  Morgan Co Frank A  Vanderlip  president  National City Bank of New YorkCharles D  Norton  president  First National Bank of New YorkBenjamin Strong  head of Bankers Trust Co  The last two are questionable due to differing accounts in the  historical record  but both were in the Morgan camp  Aldrich  incidentally  was a financial partner of J P  Morgan  and also father in law of John D  Rockefeller  Jr   If Strong wasn t there  he surely knew about it   we will hear more of him  The public did indeed hear something of this secret meeting  but it was in 1935  The Saturday Evening Post carried an article by Vanderlip and the key takeaway was  If it were to be exposed publicly that our particular group had got together and written a banking bill  that bill would have had no chance whatever of passage by Congress    Warburg led the argument for a regional structure  presumably cognizant of public mistrust of too much power located in one area  Aldrich wanted an overt central bank with no political meddling  The compromise that was reached became the Aldrich Plan  introduced in Congress in 1912 and 1913   On November 5 6  2010  Ben Bernanke stayed on Jekyll Island to commemorate the 100 year anniversary of the original meeting   Alas  the Democrats won the 1912 elections resoundingly  The Republican Aldrich Plan seemed to fall by the wayside  Shiny new President Woodrow summoned a special session of Congress in April 1913  To seal the importance  he appeared in person  the first president since John Adams to do so  Wilson s address outlined various approaches to economic policies  banking and currency reform  tariffs  and the income tax  The 16th Amendment had been ratified on February 3  1913  Wilson needed that tax to support lower tariffs  A little bit of patronage pressure  and the Revenue Act of 1913 was passed by the House on May 8  1913  finally it went through the Senate on September 9  1913  Meanwhile  the Aldrich Plan was not dead  though that hated Republican name vanished  Representative Carter Glass  chairman of the House Banking and Currency Committee  and Senator Robert Owen  chairman of the Senate s did a little tinkering here and there  Wilson mandated a central Federal reserve board be appointed by the president   with the consent of the Senate  There was one thorn in Wilson s side  his Secretary of State  William Jennings Bryan  The  Cross of Gold  person was still a power in the Democratic Party  The sop to Bryan was that Federal Reserve currency would be a liability of the government   and also  provision for federal loans to farmers  All this horse trading took time  though  and Wilson had other fish to fry during 1913  The 17th Amendment  Direct Election of U S  Senators   ratified and declared  became part of the Constitution on May 31  1913   Finally  months in the making  what started as the Glass Owen bill became the Federal Reserve Act of 1913  It passed the House on December 13 and the Senate  after an all nighter  on December 23  Wilson signed it that morning  A great year for the Populists  remember they wanted a graduated income tax  direct election of senatorsand before long  they got women s suffrage  19th Amendment   the eight hour work day  and restricted immigration    The Federal Reserve System  1914 and Beyond Aldrich had convened the Jekyll Island cabal but Warburg was the only expert on the European central bank model  Galbraith asserted that  Warburg has  with some justice  been called the father of the system   In the end  everybody won something  Aldrich s  decentralization  became the regional banks and avoidance of the term  bank  itself inevitably led to the Federal Reserve System nomenclature  And having the Federal Reserve Board in Washington  D C  implied  government   Smoke   mirrors  A decade later  the little Orphan Annie comic strip appeared  Did anyone recognize Daddy Warbucks  the self made billionaire doing good works with his wealth as an avatar of Paul Warburg  Anyway   Back in the day  the public story was that the Federal Reserve System would stabilize the economy  We ll see how that worked out  The real power of the System was   and is   the Federal Reserve Bank of New York  And who was offered the post of governor there  Benjamin Strong  Whether or not he was at Jekyll Island  there is no doubt he had influence  having been the personal auditor for J  P  Morgan  Sr  during the Panic of 1907  and also a long time friend of Henry Davidson  Paul Warburg became one of the seven members of the Federal Reserve Board in Washington  History has a droll way of throwing some unexpected crises   who would have imagined the assassination of an obscure archduke would lead to a worldwide conflagration  Well  that s the myth  anyhow  That the British mercantilist system might have been under threat from a foreign export power is unthinkiable as a cause for war  Isn t it  The outbreak of World War One had one immediate financial side effect  the New York Stock Market closed  Public anxiety was dispelled by the Secretary of the Treasury  using that dormant part of the Aldrich Vreeland Act  Emergency currency was available  by October 23  1914   368 616 990  In November  the 12 regional banks of the Federal Reserve System had opened and the emergency currency was withdrawn  The FRS was open for business  England and various European countries had been preparing for war for years  Armies were trained  alliances arranged  But when war occurred  England found itself fiscally bereft  John Pierpoint  Jack  Morgan  Jr  ruled the House of Morgan  his father having died in March  1913  Jack became the sales representative of British bonds and also the procurement officer for their needed war material  Nice profit on money going and coming  In 1915  President Wilson removed the ban on private bank lending to foreign allies  The House of Morgan immediately loaned  12 000 000 to Russia and  50 000 000 to France  Meanwhile  the first  12 000 000 British contract arrived  the first of many  The final total would be  3 000 000 000  Author John Moody  writing in 1919 summed it up  Not only did Britain and France pay for their supplies with money furnished by Wall Street  but they made their purchases through the same medium   Inevitably the House of Morgan was selected for this important task  Thus the war had given Wall Street an entirely new role  Hitherto it had been exclusively the headquarters of finance  now it became the greatest industrial mart the world had ever known  In addition to selling stock and bonds  financing railroads  and performing other tasks of a great banking centre  Wall Street began to deal in shells  cannon  submarines  blankets  clothing  shoes  canned meats  wheat  and the thousands of other articles needed for the prosecution of a great war  Large profits and small  A commission for selling  2 billion of Allied stock holdings to buy munitions  The sale of 4 400 000 rifles for  194 000 000  The House of Morgan was both buyer and seller  and no surprise that many of the purchase contracts went to businesses where Morgan was a shareholder  A reputation as war profiteer does attract some resentment  On July 3  1915 an intruder stole into Jack s Long Island mansion and shot him twice in the groin  Jack  however  survived  Great Britain  having burned through the Australian gold  from the 19th century gold rush there  found itself short of money to fund a war  It did the thing that is obvious to every politician  achieve fiat money by golng off the gold standard  Every other country in Europe did also  America maintained a gold standard but not redemption for foreign held dollars  By the end of the war  every country had inflated its money supply  Germany went eight times the pre war amount  This explains much of things to come    The Cunard Lines had turned over their record breaking Lusitania over to the Admiralty  The speedy ocean lined proved inadvisable to refit into an auxiliary cruiser due to operational expense  910 tons of coal a day    so it was ordered to continue passenger  and mail  service  On April  22 1915  the German embassy ordered advertisements in 50 U S  newspapers  advising prospective passengers that an Atlantic crossing went through a war zone  the seas around the British Isles   Many of these advertisements were never published   On May 1  1915  the Lusitania set out on its final voyage to Liverpool  England  Little did the passengers know there was a hidden cargo of munitions and other material for the British war effort  At this point in time  the German navy followed the code of limited submarine warfare  Neutral vessels were off limits  At 1420 hours on May 6  the commander of the U 20  Walther Schwieger  fires one torpedo at a target  Torpedo hits starboard side right behind the bridge  An unusually heavy detonation takes place with a very strong explosive cloud  The explosion of the torpedo must have been followed by a second one  boiler or coal or powder    The ship stops immediately and heels over to starboard very quickly  immersing simultaneously at the bow  the name Lusitania becomes visible in golden letters  U20 log The Lusitania sank in only 18 minutes  Few lifeboats were properly launched due to the extreme starboard list  Of 1 959 passengers and crew  1 195 perish  including 128 Americans  Several official inquiries were convened that created enough obfuscation to keep tinfoil hat manufacturers busy to this very day  Prevented testimony  state secrets  crew statements in identical handwriting with similar phrasing  definitely one  no  two  or was it three torpedos  Some closed hearings  other open with no access to some evidence  Two sets of Admiralty papers  depending on the type of hearing  Perjury  At any rate  Wilson s immediate response was three diplomatic notes to Germany  strong  stronger  ultimatum  After the second  Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan resigned in protest  Nonetheless  the American public had been fired up  just not enough for war  The British were already hinting that  should they lose the war  they would never be able to repay their debt to America  In early 1916  President Wilson sent his personal adviser   Colonel  Edward Mandell House to London  And why not   House was the shadow power that had arranged Wilson s nomination for president  House even had two rooms at the White House  And while Wilson sought re election on the slogan  he kept American out of war   his adviser consulted with British foreign office officials  notably Sir Edward Grey  Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan had not be told of this unofficial arrangement  nonetheless  he was not stupid  Mary Baird Bryan  co author  The Memoris of William Jennings Bryan  While Secretary Bryan was bearing the heavy responsibility of the Department of State  there arose the curious conditions surrounding Mr  E M House s unofficial connection with the President and his voyages abroad on affairs of State  which were not communicated to Secretary Bryan   The President was unofficially dealing with foreign powers  U S  Ambassador Walter Hines Page  House arrived    with  the idea of American intervention   a minimum programme of peace   the least the Allies would accept  which  he assumed  would be unacceptable to the Germans  we should plunge into the War  not on the merits of the cause  but by a carefully sprung trick   memorandum  February 9  1916  On March 9  1916  President Wilson sanctioned the secret agreement with England and France for the United States of intervene on behalf of the Allies  It seems Wilson and House believed the worthy end  of world peace and a world government  lay through the means of war  They had help  Assistant Secretary of the Navy Roosevelt  the Franklin Delano  urged arming merchant ships in violation of neutrality  And time passed with America on the sidelines and the Allies accusing Wilson of dragging his feet  Maybe they didn t understand the U S  election cycle  The attitude of the British public toward America was  too proud or too scared  and they termed unexploded shells on the front line as  wilsons   Both British and German propaganda served to inflame the American public over the next months  Wilson was narrowly re elected in 1916  A tipping point happened when Germany attempted to enlist Mexico as an ally  following their new policy  Of unrestricted submaine warfare  This threated American commercial shipping  On April 2  1917 in his message to Congress  Wilson spoke of armed neutrality no longer working   enemies against us at our very doors   unsuspecting communities   and offices of government with spies   criminal intrigues    and a warning  disloyalty  will be dealt with a firm hand of repression   And finally  the world must again be safe for democracy  With fifty representatives and six senators opposted  a declaration of war was passed by Congress on April 4  1917 and signed by Wilson the April 6  Behind the scenes during this period  the Federal Reserve went into full operation in 1915  They played a significant role in financial Allied and U S  War efforts  with some help   Wilson furthered Democratic values with the agricultural Smith Lever Act of 1914 and the Federal Farm Loan Act of 1916  He also thwarted a national transportation shutdown by guiding the Adamson Act through Congress which instituted the eight hour day  Then there was the Espionage Act of 1917 and the Sedition Act of 1918  A firm hand  yes  Anarchists  Wobblies  communists  anti war activists  and even newspaper editors were grist for the DoJ mill  Deportation of recent immigrants who opposed the war came with the Immigration Act of 1918  Then there was Wilson s Committee of Public information  the first official propaganda office  Wilson s League of Nations concept came via a speech on January 8  1918  his Fourteen Points    Liberty Bonds We have a war  And on April 24  the 1917 Emergency Loan Act initiated the first of four bond issues  Buy Liberty Bonds  It s a patriotic duty  A limit of  5 billion was set   2 billion were sold  The second  third and forth issues appeared in  respectively  October 1 1917  April 5  1918  and September 28  1918  A poor response to the bonds was met by the Treasury with a sales campaign promoted by Hollywood stars  Boy Scouts  and even a special Army Air Corps elite group that travelled the country  Buy a bond and get to ride in a JN 4 airplane  Incidentally  that 1917 act is the tool by which U S  Treasury bonds are issued to this very day  We will re visit the fourth Liberty Bond issue in fifteen years  The active  war to end war  ended on November 11  1918 with a cease fire  The Treaty of Versailles was signed on June 28  1919 ,2012-01-27,Jim
