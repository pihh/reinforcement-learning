162915,384431,GIS,Longtime China Watchers Predict What s Next for Slowing Economy,news," Bloomberg     China s economy started the decade in a boom and will end it suffering the worst slowdown since the early 1990s 
What comes next  Bloomberg asked some of the world s most prominent China watchers  several of which distinguished themselves over the past 10 years with prescient forecasts or market beating returns 
Predictions of even slower economic growth were near unanimous among the group  though most respondents also said policy makers have the tools to avoid a crisis  Several investors flagged buying opportunities in Chinese stocks after valuations sank to record lows versus global peers 
Among the biggest long term worries  demographics  Ed Yardeni  who coined the term  bond vigilantes  in the 1980s  had a similarly colorful take on China  calling it  the world s largest nursing home   His and other comments below have been lightly edited and condensed 
George Magnus  research associate at Oxford University s China Centre and author of  Red Flags  Why Xi s China is in Jeopardy 
In the spirit of self criticism  I d say my best call on the economy was an early spot of the huge demographic shift that kicked off in earnest in 2012  an abiding assertion that China s elevated growth rates could not be sustained  and anticipation of a financial crisis that turned up in 2015 16  Worst call was thinking that crisis might turn into a  Minsky Moment  for China  as per 2007 08  and failing to integrate properly the tools the state has to prevent catastrophic failure 
I expect China to flirt with officially recorded growth of around 6   but the reality is that the tempo of growth is ratcheting down to somewhere between 3  and 4   In 2020  perhaps 5 8  to 6   officially  not least because the economic news has to remain upbeat ahead of the CCP centenary in 2021  The consequences of over indebtedness  demographic change  inadequate wealth transfer and income redistribution policies  and stagnant total factor productivity growth associated with institutional flaws are the main drags on growth  The 2020s will be a challenging time for China 
 Dong Baozhen  whose Chinese stock fund has returned about 520  over the past five years  a period when the Shanghai Composite Index was little changed
People have not made much money in the stock market the past decade  While China was seen to be the growth engine of the world during the financial crisis  markets elsewhere are at new highs  whereas we are still where we started  That could mean the gains have been postponed 
The probability of no increase in stock valuations in the next decade is a lot smaller than the index reaching 10 000  up from around 3 000 now  That could happen if the valuation of large caps doubles from their current PE to about 10  I like blue chips and financials that are severely undervalued  The sectors favored in the past two years  consumer staples and drugmakers  are way overvalued 
Jim O Neill  the former  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc  NYSE GS   chief economist who coined the term BRIC
The BRICs path assumed China would grow 5  a year in the decade 2020 29 and I have no reason for changing this  If it does  and so long as the renminbi doesn t decline a lot in value  then by the end of the decade  China will be very close to being as big in current dollar terms as the U S 
As this decade nears its end  China has major problems positioning itself in the world  As evidenced by the Uighur situation  China s approach to life now gets much more global attention than when it was smaller  In the coming decade  China has to somehow develop a more subtle and sophisticated stance on many of these issues  and I am not sure Beijing fully realizes this yet 
Wang Qing  president and chief economist of Shanghai Chongyang Investment Management Co  The firm s flagship fund recorded a 385  return from its inception in 2008 through the end of November
The scale of the economy will surpass that of the U S  for sure over the next decade  with annual growth likely slowing to an average 4   which would still be a healthy level given the size of it  What China is experiencing now is like what Japan and Korea had been through decades ago  If we take a 10  to 20 year view  events like trade war are just small disruptions along the course of economic development 
In the past decade it was properties and wealth management products with guaranteed returns that won favor with investors and enjoyed the fastest growth  while equities only accounted for a small portion of the pie  Now with the era of fastest property development growth behind us  and policy changes that shake up the WMP industry  returns on such investments will be much less attractive and risk adjusted returns in equities will outweigh those on property investment 
Consumption remains a sector that offers abundant opportunities  The past decade has been a golden age of durables consumption  like home appliances and automobiles   In the coming decade it ll be services consumption that takes the center stage  with gems to be found in education  health care  leisure and travel as well as sports 
Charlene Chu  senior analyst at Autonomous Research
What I wasn t expecting to see was that the authorities would get religious on what I was talking about  which is that they had a shadow credit monster on their hands that had to be dealt with or it was going to have really serious longer term consequences  On the whole  they have done a very good job of really coming in and saying this has to stop  even in the middle of a trade war 
The problem is they still have a lot of bad debt that has been built up and that hasn t really been dealt with  We estimate more than 20  of total credit is bad credit  The real risk is that the pace of clean up is too slow  and that this dead weight strangles growth 
The question for China over the next ten years is are they going to be forced to deal with these problems in a much more rapid and aggressive fashion or can they just continue to drag these out forever  
Edward Yardeni  president and chief investment strategist at Yardeni Research Inc 
Demography is starting to really weigh on China s growth  China is rapidly evolving into the world s largest nursing home They are going to have to provide a social safety net for these folks who are going to get older and need health care  If they don t do that  they are going to depress their consumers  When you want to be a superpower there are a lot of factors that matter  and demography is certainly one of them 
Arthur Kroeber  a founding partner and managing director at research firm Gavekal Dragonomics
One of the things that has been surprising  particularly since Xi Jinping took over  is the degree to which the state has held onto its huge position in the economy and in many cases reinforced it  The lack of progress away from a state driven economy to a more private sector one has been disappointing but it has also been surprising that they have been able to maintain the pace of growth that they have  even with the state sector 
Ten years from now  I don t think we are going to be in a much different place as far as the internationalization of the Chinese currency  As long as they have this problem of high leverage and a somewhat fragile domestic financial system  they are going to have very little incentive to allow full fluidity of capital flows into and out of the country 
Michael Pettis  a finance professor at Peking University and former Bear Stearns Cos  banker
My best call was probably to insist  even in 2015 16 when the market strongly expected otherwise  that as quickly as debt was rising  China was unlikely to experience a financial crisis and a sharp depreciation of the currency  I think the market didn t understand that these are mainly balance sheet events  and as long as China s financial system was closed and its regulators powerful  Beijing could easily extend and restructure liabilities so as to prevent a crisis 
My worst call was to propose that Beijing would recognize the extent of investment misallocation and the inexorable rise in debt by 2015 16  and would begin to lower the GDP growth target rapidly after that  I did not recognize how politically difficult this would prove  and that it couldn t happen until Xi Jinping and the people around him had done a lot more to consolidate political power 
Every historical precedent    and the logic of the growth dynamics    suggests it will be another Japan  GDP growth rates will drop consistently every year until China is growing at below 3   and the longer it takes to get there  the more debt it will have to work off and the greater the macroeconomic financial distress costs it will have to absorb 
Fraser Howie  author of  Red Capitalism  The Fragile Financial Foundation of China s Extraordinary Rise 
I thought there would have been greater shocks because of the debt  Not necessarily crises  but I think China has spun out the debt problems far longer than anyone even on the bearish side would have given them credit for  It s only now in 2019 that we are starting to see a dramatic increase in defaults 
You are now starting this decade with almost the worst numbers and financials at every level  so why would we think this is going to turn around when our starting point is so much worse  The ability for China to stimulate their way out is clearly going to be much more limited  Last decade was a decade of building problems and the coming decade is one of avoiding the consequences of those problems 
Eswar Prasad  who once led the International Monetary Fund s China team and is now at Cornell University
The government has succeeded in maneuvering the economy around the seemingly inevitable prospects  at various points  of a financial crisis  massive currency devaluation  housing market meltdown  and economic stagnation  None of these plausible doomsday scenarios has yet come to pass and it is not clear any of them will 
Over the next few years  China is likely to continue growing at a rate that will look low relative to its recent history but will still be remarkable for a  13 trillion economy  Even a decent growth performance hinges  however  on the government s ability to reform the financial system so it allocates more resources to the parts of the economy that are more productive and can generate better employment growth 
Scott Kennedy  senior adviser and trustee chair in Chinese business and economics at the Center for Strategic   International Studies
China s economy has been more resilient than I expected it would have been without engaging in substantial liberalization  Although growth has slowed as a result of shoveling a growing proportion of resources to unproductive SOEs  authorities have managed to keep a lid on potential crises 
The growth outlook for 2020  5 7  to 5 8   just enough to reach their double centenary goals  In ten years   Ja pines   a mix of Japan and the Philippines   highly successful in a few sectors  yet beset by problems of inequality  debt  and poor governance 
Diana Choyleva  chief economist at Enodo Economics in London
China is now facing the sternest test of its development model since the economy started opening up 40 years ago  It is already an economic super power  but the 180 degree shift in its political and economic orientation under Xi s leadership is undermining the key drivers of its economic success 
Our read is that the market has pushed their earlier China worries to the back of their mind  But those will resurface during 2020 as Beijing goes for a credit fueled investment boost  raising investor debt concerns again after the likely initial positive response to more stimulus 
Hao Hong  the chief strategist at Bocom International in Hong Kong and one of the few forecasters to call the peak of China s equity boom in the middle of the decade
The consensus for 2020 is very optimistic  People are saying that were are bound for a  strong nation bull   Most are taking a cheery view on next years stock market but not so much for the economy  which is contradictory  We ve only seen one instance where the local stock market and economy did not move in tandem    in 2015  We see a bottom of 2 700 for the Shanghai Composite  and a peak that will probably not exceed 3 500  Next year might not be as easy to make money in the market The best trades will have to be bottom up  and you ll have to find the leading firms in each sector  or so called platform companies like  Alibaba   NYSE BABA   These are likely to emerge as the winners  Obvious themes like tech  health care and consumer bother me because i don t think we can think in terms of entire sectors  It will be a more intricate case of finding the niche opportunities   real estate services is one of them  A lot of opportunities may be found in companies that are not public as well  especially those that do innovative drugs 
Andy Xie  an independent economist and former Asia Pacific chief economist at  Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS 
China uses official statistics as an expectations management tool  gradually easing figures down so that confidence does not go bust  They won t lift expectations from here forward because they don t want hopes rising and then falling empty  The stats may say there is still stable growth  but in reality it s much more volatile  I think the official figures  say at the end of the decade  will be 4  or below 
I think leading companies in agriculture and education may be good areas to invest    anything that China wants to buy will do well  And under this principle  things that China wants but cannot create on its own  But these must be really world leading companies  like Cargill   General Mills   NYSE GIS  and Disney ",2019-12-18,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/economy/longtime-china-watchers-predict-whats-next-for-slowing-economy-2044566,2044566
162916,384432,GIS,Pet Food Success Masks Trouble for General Mills,news,"Food giant General Mills   NYSE GIS  stock rose about 2  after the company reported earnings on Dec  18  2019  The broader market  as measured by the S P 500  was flat  so Wall Street seemed pleased by the financial results  And there were things to be happy about in the company s fiscal second quarter 2020 earnings release  However  there were also things to be a little worried about  too  Here s the good news and the bad 
Going to the dogs
The single biggest piece of good news out of General Mills  financial results was that its pet food business grew 16  year over year on a material increase in volume  This is huge  because the packaged food company made a sizable bet on the space when it bought healthy pet food maker Blue Buffalo in 2018  Investors were concerned that it was paying a very high price for the company at  8 billion  General Mills  take was that it was paying for a high growth business  and that future growth would make the price tag look much less onerous over time  This deal appears to be playing out as management hoped so far  and the quarter was one more example of the trend  

To be honest  the logic of the Blue Buffalo purchase has always been pretty strong  Prior to being acquired  the company s products were largely available in specialty pet shops  It was only just starting to expand its distribution  into grocery stores  for example  when General Mills bought it  The latter has strong relationships with grocery and similar mass merchandise stores  so management believed it would be able to support and accelerate Blue Buffalo s growth plans  The real question was whether General Mills could execute on this plan  So far  it has 
This is doubly notable because some of the company s peers also gambled on pet food    and the progress they are making hasn t been living up to expectations  For example  sales at J  M  Smuckers   NYSE SJM  pet food business declined 2  in the most recent quarter  The company highlighted the trouble  with the CEO noting in the earnings release   Despite continuing softness for our premium dog food offerings  we were pleased with the performance for the balance of our portfolio   After a number of acquisitions  pet food is Smuckers  largest business  so any softness here is a pretty big deal  
Clearly  General Mills  success in expanding the Blue Buffalo brand is good news  and it is executing better than some key peers  But pet food is still a relatively small business for the company  around 9  of sales   which has material operations in the cereal  snack bar  and yogurt niches  among others 
The rest of the business
While pet food was a bright spot  the rest of General Mills  portfolio wasn t nearly as strong  Cereal did well  with sales up 2  in the first half of fiscal 2020  However  this is a mature business that s facing serious headwinds as consumers have shifted away from eating the breakfast food  General Mills is doing well for sure  but that s largely coming at the expense of competitors  who appear to be losing market share  So the company is putting up okay results and focusing on things like product innovation in a cash cow business that may be in secular decline at the moment  At best  this is a mixed blessing  
Management also highlighted that sales results in the company s snacks business improved in the fiscal first half  but that improvement was from down 4  in fiscal 2019 to down 1   Better  yes  but not a great outcome  General Mills  large snack bar operation was the big drag  with sales down 3  in the first six months of the fiscal year  though that still marked an improvement from the 5  decline last year  Snacking is a sector that is seeing increasing competition  so getting this business back on a growth track is both important and likely to be increasingly difficult 

Data source  General Mills  Table by author 
Then there s the Yoplait yogurt business  General Mills pretty much missed the Greek yogurt craze a few years ago  as that style of yogurt took over the space  As a result  yogurt sales in fiscal 2018 were off by a whopping 11   Management has been working its way back from this misstep  bringing out new products and refreshing older ones  But yogurt remains a soft spot  with sales down 3  so far in fiscal 2020  a worse showing than the 2  decline of 2019  
To be fair  not everything is going badly  Some of General Mills  major brands continue to perform well    Progresso Soups and Old El Paso  for example  put up retail sales growth of 3  and 6   respectively  And there really aren t any disasters in the mix like the fiscal 2018 yogurt performance  so it was  overall  a solid quarter  marked by a 12  bump in adjusted earnings per share 
However  the top line was flat  Ultimately  investors must balance the good news  like Blue Buffalo  and the weakness elsewhere in the portfolio  like yogurt and snacks     the company is hardly firing on all cylinders 
General Mills is a large and diversified packaged foods company  and there will always be a mix of good and bad in its portfolio  The hope is that  over time  the good will outweigh the bad  and sales and earnings will grow at a slow and steady pace  Management was looking to buy some growth when it added Blue Buffalo to its stable of iconic brands  and that s working out as intended  
If you own the stock or are thinking about adding it to your portfolio  you need to recognize that General Mills still has some work to do as it looks to get back on a growth track  That s not a knock on the quarter or the company  it s just the reality of the situation ",2020-01-16,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pisag,2060886

162988,384504,GIS,Kraft Heinz discloses SEC probe   15 billion write down  shares dive 20 percent,news,"By Uday Sampath Kumar and Nivedita Bhattacharjee
 Reuters    Shares of Kraft Heinz Co  NASDAQ KHC  slumped 20 percent late on Thursday after the food company posted a quarterly loss  disclosed an SEC investigation and wrote down the value of its iconic Kraft and Oscar Mayer brands as it highlighted the tough environment for the packaged food industry 
The gloomy results and forecast from the company  which is one of billionaire Warren Buffett s largest investments  reflect changes in consumer trends away from processed foods to healthier alternatives 
The after hours slump erased  12 billion from Kraft Heinz s stock market value and left its shares trading at their lowest point since H J  Heinz Co bought Kraft Foods Group Inc  NASDAQ KHC  in 2015  to create the world s fifth largest food and beverage company 
 Kraft Heinz results confirmed all our worst fears   plus more   Guggenheim Partners  analyst Laurent Grandet said in a note 
The  15 4 billion write down indicates declining fortunes of the iconic brands and other losses in asset value  meaning the company views those assets as less valuable than before the merger 
 We expect to take a step backwards in 2019   Chief Financial Officer David Knopf told analysts on a post earnings conference call  promising  consistent profit growth  starting in 2020 
Kraft  which owns Velveeta cheese and Heinz ketchup brands  forecast adjusted earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortization  EBITDA  between  6 3 billion and  6 5 billion in 2019  lower than analysts  estimates of  7 47 billion  according to IBES data from Refinitiv 
On a post earnings call with analysts  Chief Executive Officer Bernardo Hees said the entire packaged foods industry will likely remain challenged  blaming the rising popularity of private label brands and higher commodity costs 
 Kraft Heinz is in a worse position than many other consumer packaged goods companies because it has got a very weak portfolio of brands  They are not delivering the level of growth that s needed in this sort of market   GlobalData Retail managing director Neil Saunders said 
The company  which competes with  General Mills  Inc  NYSE GIS  and Kellogg Co  cut its quarterly dividend to 40 cents per share from around 63 cents per share on Thursday 
Buffett s Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa  Inc and Brazil s 3G Capital control Chicago based Kraft Heinz 
In addition to lower than expected earnings  the company disclosed it had been subpoenaed by the U S  Securities and Exchange Commission in October  related to an investigation into its accounting policies  procedures and internal controls related to procurement 
The company said it was working on ways to improve its internal controls and determined the problems required it to record a  25 million increase to the cost of products sold 
 That has really made a bad set of results even worse because it has also thrown some uncertainty into the mix   Saunders said 
For the quarter ended Dec  29  Kraft had a net loss of  12 6 billion  It earned 84 cents per share on an adjusted basis  missing Wall Street estimates of 94 cents  according to IBES data from Refinitiv

162990,384506,GIS,Day Ahead  Top 3 Things to Watch,news,"Investing com   Here s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow 
1  Fed Ahead
It s Fed day tomorrow and while the decision is almost certain  the press conference could bring some market moving information 
The Federal Open Market Committee will announce its decision on interest rates at 2 00 PM ET  18 00 GMT  
There is more than 90  chance that the Fed will keep rates steady 
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has said that the central bank can remain patient and recent economic data has supported his thesis 
The Atlanta Federal Reserve s NowCast of GDP growth has it just at an annual rate of 0 4  
 The statement after the meeting will have to balance weakness in the current quarter  disappointment over household spending and optimism about business investment   GrantThorton Chief Economist Diane Swonk wrote 
2  Watch the Dot Plot
The interest rate decision will likely play second fiddle to the Fed s economic projection  with many estimating that the dot plot   showing projections of where each Fed governor expects the interest rates to be at certain points in the future   will be revised downward 
The Fed s December dot plot signaled two rate hikes were in the pipeline for 2019  but with signs of a global slowdown  many economists expect the number of rate hikes will fall to only one this year 
 The FOMC decision and subsequent comments clearly establishes the Powell Put which means that Federal Reserve will not do anything intentionally to endanger the stock market and the domestic economy   said Doug Roberts at Channel Capital Research   This represents a continuation of the policy put in place by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and continued by his successors  Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen

162996,384512,GIS,More candidates  more money and a big bet  How Democrats won the House,news,"By Peter Eisler  Tim Reid and Letitia Stein WASHINGTON  Reuters     Expand the battlefield   The Democrats  mantra for seizing control of the U S  House of Representatives took shape within weeks of President Donald Trump s stunning 2016 White House victory  Democratic strategists wanted to go beyond the traditional strategy of flipping Republican seats in swing districts  Now  they would also compete in more conservative areas  forcing Republicans to burn resources defending seats they considered safe  It meant rolling the dice  gambling that a polarizing president would drive independent and moderate Republican voters away from his party s candidates  gambling that Democrats would remain energized by antipathy towards him  gambling that history and a political map that had Republicans on the defensive would work in their favor  In the fight for the House  Democrats were  starting the 2018 election cycle on offense   Dan Sena  executive director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee  wrote in a memo assessing the party s chances days after Trump s inauguration in January 2017  On Tuesday night  the Democrats  bets paid off with a projected win of at least 30 new seats  which would be seven more than the 23 needed to secure their first House majority since 2011   We owned the ground   Democratic House leader Nancy Pelosi said as the takeover became clear  She credited the win to the party s  dynamic  diverse and incredible candidates   Reuters reporters visited more than a dozen battleground House districts and interviewed candidates  campaign officials  strategists and voters to learn how Democrats laid the groundwork to capture the chamber  They also analyzed historical election trends and data from Reuters polling partner Ipsos  In his memo  Sena offered an initial list of 59 Republican held seats deemed flippable by the DCCC  the party organization that oversees House races  Democrats needed to take just over a third of them  an ambitious goal  but not unprecedented  Republicans would be defending dozens of districts where Trump either lost or won narrowly  To fight on a much larger battlefield  Democrats needed  candidates with diverse profiles that fit unique  Republican leaning districts   DCCC Chairman Ben Ray Luj n  a U S  House member from New Mexico  wrote in a June 2017 memo to staff   Look outside of the traditional mold to keep recruiting local leaders  veterans  business owners  women  job creators  and health professionals   By early this year  Democrats had broadened their target list to more than 100 battleground races where they felt they had competitive candidates  Top targets were the 41 open Republican seats  including dozens vacated by incumbents who retired rather than seek reelection in districts where Trump is not popular  Many of those districts were won by Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton or carried narrowly by Trump in 2016  Besides the open seats  Democrats focused on 21 Republican incumbents in districts that also were closely contested in 2016  Republican held districts with large minority populations were another priority  as were white  working class districts that backed Barack Obama for president before swinging to Trump in 2016  History suggested Democrats had a good shot for a  wave  election in the House   a power shifting win with a turnover of dozens of seats  Those reversals typically occur when the president s approval sits below 45 percent and the share of voters who believe the country is going in the right direction is below 40 percent  For much of this year  Trump s approval in Reuters Ipsos opinion polls has hovered around 40 percent  and  right direction  sentiment has been around 35 percent  Exit polls showed similar sentiment among voters on Tuesday  The Democrats invested  2 5 million early in the campaign cycle to expand fundraising databases and hire digital strategists to boost online donations  according to figures released by the party  By Election Day  the DCCC had raised at least  270 million   upwards of 20 percent more than its total in the 2015 16 election cycle  That allowed the party to make six figure investments in 85 districts  including many once seen as safely Republican  The committee also trained nearly 3 000 campaign workers and dispatched field organizers earlier than usual  including 20 in Republican held districts before Democrats even had candidates in them  It also forged new partnerships with outside organizations to help recruit candidates and energize key voting groups  Once Democrats had identified the districts they wanted to contest and the candidates they wanted to win them  party leaders sought to apply one of the big lessons of 2016   don t let Trump dominate the conversation  They urged candidates to focus on healthcare and economic security  issues that consistently registered high voter interest in polls   We urged our candidates to focus on the issues that are most important to voters   DCCC Press Secretary Tyler Law told Reuters   We just let Trump be Trump   A FLIP IN THE SUBURBS Until Tuesday  voters in New Jersey s 11th congressional district hadn t sent a Democrat to the U S  House of Representatives in nearly 40 years   but the seat was ripe for flipping  Perched at the western edge of the New York City suburbs  the district has the kind of wealthy  well educated  moderate Republicans who aren t especially keen on Trump  In 2016  its voters backed him for president by less than 1 percent  a fraction of the margin they usually give Republicans in White House races  And when 23 year Republican incumbent U S  Representative Rodney Frelinghuysen announced in January that he would not seek re election  the district slid into a coveted category for a Democratic Party eager to seize the U S  House majority  an open seat   The party nominated Mikie Sherrill  a centrist  first time candidate with a resume party officials saw as a perfect fit for the district  She was likely to attract college educated women  a group shown in opinion polls as especially unhappy with Trump  And her background   former Navy helicopter pilot  former federal prosecutor  coach of her children s sports teams   seemed sure to appeal to independent and moderate Republican voters  On election night  Sherrill romped to victory over state assemblyman Jay Webber  Sherrill  46  campaigned mostly on kitchen table issues  such as health care  economic security and improving transportation infrastructure  She positioned herself as someone who would  fight back against Donald Trump  but made little mention of him on her campaign website or social media accounts  Still  many who backed Sherrill had Trump on their minds  Rick Haan and Martin Smith are the sort of lifelong Republican voters who had kept the district in the party s hands since 1985   successful  well educated professionals who favor candidates in the small government  fiscally conservative mold of former President Ronald Reagan  Both are repelled by Trump s bombastic rhetoric and nationalist politics and want a Democratic Congress to stand in opposition   I won t vote for anyone who isn t against him   said Haan  a 64 year old business consultant   There s only one issue   said Martin  a retired lawyer   and that s getting back to a civil society   REVERSING THE TRUMP SURGE  Abby Finkenauer  daughter of a union worker and sister of a soybean farmer  was precisely the sort of candidate Democrats needed to flip Iowa s 1st congressional district  a mostly white  culturally conservative  working class swath of eastern Iowa  Finkenauer  29  ousted two term Republican Representative Rod Blum  a wealthy businessman she painted as out of touch with working class voters  In 2016  Trump won the district because typically Democratic union members liked his economic populism and promises of job creation  To win them back  Finkenauer stressed her union roots  one ad featured her talking about how her father  a retired welder pipefitter  would wring sweat from his belt after a day s work  In hundreds of appearances  many in union halls  Finkenauer promised to protect families  health care and oppose any efforts to cut Social Security and Medicare healthcare programs for senior citizens   I decided to do this because it is so dang personal   Finkenauer said  noting her family s working class roots at a gathering of union workers over burgers and hot dogs in Anamosa  population 5 500  Nearly 40 percent of the district s voters are independents  and it s dominated by farmers and union workers employed at the John Deere factories in Dubuque and Waterloo and the Quaker Oats and  General Mills   NYSE GIS  plants in Cedar Rapids  Like many Democrats who won Republican seats  Finkenauer outraised Blum  mostly with donations of  20 or less  She routinely criticized the Trump backed tax reform bill  which passed last year with Blum s support  as favoring the wealthy over workers  a sentiment many voters echoed in interviews  Blum s campaign did not respond to requests for comment  In a recent debate  he dismissed Finkenauer s tax cut criticism   Our economy is absolutely booming  if you haven t noticed  and it s due in large part to those tax cuts   But Finkenauer s message resonated with union voters such as Robbie Frommelt  28  a Cedar Rapids ironworker  He voted for Obama  then Trump  but has grown disillusioned with Republicans   I think the Democrats are more on the side of the workers   Frommelt said in an interview days before the election  noting that many of his co workers have told him they feel likewise   A lot of the guys are going to switch back   STICKING TO THE SCRIPT In South Florida s Latino dominated 26th congressional district  Democrat Debbie Mucarsel Powell  an immigrant from Ecuador  followed Democratic leaders  script of focusing mostly on  kitchen table  issues   and not Trump  Campaigning in a district where half of constituents were born outside the United States  Mucarsel Powell highlighted health care  pocketbook issues and the environment  a top concern in a district that stretches from the Florida Everglades to iconic Key West  While the university administrator consistently painted her Republican opponent Carlos Curbelo as a strong supporter of Trump  she didn t make Trump s controversial immigration policies the chief focus of her campaign  In a district that backed Clinton by 16 points in the 2016 presidential race  Curbelo had worked hard to separate himself from Trump s hardline stance on immigration  So Mucarsel Powell emphasized the issues where Curbelo was more closely aligned with the president  Time and again  she highlighted his vote to repeal the Obama health care law and his support for the Trump backed tax bill  which she characterized as a giveaway to the rich that would have little benefit for the district s working class voters   All you need to do is look at his voting record to see who he truly is   said Mucarsel Powell said of Curbelo   Time and time again  he caved into his party   she said   and some of the most extreme members of his party   On Tuesday voters gave Mucarsel Powell a narrow victory  Curbelo knew he faced a challenge

163017,384533,GIS,3 Top Dividend Stocks To Maximize Your Retirement Income   February 05  2020,opinion,"Believe it or not  seniors fear running out of cash more than they fear dying 
And older Americans have legitimate reasons for this worry  even if they have dutifully saved for their golden years  That s because the traditional ways people manage retirement may no longer provide enough income to meet expenses   and with people generally living longer  the principal retirement savings is exhausted far too early in the retirement period 
Your parents  retirement investing plan won t cut it today 
For example  10 year Treasury bonds in the late 1990s offered a yield of around 6 50   which translated to an income source you could count on  However  today s yield is much lower   currently under 2  and probably not a viable return option to fund typical retirements 
The effect of this drop in rates is substantial  over 20 years  the change in yield for a  1 million investment in 10 year Treasuries is over  1 million 
And lower bond yields aren t the only potential problem seniors are facing  Today s retirees aren t feeling as secure as they once did about Social Security  either  Benefit checks will still be coming for the foreseeable future  but based on current estimates  Social Security funds will run out of money in 2035 
How can you avoid dipping into your principal when the investments you counted on in retirement aren t producing income  You can only cut your expenses so far  and the only other option is to find a different investment vehicle to generate income 
Invest in Dividend Stocks
We feel that these dividend paying equities   as long as they are from high quality  low risk issuers   can give retirement investors a smart option to replace low yielding Treasury bonds  or other bonds  
For example  AT T  NYSE T  and Coca Cola  NYSE KO  are income stocks with attractive dividend yields of 3  or better  Look for stocks like this that have paid steady  increasing dividends for years  or decades   and have not cut their dividends even during recessions 
One approach to recognizing appropriate stocks is to look for companies with an average dividend yield of 3  and positive average annual dividend growth  Numerous stocks hike dividends over time  counterbalancing inflation risks 
Here are three dividend paying stocks retirees should consider for their nest egg portfolio 
General Mills  NYSE GIS  is currently shelling out a dividend of  0 49 per share  with a dividend yield of 3 73   This compares to the Food   Miscellaneous industry s yield of 0 26  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 78   In terms of dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  1 96 is flat compared to last year 
IBM  IBM  is paying out a dividend of 1 62 per share at the moment  with a dividend yield of 4 35  compared to the Computer   Integrated Systems industry s yield of 0  and the S P 500 s yield  Taking a look at the company s dividend growth  its current annualized dividend of  6 48 is up 3 18  from last year 
Currently paying a dividend of 0 11 per share  Investors Bancorp  ISBC  has a dividend yield of 3 55   This is compared to the Financial   Savings and Loan industry s yield of 2 43  and the S P 500 s current yield  Looking at dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  0 44 is flat compared to last year 
But aren t stocks generally more risky than bonds 
The fact is that stocks  as an asset class  carry more risk than bonds  To counterbalance this  invest in superior quality dividend stocks that not only can grow over time but more significantly  can also decrease your overall portfolio volatility with respect to the broader stock market 
Combating the impact of inflation is one advantage of owning these dividend paying stocks  Here s why  many of these stable  high quality companies increase their dividends over time  which translates to rising dividend income that offsets the effects of inflation 
Thinking about dividend focused mutual funds or ETFs  Watch out for fees 
You may be thinking   I like this dividend strategy  but instead of investing in individual stocks  I m going to find a dividend focused mutual fund or ETF   This approach can make sense  but be aware that some mutual funds and specialized ETFs carry high fees  which may reduce your dividend gains or income  and defeat the goal of this dividend investment approach  If you do wish to invest in a fund  do your research to find the best quality dividend funds with the lowest fees 
Bottom Line
Seeking steady  consistent income through dividends can be a smart option for financial security in retirement  whether you invest in mutual funds  ETFs  or in dividend paying stocks

163027,384543,GIS,3 Investing Facts About Required Minimum Distributions You Need To Know   January 23  2020,opinion,"Failing to withdraw a required minimum distribution  RMD  from your own or an inherited IRA by the deadline results in a big tax code penalty  50   That s right  If you were supposed to take out a minimum of  4 000 and  oops   did not do so  you have the privilege of writing the IRS a check for  2 000  It s important to remember that the rules related to RMDs changed on January 1  2020
Like many investors  you re likely aiming to build a comfortable nest egg to ensure a comfortable retirement  Among retirement financial planners  this is called the  accumulation phase   In this phase  your goal is to invest wisely by choosing stocks with long term potential for your retirement portfolio  such as General Mills  NYSE GIS   a current top ranked dividend stock 
There is also a second phase of retirement planning that gets less focus   despite the fact that it s the more interesting part  It s the  distribution phase   which essentially means spending the wealth you ve worked hard to amass 
Making plans for the distribution stage involves deciding where you ll live in retirement  whether you ll travel  your proposed leisure activities  and more decisions that will affect your spending during your golden years 
Along with those choices  you need to be mindful of the RMD  because it applies to the majority of retirement accounts  This IRS rule requires you to withdraw a specific minimum amount from any qualified accounts you have when you reach a certain age  previously it was 70 1 2  but beginning in 2020  it is 72 
What is the point of this mandatory withdrawal by the IRS  Not surprisingly  it s to be sure that the government gets their tax money  Without the RMD requirement  individuals could live off other income and never pay tax on retirement account gains  That cash could be left to family or friends as an inheritance and the IRS would not receive taxes from it 
The Most Important Things to Know About RMDs
Which types of retirement accounts have RMDs  Qualified retirement accounts like IRA accounts  401 k s  457 plans and other tax deferred retirement savings plans like a TSP  403 b   TSA  SEP  or SIMPLE IRA plan require withdrawals in retirement 
When does it become necessary to begin taking distributions  Your first distribution must be taken by April 1 of the year following the calendar year that you turn 72  for most accounts   Also  if you retire after that age  you must take your first RMD from your 401 k   profit sharing  403 b   or other defined contribution plan by April 1 of the year after the calendar year in which you retire 
For each year after your required starting date  you must take your RMD by December 31  Note that you don t need to take an RMD on a Roth IRA since you covered taxes before contributing  Other varieties of Roth accounts require RMDs  But  there are approaches to avoid them   for instance  you can roll your Roth 401 k  into your Roth IRA 
What will happen if I neglect to take my RMD  If you don t take an RMD  or don t take a large enough distribution  you are liable for a 50  tax on the amount that was not withdrawn in time 
How much cash do I need to withdraw  The RMD you are required to take is calculated by dividing your previous year s December 31st retirement account balance by a  distribution period  factor dependent on your age 
Here s an example to give you an idea of the math  Ann is 71 and will take her first RMD in the year following the year she turns 72  Her IRA balance toward the end of the preceding year was  100 000  Her  distribution period  factor is 27 4  Dividing  100 000 by 27 4 equals  3 649 63  This is the amount Ann is required to withdraw for her first RMD

163098,384614,GIS,Can General Mills  GIS  Stock Continue Its 2019 Run After Q2 Earnings ,opinion,"General Mills   NYSE GIS   is set to report its second quarter fiscal 2020 results before the market opens on Wednesday  December 18  The food giant s shares have climbed over 34  in 2019 to outpace the broader food market s 16  run 
General Mills stock currently hovers around 7  below its 52 week high of  56 40 per share  which it reached back in early September 
The company has made strides to better adapt its products to current consumer tastes and expanded its product portfolio 
First Quarter Yields Mixed Results 
General Mills saw moderate revenue growth despite its flat organic sales in fiscal 2019 thanks to its acquisition of the premium pet food maker  Blue Buffalo  General Mills also bought other big companies like organic food maker Annie s and the Brazilian food company Yoki Alimentos 
In the company s largest business division  its North American retail segment  Q1 sales were flat at nearly  2 4 billion  General Mills  pet segment revenue improved by 7  to  368 million on volume growth  higher price realization  and favorable product mix 
Plus  General Mills  profitability has been a bright spot for investors in recent quarters and Q1 was no different  The firm s Gross profit margin rose by nearly 2  last quarter  These gains resulted in a 11  bottom line gain  which was higher than management had predicted  even though sales came in below expectations 

International Struggles   Outlook
While General Mills saw some success in the first quarter  the company still saw weakness in its international units and its specialty retail section  General Mills CEO  Jeff Harmening  stated in a press release that  We got off to a slower start in our other segments  and we re taking actions to drive top line improvement for those segments     starting in the second quarter  
Management said the stumbles were caused by economic issues in Brazil and weak flour demand in convenience stores and supermarket bakeries  Its international growth is something that will likely be closely monitored by Wall Street in the upcoming report as investors gauge the firm s international runway 
Our Zacks consensus estimates call for sales to slip about 0 1  to  4 41 billion and for earnings to grow about 3 5  to  0 88 per share  The North American retail segment is projected to bring in  2 69 billion for a slight 0 4  gain 
Its international struggles are forecasted to continue in the second quarter as Europe and Australia sales are predicted to fall 4 2  to  434 7 million and Asia and Latin America sales are anticipated to decline 5 2  to  408 2 million 
Looking ahead to our fiscal 2020 figures  estimates predict a top line rally of 2 2  to  17 2 billion and a bottom line hike of 4 7  to  3 37 per share 
Bottom Line 
General Mills has put together a nice 2019 so far  boosted by its Blue Buffalo acquisition  The company has also been able to successfully expand its margins  which has compelled Wall Street to drive the stock higher 
General Mills currently trades at about 15 3X its forward earnings  which is below the industry average of 18 8X forward earnings  General Mills also pays out a quarterly dividend with a hefty 3 8  yield  which can help ease investors  risk of potentially continued decline on the international front

163103,384619,GIS,Should Value Investors Choose General Mills  GIS  Stock Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put General Mills  Inc    NYSE GIS   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  General Mills has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 15 42  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 19  If we focus on the long term PE trend  General Mills  current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 18 60 over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months  However  the current level stands significantly below the highs for the stock  suggesting that it can be a solid entry point  Moreover  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Consumer Staples Market sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 22 66  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that General Mills has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 15 61  so it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near future P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  General Mills has a P S ratio of about 1 91  This is much lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 49 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years  Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  General Mills currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes General Mills a solid choice for value investors For example  the PEG ratio for General Mills is just 2 23  a level that is lower than the industry average of 2 47  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Additionally  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 12 43  which is better than the industry average of 12 98  Clearly  GIS is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though General Mills might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of C and Momentum Score of D  This gives GIS a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current year has seen five upward revisions in the past sixty days compared to no downward revision  while the full year 2020 estimate has seen four upward revisions compared to no downward revisions in the same time period The current year consensus estimate increased 0 9  in the past two months  whereas the full year 2020 estimate rose 0 3   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below General Mills  Inc  Price and Consensus   Notably  the stock with a solid earnings surprise history and long term EPS growth rate of 7  has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   which is why we are looking for outperformance from the company in the near term Bottom LineGeneral Mills is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Furthermore  the Zacks Rank  2 company flaunts a robust industry rank  among the top 37    which indicates that the broader factors are favorable for the company So  value investors might want to delve deeper in this stock as it appears to be a compelling pick Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana Ignited by new referendums and legislation  this industry is expected to blast from an already robust  6 7 billion to  20 2 billion in 2021  Early investors stand to make a killing

163130,384646,GIS,General Mills  GIS  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"General Mills  NYSE GIS  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended November 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on December 18  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This maker of Cheerios cereal  Yoplait yogurt and other packaged foods is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 89 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  4 7  
Revenues are expected to be  4 41 billion  down 0 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for General Mills 
For General Mills  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 58  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that General Mills will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that General Mills would post earnings of  0 77 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 79  delivering a surprise of  2 60  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
General Mills appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-12-11,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/general-mills-gis-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200491920,200491920

research technician uses tweezers to transfer pollen from one canola plant to another  a small step toward creating a new breed of the vegetable oil producing crop  It s an early stage of a high stakes effort to control the biggest threat to Canada s C 27 billion canola industry   a crop disease called clubroot that presents unique challenges for Monsanto  along with rival seed developers DowDuPont and  Bayer AG   DE BAYGN   The firms are scrambling to create new clubroot resistant seeds  but all three firms say that the process takes most of a decade   and any solution may not last long because the clubroot pathogen quickly adapts  Worse  clubroot spores make themselves at home in the soil for up to 20 years  unlike most crop diseases that damage harvests for a single season  Another challenge is canola farmers themselves  who have rapidly spread clubroot by planting record canola crops for the last two years  The best way to avoid the disease is for farmers to give fields at least a two year break between canola sowings  But with canola consistently delivering much higher profits than wheat  many are unable to resist  Farmer Bill Craddock acknowledged he plants canola with only a one year break in Manitoba  where clubroot first appeared in 2013   We don t really want to back off   he said   There s just more money in canola   The crop   Canada s most profitable   provides big earnings for the seed firms  too  Canola accounts for one third of Monsanto s total annual Canadian revenue  said spokeswoman Trish Jordan  who declined to specify the amount    Companies are very mindful of it because the consequences are huge   said David Dzisiak  DowDuPont s North America commercial leader in grains and oils   If farmers can t grow their most profitable crop  we can t sell it   DuPont  NYSE DWDP  Pioneer Canada  a unit of DowDuPont  has the largest market share of Canadian clubroot resistant seeds  according to Monsanto  DowDuPont  which declined to confirm its market position  may add to its lead on the others as it broadly launches a new clubroot resistant seed this year after introducing it last year on a small scale  Monsanto hopes to have a new disease resistant canola seed on the market in two to four years  Bayer expects to have a variety in two to five years  But all firms face uncertainty because the clubroot pathogen adapts rapidly and not all pathotypes have been identified  said Marcus Weidler  vice president of seeds operations at Bayer Crop Science   Sooner or later  the pathogen will find a way around it   Weidler said    WILD  RUTABAGA CROSSBREEDS Yellow flowering canola  called rapeseed in other countries  is grown and exported in Canada more than anywhere else  Canola seeds are crushed by Cargill Inc  CARG UL   Archer

General Mills   NYSE GIS   Clubroot first hit Western Canada s canola in 2003 but dates back centuries in Europe  It has now been found on all agriculture producing continents  often in vegetable farms  but it has rarely affected crops as widely planted as canola in Canada  It remains a  seriously increasing problem  in Europe  especially in rapeseed intensive areas of northern Germany and Sweden  said Elke Diederichsen  a biologist at Free University Berlin  Developing clubroot resistant seeds takes many years because it requires painstaking crossbreeding with plant relatives such as rutabaga  cabbage or turnip  Resistant genes do not exist naturally within the canola plants   The first generations of a canola by rutabaga cross will look pretty wild   said Jed Christianson  trait

hundreds of canola plants  ranging from petri dishes of tiny floating embryos to tall stalks topped with yellow blossoms  Monsanto s early results in breeding canola and rutabaga produced misshapen or oversized leaves  and main roots that ranged in width from a finger to a fist  Promising candidates that graduate from Monsanto s earthy smelling  growth rooms  move on to years of field trials across the Canadian Prairies and seed production in Chile  The strategy allows Monsanto to take advantage of northern and southern hemispheres to grow plants year round and speed the process  Monsanto released its first clubroot resistant seed in 2009  but just three years later  the disease showed up in those fields  too   sending Monsanto and rival firms scrambling for new solutions   That s a very short period of time   Christianson said   It was a bit alarming   LIKE  CANCER  The long term damage to fields makes fighting clubroot all the more urgent  said Igor Falak  senior research scientist at DuPont Pioneer Canada   If you don t have resistance  you can t grow canola at all in some areas   Falak said in an interview  Each gram of dirt in an infected field can host 100 million clubroot spores  which spread by wind  water  farm machinery   even a farmer s boots   It s a lot like being told you have cancer   said Alberta farmer John Guelly   You feel helpless  and you re not sure what you can do   Clubroot infected Guelly s crops and forced him to plant less profitable wheat and barley for the next two years and adopt ongoing two year breaks in canola plantings  Farmers  seed companies and industry groups told Reuters the disease is spreading fast  but the data to quantify the damage is incomplete  In Alberta  the second biggest canola producing province  clubroot damage has been confirmed in 2 744 fields  or about 50 percent more than three years ago  according to University of Alberta   Most of those fields span about 160 acres  said Stephen Strelkov  an agriculture professor at the university  That much land would translate to about 439 000 acres that now have limited canola growing potential  representing 6 percent of Alberta s total canola cropland last year  But many more fields may go undetected  in part because clubroot carries a stigma  Some farmers hesitate to report its spread for fear that land values will fall or out of embarrassment  Guelly said  Many farmers also resist steps that might slow the spread of clubroot because it presents unusual economic dilemmas  In Saskatchewan  the biggest canola growing province  where clubroot first appeared in 2008  canola is expected to net farmers this year double or triple the return per acre of spring wheat  according to a provincial government forecast  In addition  farmers who gamble on back to back canola sowings   rather than letting fields recover   may still initially reap good harvests until clubroot spreads enough to substantially lower yields  Clubroot produces swellings on canola s roots  choking them of nutrients and stunting growth of the plant s valuable seeds  but the disease does not affect the quality of canola oil and meal  The seriousness of the disease has prompted some Alberta municipalities to ban canola plantings in certain infected fields for three years  The goal is to prevent farmers from making decisions that make economic sense in the short term but cause lasting damage to the industry at large   If we aren t putting in restrictions  they ll keep planting canola and putting everyone else at risk   said Aaron Van Beers  agriculture foreman for Leduc County south of Edmonton  Weidler  from Bayer  agreed the problem demands a broad strategy

163161,384677,GIS,Will General Mills  GIS  Beat Estimates Again In Its Next Earnings Report ,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  General Mills  NYSE GIS   which belongs to the Zacks Food   Miscellaneous industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
This maker of Cheerios cereal  Yoplait yogurt and other packaged foods has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 5 90  
For the most recent quarter  General Mills was expected to post earnings of  0 77 per share  but it reported  0 79 per share instead  representing a surprise of 2 60   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  0 76 per share  while it actually produced  0 83 per share  a surprise of 9 21  
Price and EPS Surprise

For General Mills  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
General Mills has an Earnings ESP of  1 58  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on December 18  2019 
With the Earnings ESP metric  it s important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power  however  a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-12-01,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-general-mills-gis-beat-estimates-again-in-its-next-earnings-report-200489298,200489298
163170,384686,GIS,Bakers  farmers struggle to make any dough on poor wheat crop,news,"By Rod Nickel and Julie Ingwersen WINNIPEG  Manitoba CHICAGO  Reuters    Chicago s iconic sandwiches   Italian beef heroes dripping with gravy  and hot dogs loaded with pickles and hot peppers   wouldn t be such culinary institutions without the bread  But this fall  bakers faced a crisis getting the right kind of bread to delis and sandwich shops locally and across the United States  Gonnella Baking Co   which supplies the buns to Major League Baseball s Wrigley Field   faced an unusual problem in October when flour from this year s U S  wheat harvest arrived at their factories containing low levels of protein   For a graphic on dwindling wheat crops in the United States  click   That meant bakers couldn t produce bread with the airy texture customers demand  setting off two weeks of tinkering with temperatures and the mixing process  and the eventual purchase of gluten as an additive  By the time the alchemy was done  Gonnella had thrown away more than  20 000 worth of substandard bread and buns  said president Ron Lucchesi   That really was a headache   Lucchesi said  The problem spans the  23 billion U S  bread market and highlights a paradox in the global wheat trade  Despite a worldwide grains glut  high protein hard wheat is scarce after two years of poor U S  harvests  The shortage hurts bakers and millers who prize high protein wheat  along with the farmers who grow it  Wholesale bakers such as Grupo Bimbo  Flowers Foods Inc and Campbell Soup Co s Pepperidge Farms are feeling the squeeze on margins  said Stephen Nicholson  senior grains and oilseeds analyst with Rabobank  All three companies have seen their stock prices fall over the last two years  a period when the benchmark S P 500 index gained more than 26 percent  Millers such as Archer Daniels Midland Co  Ardent Mills   General Mills  Inc  NYSE GIS  have been able to pass on much of their higher wheat costs in sales of flour to bakers  he added  But bakers have not been able to pass those costs to grocers  who have been unwilling to pay higher prices because of increased competition and price deflation  Global wheat inventories have risen to record high levels due in part to heavy production from Russia  Meanwhile  U S  per capita consumption of wheat flour in 2016 fell to its lowest level in nearly three decades  and U S  farmers planted their smallest winter wheat crop in more than a century   It s a low margin  pennies business  but now you ve got even more disruption   said Robb MacKie  CEO of the American Bakers Association  Ardent Mills   a joint venture of Cargill Inc  CHS Inc and ConAgra Foods  NYSE CAG    is finding enough high protein wheat but also incurring higher costs  said Buck VanNiejenhuis  Ardent s general manager in Canada  ADM faces a similar situation  said Aaron Brown  its manager for Canadian origination and exports  Campbell Soup declined to comment  but the company said in August that it expected costs to rise by two to three percent in 2018  Representatives for General Mills and Grupo Bimbo s U S  bakery division declined to comment  Flowers Foods did not respond to requests for comment  SHRINKING PROFITS  FEWER ACRES Two years of heavy spring rains in Kansas  the largest producer of hard winter wheat  have sapped the protein levels of a crop that thrives in arid conditions  Hard winter wheat makes up about 40 percent of the  10 billion U S  wheat crop  which peaked in value at  17 4 billion in 2012 amid higher prices and plantings  Total wheat plantings in Kansas fell this year to 7 6 million acres  That s down from 9 4 million acres in 2012 and represents the second smallest planting since the U S  Department of Agriculture started keeping records in 1919  Kansas farmers have seen their returns steadily diminish  with some incurring losses  Farmers received an average of  3 20 per bushel for the 2016 harvest  down from  6 07 two years before  Data for the 2017 harvest is not yet available   Further north  farmers have been selling high protein spring wheat for a premium due to tight supply  Protein premiums in Manitoba  the Canadian province  have reached their highest levels in at least five years  Farmer Dan Mazier  located near Justice  Manitoba  sold his high protein wheat for delivery next spring to squeeze out the highest price   If you have high protein wheat  you re in the driver s seat   he said  Last spring  as the rains poured down in Kansas  that state s Stafford County Flour Mills stockpiled as much high protein wheat as it could find in anticipation of a substandard wheat crop  The protein level of the latest wheat harvest was  the lowest I ve seen   said general manager Reuel Foote  He said the company bought 600 000 bushels of high protein wheat   more than a quarter of its total wheat purchases   at a premium of 75 cents to  1 a bushel  GLUTEN FEE  The additional gluten that some millers and bakers are using to compensate for the wheat s low protein content comes at a cost  Gonnella paid up to 20 percent more for gluten than usual because of the surge in demand  Lucchesi said  But bakers can t necessarily charge retail outlets more to make up those costs  Bread lacks the consumer loyalty of other food staples  such as meat and fruit  and sales would likely slide if grocers raised prices  said Sylvain Charlebois  professor of food distribution and policy at Dalhousie University in Halifax  Nova Scotia  Export markets are also affected  The limited amount of high protein wheat available has caused the market to ration demand  maintaining shipments to countries willing to pay a premium  such as Japan  and sending less than usual to price sensitive markets such as Mexico  said Rhyl Doyle  a wheat trader at Winnipeg based Paterson Grain  Some bakers are tapping a protein pipeline to farms  Warburton s  the largest bakery in the United Kingdom  buys flour from mills that is made from wheat grown to the bakery s specifications in a dedicated supply system   Others  though  are counting on a drier spring than the last two years  A third straight low protein crop would leave millers hard pressed to scrounge up enough supply to meet blending needs  said Foote  of Stafford County Flour Mills

GIS  Free Cash Flow Supports Dividend Payments
Since 2015  GIS has increased its annual dividend from  1 67 share to  1 96 share  or 4  compounded annually  This dividend payment has been supported by GIS  cumulative free cash flow  With the exception of 2018  when  General Mills   NYSE GIS  acquired Blue Buffalo Pet Products  the company consistently generates the free cash flow necessary to pay its dividend  per Figure 2  Excluding 2018  GIS generated  8 7 billion  29  of market cap  in FCF while paying  4 4 billion in dividends since 2015 Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filingsCompanies with strong free cash flow provide higher quality dividend yields because we know the firm has the cash to support its dividend  On the flip side  dividends from companies with low or negative free cash flow cannot be trusted as much because the company may not be able to sustain paying dividends 
GIS  Valuation Implies Permanent Profit DeclineAt its current price of  50 share  GIS has a price to economic book value  PEBV  ratio of 0 8  This ratio means the market expects GIS  NOPAT to permanently decline by 20   This expectation seems too pessimistic given that GIS has grown NOPAT by 4  compounded annually over the past decade and 7  compounded annually over the past two decades 
If GIS can maintain TTM NOPAT margins  14   and grow NOPAT by just 2  compounded annually for the next decade  the stock is worth  73 share today   a 46  upside  See the math behind this reverse DCF scenario

163229,384745,GIS,China s pork demand hits a peak  shocking producers  as diets get healthier,news,By Dominique Patton BEIJING  Reuters    China s frozen dumpling makers are finding there s a quick route to winning new sales   increase the vegetable content  and cut down on the meat  This departure from traditional pork rich dumplings is a hit with busy  young urbanites  trying to reduce the fat in diets often heavy on fast food   They like to try to eat more healthy products once a week or fortnight  It s a big trend for mainland China consumers  especially those aged 20 to 35   said Ellis Wang  Shanghai based marketing manager at U S  food giant  General Mills   N GIS   which owns top dumpling brand Wanchai Ferry  For pig farmers in China and abroad  it is a difficult trend to stomach  The producers and other market experts had expected the growth to continue until at least 2026  Chinese hog farmers are on a building spree  constructing huge modern farms to capture a bigger share of the world s biggest pork market  while leading producers overseas have been changing the way they raise their pigs to meet Chinese standards for imports  Some have  for example  stopped using growth hormones banned in China  China still consumes a lot more meat than any other country  People here will eat about 74 million tonnes of pork  beef and poultry this year  around twice as much as the United States  according to U S  agriculture department estimates  More than half of that is pork and for foreign producers it has been a big growth market  especially for Western style packaged meats  But pork demand has hit a ceiling  well ahead of most official forecasts  Sales of pork have now fallen for the past three years  according to data from research firm Euromonitor  Last year they hit three year lows of 40 85 million tonnes from 42 49 million tonnes in 2014  and Euromonitor predicts they will also fall slightly in 2017  Chinese hog prices are down around 25 percent since January  even though official numbers suggest supply is lower compared with last year  China s meat and seafood sales IMG   RARE LUXURY Since China began opening up to the world in the late 1970s  pork demand expanded by an average 5 7 percent every year  until 2014 as the booming economy allowed hundreds of millions of people to afford to eat meat more often  During Mao Zedong s reign as Chinese leader from 1949 76 meat had  for many  been a rare luxury  Now  growing concerns about obesity and heart health shape shopping habits too  fuelling sales of everything from avocados to fruit juices and sportswear         Market demand remains very weak  I think one factor behind this is people believe less meat is healthier  This is a new trend   said Pan Chenjun  executive director of food and agriculture research at Rabobank in Hong Kong  Sales of vegetable only dumplings grew 30 percent last year  compared with around 7 percent for all frozen dumplings  Nielsen research also shows   Demand for vegetable products keeps rising  giving us large room for growth   said Zhou Wei  product manager at number two dumpling producer Synear Food  Guangzhou based Harmony Catering says health is the key to reduced servings of meat to the roughly 1 million workers eating at its 300 canteens each day  Staff at the technology companies  banks and oil majors that are Harmony s clients will consume about 10 percent less meat today than they did five years ago  but around 10 percent more green vegetables  according to Harmony vice president Li Huang   It s mainly because of media  the concept of health has entered popular consciousness   he said  For now  it s mostly urban and white collar workers paying closer attention to their diets  There s been  for example  a sharp rise in vegetarian food stations at university campuses  But the government wants a nationwide shift in eating habits  Childhood obesity in China is rocketing  and the country also faces an epidemic of heart disease  Harvard researchers warned last year  Among the problems  they blamed growing consumption of red meat and high salt intake  In April  the health ministry kicked off its second 10 year healthy lifestyle campaign  urging citizens to consume less fat  salt and sugar  and aim for a  healthy diet  healthy weight and healthy bones   By 2030  Beijing wants to see a marked increase in nutritional awareness  a 20 percent cut in the per capita consumption of salt  and slower growth in the rate of obesity  it said in its recently published  Healthy China 2030  pamphlet  Meat consumption by type and country   Some companies have been urgently changing the mix of products they sell  going for higher margin pork meats rather than volume  Sales of traditionally less popular lamb and beef have also been increasing  Li of Harmony Catering says although servings of pork are down  the firm is including more beef and lamb in meals   People usually eat lean beef or lamb  like beef brisket  while with pork it s both fatty and lean parts  like in  hong shao rou    said Beijing based nutritionist Chen Zhikun  referring to the widely consumed braised pork dish  China s top pork producer WH Group has been going up market  selling Western style products in China  such as sausages and ham  A lot of this is imported from Smithfield  the largest U S  pork producer  which was acquired by WH in 2013  Some producers say that the recent drop in pork consumption can be partly explained by sharply lower output  A prolonged period of losses during 2013 to 2015 forced farmers to cull millions of hogs  hitting supply and sending pork prices to record levels in 2016  But for a growing portion of Chinese consumers  price tags on food items are less and less important  A spate of safety scandals in recent years  many related to meat  have made urban Chinese highly sensitive to food quality  More than 80 percent of people in China surveyed by Nielsen last year said they were willing to pay more for foods without undesirable ingredients  much higher than the global average of 68 percent   China is in a new stage where consumption of pork and other foods is no longer a simple matter of  more is better    said Fred Gale  senior economist at the United States agriculture department

163230,384746,GIS,General Mills  GIS  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"The market expects General Mills  NYSE GIS  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended August 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on September 18  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This maker of Cheerios cereal  Yoplait yogurt and other packaged foods is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 77 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  8 5  
Revenues are expected to be  4 09 billion  down 0 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 22  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for General Mills 
For General Mills  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 43  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that General Mills will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that General Mills would post earnings of  0 76 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 83  delivering a surprise of  9 21  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
General Mills appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-09-10,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/general-mills-gis-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200463642,200463642

163251,384767,GIS,Wells Fargo board pays price for letting whistleblowers whistle in the wind,news,"By Dan Freed NEW YORK  Reuters     Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC    Co directors could have avoided a shareholder backlash over a sales practices scandal if they had paid more attention to scores of whistleblowers who complained  in vain  for years  A slow response to warnings is not unique to Wells Fargo  but it is an immediate concern at the third largest U S  bank  whose board is facing a no confidence vote at its annual shareholder meeting on Tuesday  Wells Fargo has been engulfed in scandal since September  when it reached a  190 million settlement with regulators over complaints that its retail banking staff had opened as many as 2 1 million unauthorized client accounts  The bank fired 5 300 employees for improper sales tactics over five years  but did not make more substantive changes to policies and procedures or hold managers accountable until there was a public outcry  An third party investigation commissioned by the board found such practices were not flagged as  a noteworthy risk  until 2014  even thought lawsuits and complaints suggested the problem existed at least as far back as 2010  George Sard  a spokesman for Wells Fargo s board  declined to comment  The bank s spokeswoman Richele Messick said Wells Fargo takes the issue  very seriously  and detailed multiple steps the bank has taken to improve procedures since the scandal erupted  including reviews of its ethics hot line and new standards and training for employees   It s critical that all team members feel safe escalating concerns  and have confidence those concerns will be addressed   Messick said  Influential proxy advisor Institutional Shareholder Services recommended shareholders vote against 12 of its 15 directors  including Chairman Stephen Sanger  arguing directors failed in their oversight duties for years leading up to the settlement  The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday that several directors were at risk of losing re election based on a tally of those who have already cast ballots  Sanger  who led the internal investigation after being installed as independent chairman in October  had faced controversy involving whistleblowers before  In 2004  an employee sued  General Mills  Inc  NYSE GIS   the company Sanger ran from 1995 to 2007  for allegedly retaliating against him after he raised concerns that the company was shipping more products to retailers than they wanted to artificially boost sales figures  General Mills and the employee ultimately agreed to settle out of court and the U S  Securities and Exchange Commission dropped a probe it had launched without bringing a case  Sanger did not return a request for comment and Sard declined to comment on his behalf  The whistleblower could not be reached  Nancy Bush  an analyst with NAB Research who owns Wells Fargo shares  said she was unaware of the General Mills episode  but thought it should not affect Tuesday s vote  Instead  shareholders should focus on Sanger s track record at Wells Fargo  she said  echoing a sentiment shared by other analysts and investors reached by Reuters   In the years since the financial crisis     a corporation s obligation to listen to whistleblowers has changed   very much so   Bush said   I don t think the experience of 2004 is necessarily applicable to today s environment   HOTLINES AND SURVEYS Attorneys and consultants who work with whistleblowers and their employers say management teams must show they take internal complaints seriously  even if their first instinct is to dismiss them as unimportant or flawed  Among the steps they recommend  allowing employees to report problems anonymously  and following up on reports without trying to identify whistleblowers   Having third parties run whistleblower hotlines  analyze corporate culture and compensation practices  and survey the satisfaction of employees also helps to avoid getting blindsided  A spate of recent high profile whistleblower cases shows many companies still have work to do  Blood testing company Theranos downplayed concerns of a whistleblower until The Wall Street Journal reported last year that its tests were flawed  Regulators have since barred it from the blood testing business for two years  Fox News recently ousted its CEO and top television host Bill O Reilly  and has paid millions of dollars in settlements  after years of employees  sexual harassment complaints  Volkswagen  DE VOWG p  ended up paying more than  20 billion in fines and reparations over rigged emissions tests  something it could have avoided if it had listened to a whistleblower in 2011  And in the financial industry   Barclays   LON BARC  PLC Chief Executive Jes Staley is now being investigated by two UK regulators for inappropriately using a security team to track down a whistleblower

163300,384816,GIS,Buy These 5 Stocks As Yield Curve Inversion Deepens,opinion,A key yield curve has inverted to its worst level since 2007  sending out a warning signal for the global economy  Lingering trade tensions have unnerved investors  pushing them toward government bonds and dragging the benchmark yield down Given the rising concerns about the health of the economy  investors should find refuge in slowdown proof stocks that have a steady stream of customers  irrespective of market conditions U S  Treasury Yield Curve InvertsThe benchmark 10 year Treasury yield is now at its lowest level against the 2 year Treasury note since 2007  Currently  the yield on the benchmark 10 year Treasury note is at 1 476   5 basis points lower than the 2 year note s rate of 1 526  With the 10 year rate below the 2 year note  fixed income traders are expecting a slowdown in the near term  Lest we forget  the 2 year yield has always surpassed the 10 year note in every slowdown over the past 50 years  What s more  the spread between the 10 year note and the 3 month Treasury bills has contracted to  52  basis points  the worst since March 2007 So  what led to the inverted yield curve  Thanks to the ever changing China trade narrative  the stock market continues to gyrate  compelling investors to pull money out of equities and opt for safe haven government bonds  eventually leading to decline in the 10 year Treasury yield  After all  bond yields tend to move opposite to prices U S  China trade war is showing no signs of cooling down  The trade tussle got intensified after President Trump urged American firms to start looking for an  alternative to China   Trouble began after China announced plans of imposing tariffs of 5  and 10  on nearly  75 billion of U S  products Beijing clarified that the move was due to the Trump administration s intention to impose 10  tariffs on  300 billion of Chinese imports  Trump  in the meantime  reacted to China s decision by saying that the United States will increase tariffs on  250 billion of Chinese goods to 30  from an earlier 25   And tariffs on additional  300 billion imports from China would go up to 15  from 10  Some may argue that Trump has now said that China wants to return to the negotiating table  He  in fact  claimed receiving two  very good calls  from Beijing  However  the Chinese have downplayed the significance of such calls Don t Shun EquitiesContrary to popular belief  there are stocks that do well during economic slowdowns  Prominent among them are defensive stocks  These stocks are generally non cyclical  or companies whose business performance and sales are not highly correlated with activities in the larger market  Their products are in constant demand  irrespective of market volatility  and such names include companies from the utilities and consumer staples sectors Utilities are deemed defensive stocks as electricity  gas and water are essentials  Food companies are true defensive plays as demand for such staple stocks remains unaltered despite market gyrations The idea of investing in  vice  stocks can also be considered  After all  products or services in this space are relatively inelastic  and business is slowdown proof  The very nature of their business ensures a stable stream of consumers  irrespective of market conditions  which eventually leads to higher margins and solid profits Noteworthy vice stocks include beer and gaming companies  Lest we forget  booze consumption is increasing at a slow but steady pace this year  according to data researcher

163320,384836,GIS,General Mills  GIS  Hits 52 Week High  Can The Run Continue ,opinion,"Shares of General Mills  NYSE GIS  have been strong performers lately  with the stock up 3 3  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  55 29 in the previous session  General Mills has gained 41 3  since the start of the year compared to the 17 6  move for the Zacks Consumer Staples sector and the 14 4  return for the Zacks Food   Miscellaneous industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on June 26  2019  General Mills reported EPS of  0 83 versus consensus estimate of  0 76 while it missed the consensus revenue estimate by 1 56  
For the current fiscal year  General Mills is expected to post earnings of  3 37 per share on  17 44 billion in revenues  This represents a 4 66  change in EPS on a 3 42  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  3 51 per share on  17 35 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 4 06  and  0 52   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
General Mills may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
General Mills has a Value Score of C  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are B and D  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of B 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 16 3X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 12 9X versus its peer group s average of 12 9X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 2 33  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to consider the stock s Zacks Rank  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  General Mills currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if General Mills fits the bill  Thus  it seems as though General Mills shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term 
How Does General Mills Stack Up to the Competition 
Shares of General Mills have been moving higher  and the company still appears to be a decent choice  but what about the rest of the industry  Some of its industry peers are also impressive  including Danone  DANOY   MGP Ingredients  MGPI   and MEDIFAST INC  MED   all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least  2 and a VGM Score of at least B  making them well rounded choices 
However  it is worth noting that the Zacks Industry Rank for this group is in the bottom half of the ranking  so it isn t all good news for General Mills  Still  the fundamentals for General Mills are promising  and it still has potential despite being at a 52 week high ",2019-08-18,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/general-mills-gis-hits-52week-high-can-the-run-continue-200456321,200456321

163371,384887,GIS,General Mills announces recall of frozen green beans amid listeria scare,news,"Investing com     General Mills   NYSE GIS  announced on Friday that it is recalling 60 000 bags of its Cascadian Farm frozen green beans after a single package tested positive for the presence of listeria  marking the second time the company has had to recall the brand in the last three months 
The recall pertains to frozen 16 ounce bags of Cascadian Farm green beans with the label  better if used by  June  2017  The contaminated package in question was produced in June  In August  General Mills recalled 60 000 bags of 10 ounce Cascadian Farms frozen green beans produced in March 
Eating food contaminated with listeria can lead to listeriosis  a rare  serious illness marked by fever and muscle aches  according to the U S  Food and Drug Administration  Listeriosis can also be preceded by diarrhea and other gastrointestinal symptoms  the FDA said  The symptoms can appear anywhere from a few days to a few weeks after consumption of the contaminated foods 
Earlier this year  the FDA along with the U S  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention investigated a listeriosis outbreak linked to pre packaged caramel apples produced by companies in several states in the Midwest  as well as California  The CDC found 34 cases that required hospitalization from the contamination  including 11 that were pregnancy related  The investigation covered a four month period from October  2014 until early January  2015 
In addition  the CDC linked a multi state outbreak of listeriosis to the presence of listeria at several Blue Bell ice cream factories this spring  The case led to hospitalization of 10 people in four states in the Midwest and South  In May  Blue Bell was forced to eliminate more than 1 400 jobs after voluntarily suspending its operations due to the outbreak  Blue Bell resumed selling ice cream on a limited basis in late August after several of its factories completed an extensive decontamination process 
General Mills acquired Small Planet Foods  the owner of Cascadian Farm in December  1999  At the time  the organic foods company earned annual sales of  60 million  which amounted to only a sliver of the  1 8 billion in quarterly revenues earned by the food industry giant

take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers  General Mills Q4 Earnings Beat Estimates  Sales MissGeneral Mills released fourth quarter fiscal 2019 results  recording its fifth straight earnings beat while the top line missed estimates  The top and the bottom lines improved on a year on year basis  The quarterly results gained from the acquisition of Blue Buffalo Nevertheless  sluggishness across segments such as the North America Retail and the Europe   Australia hampered results  Also  margins were weak due to higher input costs and other expenses Highlights of the ReleaseThe company s adjusted earnings per share of 83 cents increased 6  year over year on a constant currency  cc  basis  The bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 76 cents  The year over year increase was fueled by reduced adjusted effective tax rate and higher adjusted operating profit  These were somewhat offset by escalated interest costs and average shares outstanding Net sales of  4 161 7 million improved 7  year over year  mainly backed by gains from Blue Buffalo  At cc  the top line rose 9  from the prior year quarter s figure  However  the top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  4 227 million Organic sales inched down 1  due to lower contributions from organic volume  Moreover  organic net sales declined in the North America Retail and the Europe   Australia segmentsAdjusted gross profit amounted to  1 470 5 million  up nearly 5   However  adjusted gross margin declined 50 basis points  bps  to 35 3  due

to witness challenges in U S  Snacks and Canada  Organic net sales declined 2 Convenience Stores   Foodservice  Revenues edged up 1 6  year over year to  519 million  Growth in Focus 6 platforms drove performance of the unit  The upside was partly countered by sluggishness in bakery flour  Organically  sales rose 2  from the year ago quarter s levels Europe   Australia  The segment s revenues declined 10 2  to  499 5 million due to unfavorable year on year comparison  Further  sales declined 3  year over year on an organic basis  Lower sales stemmed from a tough operating environment in France and weak trends in ice cream  However  the decline was somewhat offset by double digit growth in snack bars Asia   Latin America  Revenues declined almost 9 1  from the year ago quarter s levels to  395 9 million due to unfavorable currency movements  headwinds from the sale of La Saltena in Argentina and the divestiture of yoghurt business in China  Nevertheless  sales rose 1  on an organic basis Pet Segment  Revenues came in at  405 6 million  Sales in the segment rose 38  year over year on a pro forma basis  thanks to growth in Food  Drug and Mass  FDM  channels as well as the

reported cigar shipment volume rose 2 6  Adjusted OCI in the segment improved 11  to  2 427 million  owing to better pricing and reduced costs  which includes lower tobacco and health litigation

Products  Net revenues in the segment improved 4  from the year ago quarter s figure to  602 million  driven by higher pricing and reduced promotional investments  These were partially countered by

163434,384950,GIS,Should Value Investors Consider General Mills  GIS  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put General Mills  Inc    NYSE GIS   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  General Mills has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 16 88  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 18 55  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts General Mills  current PE ratio somewhat below its midpoint  which is 18 80  over the past five years Further  the stock s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Consumer Staples sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 22 48  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that General Mills has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 16 15  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for General Mills  stock in the near term too   P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  General Mills has a P S ratio of about 1 96  This is significantly lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 35 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is somewhat below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms    Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  General Mills currently has a Value Style Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes GIS a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for General Mills is just 2 31  a level that is slightly lower than the industry average of 2 39  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Clearly  GIS is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though General Mills might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of B and a Momentum score of F  This gives GIS a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen four estimates go lower in the past sixty days compared to none higher  while the full year estimate has seen six upward and one downward revision in the same time period This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen 3 8  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched up 0 9   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below General Mills  Inc  Price and Consensus    Despite this somewhat mixed trend  the stock has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  on the back of its strong value metrics and this is why we are expecting above average performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineGeneral Mills is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Its strong Zacks Rank also indicates robust growth potential in the near future  However  the company s prospects might be constrained due to adverse broader factors  as it has a sluggish industry rank  bottom 43  out of more than 250 industries   In fact  over the past one year  the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates  analyst sentiment and broader factors to turn favorable in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Breakout Biotech Stocks with Triple Digit Profit Potential The biotech sector is projected to surge beyond  775 billion by 2024 as scientists develop treatments for thousands of diseases  They re also finding ways to edit the human genome to literally erase our vulnerability to these diseases Zacks has just released Century of Biology  7 Biotech Stocks to Buy Right Now to help investors profit from 7 stocks poised for outperformance  Our recent biotech recommendations have produced gains of  98    119 and  164 in as little as 1 month  The stocks in this report could perform even better ,2019-07-04,Zacks Investment

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 9 21   A quarter ago  it was expected that this maker of Cheerios cereal  Yoplait yogurt and other packaged foods would post earnings of  0 69 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 83  delivering a surprise of 20 29  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
General Mills  which belongs to the Zacks Food   Miscellaneous industry  posted revenues of  4 16 billion for the quarter ended May 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1 56   This compares to year ago revenues of  3 89 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
General Mills shares have added about 37 9  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 16 4  
What s Next for General Mills 
While General Mills has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for General Mills was favorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

 NEW YORK  Sept 23  Reuters    U S  stocks edged lower on
Wednesday  pressured by falling crude oil prices  as investors
awaited a policy statement from the Federal Reserve 
 Trading was subdued ahead of the Fed s announcement  with
investors focused on whether the central bank will signal any
changes to its plan for asset purchases or monetary policy 
 October crude oil futures shed 4 percent to  68 85 per
barrel after data from the Energy Information Administration
showed oil stockpiles unexpectedly rose last week 
  The inventory level is bearish and that s pushing stocks
to the downside   said Dan Faretta  senior market strategist at
Lind Waldock in Chicago 
  Demand for oil has been weak  and the markets are
consolidating  If oil prices break  that could continue to pull
markets lower  
 The Fed is expected to keep interest rates unchanged  so
investors will look to the committee s statement and whether
the language used suggests a shift in its efforts to revive the
economy by flooding the markets with cheap money  The Fed s
statement is expected around 2 15 p m   1815 GMT 
  It won t be a surprising statement   Faretta said   It
might say that the economy is improving and that inflation is
in check  If  Fed Chairman Ben  Bernanke says that about
inflation  you may see the market rally this afternoon  If he
doesn t  we ll see a muted trade  
 The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 19 72 points  or
0 21 percent  to 9 808 79  The Standard   Poor s 500 Index fell
3 08 points  or 0 29 percent  to 1 068 58  The Nasdaq Composite
Index fell 2 35 points  or 0 11 percent  to 2 143 92

 Ford Motor Co rose 5 7 percent to  7 41 after the company s
chief executive said the U S  market was showing signs of

a small car in India early next year

 NEW YORK  Sept 23  Reuters    U S  stocks were little
changed on Wednesday before a statement from the Federal
Reserve on interest rate policy later on Wednesday 
 Trading was subdued  with investors focused on whether the
central bank will signal any changes to its plan for asset
purchases or monetary policy  which includes record low
interest rates 
 The Fed is  going to give the market exactly what it
expects  which is a clear indicator that they ll remain easy 
That s not going to do much to move the markets to the upside  
said Chip Hanlon  president of Delta Global Advisors in
Huntington Beach  California 
 The Fed s statement is expected around 2 15 p m   1815

 At the end of a two day meeting  the Federal Open Market
Committee is likely to hold overnight lending rates at close to
zero  Investors will look to the committee s statement for any
hints that suggest a shift in efforts to revive the economy by
flooding the markets with cheap money 
 Stocks recovered from earlier lows  which followed a sharp
drop in crude oil on U S  government data showing fuel

percent  to 9 838 41  The Standard   Poor s 500 Index rose 0 47
point  or 0 04 percent  to 1 072 13  The Nasdaq Composite Index
 rose 2 68 points  or 0 12 percent  to 2 148 97 
 The Nasdaq was boosted by strength in semiconductors after
Xilinx raised its second quarter revenue outlook  citing
 broad based strength across nearly all end markets  
 The stock climbed 5 2 percent to  23 89 while a
semiconductor index  rose 1 3 percent 
 Also providing a lift was General Mills Inc  which climbed
4 8 percent to  63 96 after it reported quarterly earnings that
beat expectations and raised its outlook 
 Ford Motor Co rose 5 9 percent to  7 42 after the
automaker s chief executive said the U S  market was showing
signs of recovery  The company also said it would start
production of a small car in India early next year 
 Real estate investment trusts were down as BMO Capital
Markets downgraded the sector  sending the Dow Jones U S 
Residential REITs Index 1 8 percent lower 
 The group was also pressured after Colony Financial Inc and
Apollo Commercial Real Estate Finance Inc lowered the number of
shares they expect to sell in initial public offerings 
 Airline stocks fell after AMR Corp  parent of American
Airlines  and US Airways Group Inc launched share sales to
raise money for general corporate purposes 
 AMR dropped 5 1 percent to  8 01 while US Airways dropped
11 percent to  4 67  The AMEX airline index dropped 2 9
percent

163475,384991,GIS,General Mills  GIS  Expected To Beat Earnings Estimates  What To Know Ahead Of Q4 Release,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when General Mills  NYSE GIS  reports results for the quarter ended May 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on June 26  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This maker of Cheerios cereal  Yoplait yogurt and other packaged foods is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 76 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  3 8  
Revenues are expected to be  4 23 billion  up 8 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for General Mills 
For General Mills  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 18  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination indicates that General Mills will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that General Mills would post earnings of  0 69 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 83  delivering a surprise of  20 29  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
General Mills appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-06-18,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/general-mills-gis-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates-what-to-know-ahead-of-q4-release-200432872,200432872
163476,384992,GIS,S P Closes At New Record High,opinion,"The S P finally returned to record territory on Thursday as the market had a delayed reaction to yesterday s dovish Fed statement 
	The last time the index was at an all time high was on the final day of April  right before things took a turn for the worse in the following month 
	But today the S P jumped by 0 95  to a history making close of 2954 18 
	The other major indices came along for the ride as we enjoyed a broad based rally on Thursday  The Dow jumped 0 94   or nearly 250 points  to 26 753 17 and is within 1  of its own high  while the NASDAQ advanced 0 80  to 8051 34 
	Stocks jumped higher right at the open  but it looked like we might lose it all as they came tumbling down at mid day  Investors apparently got nervous that we were running higher too quickly after three straight days of gains 
	And it certainly didn t help that Iran shot down a U S  drone  which promises to further irritate an already acrimonious relationship between the two countries 
	But stocks got over all of that to complete a fourth straight day in the green 
	The market is all excited about a rate cut in July  and maybe even another one before the year is out  The Fed kept rates unchanged in this month s meeting  but investors believe that the language in the statement and from the Fed Chair are setting up a cut moving forward 
	So now the market heads into Friday s session with a great chance of extending its winning streak to three weeks and keeping this June rally going

looked ahead to a private sector employment report expected to
show an easing of job losses ahead of the government s June

commodity prices regained ground  potentially benefiting shares
of natural resource companies

 By Ellis Mnyandu
 NEW YORK  July 1  Reuters    U S  stocks rose on
Wednesday  the first day of the third quarter  as investors
took reassuring manufacturing data from China  Europe and the
United States as signaling the world s economy is on the road
to recovery 
 A day after the S P 500 wrapped up its best quarter in a
decade  investors plowed new money into stocks  boosting
growth sensitive sectors like energy  industrials  technology 
materials and consumer discretionaries 
 A weaker U S  dollar prompted investors to buy the stocks
of some multinational companies such as Coca Cola   up
2 8 percent at  49 31  as investors bet the U S currency s
decline might boost overseas earnings 
  We think the economy has bottomed out and we ll see some
positive GDP this quarter   said Maury Fertig  chief
investment officer of Relative Value Partners in Northbrook 
Illinois 
  The one thing that really give us a lot of comfort is a
tremendous improvement in the credit markets  
 Even so  volume was light because of the absence of most
market players in a holiday shortened week  U S  financial
markets will be closed on Friday for the U S  Independence Day

 Heading toward the close  some apprehension about
Thursday s release of June non farm payrolls data crept into
the market  causing indexes to pare some gains 
 General Mills Inc  the maker of Cheerios cereal  also gave
investors more reason to be optimistic about the economy after
the food company forecast a stronger than expected annual
profit  sending its stock up 4 3 percent to  58 43 
 Kraft Foods Inc  another major U S  food company  jumped
5 3 percent to  26 68 
 In the latest readings on the global economy  surveys from
Europe showed manufacturing was shrinking less than initially
thought and in China s case  growing modestly 
 Other data on Wednesday showed the U S  manufacturing
sector contracted in June but at a slower pace than in May 
The Institute for Supply Management said its index of national
factory activity edged up to 44 8 to in June from 42 8 in
May 
 Additionally  global outplacement consultancy Challenger 
Gray   Christmas data showed planned layoffs at U S  firms
fell to a 15 month low in June 
 That news  coming a day before the release of the
government s June non farm payrolls report  eclipsed the ADP
Employer Services payroll survey showing that private
employers cut 473 000 jobs in June 
 The forecast for U S  job losses in June was increased to
363 000 on Wednesday  a steeper estimate than the 355 000
originally forecast 
 Prospects for a better world economy lifted commodity
prices  boosting stocks in natural resource companies 
including miners  with Newmont Mining Corp  up almost
3 5 percent at  42 31 
 Shares of Chevron Corp rose 0 5 percent to  66 56  while
Exxon Mobil added 1 1 percent to  70 71  Both stocks were off
their best levels  however  after crude oil futures reversed
an initial climb that sent them above  71 a barrel earlier on
Wednesday 
 U S  front month crude slipped 58 cents to settle at
 69 31 a barrel  after rising as high as  71 85 earlier

163559,385075,GIS,Why General Mills  GIS  Is Poised To Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  General Mills  NYSE GIS   which belongs to the Zacks Food   Miscellaneous industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
This maker of Cheerios cereal  Yoplait yogurt and other packaged foods has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 12 61  
For the most recent quarter  General Mills was expected to post earnings of  0 69 per share  but it reported  0 83 per share instead  representing a surprise of 20 29   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  0 81 per share  while it actually produced  0 85 per share  a surprise of 4 94  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for General Mills lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
General Mills currently has an Earnings ESP of  1 18   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  2  Buy  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-06-02,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-general-mills-gis-is-poised-to-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200427872,200427872
163560,385076,GIS,High Costs Weigh On Miscellaneous Food Industry Prospects,opinion,The Zacks  industry comprises companies that manufacture and sell a wide range of food and packaged food items such as cereals  natural and organic products  bakery items  spices and condiments and frozen items among other things  A few companies also provide comfort food items such as chocolates and ready to serve meals  soups and snacks  The companies operating in this space sell their products mostly through wholesalers  distributors  large retail organizations and grocery chains Let s take a look at the industry s three major themes      Rising input costs is a concern for a number of players in the food industry  The companies in the space have been challenged by steep pricing for supplies like grains  edible oils  vegetables  dairy items as well as animal feed  to name a few  Moreover  higher costs of logistics  stemming from tight trucking capacity along with increased warehouse and packaging expenses increase the cost burden      Food companies are increasingly relying on savings programs to broaden profitability  Savings are being achieved through efforts such as streamlining of operational structures  optimizing manufacturing capacity and supply networks  Moreover  companies are indulging in efficient pricing to a strike balance between volumes and profits      Players in the food space are required to frequently upgrade or widen their offerings so as to keep pace with consumers  changing tastes and preferences  Companies often engage in portfolio refinement through strategic buyouts and divestitures of non core elements  In fact  a number of miscellaneous food companies are enriching their portfolio by adding more natural and organic foods to meet consumers  growing inclination for healthy offerings  In order to promote newly added products  companies are adopting efficient promotional practices  Moreover  companies are widening market reach through e commerce channels Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Gloomy ProspectsThe Zacks Food Miscellaneous industry is housed within the broader Zacks  sector  The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank  151  which places it in the bottom 41  of more than 250 Zacks industries The group s   which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks  indicates bleak near term prospects  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 The industry s positioning in the bottom 50  of the Zacks ranked industries is a result of negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate  Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions  it appears that analysts are losing confidence in this group s earnings growth potential  Over the past year  the industry s earnings estimate for 2019 has declined nearly 10 6  Despite the dull scenario of the industry  we will present a few stocks

163586,385102,GIS,Beyond Meat  BYND  Soars As Mock Meat Bulls Rule,opinion,"Beyond Meat   NASDAQ BYND    the maker of a veggie burger using peas  beet juice  pomegranate juice and other unlikely ingredients and condiments  saw shares rising nearly 8  yesterday after the bell  Its closing price of  86 is also up 244  from the IPO price of  25 launched nearly a month ago  the company started trading at a premium   In contrast  the S P 500 was actually down 4 9  over the past month 
The latest jump in BYND prices came from a positive investment note from J P  Morgan analyst Ken Goldman  The analyst says that the mock meat market will be worth  100 billion 15 years from now  at which time Beyond Meat  being an early entrant will corner at least a 5  share or around  5 billion in revenue  The company generated sales of  88 million last year  so this is pretty huge 
According to Nielsen data released by the Good Food Institute  GFI  in September last year  the plant based meat market grew 23  to  684 million in the 12 months ended Aug 11  This was much higher than the 2  growth in food overall  Major players included Morningstar Farms  Gardein  Lightlife  Beyond Meat and Boca  Beyond Meat grew the fastest at 70   with Field Roast  up 68   close on its heels  Gardein  up 51    Dr  Praeger s  up 44   and Quorn  up 31   were next  GFI estimates that 14 7 million  12   of U S  households buy this meat  So Goldman s projections of BYND revenue growth may not be much off the mark 
Coming off its success in the U S  where its products are sold through most supermarkets and around 10 000 food service outlets  the company is looking to expand in Europe  Initial testing showed demand beyond its expectations  so the company is wasting no time 
Its European manufacturing plant  built in partnership with Zandbergen World s Finest Meat in the Netherlands  will be completed in the first quarter of 2020  enabling it to speed up expansion in the region while cutting transportation cost  While the company s primary focus is in northern and western European markets  it is seeing demand from the south and east as well 
Euromonitor estimates that around 22  of Europeans are looking to reduce their meat intake  This is in perfect sync with the company s goals  Rather than attempting to convert meat eaters or selling only to vegetarians and vegans  its primary target is the meat eater because this group is larger in size  So the products are sold in the meat section of groceries  promising comparable taste and experience while being healthier  no cholesterol   friendly toward animals and making for a more sustainable environment 
This brings us to the question of cost  There s plenty of data out there these days supporting the view that vegetarian food is less resource intensive  So the same amount of land would theoretically generate more plant based protein than would be generated from cultivating animal feed over the lifetime of the animal  There will also be savings in terms of storage  power and other overheads 
But until there s some momentum in the market  product sourcing remains a challenge for mock meat production  Producers have to  in some cases  secure their ingredients up to a year in advance to make sure they don t run short  This kind of thing will keep near term prices high  Unless of course there s some other factor in play  such as a push to drive trade war impacted farmers in that direction  for example  
Once the cost angle works out  to choose or not to choose a veggie burger will primarily be a question of taste and preference  Since most normal people don t enjoy slaughtering torturing animals but eat meat because that is their conditioning  there will be more takers for tasty veggie burgers over time  as an option if not for anything else 
Particularly so because scientific research increasingly shows that vegan is better for health 
Last Word
The primary challenge for players is over enthusiasm 
On the ingredients side  this could lead to genetically modified crops  A certain amount of plant  husbandry  is already there  but too much interference could destroy the natural balance of nutrients in vegetables  with related side effects  like pumping hormones etc into livestock is harmful for meat eaters   Minus the health consideration  the going can be rough especially since vegans are generally the more informed amongst us 
The other challenge is with respect to investors  While Beyond Meat is the only publicly traded mock meat company at the moment  we are likely to see many more announce their IPOs soon  And if the current level of enthusiasm is sustained or breached  the market is likely to be overvalued  As things stand now  Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS   Jefferies and BoA Merrill Lynch analysts already feel that Beyond s valuation is a bit high given the untested waters

being really boring can lead to exciting profits  You don t have to take my word for it  just take a look at Berskhire Hathaway s portfolio  Insurance companies  consumer staples  consistency  While everyone loves to talk about the hot new tech stock or cannabis stock hitting the market  there s something to be said about the old  very profitable  guard  One way to find companies like this is to lean on the time tested power of the Zacks Rank  Stocks with favorable ranks have solid earnings trends that have a tendency to continue quarter after quarter One such stock is today s Bull of the Day  General Mills  General Mills  Inc  manufactures and markets branded consumer foods worldwide  The company operates in five segments  North America Retail  Convenience Stores   Foodservice  Europe   Australia  Asia   Latin America  and Pet  It offers ready to eat cereals  refrigerated yogurt  soup  meal kits  refrigerated and frozen dough products  dessert and baking mixes  frozen pizza and pizza snacks  grain  fruit  and savory snacks  as well as organic products  including refrigerated yogurt  nutrition bars  meal kits  salty snacks  ready to eat cereal  and grain snacks Despite Goldman Sachs  downgrade  General Mills is a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   The reason for the favorable rank comes from the recent trend in earnings estimates coming from analysts across the board  Over the last sixty days  two analysts have increased their earnings estimates for next year  That bullish sentiment pushed up our Zacks Consensus Estimate from  3 34 to  3 28 General Mills  Inc  Price and ConsensusIt s that sort of strong earnings trend which has helped underpin a move from the  36 level on Christmas Even to over  53 just last week  Today s Goldman downgrade  coupled with a rough day for the market  saw shares dip to  48 25  Should the underlying earnings trend remain intact over the long run  today s selling could be seen in retrospect as a great entry point  I remember the good old days of the  Sandwich Wars   Everywhere you looked  new  delicious sandwich shops were opening up to challenge a space formerly dominated by Subway  Fresh names like Quizno s and Jersey Mike s popped up  giving lunch time folks on a time crunch plenty of choices  One of these sandwich shops is today s Bear of the Day  Not because I think it s in danger of going the way of Quizno s  just because its earnings trend has taken a turn for the negative I m talking about Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  Potbelly s  Potbelly Corporation  through its subsidiaries  owns  operates  and franchises Potbelly Sandwich Works sandwich shops in the United States  The company offers toasty warm sandwiches  salads  soups  chili  sides  desserts  breakfast sandwiches  and steel cut oatmeal  As of February 25  2019  the company operated approximately 400 shops in the United States  and approximately 50 franchisees operated shops in the United States  the Middle East  Canada  and India  The reason for the unfavorable Zacks Rank stems from a series of earnings estimate revisions to the downside coming from analysts  Over the last thirty days  three analysts have cut their earnings estimate for the company s current year and next year  The bearish sentiment has smashed the current year Zacks Consensus Estimate down from 29 cents to a 3 cent loss  Next year s number has come down from 33 cents to only 15 cents Can the 2020 Election Be Expected to Boost Twitter  TWTR  Twitter has established itself as the contemporary platform for up to date news  whether it be on entertainment  sports  politics  or business  etc  People all over the world turn to the social media platform for updates on daily events and any other significant occurrences The company s IPO in November of 2013 was received eagerly by investors  their shares opened at  26 and closed at nearly  45  This initial burst landed the company a valuation of around  31 billion Despite this strong start in the stock market  Twitter eventually started to experience growth problems  The fiscal year of 2015 proved to be Twitter s biggest test  as the company s growth became stagnant and many publications confirmed this public sentiment  These tough times brought upon many doubts about the company s future and rumors spread about a potential takeover by other tech industry giants The end of 2016 provided the company a chance for rebirth from an unlikely source  Donald Trump s involvement in the 2016 presidential race caused people to flock to Twitter to read what the candidate had to say  The presidential election that year  as well as Donald Trump s frequent activity on the platform  drastically increased traffic on the website  This Donald Trump boost turned the tide for the company as more prominent figures have joined Twitter  trampolining the company into a popular news source and completely reconfiguring its demographic landscape This trend has helped the company expand its appeal  reach various demographics  and finally escape the perception of being a gossip website for younger people  Additionally  Twitter s emergence as a public daily news forum has helped drive shares to more than double their value from a near all time low in 2016  Thanks to this newly obtained public perception  Twitter s been able to reemerge successfully and earn a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  After becoming a hotbed for breaking news  the company has been able to silence doubts about its future  Analysts expect earnings to see solid growth through this year and next  And  Twitter s increased social media presence has helped it earn a B rating in Growth for the Zacks Rank Style Scores Twitter is a company that can appeal to investors who are looking for a stock that has big growth potential  Including this stock in a portfolio could potentially have a strong payoff  especially as another presidential election is just around the corner  Will you retire a millionaire  One out of every six people

163617,385133,GIS,Are You Looking For A Top Momentum Pick  Why General Mills  GIS  Is A Great Choice,opinion,"Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock s recent trend  which can be in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   And for investors following this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks  this can be very tough to define  There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance  The Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at General Mills  NYSE GIS   a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B  We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions  two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  General Mills currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
In order to see if GIS is a promising momentum pick  let s examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this maker of Cheerios cereal  Yoplait yogurt and other packaged foods holds up 
A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short term price activity  as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand  It is also useful to compare a security to its industry  as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area 
For GIS  shares are up 0 7  over the past week while the Zacks Food   Miscellaneous industry is up 0 24  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 0 14  compares favorably with the industry s 0 05  performance as well 
While any stock can see a spike in price  it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market  Shares of General Mills have increased 14 99  over the past quarter  and have gained 21 77  in the last year  On the other hand  the S P 500 has only moved 2 63  and 5 14   respectively 
Investors should also pay attention to GIS s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  GIS is currently averaging 3 042 176 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things  including estimate revisions and a stock s price movement  Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank  and a nice path here can be promising  We have recently been noticing this with GIS 
Over the past two months  8 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost GIS s consensus estimate  increasing from  3 08 to  3 14 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  5 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Taking into account all of these elements  it should come as no surprise that GIS is a  2  Buy  stock with a Momentum Score of B  If you ve been searching for a fresh pick that s set to rise in the near term  make sure to keep General Mills on your short list ",2019-05-13,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/are-you-looking-for-a-top-momentum-pick-why-general-mills-gis-is-a-great-choice-200421242,200421242

For the full year  our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of  3 14 per share and revenue of  16 93 billion  which would represent changes of  0 96  and  7 56   respectively  from the prior year 
It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for GIS  These revisions typically reflect the latest short term business trends  which can change frequently  As such  positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company s business and profitability 
Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near term share price momentum  Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank  This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple  actionable rating system 
The Zacks Rank system  which ranges from  1  Strong Buy  to  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive outside audited track record of outperformance  with  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant within the past month  GIS is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy

Meanwhile  GIS s PEG ratio is currently 2 18  The PEG ratio is similar to the widely used P E ratio  but this metric also takes the company s expected earnings growth rate into account  GIS s industry had an average PEG ratio of 2 3 as of yesterday s close 
The Food   Miscellaneous industry is part of the Consumer Staples sector  This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 163  which puts it in the bottom 37  of all 250  industries

include  Cisco   NASDAQ CSCO    NIKE   NYSE NKE    United Parcel Service   NYSE UPS    General Mills   NYSE GIS   and WellCare Health   NYSE WCG   Here are highlights from Monday s Analyst Blog  Top Stock Reports for Cisco  Nike and UPSThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Cisco  NIKE and United Parcel Service  These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today You can see Buy ranked Cisco s shares have gained  19 7  in the past year  outperforming the Zacks Computer Networking industry s increase of  17 3   The Zacks analyst thinks Cisco is benefiting from strength witnessed in the company s security  Infrastructure Platforms and applications segments  Order strength and improving traction of the subscription based model are other tailwinds A strengthening collaboration portfolio  which now includes Webex Teams and Accompany  bodes well  Further  buyout of Duo Security and Luxtera is expected to aid the company in expanding its IT and data center clientele  Moreover  robust adoption of company s Wave 2 offerings  Meraki solutions  Catalyst 9000 switching platform and HyperFlex data center solutions hold promise Nevertheless  weakness in routing is a headwind  Competition from Arista primarily in campus connect network switches market is likely to hurt Cisco as it holds a dominant position in that domain  You can   Shares of Nike have gained  24 8  in the past year  outperforming the Zacks Shoes and Retail Apparel industry  which gained  19 6  over the same period  driven by a robust surprise trend  stemming from the execution of Consumer Direct Offense  Nike delivered positive earnings results for over three years now  with third quarter fiscal 2019 marking the 27th straight quarter of earnings beat  Sales surpassed estimates for the eighth straight quarter The Zacks analyst thinks strong progress on Consumer Direct Offense through innovation and focus on digital transformation are the key drivers  Growth at international and NIKE Direct businesses aided results in the fiscal third quarter However  the company provided a soft view for the fiscal fourth quarter  owing to unfavorable currency impact  Higher SG A expenses due to increased investments are likely to remain a drag  Further  higher input costs like cotton  chemicals and labor as well as the shift in supply chain investments from the fiscal third quarter to the fourth quarter should hurt results  You can   United Parcel Service s shares have outperformed the Zacks Transportation   Air Freight and Cargo industry over the past year  gaining  3 5  vs   10   The Zacks analyst likes UPS  efforts to reward its shareholders through dividends and buybacks Evidently  the company rewarded its shareholders to the tune of  4 2 billion in 2018  Continuing its pro investor approach  in February 2019  UPS increased its quarterly dividend by 5 5  to 96 cents per share  Robust free cash flow generation by UPS supports the possibility of a dividend hike moving ahead  Moreover  UPS  growth is hugely supported by the e commerce development  The company anticipates cross border e commerce volume to grow by 28  over the next three years However  the company s high capital expenditure is limiting bottom line growth  Trade war related uncertainty and high debt pose further challenges  You can   Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include General Mills and

163751,385267,GIS,General Mills Stock  Top Performer In Q1 2019,opinion,"General Mills  NYSE GIS  stock plunged by 50  in the second half of 2018  following a decline from its July peak of  72 95  So  when the stock touched  36 42 in late December most investors were not exactly optimistic about it  to put it mildly 
On the other hand  the Elliott Wave analysis of GIS  daily price chart  published three months ago  revealed a different picture  Take another look at it below 

First  the decline from roughly  73 to under  36 50 had a the structure of a perfect five wave impulse  labeled 1 2 3 4 5  According to the theory  a three wave correction in the opposite direction was supposed to follow  In addition  there was a strong bullish MACD divergence between waves 3 and 5   another reason not to trust the bears too much 
General Mills Stock   a Top Performer in Q1 2019
So instead of extrapolating General Mills stock s decline into the future  we thought the stage was  set for a  30  rally   The resistance near  50 a share looked like a viable first target in wave B 

Yesterday  General Mills stock closed at  51 09  up 33  since we examined its chart  The problem is that this recovery was much sharper than we expected  which means wave B is not over yet  The manner in which the bulls conquered  50 opens the door to  60 a share  which also coincides with the 61 8  Fibonacci retracement level 
Wave B is still supposed to develop as a three wave pattern  Once the current rally in wave  a  is over  a pullback in wave  b  of B should be expected before wave  c  can complete the sequence  In other words  General Mills stock can still add another  20  before wave C down begins

163799,385315,GIS,Analysts Estimate General Mills  GIS  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when General Mills  NYSE GIS  reports results for the quarter ended February 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on March 20  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This maker of Cheerios cereal  Yoplait yogurt and other packaged foods is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 69 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  12 7  
Revenues are expected to be  4 18 billion  up 7 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for General Mills 
For General Mills  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that General Mills will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that General Mills would post earnings of  0 81 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 85  delivering a surprise of  4 94  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
General Mills doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-03-12,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analysts-estimate-general-mills-gis-to-report-a-decline-in-earnings-what-to-look-out-for-200397326,200397326

This may also help the company revive investors  confidence  Well  this Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  stock has plunged close to 32  in the past three months  wider than the  s decline of 4   We note that the company recently posted fourth quarter 2018 results  wherein the bottom line tumbled 6 7  year over year  owing to lower adjusted EBITDA  elevated interest costs  and greater depreciation and amortization expenses 
Notably  adjusted EBITDA was down 13 9  to  1 699 million in the quarter  with currency playing a spoilsport to the tune of nearly 2 4 percentage points  Excluding currency  softness in adjusted EBITDA was mainly driven by weakness in the United States  wherein lower than expected savings  and high manufacturing and logistic expenses were deterrents 
Further  management expects the company s adjusted EBITDA to decline at a high teens rate in the first quarter of 2019  owing to cost inflation and planned commercial expenditure  Moreover  in 2019  earnings are likely to remain pressurized by soft EBITDA  increased depreciation costs and elevated interest costs  among other factors Nonetheless  Kraft Heinz has solid innovation initiatives planned in the foodservice space to fuel growth across all regions  To this end  the company unveiled an alliance with online grocer  Farmstead  earlier this month  The deal will bring Kraft Heinz s solid assortments like Heinz Ketchup  Kraft Mac   Cheese and Philadelphia Cream Cheese  among others  to Farmstead s customers  While the partnership will strengthen Farmstead s inventory  it will help Kraft Heinz reach more consumers through the convenience of online order and delivery Let s see if these efforts can help the stock witness a turnaround Don t Miss These Solid Food StocksMedifast   NYSE MED    with long term EPS growth rate of 20   flaunts a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see General Mills   NYSE GIS    a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  stock  has long term EPS growth rate of 7 3  Zacks  Top 10 Stocks for 2019In addition to the stocks discussed above  wouldn t you like to know about our 10 finest buy and holds for the year From more than 4 000 companies covered by the Zacks Rank  these 10 were picked by a process that consistently beats the market  Even during 2018 while the market dropped  5 2   our Top 10s were up well into double digits  And during bullish 2012   2017  they soared far above the market s  126 3   reaching  181 9  This year  the portfolio features a player that thrives on volatility  an AI comer  and a dynamic tech company that helps doctors deliver better patient outcomes at lower costs ",2019-03-13,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-kraft-heinzs-potential-sale-of-breakstones-aid-growth-200397418,200397418
163801,385317,GIS,GIS Now Testing A Key Price Level Ahead Of Earnings ,opinion,"The first quarter of 2019 has been a positive one for General Mills Inc  NYSE GIS  which has seen the price of the stock rally from the low of  36 42 of last December  to currently trade at  47 39 at the time of writing  and the question now is whether this bullish sentiment will continue into Q2 
And from a technical perspective  we are now at a delicate point for this stock as we are once again approaching a strong region of price resistance which was the catalyst for the bearish trend of late 2018  This level is denoted with the red dashed line of the accumulation and distribution indicator which considers price based support and resistance  rather than volume as on the VPOC indicator  The thickness of the line indicates this is a strong region  that gains strength each time it is tested from below  which has been the case over the last two weeks and was tested again at the end of last week 
The reason this level is so important is two fold  First it is a strong area  and second  if the stock price does breach it  then above we have a low volume node on the volume point of control through which the price should rise quickly  and on towards minor price resistance at  50 
The catalyst for such a move may well come this week with earnings due for release on the 20th March before the opening bell  with the forecast EPS being  0 69 compared to the same quarter last year at  0 79  Provided earnings come in at or better than expected  we should see the price break above the  48 price  which in turn will then create an excellent platform of support for a further move higher in due course  through  50 and on towards  52  Volumes remain supportive of a move higher  with the trend monitor also confirming the current bullish sentiment ",2019-03-18,Anna Coulling,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gis-now-testing-a-key-price-level-ahead-of-earnings-200398563,200398563

163884,385400,GIS,That   s Not What We Wanted To Hear ,opinion,"Stocks were cautiously optimistic that the Fed would right the market s ship on Wednesday with a dovish announcement about future rate hikes  The Dow even soared nearly 400 points this morning in anticipation 
	But we didn t get it 
	Actually  if the market weren t so desperate for Fed Chair Jerome Powell to be a hero  then the news may not have felt that hawkish at all  The Committee raised rates for a fourth time this year as was widely expected  but they did pull back on hikes next year to 2 instead of 3 
	That s just not enough for a market struggling with a steep correction  though  We wanted to hear that there were NO plans for further hikes in 2019  Many were hoping against hope that they might not even hike today  Therefore  when news of the Fed decision came down to the Street  the market came down to earth 
	The Dow sharply reversed course and ended with a decline of 1 5   or nearly 352 points  to 23 323 66  The S P is now knocking on the door of 2500 after slipping 1 54  to 2506 96  The NASDAQ saw the steepest percentage decline with a dip of 2 17  to 6636 83 
	So Mr  Powell won t be intimidated by a falling market or pressure from President Trump  which should calm folks who were concerned about the independence of the Fed   But investors feel that slowing economic growth across the globe is a bigger problem than the Chairman is willing to admit and that it may be too late when he does finally get around to doing something about it 
	Who s right  Who knows  For now  the U S  economy continues to be very strong regardless of the market s ugly sentiment  Stocks have pulled back so far that a bounce should be coming rather soon  It would be great to get a rebound before the year is out to salvage some of this unfortunate month and get 2019 started on the right foot  Fingers crossed   Today s Portfolio Highlights 
	Zacks Short List  This portfolio was made for uncertain times like these  Therefore  it makes complete sense that three of the top 5 movers today were short positions from this service  Those movers included Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd   AEM   5 3    GrubHub  GRUB   4 3   and Baidu  BIDU   3 1    Learn more about this emotion free portfolio that takes advantage of falling and volatile markets by reading the Short List Trader Guide Income Investor  When Ryan bought General Mills  NYSE GIS  back in October  it was for a defensive  less riskier play in a market that was growing more uncertain  No pullback is going to keep people away from their favorite cereal in the morning  The plan paid off on Wednesday as GIS gained a little over 5  while the market tanked after the Fed decision  The company reported a third straight positive surprise when fiscal second quarter adjusted earnings of 85 cents beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by about 5   Net sales missed expectations but improved 5 1  from last year  GIS was one of the best performers of all ZU names on Wednesday Counterstrike   This amazing down move in December feels like the financial crisis without the crisis  Some stocks are beat down so much  that its going to be very hard not to buy over the next couple days  despite the market s overall weakness 
	 Fundamentally speaking  things still look fine  which is why Powell feels like he can raise rates  Technically speaking its ugly out there  with the market seeing trouble ahead  
	 I m ready to buy  I know it doesn t feel like it  but I think we need to start nibbling      Jeremy Mullin

163886,385402,GIS,General Mills   Chevron In Spotlight On Earnings And Oil s Crash,opinion,"Stocks were in turmoil once again Thursday  with Wall Street extending its post Fed meeting selloff well into afternoon trading hours  The Nasdaq entered bear market territory  just one stock in the Dow was green on the day  and the S P 500 approached 18 month lows 
That said  one of the stocks featured in today s video  General Mills   NYSE GIS    was clinging to marginal gains  just one day after rallying 5  on the back of an earnings beat 
The consumer staples giant posted better than expected profits  acquisition backed revenue growth  and maintained guidance on Wednesday  That report sent shares bouncing off their five year lows a much needed bit of reprieve for the battered stock 
Now  with the near term direction of the broader market in serious question  General Mills hopes to stick out from the pack  Its results show that concerns about business conditions were overblown  and its 5  dividend yield looks like an interesting place camp out while volatility crushes momentum and growth stocks 
And if General Mills can find interest from investors looking for relative safety from industries  perhaps Chevron   NYSE CVX   can too  The energy behemoth  along with many other major stocks from the sector  sunk lower this week after oil prices crashed  But CVX is likely better prepared for a sub  50 prices than  say  a Permian Basin E P  so will its strong dividend yield keep investors in the game 
Well  earnings estimates for Chevron have been trending downward  That s to be expected  as lower oil prices put some pressure on the bottom line  That s not the trend we like to see in any company  but we also need to understand that things play out differently in each individual industry 
The reality is that Chevron s dividend is healthy  its valuation is cheap  and it will likely hold up better at current oil levels than many of the other options in the industry  If you re holding energy stocks right now  this one might be your best bet

163887,385403,GIS,General Mills Stock Staging An Elliott Wave Recovery,opinion,"If you think the last three months have been bad for stock market investors  think about how General Mills  NYSE GIS  stock investors must be feeling  GIS has been steadily declining since mid 2016  Two and a half years ago  the share price climbed to an all time high of  72 95  Last week it fell to  36 42  so it is fair to say that General Mills  market value has been cut in half in less that three years 
Almost everyone was bullish on General Mills stock in July 2016  The stock fell instead  Almost everyone is bearish on GIS now  so can it actually go up this time  Let s ask the Elliott Wave Principle  The daily chart above reveals the structure of the whole selloff from  72 95  The stock s decline appears to have taken the shape of a textbook five wave impulse  labeled 1 2 3 4 5  According to the Elliott Wave theory  impulses point in the direction of the larger trend  Unfortunately for General Mills investors  this means more weakness can be expected 
The good news is that one of Ralph N  Elliott s other findings states that every impulse is followed by a correction in the opposite direction before the larger trend resumes  In other words  a bullish reversal should soon follow  We can expect a three wave recovery in wave B to lift the share price to roughly  50  before the bear market continues 
The MACD indicator provides another reason for short term optimism  As visible  there is a bullish divergence between waves 3 and 5 of A  highlighting that the bears are about to go in hibernation  This is probably not the best time to bet against General Mills stock  If the above shown count is correct  the stage is set for a  30  rally

163905,385421,GIS,5 Cash Machines That Soar With Rates  40  Dividend Growth Ahead ,opinion,"If rising rates and this whipsawing market have you wondering where to put your cash now  don t worry  you re not the only one 
The good news  I ve got 5 perfect contrarian buys for you to snap up now 
Each of these 5 stocks is set to pull off something that s proven to line shareholders  pockets when rates spike  all 5  outrun  rates by giving us a high dividend yield now or fast payout growth and sometimes both in one buy 
More on these 5 smart rising rate plays in a moment 
First  we need to talk about another group of stocks that might look like a great contrarian opportunity now  but is anything but  Putting your money into them as rates rise is a recipe for losses and missed income 
Resist This Siren Song
I m talking about consumer staples stocks particularly big name food makers like Kraft Heinz Co  NASDAQ KHC  and General Mills  NYSE GIS   
There s one factor that just might put these tired blue chips on your menu now  their dividend yields  Take KHC  at 4 8   its yield is far higher than the 3 1  you d get from  say  a 10 year Treasury note 
The problem  That high yield is entirely because KHC s share price has crumbled just as I predicted it would in September 2017 
High Yield Hides Huge Price Drop
In other words  if you d bought KHC in January  when it was yielding about what the 10 year is today  you d be down 33  already  And food stocks like KHC still have lots of room to fall 
Why 
For one  as I ve written previously  a rising payout is the No  1 driver of share prices  Too bad KHC and its cousin  General Mills Inc  NYSE GIS   have hit the brakes on their payouts 
Dividend Growth Flatlines
That s partly because food makers are snagged in a tightening vise  on the one hand  nimble local players are out hustling them as shoppers buy more fresh food and less packaged fare 
That s knocking the wind out of sales  KHC s revenue  for example  inched up just 1 6  in the third quarter  while GIS saw North American sales dip 2  and is calling for flat organic sales  or excluding revenue from acquisitions  in fiscal 2019 
Meantime  ingredient costs are soaring  KHC s cost of goods sold jumped nearly 5  in the latest quarter  while GIS booked a 12  rise 
No wonder profits slid at both companies  And as long as that continues  you can bet both dividends will stay in the deep freeze at best 
Flat Payouts Are a Lead Weight
Of course  a stagnant payout is the last thing we need as rates rise  because it s only a matter of time before investors get restless and look elsewhere for incomes 
It s already happening 
Check out how shares of food makers like Kraft Heinz  blue line below   ConAgra Brands  CAG   in orange  Mondelez International  NASDAQ MDLZ   in red and General Mills  in green  have performed vs  the broader market  purple  since the Federal Reserve kicked off the latest rate hike cycle on December 17  2015 
Rates Rise  Staples Stocks Lose
Obviously  this is no way to grow your nest egg or secure your income stream as rates rise 
Luckily  as I mentioned off the top  there s another set of investments that lets us do both of those things and they re bargains right now  too 
REITs  A Perfect Play for Rising Rates
I m talking about real estate investment trusts  REITs  
Let s stop right here  because I know what you re thinking   Sure  Brett  but haven t REITs also been roughed up as rates have risen  
You d be right   partly  anyway 
Because when you look at the performance of REITs compared to the broader market on a price basis  it looks like REITs are getting hit 
Price Performance Looks Rough  
But REITs are income investments  so we need to look at total returns  including dividends   something few people bother to do 
  But Dividends Improve the Picture
Even so  it s still true that REITs are lagging overall  That s something first level investors would take to mean the whole sector is  dead money   and it s best to look elsewhere 
But that s the exact wrong move to make it s time to buy instead 
The Secret to Big REIT Profits   Outrun  the 10 Year
The key to contrarian gains  and income  in REITs is to zero in on trusts that  as I mentioned off the top  boast dividends that outrun the 10 year  either through high current yields or by growing their dividends so fast they re leaving interest rates in the dust 
To pull that off  we ll need REITs that are cashing in as the strong economy drives up demand for rental space  That way  their funds from operations  FFO  the REIT equivalent of EPS  will easily lap higher borrowing costs 
This is where those 5 names I mentioned earlier come in 
An Instant 5 REIT Portfolio
My 5 REIT picks are healthcare property owner National Health Investors  NHI   self storage operator Life Storage  LSI   apartment landlord Essex Property Trust  NYSE ESS   office REIT Alexandria Real Estate Equities  ARE  and warehouse owner Duke Realty  DRE  
A Safe 4 2  Dividend With 40   Upside
Let s start with dividends 
You can see below that all five boast either a high yield  soaring payout growth or both 
High Yields and Payout Growth Too  Yield includes  0 85 a share special dividend in December 2017 
So you re already getting a nice 4 2  average dividend here  which already tops the yield on the 10 year Treasury note  Plus you re getting generous payout growth  too  an average of 40 6  over the last 5 years 
 One other thing  although the payout ratios on LSI and NHI may look high  they re reasonable well run REITs like these can easily manage ratios of 85  and even higher  
But what about sales growth  the Achilles heel of the food stocks I mentioned earlier 
No problem there  either 
Big Sales Growth From  Boring  Businesses
Finally  valuation  NHI trades at 15 1 times trailing twelve month FFO  LSI  17 7  and ARE at 18 8 all terrific bargains 
Even our two priciest REITs Essex at 20 9 times FFO and Duke at 22 0 times are ripe for buying when you consider the huge payout growth on offer here  Essex sports the lowest payout ratio of our  5 pack  and the best dividend growth history 
And Duke 
It doesn t trail Essex in the dividend growth race by much when you include the 2 special dividends it s dropped on shareholders in the last 5 years 
Add in surging FFO  up 17  in Q3   low debt  just 26  of market cap  and Duke s ultra safe payout ratio  and this dividend has lots of room to run  Grab a position now  before the price races further away

163906,385422,GIS,Earnings Preview  General Mills  GIS  Q2 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when General Mills  NYSE GIS  reports results for the quarter ended November 2018  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on December 19  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This maker of Cheerios cereal  Yoplait yogurt and other packaged foods is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 81 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  1 2  
Revenues are expected to be  4 51 billion  up 7 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 4  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for General Mills 
For General Mills  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  4 76  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that General Mills will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that General Mills would post earnings of  0 64 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 71  delivering a surprise of  10 94  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
General Mills doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2018-12-11,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-general-mills-gis-q2-earnings-expected-to-decline-200367446,200367446

163940,385456,GIS,ProShares Brings Pet Friendly ETF,opinion,"The ETF industry has finally got a product on pets from ProShares  The issuer indicated that the global pet care market is worth about  132 billion  with strong expectations for growth from both millennials and boomers  read    
With about 80 mergers and acquisitions taking place in this field over the past year  increasing corporate activity is noticeable  For example  General Mills  NYSE GIS   renowned for ready made foods has forayed into the pet food industry recently with the acquisition of Blue Buffalo 
ProShares went on to highlight that the sector is non cyclical in nature   It has grown steadily every year since 1994  including through the Great Recession   according to the issuer  The name of the newly launched fund is ProShares Pet Care ETF  
Inside the Newly Launched Fund
The fund looks to track the pet industry  The fund follows the FactSet Pet Care Index  which is   The underlying index of the product will include domestic and foreign companies that make at least half of their revenues from businesses related to pet care related or veterinary related products and services  The index has at least 21 constituents 
How Big is the Pet Care Industry 
The pet industry has been growing by leaps and bounds lately  Americans shelled out about  70 billion on their pets in 2017  including health foods and luxury items  And Euromonitor noted that the industry expanded  more than 1 2  growth noted in the packaged food industry last year 
Back in 2013  Americans had spent about  55 7 billion on pet products  per the American Pet Products Association  as quoted on CNBC  The number spiked to  66 billion in 2016 and hit  in 2017  Of this  about  29 billion to  30 billion was shelled out on pet food alone  Now  the market expects the pet industry to see about  72 1 billion in spending this year 
Actually  along with themselves  people are applying health consciousness on their pets too  Demand for packaged and processed human foods is on the decline  and food companies are now aiming the bourgeoning pet industry to compensate for the decline in the human category  With millennials considering pets as family members and seven out of 10 U S  households having pets  this market is sure to grow in the coming days

163941,385457,GIS,Boost Your JM Smuckers Dividend Yield ,opinion,"Retirees seek reasonable  consistent yield without a threat to the nest egg  For the last three weeks I have revisited a method for doing this  one I first described six years ago 
The Quest for Yield  Part 6   Enhancing the Yield from Your Dividend Stocks  written in March 2012 explained the concept  While I have made a few changes  it is working as expected  I hope to write a series of posts describing and explaining some of our current choices and trades  While this is not investment advice for any specific reader  those who need to increase their yield may find it interesting   More on this subject below  
Introduction
The program  simply described  consists of buying a good dividend stock and selling a call against the position  While there are many dividend programs and many covered call programs  there is a powerful synergy from putting them together  There is also skill in choosing suitable stocks and the right call to sell 
I began the series with IBM  NYSE IBM   emphasizing criteria for finding suitable stocks  The next installment covered AT T  NYSE T   with an emphasis on the choice of which call to sell  Last week I discussed how to manage a position  using General Mills  NYSE GIS  as an example  This week I will take up what happens when you lose your stock because the option is exercised  This happened to us yesterday in JM Smucker  SJM  
Choosing a Suitable Stock
The best stocks for this approach have the following characteristics 

A reasonable dividend   2 5  or more is fine 
A good balance sheet 
A reasonable payout ratio  providing confidence that the dividend can be maintained 
Limited downside risk 

A cheap stock on a P E basis 
Evidence of technical support 



We do not care about the immediate chances for an upside move  We do not care about the  organic  earnings growth versus share buybacks  We do not care if the stock is out of favor or boring 
We seek a safe platform for selling calls  Wherever someone sees a  value trap   we see a candidate for this program 
Smucker Qualifications
Let s start with the dividend history  a very impressive record 

For valuation  I use FAST Graphs to verify that the price is attractive  We made this trade on two different occasions  The price is good now and was even better when we made our trades 

History of the Trades
This investment included several different parts 

The original covered call  9 19 17 

Purchased stock at  110 10 
Sold OCT 110 call for  1 99 
Call expired worthless   10 20 17 


Sold DEC 100 call for  1 12   10 24 17 
Collected dividend of 78 cents  those who owned the stock before the ex dividend date  11 9 17 
Call was assigned  stock sold at  110 
New covered call position  10 2 18 

Purchased stock at  103 17 
Sold NOV 105 call for 2 40 


Assigned on call  stock sold at 105   11 14 18  

Here is the history in chart form 

In the first trade  we waited for a dip in the stock to get a good price  There was a further dip  so we collected  1 99 on the call which expired worthless  We now sold another call for  1 12  We then collected a dividend of 78 cents  At December expiration  the stock was above the 100 strike price  so we were assigned on our call  This means that the call owner exercised the right to buy the stock at the strike price of 110 when it was trading 115  In all  we made  1 99    1 12   0 78 and lost ten cents on the stock for a total of  3 79 in about three months  an annualized return of 13 7  
In the second trade we bought stock at 102 55  and sold a NOV 105 call for  2 26  The stock would go ex dividend on 11 14  with holders collecting 85 cents  By that time  the stock had moved to about 113  well above the strike price  The call holder exercised the call  becoming the holder of record and getting the dividend  We missed out on the dividend  but we collected  2 26 on the call and  2 45 on the gain in the stock  105 102 55   This is a total of  4 71 in about six weeks or an annualized gain of about 40  
Terms and Concepts
We trade in  American  options  which permit exercise at any time before the option expires  Here is a good definition of exercise 

Exercise means to put into effect the right specified in a contract  In options trading  the option holder has the right  but not the obligation  to buy or sell the underlying instrument at a specified price on or before a specified date in the future  If the holder decides to buy or sell the underlying instrument  rather than allowing the contract to expire worthless or closing out the position   he or she will exercise the option  and make use of the right available in the contract 

 If you have sold a call  as we are doing in the strategy described in this series  we have sold these exercise rights  That is why we collected a premium  When calls are exercised  those who are  short the call  are  assigned  
Calls are exercised when the stock is trading above the strike price at the time of expiration  Until then  the option holder can enjoy the same exposure as owning the stock  but with much less risk 
Calls are exercised before expiration to collect a dividend  The option holder compares the remaining  premium  in the call   how much over parity it is trading  In general  if the dividend is greater than the premium it is right to exercise the call before expiration 
When does this happen  Before the stock goes ex dividend  A company announcing a dividend on a record date  the dividend will be paid to holders of record on that date  Since stocks settle after two business days  an ex dividend date is also announced  That means that those who buy on that date will not be owners of record in time to collect the dividend  On the ex dividend date  stocks decline by the amount of the dividend  Some  recover   and some do not  The actual value of the company is obviously lower by the amount of cash expended 
Thus   if you hold a call  you must exercise it before the ex dividend date  Since today  11 15 18  is the ex date  the calls were exercised yesterday  and we got the assignment notices this morning 
Those wishing to dig deeper should explore the C boe site  beginning with this terminology page  There are many other great resources  including pricing models 
This is not as difficult as it might seem on first reading  Also  it will generally not affect your choice of covered calls  it is more of a problem for those long the call 
Key Lessons
This is a complicated story but includes essential concepts 

Even though we made the initial trade after waiting for a significant dip  there was another decline in the stock  Viewed as a trade  it began as an apparent loser 
If you compare these two trades with buy and hold  you can readily see a big advantage  Long term holders made two dollars or so in stock appreciation and four dollars in dividends in more than a year  This is a lower return with a lot more risk  When we were out of the market  we could choose to have less exposure or to pursue similar strategies in other stocks 
Do not fall in love with a stock  Some of those using covered calls are unhappy when assigned on an option  They do not want to  lose  their stock  especially if missing a dividend 
If you have planned your trade properly  you will be well compensated via premium and stock appreciation if there is an early exercise 
If you own the stock because of exciting immediate upside and long term potential  this is the wrong strategy  Trying to coax out a little more return is difficult in a stock that often spikes higher 

If your short term opinion about a stock has changed  you can trade to avoid the assignment  You buy in your short call and  roll  to a different month  usually at a higher strike  We do this occasionally 

Putting It All Together
It is a good idea to have several positions in diverse sectors  I currently use 14 positions  with no more than two in a single sector 
Of our targeted portfolio yield of 9   4 5 of it comes from selling calls  Most people can take 5  yield on the original investment and reinvest the rest  The yield payout comes from the dividends and call sales  not from selling our stocks  In that sense  it is like a regular dividend program  An advantage is that if the underlying stocks decline  the reinvested yield increases your position size  You are  buying low   When stocks are sold  closing above the target price  you are  selling high

163969,385485,GIS,Has Earnings Growth Peaked Already ,opinion,"We still have a few more weeks to go before the big banks start reporting June quarter results  But the Q2 reporting cycle has  officially  gotten underway  with results from 9 S P 500 members already out  All of these early earnings releases are from companies that have fiscal quarters ending in May  but these get counted as part of the June quarter tally We have another 11 index members with fiscal quarters ending in May on deck to report results this week  All in all  we will have seen such Q2 results from almost two dozen S P 500 members by the time JPMorgan     Wells Fargo    and Citigroup     unofficially  kick off this earnings season on July 13th The notable earnings reports coming out this week include Lennar    reports on Tuesday  6 26  before the market s open  with the homebuilder expected to earn  0 45 per share in earnings on  5 23 billion in revenues  which compares to  0 91 per share on  3 26 billion in revenues in the year earlier period  The stock was up big following the last earnings release  but overall it has been a tough period for Lennar shares as well as the broader homebuilder space Lennar shares are currently trading close to 52 week lows and are now down  18 8  since the start of the year  underperforming the Zacks Construction sector s  8 1  year to date decline vs  the S P 500 index s  4  gain  KB Home     which is scheduled to report results Thursday morning  06 28  is down even more than Lennar  down  19 9  YTD      General Mills  NYSE GIS     reports on Wednesday  6 27  morning  with the company expected to earn  0 75 per share on  3 91 billion in revenues  which compares to  0 73 per share on  3 81 billion in revenues in the year earlier period  Estimates have come down a bit in recent days and the stock has lost ground following each of the last two earnings reports  The stock was down big in the run up to and the day of the last earning release on March 21st and has essentially remained flat since then  General Mills shares are currently down  22 3  since the start of the year  underperforming the struggling Consumer Staples sector s  10 3  year to date decline Nike  NYSE NKE   reports after the market s close on Thursday  6 28   with the company expected to earn  0 64 in EPS on  9 39 billion in revenues  which compares to  0 60 EPS on  8 68 billion in revenues in the year earlier period  The stock was down following each of the last three earning releases  but has been an impressive performer this year  outperforming the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector as well as the broader market  Nike shares are currently trading close to their 52 high and are up  18 6  vs  the Consumer Discretionary sector s  4 7  year to date period Accenture  will report before the market s open on Thursday  6 28   with the company expected to earn  1 71 per share in earnings on  10 02 billion in revenues  up  12 5  and  13  from the year earlier period  respectively  Accenture has been spotlighting its opportunity in the digital  cloud and security areas in recent quarters and revenues from those areas should show strong momentum in this release as well  Management s commentary about technology spending trends typically has read through for IBM    and Hewlett Packard Enterprise     The stock was down big following the last quarterly release on March 22nd  but has recovered since then and is currently up  4 9  in the year to date period 
The chart below of weekly reporting calendar for the S P 500 index clearly shows that we still have another three weeks to go before the Q2 earnings season really takes off 

Expectations for Q2Total Q2 earnings are expected to be up  18 5  from the same period last year on  7 9  higher revenues  with double digit earnings growth for 10 of the 16 Zacks sectors  This would follow  24 6  earnings growth in 2018 Q1 on  8 6   the highest growth in almost 7 years The chart below plots the evolution of Q2 earnings growth expectations  As you can see  the growth rate has ticked up a bit  partly reflecting results from the 9 S P 500 members that have reported results already  But even after accounting for the results that have come out  Q2 estimates revisions are nowhere near the impressive positive revisions we saw ahead of the start of the Q1 earnings season 

A big part of the positive revisions we saw ahead of the start of the Q1 earnings season reflected the direct impact of the tax law changes  which was obviously a one off development  Had all positive revisions been a result of tax law changes  we would have seen only EPS estimates go up  with no changes to revenue estimates  But that wasn t the case  as revenue estimates had gone up as well  which raised our hopes that the aggregate revisions trend had finally turned positive after many years being in the other direction But as the chart above shows  we didn t see much in positive revisions  In other words  while the overall growth picture remains very strong   there is no other way to describe  18 5  quarterly earnings growth   there is not much improvement in expectations for Q2 and beyond  The recent strength in the exchange value of the U S  dollar and questions about global growth will likely serve as incremental negatives for folks like us monitoring the aggregate revisions trend This flattish aggregate revisions trend notwithstanding  June quarter estimates have actually modestly ticked down for 9 of the 16 Zacks sectors and gone up for 7 sectors  The sectors enjoying positive revisions in the aggregate include Technology  Energy  Medical  Industrial Products  Basic Materials  Business Services  and Retail  Estimates have gone up the most for the Energy sector  reflecting momentum in oil prices  Excluding the gains made in the Energy sector  the aggregate revisions picture for the S P 500 index would be in negative territory The table below shows the summary picture for Q2  contrasted with what was actually achieved in Q1 

The Earnings Growth PeakThe chart below compares current Q2 earnings growth expectations with what was actually achieved in the preceding 5 quarters and what is expected in the following 3 quarters 

Please note that while the Q2 growth pace represents a deceleration from the preceding quarter s impressive level  the overall level of total earnings is in record territory  as the chart below shows 

The two charts above provide different answers to the  peak earnings  question  The first chart shows that the growth rate likely peaked in 2018 Q1  while dollar earnings aren t expected to  peak  till the last quarter of 2018  Even with respect to the growth rate  it is very much possible that final growth rates for Q2 and Q3 may surpass what we saw in Q1 We should keep in mind that this earnings cycle got underway back in 2009 when the U S  economy got out of its last recession  By this time  earnings growth should have come down to the historical  normalized  pace in the mid single digits level  The reason we have these impressive growth numbers and positive revisions trend is thanks mostly to the effect of the tax cuts  which will start wearing off towards the end of 2019 In other words  earnings likely haven t peaked yet  But with this cycle so long in tooth  we are steadily moving towards that stage 
Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest StrategiesIt s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But while the market gained  21 9  in 2017  our top stock picking screens have returned  115 0    109 3    104 9    98 6   and  67 1  And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon  Over the years it has been remarkably consistent  From 2000   2017  the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over  Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we re willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation

163971,385487,GIS,This Hated 6 8  Payer Is Ready To Pop  Buy Now ,opinion,"It s here again  another stock downturn 
But don t worry  because today I m going to show you a  1 click  way to profit from it  and collect a nice 6 8  dividend while you do  
The key  Dipping into an out of favor sector that outperforms when the market gets fearful  I m talking about consumer staples  which is down a whopping 9 4  in 2018  far below every other sector in the S P 500 
Consumer Staples Swoons
Usually  when volatility picks up  consumer staples outperform consumer discretionary stocks  Yet that didn t happen from February to April  when the market first began to tumble  and it isn t happening now that the market is beginning to fall again 
In fact  the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR ETF  NYSE XLP  has fallen by almost exactly as much as the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR ETF  XLY  has risen in 2018  suggesting investors are simply selling off the one to buy the other 
Investors Ditch So Called  Safe  Stocks Despite Market Wobbles
So where is this market confidence in the relative weakness of staples coming from  if investors are also scared that US stocks are generally riskier than they looked in January 
The answer may come down to changing consumer preferences  A big part of the sector is consumer packaged goods  CPGs   a group that includes everything from Procter   Gamble  PG  to tobacco producer Altria  MO  and well known brands such as General Mills  NYSE GIS  
And  taken as a whole  these firms just aren t selling as much as they used to 
Big Names  Weak Sales
With the exception of Altria  which has benefited from a trend in vaping that s helped drive tobacco sales higher  these firms  sales are down  and there s little evidence they ll recover 
But keep in mind that this trend is well known and is why staples have underperformed consumer discretionary stocks for years 
Underperformance Serves Up Bargains
Notice  however  that consumer discretionary s outperformance has increased significantly in the last few months  which may indicate that the market has oversold the weakness in consumer staples  providing some bargains in the sector 
And while the sector is being challenged by changes in the market  there are standouts that can likely withstand the pressures  Take Altria  This tobacco producer has been able to grow EPS by 111 7  in the last 20 years  even though revenue has fallen by 55 1  
Higher Profits on Lower Sales
That is why Altria has far exceeded the sector s performance and even matched the performance of the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR ETF in the last few years  up until a few months ago 
Leading a Weak Sector
This doesn t mean that all staples are destined to recover or even that they will start to tick upward over the long term  As my colleague Brett Owens points out  firms with shrinking sales  like Altria  can t squeeze out profits forever but the question to ask yourself is whether some firms  profit making abilities have been discounted too much by the accelerated declines in staples stocks in the last few weeks 
For an investor who can answer this question and find the staples firms that can outperform thanks to higher earnings and exaggerated stock price declines  the recent extreme selloff in the sector is a rare buying opportunity 
But how do you know which staples stocks to buy and which to avoid 
The Main Consumer Staples ETF Is Not the Answer
Since some staples companies can t match Altria s earnings growth  despite falling sales  just buying the index isn t a way to make this contrarian play 
Instead  there is a fund that gives you exposure to the best staples companies while also providing a high yield and strong performance 
You get all of this with the Eagle Capital Growth Fund  GRF   a closed end fund that yields 6 8   XLP  by the way  yields just 3 7   and holds many consumer staples stocks  including Colgate Palmolive  CL   its top holding  as well as Kraft Heinz  KHC   Procter   Gamble  PG   Pepsi  PEP  and Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  
And  when we look at the last 3 years  GRF has matched the performance of the consumer discretionary ETF performance while beating the consumer staples ETF for years that is  until the recent downturn in staples 
A Buying Opportunity Appears
The reason I say now is a buying opportunity is because GRF s recent decline is largely affected by its staples holdings  while the fund s other holdings have crushed both the consumer discretionary ETF and the market more broadly 
While GRF is heavily invested in consumer staples  it also provides investors with exposure to high performing stocks like T  Rowe Price  TROW   Ebay  EBAY  and Stryker  SYK   its biggest holdings behind Colgate  And in case you were wondering  here s how these stocks have performed in the last 3 years 
Top Holdings Lead the Way
An 18 3  annualized gain over 3 years is impressive enough and shows GRF is a good pick not only for consumer staples exposure but also for access to a fund management team that has made great investment decisions in the past

164018,385534,GIS,Many Dividend Growth Stocks Are Finally In A Bear Market  General Mills ,opinion,"For quite some time I have been complaining that most best of breed dividend growth stocks were overvalued  Frankly  for the most part I continue to hold that opinion  On the other hand  I am also starting to see what I ll call a stealth bear market for many dividend growth stocks  In some cases  this stealth bear market has brought several dividend growth stocks close to fair value  and in a few cases down to undervalued territory  Furthermore  there are also dividend growth stocks that have fallen 10  to 20  or more and yet remain significantly overvalued 
Consequently  I am beginning to suspect that my long awaited reversion to the mean may finally be happening  However  so far valuation reversions have been somewhat selective  In other words  although the valuations of most high quality dividend stocks remain extended  the stock prices of several specific individual dividend growth stocks have been dropping and or moving sideways recently 
Therefore  I thought it would be helpful to provide FAST Graphs analyze out loud videos on several dividend growth stocks that have corrected from high valuation levels to more reasonable levels  My first research candidate is General Mills Inc  NYSE GIS   The following slide summarizes General Mills  business makeup 

FAST Graphs Analyze out Loud Video  General Mills
General Mills has fallen more than 40  off its high established in July 2016  Additionally  General Mills  stock price has fallen over 29  since the beginning of calendar year 2018  However  as I intend to illustrate in the following analyze out loud video  nothing fundamentally has really changed with the company  In 2016 General Mills was extremely overvalued  and it entered 2018 still overvalued but not at the extreme level it was in 2016  Thanks to this correction this quality consumer staples company now offers investors a dividend yield exceeding 4    

Summary and Conclusions
If you re looking for a good income investment to add to your portfolio  then General Mills might just be the ticket  On the other hand  if you re looking for capital appreciation  then General Mills might also represent a valuation arbitrage situation  In other words  if the company were to produce the modest growth expected by analysts and the market decided to once again value the stock at its normal premium P E ratio  capital appreciation potential could also be superior  Both scenarios appear to be predicated on conservative forecasts  However  I would strongly suggest conducting your own comprehensive research and due diligence

The News
Each week I break down events into good and bad  For our purposes   good  has two components  The news must be market friendly and better than expectations  I avoid using my personal preferences in evaluating news   and you should  too 
The Good

The best news was from the FOMC minutes  suggesting extended patience under Chairman Powell 
Michigan sentiment and jobless claims remain at excellent levels but were slightly below expectations 

The Bad

Durable goods orders declined 1 7   reversing the prior month s gain and slightly worse than expectations 
Home sales missed expectations  Calculated Risk comments on  and  home sales 

The Ugly
Over  1 million in student loans  This dentist is one of over 100 such people  Josh Mitchell s account    explains how this can happen 
The Week Ahead
We would all like to know the direction of the market in advance  Good luck with that  Second best is planning what to look for and how to react 
The Calendar
The economic calendar is huge  and the week is short  The most important data is all on the calendar  The employment report will attract the most attention  The ISM index  the Fed s favorite inflation indicator  core PCE prices   personal income and spending  consumer confidence  auto sales  and pending home sales are all on the schedule  And those are just the big reports  Factor in some late arrivals back on the job on Tuesday  and there is the potential for plenty of action in four days 
 has a good U S  economic calendar for the week  and many other good features which I monitor each day   Here are the main U S  releases 

Next Week s Theme
There is an avalanche of economic news in the shortened week ahead  While this will provide plenty to talk about  I expect many to be asking 
Should investors basically ignore the daily geopolitical news 

The Pundit in Chief commented that the market is getting it wrong every day  mistakenly trying to trade every swing in the news flow 
Art Cashin observed that traders seem to be learning a pattern  Aggressive statements by world leaders  including the Trump Administration  followed by more moderate policies  Art sees this understanding as part of the recent reduction in volatility 

As usual  I ll save my overall personal conclusions for today s Final Thought

The Indicator Snapshot

Short term trading conditions improved dramatically  Despite the recent borderline ratings suggesting  bad weather  it was not quite enough to take us out of the market  A strength of our modeling approach  Thanks  Vince   is a touch more patience than shown by many technical systems  This has a mild cost  and can reap great rewards  as it has in the last few weeks 
A notable feature of the chart is that we recently increased the nine month recession odds to a chance of 25   While this is significantly higher than it has been during the long stock rally  it does not yet represent a real threat  Instead of thinking of the odds as higher than before  we must keep in mind the continuing evidence that a near term recession is unlikely  The odds are only slightly higher than the long term average 
That said  we watch this quite closely and plan to reduce position sizes if the risk grows much larger

Best of the Week
If I had to pick a single most important source for investors to read this week it would be  of  extreme  portfolios 

There are certain people in this world with some very  ahem  unique  i e  extreme  political  economic  and investing viewpoints  Sometimes these people sound VERY smart on their blogs  in comments  or on internet forums  They rattle off all kinds of interesting economic factoids  throw out a lot of fancy acronyms that you ve never heard of  and suggest that they re in the know about the future and you are not  What I prefer to do when I run into people like this is to simply ask them what their asset allocation is 

And one of several examples 

Let me give you some examples of portfolios that are being used or recommended by some of these folks

1 3 Gold  not a gold ETF  not coins  the actual bullion

Outlook
Mike Williams presents an excellent summary of recent economic strength and takes note of the gap between reality and headlines 

Stocks dipped 10 2  from their most recent highs during the latest window of chop spanning from January 26 to February 8 of this year  While that was unfolding   the media flooded the idea that liquidity was  drying up  


The usual scapegoat was the chatter about the Fed s quantitative tightening  which started during October of last year  Anyone listening for the last five years will note that the bears have been predicting that our next bear market would be driven by the Fed unwinding its QE program 


Yet  that same group told us that the next bear market would be driven by the end of QE as well   which is now three years old 


You could drive a truck through the space between the financial facts and financial headlines 


It all depends on what you want to believe

Final Thoughts
This week s narrative rapidly shifted from concern about inflation and a ten year note over 3  to questions about deflation  Those who have been citing the likelihood of more Fed rate hikes as a sign of danger were surprised by the FOMC minutes  The Fed has long stated that it would tolerate slightly higher inflation levels for a time  even above the 2  target for PCE prices  This approach  like every other Fed policy  has many critics 
Investors should make decisions based upon what they expect from Fed policy in the near term  not on some theoretical critique from the punditry 
My travels have once again included casual discussions with many individual investors  I always enjoy the opportunity to listen  I ask about their own businesses  their spending and travel plans  their current investment attitude  and their biggest concerns  In general  their own businesses are doing well  and they are enjoying some travel and recreation  A problem with this sort of anecdotal evidence is that I am meeting the people who are traveling  not the ones who are staying home 
The investment concerns are repeated by many 

There is so much more volatility in stocks  Isn t that a sign of trouble 
There seem to be new geopolitical issues or disasters every week  Isn t this a risk for stocks 
Everyone talks about the aging bull market  Is that a sign that death is near 

These have all been among my favorite recent topics  but those I am meeting are not among my regular readers  They do not know the following 

Volatility is now normal  returning from recent lows  A one percent daily move is the historic average  Volatility is not a predictor of declining stocks  It is a trailing or coincident indicator 
Geopolitical questions are difficult to evaluate in this ever changing landscape  Many issues that are important to us as citizens do not translate into corporate earnings and stock prices 
Bull markets do not die of old age  despite the many false narratives we hear  There is no statistical evidence between age and prospects for  say  the next two years  It is not like comparing a young person to an elderly one  no matter how seductive that analogy may seem 

The implication  The wise investor can still benefit from the baseless fears of others

164020,385536,GIS,Pet Industry Is Getting All Love From ETF Issuers  ,opinion,"The pet industry has been growing by leaps and bounds lately  Americans shelled out about  70 billion on their pets in 2017  including health foods and luxury items  And Euromonitor noted that the industry expanded  more than 1 2  growth noted in the packaged food industry last year

What Is Driving This Industry  
Actually  health consciousness is broad based among Americans and people are applying this on their pets too  Demand for packaged and processed human foods is falling  and food companies are now targeting the budding pet industry to make up for the decline in the human category With millennials considering pets as family members  this market is sure to grow in the coming days  read

And why won t ETF issuers target this fast moving industry  Global sales of all pet care products and services  including pet food  jumped  from 2012 to 2017 with the U S  market leading pet care and pet food sales  General Mills  NYSE GIS   renowned for ready made foods  has announced this year that it would buy the Wilton  Connecticut based company Blue Buffalo Pet Products for  in cash 
Will the Duo Be Successful 
Presently  the pet care industry is devoid of such pure play products  So  from that point of the view  the duo will see easy success  if it gets approval and even enjoy first mover advantage over the long run  However  with General Mills planning to foray into this division  the proposed funds may face some threats from General Mills heavy funds like PowerShares Dynamic Food and Beverage  and Ivy Focused Value NextShares

164049,385565,GIS,Is Gabelli Nextshares Introducing A Pet Friendly ETF ,opinion,"Innovations have lately been part and parcel of the ETF industry  The days of plain vanilla ETFs or market cap weighted ETFs are long gone  In fact  products with winning attributes like low volatility or high dividend are also widespread in the market   Naturally  issuers have to explore newer and untapped areas  This is where the concept of thematic ETFs starts to bloom  read    
There are ETFs dedicated to several corners of the society  generation or culture  So far  thematic funds were targeted at humans but Gabelli Nextshares Trust went a step ahead with its plan to launch a pet oriented ETF called Gabelli Pet Parent Fund  The ticker code is yet to be disclosed 
Inside the Proposed Fund 
The fund looks to track the pet industry  It means that the product will include companies that offer services and products for pets and pet owners  The industry encompasses  services  pharmaceuticals  wellness  nutrition  equipment  medical and dental supplies and services related to the well being of pets  The product charges 90 bps in fees 
How Does it Fit in a Portfolio  
The pet food industry has been on the rise  Euromonitor noted that the industry expanded  more than 1 2  growth noted in the packaged food industry last year  Americans shelled out about  70 billion on their pets in 2017  including health foods and luxury items 
Back in 2013  Americans had spent about  55 7 billion on pet products  as per the American Pet Products Association  quoted on CNBC  The number spiked to  66 billion in 2016 and hit  in 2017  Of this  about  29 billion to  30 billion was shelled out on pet food alone  Now the market expects the industry to see about  72 1 billion in spending this year 
Actually  health consciousness is broad based among Americans and people are applying this on their pets too  Demand for packaged and processed human foods is falling and food companies are now targeting the budding pet industry to make up for the declines in the human category 
The CNBC article also gave an example that General Mills  NYSE GIS   renowned for ready made foods  has announced this year that it would buy the Wilton  Connecticut based company Blue Buffalo Pet Products for  in cash 
The wholesome natural pet food category accounts for only   up from 5  five years ago  With millennials considering pets as family members  this market is sure to grow in the coming days  read    
Competition 
No such product targeting the pet industry is available at present in the market  However  with General Mills planning to foray into this division  the proposed fund may face some threats from the General Mills  heavy funds like PowerShares Dynamic Food and Beverage  and Ivy Focused Value NextShares   Overall  the issuer has targeted an unexplored ETF area and is likely to enjoy the first mover advantage  if approved

164097,385613,GIS,Is General Mills  GIS  A Great Stock For Value Investors  ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put General Mills Inc    NYSE GIS   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  General Mills has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 19 7  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 22 9x  If we focus on the long term PE trend  General Mills  current PE level puts it above its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the broader industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 22 6  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that General Mills has a forward PE  ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 19 1  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for General Mills stock in the near term too  P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  General Mills has a P S ratio of about 2 2  This is significantly lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 6x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  General Mills currently has a Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes General Mills a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though General Mills might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of C and a Momentum Score of D  This gives GIS a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed  The current quarter has seen three estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to four lower  while the full year estimate has seen five up and two down in the same time period This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has decreased by 1 3  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched upper by 0 6   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below General Mills  Inc  Price and Consensus     This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineGeneral Mills is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Further  with a strong industry rank  among Top 42  of more than 250 industries  instilss our confidence on the stock  However  with a Zacks Rank  3 it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the broader industry has clearly underperformed the market at large  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of All                 Last year  it generated  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  47 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce   the world s first trillionaires    but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early ,2018-01-30,Zacks

164098,385614,GIS,5 Hated Stocks That Will Soar With Interest Rates  and Pay 6  ,opinion,"If you re like most dividend investors  you re probably keeping a nervous eye on bond yields right now 
And  well  you should be but only if you own low yielding  or slow growing  Dividend Aristocrats like  say  PepsiCo  NASDAQ PEP   
But if you buy  or already own  the 5  undercover  high yielders I ll show you at the end of this article  I have great news for you  You can ignore inflation  bond yields and the Fed and simply keep on collecting your fat dividend checks 
In fact  this overdone selloff has given us an open window to buy more 
Bond Yields  1  PepsiCo  0
Before we get to that  back to PepsiCo 
As you probably know  the yield on the 10 year Treasury note has spiked from 2 3  in early December to more than 2 9  today 
And guess what PEP s dividend yield is  2 9  
So in a matter of a couple weeks  the 26  gap between the two yields has shrunk to zero 
The question then becomes  with that gap narrowing  why would you buy PEP  a company whose biggest business  North American beverages  is on the wrong side of the landslide toward healthier drinks 
Because even though PEP beat expectations in the fourth quarter and delivered a 15  dividend hike  in the background are flat year over year revenues  no thanks to a 6  drop in North American drink sales 
No wonder CFO Hugh Johnston said PEP has  challenges  in its business  We don t envy him  with more than a third of his sales tied to popular drinks of yesteryear 
Bond Yields Will Bury Old School Aristocrats
The problem with PepsiCo and its ilk is that their sales are stalling out at precisely the wrong time  just as bond yields rise  That means their dividends  which depend on rising sales and earnings to go higher  will get left in the dust 
Result  income hungry first level investors will dump these paupers in droves  practically guaranteeing they ll underperform 
It s already happening 
Check out how PepsiCo  purple line  below   ConAgra Brands  NYSE CAG   in green  Mondelez International  NASDAQ MDLZ   in orange  and General Mills  NYSE GIS   in blue  have performed vs  the broader market  red  since this rate hike cycle kicked off on December 17  2015 
 Safe  Stocks Are Anything But 
Funny thing is  history is repeating itself 
Let s go back to July 2004 through June 2006  when the Federal Reserve hiked rates from 1 25  to 5 25  and 10 year Treasury yields spiked to 5 14   I don t think we ll see anything that dramatic this time around  by the way  
What happened  None of these household names could squeak past the S P 500 
A Depressing Pattern
But don t worry  because there is one sector that crushed the market then and is woefully undervalued now  real estate investment trusts 
And when I say  crushed   I mean it 
If you held the iShares Real Estate ETF  NYSE IYR  back then  you pocketed a gain more than 3 times that of the S P 500   Note  I m using IYR instead of the more popular REIT benchmark  the Vanguard Real Estate ETF  NYSE VNQ   here as VNQ didn t launch until September 2004  
REITs Lap the Market
I know what you re thinking   Sure  Brett  but unlike back then  REITs have gotten hammered in the current rate hike cycle  
You d be right 
VNQ has been badly roughed up since the Fed kicked off the latest series of hikes more than two years ago 
Our Cue to Buy
First level investors would take this as a sign that now is the time to sell REITs and look for safer income plays 
But the right move is the exact opposite  
Here s why 
Unlike consumer staples stocks  REITs boast fat dividend yields  VNQ pays 4 7  now  and many REITs  like 3 of the 5 I ll reveal below  yield 6  and up  Let s be honest  the 10 year will never rival payouts like those 
The best REITs including all 5 below are seeing rising sales  which PepsiCo s Johnston can only dream of    driving payout growth that will keep the yield on your original buy rising for years 
As  on January 23  a surging payout is the No  1 driver of share prices 
The bottom line  Now is the time to buy REITs  
So let s dive into the 5 I have for you  They either boast a sky high yield  surging dividend growth   or both 
An Instant 5 REIT Portfolio for Rising Rates
They are  Easterly Government Properties  NYSE DEA   Physicians Realty Trust  NYSE DOC   Life Storage  LSI  a REIT  as a  buy and hold forever  stock in November Preferred Apartment Communities  NYSE APTS  and STAG Industrial  NYSE STAG  
You can see that our 5 REIT mini portfolio represents a range of REIT sectors  with one glaring omission  shopping mall REITs  whose tenants are being  by Amazon com  NASDAQ AMZN  
You ll also see that all 5 either have tenants who aren t going anywhere  like Easterly  its buildings were 100  occupied at the end of Q3  and Physicians Realty  when was the last time you heard of doctors being tight for work   or are benefiting from something the first level crowd always forgets when rates rise a surging economy 
The latter group includes Preferred  which sees higher demand and rents   STAG  which owns 347 warehouses in 37 states    and Life  a self storage REIT that benefits from the bull market in  stuff  
Dividends and Dividend Growth Look Solid
Let s start with dividends 
You can see below that all 5 boast either a high yield  soaring payout growth  getting you a high yield on your initial buy in short order  or both  And they re backed by safe payout ratios  90  of FFO paid as dividends is a sustainable number for well run REITs  
High Yields and Payout Growth Too 
So you re already getting a nice 5 9  average dividend here 3 times more than the average S P 500 stock pays and generous payout growth  too 
But what about revenue growth  the Achilles heel of the 5 consumer stocks above  No problem there  either 
Big Growth From  Boring  Businesses
Finally  valuation  Thanks to the selloff  DEA trades at 16 8 times trailing twelve month FFO  DOC clocks in at 14 3  LSI  15 2  APTS at just 9 9  and STAG at 13 8 
These are bargain numbers for cash spinning businesses like these  And they won t last once the herd realizes that CDs and Treasuries still won t be enough to retire on

164158,385674,GIS,Stock Market Looking Scary For Bulls,opinion,"Things were looking a little scary for the bulls into the start of US trade and the view that tactically various risk assets were due a pullback was starting to play out 
Our ASX 200 opening call overnight  around 01 00 aedt  got as low as 5975  with SPI futures trading down to 5984 or  0 8   Naturally  the lead for SPI futures came from S P futures  which were heavy through European trade and dragged lower by selling in the Euro Stoxx 50 and DAX index  although both staged a decent comeback to finish modestly lower  The German DAX traded into the 13000 to 12900 support zone  which now looks like rock solid support on the daily timeframe  so in the session ahead if the bulls can dominate and we see a higher high then that should be respected and could mark a short term low in the index 
The S P 500 cash index opened on its lows of 2574  naturally in line with how the futures market had been reacting  with buyers then steeping in from the get go and pushing the index slightly above the flat line  The buy the dip mentality is still very much in place  but then again who wants to sell and realise a capital gain when you may get a lower tax rate next year 
Either way  we can see an improvement in market breadth  60  of S P 500 companies are trading higher   with good volumes going through the various exchanges  Notably  the Dow  where value traded was some 52  above the 30 day average  One can put emphasis on General Mills Inc  NYSE GIS   which is lower by 8  and taking 11 points out of the market and as something Telstra Corporation Ltd   AX TLS  shareholders will attest to  the market is never enthused when management lower you dividend by 50   even if this does still represent an above sector payout ratio of 85  of forecast free cash flow  Sector wise  we can see broad sector appreciation within the S P 500  with utilities and staples leading the way  with modest gains in materials   0 6   and financials   0 3    Energy and industrials have seen small losses and have been the laggards 
Small underperformance has once again been seen in high yield credit  with spreads widening by a single basis point  but there is no cause for concern here  The Russell 2000 is trading largely unchanged  although the noise around US tax reform is set to heat up with headlines just out that the Senate Finance Committee will release its revised tax plan tonight  So this index will be worth watching as it is the poster child of all things tax reform and will be well traded as the vehicle on how tax reform plays out and whether the House and the Senate can reconcile the key difference in tax reform 
In fixed income land  we have seen a slight bear flattening of the Treasury curve  with two year Treasuries ticking up two basis points  bp  to 1 68   the highest level since October 2008   while the 10 year and longer end of the curve remains anchored at 2 40  
The attention of AUD USD traders has been fixed on the yield premium commanded to hold Aussie 10 year bonds over US 10 year Treasuries and the fact this yield differential has dropped from 61bp in September to currently sit at 22bp and eyeing a move into the year low of 14bp  I would urge switching to focus on the five year part of the bond curve  which obviously has a strong sensitivity to monetary policy changes over the coming five years  Here  we can see the yield advantage the Aussie bond commands falling to a mere 6 bp over US 5 year Treasuries and the smallest premium since July 2000  AUD USD  itself is trading heavy and lower by 0 5  on the session and a close below  0 7625  the 27 October low  would open up further downside and I am a willing seller through here on both a trend and momentum basis  In terms of event risk for the session ahead and there are a few to focus on  although whether they affect price is another thing 

AUD CAD is another chart on the radar and as seen on the daily timeframe  we can see price having broken the September uptrend and looking like it wants to test the September lows  A close through c 0 9799 opens up strong downside in my opinion 

So locally  we get the NAB business conditions and confidence report at 11 30 aedt  although I would not expect this to promote too great a reaction  China is in focus and while we saw the release of the October credit data overnight  which showed M2 money supply and new yuan loans were both below the market s forecast  while total social financing has held up well  If we look at the China CSI 300 ETF  NYSE ASHR ETF  there has been little concern here and we see it trading  0 2   Fast forward to 13 00 aedt though and we get the October data dump  with retail sales  consensus at  10 8    fixed asset investment   7 3   and industrial production  6 3   in play  but again  we find markets like copper and AUD have not been overly sensitive to this release for a while 
Our call then for the ASX 200 sits at 6009   12 points  and it will be of interest to see how investors and trader act from around 10 10 aedt and the full unwind of the market  BHP Billiton  LON BLT  Ltd ADR  NYSE BHP  looks set to open  1 2  and that should weigh  with energy also likely to struggle if it follows the lead from the S P 500 and the modest selling in both US and Brent crude  As a guide for the materials space  we see spot iron ore  0 7   although more positive flows have been seen in the Dalian futures exchange with iron ore  steel  and coking coal closing up  0 8   0 5   and  0 3  respectively  Copper is up 1 5   Financials  as always are key but there doesn t seem to be any clear catalyst for the space on open ",2017-11-14,IG,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-long-and-the-short-of-it-200264791,200264791

region  and Asia   Latin America  which combines the remaining two current international regions This structural change aims at maximizing global scale  unlocking global growth opportunities and driving efficiency North America Retail  Revenues from this segment declined 3  year over year to  2 39 billion due to double digit declines in the U S  yogurt operating units  This was partly offset

favorable impact on the quarter s results Segment operating profit dropped 34  year over year  This was due to the reporting period difference and input cost inflation  including currency driven

Economic calendar continues to be quiet 
Treasuries were higher  with the economic calendar again void of any major reports today  as the yield on the 2 Year note declined 3 basis points  bps  to 1 26   and the yields on the 10 Year note and the30 Year bond were down 4 bps at 2 42  and 3 04   respectively

Political infighting  Presidential tweets  North Korean missile launches  oil falling below  50  European political uncertainty  higher bond yields  and the Fed raising rates  none of those forces have knocked stocks off their recent uptrend  Volatility remains remarkably low but that doesn t mean it won t pick up  investors should be prepared for bouts of volatility  and pullbacks along the way  The U S  economy continues to expand  although there are signs that first quarter growth could be on the weak side  largely due to continued seasonal issues  We believe that economic growth is generally accelerating  a thought bolstered by the Fed s confidence to raise rates again  Politics  both here and abroad  are keeping policy uncertainty high and should also contribute to bouts of volatility

News on the economic front centered on the U K   with the nation reporting its fastest pace of consumer inflation in over three years  citing the pound s depreciation against the U S  dollar following the country s vote to leave the EU  Prices in February jumped 2 3  from 1 8  the month prior  the first time consumer prices have eclipsed the Bank of England s 2 0  target since November 2013  prompting analysts to posit the notion of a possible rate hike in May  Meanwhile  producer prices in the county were roughly in line with forecasts  and retail sales were higher than expected 
The British pound climbed to trade higher against the U S  dollar following the nation s inflation report  while bond yields in the region are mixed

Mainland Chinese shares declined  while those in Hong Kong gained ground  after the People s Bank of China  PBoC  injected 30 billion yuan into the markets  coinciding with a decline in money market rates  Mainland media outlets stated that the PBoC will continue selective policy tightening  while Reuters reported that Beijing is seeking guidance on how to counter any trade penalties imposed against it by the U S

164345,385861,GIS,5 Top ROE Picks As Markets Turn Trump Friendly,opinion,The U S  equity market recently saw key indices scale a record high  driven by expectations of radical policy changes by the President designate Donald Trump  Investors expect economic stimulus and infrastructure investments to boost hiring and corporate earnings while cutting taxes  However  in the same breath  investors anticipate higher inflation as the markets brace for a probable interest rate hike by the Fed   Amid such an equivocal scenario  investors are often on the lookout for  cash cow  stocks that would enable them to rake in more profits However  singling out cash rich stocks alone does not make them a solid investment proposition unless they are backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity  ROE   A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return Significance of ROEROE   Net Income Shareholders  EquityROE helps investors distinguish between profit generating companies from profit burners and is useful for determining the financial health of a company  In other words  this financial metric enables investors to identify stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher returns Moreover  ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry   the higher the better  It measures how well a company is growing its profits without investing any new equity capital in the business and portrays management efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk adjusted returns Screening ParametersIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE  we added Cash Flow greater than  1 billion and ROE greater than X Industry as our primary screening parameters  In addition  we take a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy Price Cash Flow less than X Industry  This metric measures how much investors pay for one dollar of free cash flow  A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock Return on Assets  ROA  greater than X Industry  This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset  which includes cash  accounts receivable  property  equipment  inventory and furniture  Of course  the higher the ROA  the better it is 5 Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X

164346,385862,GIS,Unilever  UL  Down After Paying Fine In Brazilian Tax Case,opinion,"Unilever  LON ULVR  PLC s   NYSE UL   share price fell nearly 1  on Nov 25  after the Anglo Dutch consumer giant received an  adverse judgement  from Brazilian Judicial court in relation to an indirect tax case  As a result  Unilever has decided to pay judicial deposit of approximately  590 million   504 million   which will be recognized as a non current financial asset  Hence  no impact is expected on the company s reported free cash flow 
Unilever intends to appeal this ruling at the Brazilian Supreme Court  believing it has a strong case  The company had been warned about the Brazilian tax case in October 
Last month  Unilever posted weak third quarter 2016 results  In the reported quarter  its sales dipped 0 1  mainly due to currency headwinds and weak economic conditions in a number of countries  On a constant currency basis  sales increased 3 4  in the quarter 
Unilever delivered organic sales growth of 3 2   in local currency   which was toward the lower end of the 3  5  range expected for the year  Higher pricing of 3 6  offset the volume decline of 0 4   Organic sales growth was lower than 4 7  growth in the preceding quarter 
Emerging markets grew 5 6  in the third quarter of 2016  weaker than 7 7  growth in the second quarter and 8 3  in the first quarter  Developed markets remained flat in the quarter as against 0 7  growth in the preceding quarter owing to weak volume growth and price deflation in Europe UNILEVER PLC Price and Consensus
    Overall  we are encouraged by the fact that Unilever is consistently focusing on product improvement through innovation  The company has also accelerated its cost containment measures to remove unnecessary costs and simplify the business 
Unilever has been relying on deodorants and hair care products to augment revenues this year  amid waning sales of its margarine and bread spreads  In fact  the company entered into many deals recently in order to fortify its position in home care and personal care products  These acquisitions will strengthen its portfolio and add to revenues 
Apart from acquisitions  Unilever has also been shedding off assets in its battered food business  The company still remains concerned about deteriorating trends in Europe  Brazil and Russia  Weakness in consumer demand persists  Many emerging markets continue to be volatile  particularly those dependent on oil and other commodity exports  and where currency devaluation is pushing up the cost of living for consumers 
Unilever currently has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  
Stocks that Warrant a Look
Some better ranked stocks in the food industry include General Mills  Inc    NYSE GIS    Ingredion  Inc    NYSE INGR   and Lancaster Colony Corporation   NASDAQ LANC    each carrying a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see

5 Top ROE Picks as Markets Turn Trump Friendly

	The U S  equity market recently saw key indices scale a record high  driven by expectations of radical policy changes by President elect Donald Trump  Investors expect economic stimulus and infrastructure investments to boost hiring and corporate earnings while cutting taxes  However  in the same breath  investors anticipate higher inflation as the markets brace for a probable interest rate hike by the Fed 

	Amid such an equivocal scenario  investors are often on the lookout for  cash cow  stocks that would enable them to rake in more profits 
	However  singling out cash rich stocks alone does not make them a solid investment proposition unless they are backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity  ROE   A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return Significance of ROE
	ROE   Net Income Shareholders  Equity
	ROE helps investors distinguish between profit generating companies from profit burners and is useful for determining the financial health of a company  In other words  this financial metric enables investors to identify stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher returns 
	Moreover  ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry   the higher the better  It measures how well a company is growing its profits without investing any new equity capital in the business and portrays management efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk adjusted returns Screening Parameters
	In order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE  we added Cash Flow greater than  1 billion and ROE greater than X Industry as our primary screening parameters  In addition  we take a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy Price Cash Flow less than X Industry  This metric measures how much investors pay for one dollar of free cash flow  A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock 

Return on Assets  ROA  greater than X Industry  This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset  which includes cash  accounts receivable  property  equipment  inventory and furniture  Of course  the higher the ROA  the better it is 5 Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X Industry  This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment 
	Here are five of the 13 stocks that qualified the screening General Mills  Inc   NYSE        Based in Minneapolis  MN  General Mills is a global manufacturer and marketer of branded consumer foods sold through retail stores  The company also serves the foodservice and baking industries  This Zacks Rank  2 stock has a decent long term earnings growth expectation of 8 2  and a modest trailing four quarter average earnings surprise of 4 4  Texas Instruments Incorporated  NASDAQ        Headquartered in Dallas  TX  Texas Instruments is an original equipment manufacturer of analog  mixed signal and digital signal processing integrated circuits  This Zacks Rank  2 stock has a decent trailing four quarter average earnings surprise of 5 7  and long term earnings growth projection of 9 6  Braskem S A   NYSE        Braskem is the leading thermoplastic resins  polyethylene  polypropylene and PVC  producer in the Americas and the largest producer of polypropylene in the U S  This Zacks Rank  1 stock has a trailing four quarter average earnings surprise of 107 8   You can see     General Motors Company  NYSE        Detroit  MI based General Motors is a leading global automotive manufacturer  The company filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the U S  Bankruptcy Code on Jun 1  2009  Pursuant to this  the New GM was formed by acquiring most of the assets and assuming certain liabilities of the Old GM as well as some of its direct and indirect subsidiaries  The company has a trailing four quarter average earnings surprise of 19 7  and long term earnings growth expectation of 8 9   General Motors carries a Zacks Rank  2 Celanese Corporation  NYSE        TX based Celanese is a global hybrid chemical company that produces chemical substances and materials  This Zacks Rank  2 stock has a trailing four quarter average earnings surprise of 7 1  and long term earnings growth projection of 8 8

Analyst Reports for AT T  Pfizer and General Mills

	Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including AT T  NYSE      General Mills  NYSE     and Pfizer  NYSE      

AT T is in the headlines because of the Time Warner  NYSE      deal  which will likely get plenty of regulatory scrutiny  The stock had lost ground prior to the deal announcement as the market s earlier affinity big dividend paying telecom stocks had cooled off to some extent  That said  it is still up more than 7  year to date  doing better than both Verizon as well as the broader S P 500 index  AT T s Q3 results were mixed  though the strategic rationale for the Time Warner deal is compelling   You can 

General Mills shares have not been doing too well lately  likely reflecting weakness in the company s U S  Retail segment as a result of lower demand amid changing consumer food preferences  But the analyst likes its robust restructuring savings  which are making up for the slower revenue growth  Though consumer focused innovation and marketing drive as well as greater distribution of natural and organic portfolio helped improve the top line on many businesses in segments like cereals and snacks in fiscal 2016  a material improvement may take time   You can  

Pfizer shares have lagged the market this year  in line with the broader the pharmaceutical space  on concerns about the group s pricing power in the current political environment  These issues notwithstanding  the analyst likes Pfizer s strategy of strengthening its product portfolio and pipeline through acquisitions and licensing deals  The 2015 Hospira acquisition has significantly expanded Pfizer s sterile injectable and biosimilar capabilities  However  headwinds remain in the form of genericization and the expiration of a few co promotion agreements which will continue to hamper top line growth  Estimate movement has been mixed lately ahead of the company s Q3 earnings release   You can

164368,385884,GIS,A Must Own Stock Ahead Of Election Day,opinion,"Oh boy    here we go  It s election week 
It feels like our wedding day all over again  We spent the last year hoping it would get here fast    but now that we re about to make the big commitment  we re nervous as hell 
What the next few days holds for our grand union  nobody knows  It s an idea that has markets on edge 
Throughout the last five days  the go to gauge for volatility   the VIX   made a steady march higher  In a whopper of a week  it surged by more than 50  
Clearly  investors aren t too excited about what could happen on Tuesday night 
It s why I want to tell you about a type of stock you must own as risk runs higher  I call them HERO stocks 
Or to be a whole lot clearer  they are stocks that boast High Earnings and Reliable Outcomes 
You ll have the chance to learn about four must own HERO stocks below 
I ve written about these   Often  these are the kinds of stocks you ve never heard of  Like most heroes  they do their best to stay out of the headlines  But they do their job of creating outsized wealth reliably and honestly 
You can invest in HERO stocks and trust your money will grow    most often  far outpacing the headline driving fad stocks 
The last HERO stock we looked at was General Mills  NYSE  NYSE GIS    a stock that s more than doubled the results of the S P 500 over the last decade   with far less volatility 
American Water Works  NYSE AWK  is perhaps even more conservative    and yet its performance has been even stronger  So far this year  it s up 20  versus a virtually flat market  And during its publicly traded existence  it has outpaced the S P 500 by more than 4 to 1 

It s not hard to understand why American Water Works is a go to stock in a high risk market  It s all in the name  The company offers the ultimate recession proof product    water 
As a provider of public water  the company sells a product nobody can live without  and it has a monopoly nearly everywhere it works  No matter what happens to your job or your portfolio   and no matter how bleak the election outcome on Tuesday   you re going to pay your water bill next month 
One of the key metrics for a HERO stock is beta  Think of this figure as a correlation to the overall market  A stock that boasts a beta of 1 0 has a perfect tie to the S P 500  If the index moves higher by 1   the stock moves higher by 1  
A beta of zero means there s no correlation  While a beta of  1 0 tells us of an inverse correlation   if the market moves up by 1   our stock moves down 1  
Simple 
American Water Works has a beta of just 0 23  In other words  its share price doesn t care much about what the broad markets are doing  It seems to keep rising and rising regardless of the headline du jour 
And in the rare instances where this ultra reliable stock isn t rising  investors can count on its rising dividend  Since 2008  the annual payout has risen every year   adding an overall increase of up to 70  in less than a decade 
Today  the stock yields 2 08   That s a nice yield considering American Water Works acts more like a growth stock than a value play 
But it s that low beta that makes the company quite attractive these days  With so much political and monetary uncertainty  it d be nice to know you have a HERO stock in your portfolio that s ultrareliable and won t succumb to market volatility ",2016-11-07,Investment U,https://www.investing.com/analysis/a-must-own-stock-ahead-of-election-day-200163054,200163054

In the hourly chart we can see two opposing  relevant trends  whereby the small trend is facing downwards and the two large ones are running upwards  As expected  the gap from last Friday was closed in the course of an expansion of the correction  Following this  an apparent new movement in a downwards direction started up  However  as long as the closing price does not surpass the red box  this trend will remain intact and can then continue on at any time  In terms of the superior green trend  however  this all remains simply a correction  
  169 Dow Jones    
From the perspective of the hourly chart  this index is in a large downward trend  The current correction zone runs between 18311 and 18554 points on the upper side  After the last course low at 17822 points  the price attempted to stretch the correction out into the red box  however  it got stuck shortly before it  As so often happens when the correction remains floating in mid air  a trend continuation did not occur on the lower side  Since then  the price has been running sideways  It is possible that the FED meeting will bring the decisive change of direction

164417,385933,GIS,5 Things To Watch When General Mills Reports On Wednesday,opinion,"by Clement Thibault
General Mills  NYSE GIS   the U S  based manufacturer of branded consumer staples  reports Q1  17 earnings on Wednesday  September 21  before the market opens 

1  Earnings and Revenue Forecast
General Mills is expected to report earnings of  0 76 per share  along with revenues of  3 9 billion  If it meets these expectations  its EPS will have decline 3 8  year over year  with an even more substantial drop of 7  in revenue  It s also worth noting that General Mills  revenue has fallen during each of the past four quarters 

2  Big Stock Price Moves
The past three months have been surprisingly volatile for General Mills  share price  The company last reported earnings on June 29th  beating expectations by 10   This propelled the stock upward  from  66 pre report to an all time high of  72 95 on July 6th  On September 7th  the stock began to fall when the company reaffirmed that they expected to see flat sales growth at best for fiscal 2017  Eventually the share price returned to its pre report level  around  66  where it s been hovering ever since 
Of note about the stock price  while the last earnings report did beat lowly expectations  net sales were down 7  year over year  and the  0 63 EPS reported was a mild decline from previous years  it stood at  0 66 in 2014  2015 has incomparable numbers   Additionally  the guidance reaffirmed on September 7th  the day of the decline  was already known months before the market reacted 

3  Sales by Category
It s clear that General Mills  sales are declining  but a deeper dive into its individual lines of business helps to better understand what GIS needs to do in order to right the ship  Seven corporate segments each contribute more than 10  to the company s total sales number  The biggest segment   Snacks  which includes brands such as Nature Valley and Fiber One brought in  3 3 billion in FY2016  and accounted for 20  of revenues  It has declined about 3  from FY2015 
 Meals  including Annie s and Betty Crocker follows with  2 7 billion  or 17  of total revenue  Sales fell just a few million dollars in this category  but for the second year in a row 
The company s other segments are  Yogurt  dominated by Yoplait   Cereals  which includes blockbuster Cheerios   Baking Products  which produces Pillsbury  Betty Crocker and Bisquick products   Frozen Foods  Haagen Dazs is the dominant name here  and  Small Planet  aka Organic  Foods   One could list returns from each of the remaining segments in greater detail  but the point is simple  Every major segment in General Mills portfolio declined in 2016  Worse still  every segment except  Snacks  declined for the second consecutive year in a row 
Right now customers are looking for what they perceive to be healthier choices on their supermarket shelves  For example  Greek yogurts in lieu of GIS s more sugary Yoplait  an area where rival Danone s  PA DANO  Oikos brand has the upper hand  Indeed  General Mills is currently a minor competitor in the  healthy  market arena 

4  2017 Fiscal Year Expectations
Tomorrow s report marks the first quarter of 2017 for General Mills  fiscal calendar  The company has already announced a few targets they wish to hit in the coming year  Primarily  it expects currency neutral EPS growth of 6  8  with margin growth of 1 5  on its current 16  margins  The company generates a little over 70  of its revenue in the U S   so it is less affected by foreign exchange than some of its multinational peers such as Nestle  SIX NESN  and Danone  The bad news  the company s guidance for global net sales is for flat to  2  growth  meaning potentially a third straight year of declining sales overall 
Conclusion
All of this is not to say that General Mills is a bad company  or one that it s headed for major problems  The company is solid  with strong brand recognition from consumers for such marquee brands as Pillsbury  Cheerios  and Yoplait  Its sales should remain fairly consistent over the next twelve months  because customers tend to be creatures of habits  loyal to the brands they know   and even love 
GIS s bottom line is expected to improve due to divestitures such as the sale of Green Giant to B G Foods  NYSE BGS  in November 2015  as well as additional cost cutting moves including a 10    300 million decrease in SG A over the past two years and a continuous decline in advertising expenses since 2012  But as always  cost cutting can only benefit a company s bottom line for a short while  Perpetually shrinking sales will inevitably start to take their toll 
On the upside  General Mills offers a nice dividend at  0 48 every quarter  which runs to  1 92 on the year  for a yield of almost 3   And consumer staples companies are generally considered relatively safe havens during times of economic uncertainty given that consumers will always need their products  But even if you re interested in GIS only for the dividend  the company s P E ratio of nearly 24 for a company whose steady bottom line growth stopped in 2011 and has been choppy since should worry you  At least right now 
We believe General Mills will provide a better entry point in the coming year as the stock price settles  Wait until it reaches the mid  50 s before opening a position in the stock ",2016-09-20,Clement Thibault/Investing.com ,https://www.investing.com/analysis/5-things-to-watch-when-general-mills-reports-on-wednesday-200154204,200154204

164473,385989,GIS,Will General Mills  GIS  Beat Q4 Earnings On Improved Sales ,opinion,"General Mills Inc    NYSE GIS   is set to report fourth quarter and fiscal 2016 results on June 29  before the market opens  Last quarter  the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 4 84  
Despite soft sales figures  the branded consumer foods company delivered positive earnings surprises in three of the past four quarters with an average surprise of 6 24  
Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement GENL MILLS Price and EPS Surprise
   Factors to Consider
Sales and profits in General Mills  U S  Retail segment have been soft due to lower demand amid changing consumer food preferences  In fiscal 2016  increased competitive activity in Yogurt and reduced display and merchandizing levels hurt results in the segment  To cater to the evolving consumer tastes  the company is investing in consumer focused innovation and marketing along with the accelerating distribution of its natural and organic brands in fiscal 2016 
Management s renovation and innovation efforts with a higher level of advertising is expected to lead to better organic  excluding currency headwinds and the Green Giant divesture  sales trends in the U S  Retail segment in the fourth quarter  largely in cereals and snacks  Organically  sales growth is expected to turn positive in the fourth quarter  rising in a low single digit range 
General Mills divested its Green Giant and Le Sueur brands of frozen and shelf stable vegetables to food manufacturer  B G Foods  Inc    NYSE BGS    in November last year 
However  like the third quarter  net sales  segment operating profit and adjusted earnings are expected to decline in the fourth quarter due to the Green Giant divesture  currency headwinds and difficult year over year comparisons  The year ago comparable quarter gained from an extra week 
Adjusted gross margins are expected to decline year over year in the fourth quarter  reflecting the highest quarterly input cost inflation rate  Media expenses are expected to rise in a double digit range  excluding currency impact which will hurt operating profits 
Nonetheless  significant restructuring savings will provide bottom line support like the previous quarters  General Mills is currently pursuing many multi year restructuring initiatives to improve operational efficiency  generate cost savings and support key growth strategies 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that General Mills is likely to beat earnings this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here  as you will see below 
Zacks ESP   The Earnings ESP is 0 0  as both the Most Accurate estimate as well as the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at 60 cents 
Zacks Rank  General Mills  Zacks Rank  2 increases the predictive power of ESP  However  we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings beat 
We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum 
Stocks to Consider
Here are some food stocks that have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank 
The Kraft Heinz Co    NASDAQ KHC    with an Earnings ESP of  2 86  and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold

164476,385992,GIS,Markets Remain Steady,opinion,"As the calendar Q2 winds to a close and we await another earnings season in another couple weeks  though Nike  NYSE NKE     reported yesterday after the bell   more on this below   before the bell this morning we saw a positive read on Personal Income and Spending for the month of May  Personal Income rose 0 2  while Consumer Spending went up 0 4  

Both reads are basically in line with expectations   spending perhaps a bit heavier than anticipated  income a tad light  These also compare with the April numbers of 0 5  in income and 1 1  in spending  Continued  if subdued  strength domestically  keep in mind these reads are on a one month lag 

Futures are up in the U S  markets   Dow  118  Nasdaq  30  S P 500  15   which follow the positive results overseas on Wednesday  The FTSE  DAX and CAC were all up more than another percentage point overnight  as were the Nikkei and Shanghai markets  Gold and silver are up this morning  too  and crude oil on both the WTI and Brent are above  48 per barrel 

The Brexit fallout appears to have been managed uncommonly well to this point  The EU summit in Brussels  Belgium has recently wrapped  with the crux of the various discussions basically how firm the EU will be regarding the Great Britain breakup  and how quickly it will take place  Both European Commission President Jean Claude Juncker and German Chancellor Angela Merkel are pushing to move sooner  and with tough rhetoric regarding what s being termed as  freedom of movement  

Merkel does not want EU rules renegotiated for a new British Prime Minister this September  on the 16th the EU will reconvene without a UK representative   and Juncker has said the EU should accept  no nuances  regarding the breakup  That said  Brexit has thus far been an orderly affair  even the GB pound  which sold off precipitously last Friday  has been trading more or less sideways since then  A near term bottom looks priced into the markets today 

As mentioned earlier  earnings season is right around the corner  We ve gotten a taste of what s to come with Nike and General Mills  NYSE GIS     reporting earnings already  Both companies beat expectations on top and bottom lines  although Nike sold off in late trading yesterday following disappointing guidance     General Mills is trading up  though not yet at highs from earlier this week    ",2016-06-28,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/markets-remain-steady-200138963,200138963

164507,386023,GIS,Tiny Toast To Take General Mills Higher,opinion,"General Mills  NYSE GIS  has been a consumer staple stock for many years  Chugging along  printing profits and increasing dividends  It has been a staple in my house as well due to its Cheerios line of cereals  Straight and Honey Nut for my kids  Recently the company released its first new cereal in 15 years  Tiny Toast comes in many varieties and since the only thing my kids eat for breakfast with their Cheerios is toast  is sure to be a hit 
The stock price is loving it as well  The chart below shows strong move higher off of the low made in February to a peak in early April  Since then it has consolidated in an ascending triangle and finds itself at the top of that triangle Wednesday  A break of the triangle to the upside would give a target of 71  The most powerful moves out of triangles are said to occur about 2 3 of the way through the triangle  as it is now 


There is support for a push higher from both momentum indicators and the Bollinger Bands   The MACD is rising and positive  The Bollinger Bands are opening to the upside  And the RSI  had only a minor pullback in the bullish zone  and is turning back higher  This allowed for a higher low in price  A Measured Move higher from this pivot would give a target to 68 25 
Look for a push to new highs as a buy trigger  then use the prior resistance as a stop  An alternative approach would be to buy it and add a collar in July to protect the downside through earnings June 29th  Buying a July 65 62 5 Put spread and selling an October 70 Call should cost about 20 cents to protect to the bottom of the triangle and still allow 7  upside without adjusting it

164508,386024,GIS,Bull Of The Day B G Foods  BGS  ,opinion,"Food stocks are hot this year as investors like their safety and high dividends in the current uncertain and ultra low rate environment  B G Foods    is a food products company with a huge portfolio of well known brands  They manufacture and market processed and packaged foods across the United States and Canada Solid First Quarter Results and Improved Guidance

	The company reported excellent results for Q1  Gross profit surged 72  to  115 9 million from  67 4 million a year ago  primarily driven by the acquisition of Green Giant brand  The brand was purchased from General Mills  NYSE GIS  in September last year 
	After strong results they also raised their 2016 outlook  They now expected adjusted EPS to be in the range of  2 05 to  2 15  The stock hit its all time high after results Soaring Estimates

	After excellent results and upgraded guidance  analysts have raised estimates for the company  Zacks Consensus Estimates for the current and the next year are now  2 12 per share and  2 24 per share respectively  up from  1 92 and  2 02  before the results 

	The following chart shows earnings and price momentum 
Returning Cash to Shareholders

	The stock has a very juicy dividend yield of 3 75  as of now  Earlier this year they increased their quarterly cash dividend by 20     This was 46th consecutive quarterly dividend since their IPO in October 2004 
The Bottom Line

	The company continues to grow organically and through acquisitions  In the past 20 years  they have acquired more than 40 brands  They have an excellent record of  such heritage brands after acquiring them 
	In addition to a top Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   the stock enjoys the Zacks Industry Rank of 44 out of 265  top 17   and the Style Score of  A  for Growth 
	While shares are definitely not cheap after the recent run up  the company has a much higher growth potential compared to most peers  Further  in the current uncertain environment  it makes sense to increase portfolio allocation to defensive industries like food  And with interest rates expected to stay lower for longer  stocks with attractive dividends will likely remain in favor

164540,386056,GIS,Four Defensive Stocks To Buy Now,opinion,"Over the last month  the market has seen a myriad of ups and downs   When you look a little closer  you will find that there have been more downs than ups   I see a few other indicators pointing to lower stock prices  so let s look at a few defensive style names that carry a high Zacks Rank 

To increase our odds of success  I am picking these Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and Zacks Rank  2  Buy  stocks from a screen that looks for increasing price and increasing volume   This is one of my favorite trading screens to look at as it shows me stocks that investors have been bidding up and have improving fundamentals  in the form of higher earnings estimates  

People Have To Eat

There are 5 food stocks that showed up on the screen  but I am only going to point out the two that are Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  

B G Foods  BGS  is a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and is coming off a very solid earnings report in late April  The company topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 51 by  0 14 for a 27  positive earnings surprise  Wall Street liked the numbers and sent the stock higher by 22  in the session following the release  Management pointed to the solid performance of Green Giant  a unit that was purchased from General Mills  NYSE GIS  for  765 million in September of last year 

Fresh Del Monte  FDP  is also a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and is coming off a titanic beat of the Zacks Consensus Estimate   The company reported EPS of  1 57 when the Zacks Consensus Estimate was calling for  0 83  That translates into a  0 74 beat and an 89  positive earnings surprise  The stock advanced approximately 8 5  in the session following the release 

Both food stocks are considered defensive in nature  but the recent earnings beats make the story that much sweeter   A quick look at the charts for both stocks shows the trend of increasing price and volume and that alone should get you interested in these Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  stocks 

Shocking Pick

I tend to focus on aggressive growth stocks  but this article is focused on picking defensive style names  Along with the food names  a sector should pop into your head when speaking about defensive investing is Utilities 

Avangrid  AGR  is a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  stock that is coming off a solid beat of the Zacks Consensus Estimate   The company reported a  0 04 beat for a 6 8  positive earnings surprise near the end of April 

The company operates eight electric and natural gas utilities serving 3 1 million customers in Connecticut  Maine  Massachusetts  and New York 

Man s Best Friend

It might be considered that defensive of a play  but I like the idea of including Petmed Express  PETS  in this list   The basic idea of why this stock is here is that people will gladly go without some discretionary purchases to make sure their pet has proper medication   

I know my dog Buckeye would get his dinner before I would if I were in peril  so I think of this stock as a defensive play  How can you not think this face is adorable 




PETS is also coming off a solid performance in the most recent quarter   The company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate on top and bottom   Revenue of  55M was   6M more than expected for an 11  positive revenue surprise   EPS of  0 27 was  0 03 better than expected for a 12 5  positive earnings surprise

164542,386058,GIS,Has General Mills Stock  GIS  Been Affected By E coli Concerns ,opinion,"General Mills Inc   NYSE GIS  is voluntarily recalling an estimated 10 million pounds of flour over E  coli concerns after customers who used the company s products reported getting sick during the last five months 
General Mills said in a  Tuesday that local and federal authorities have been researching 38 different occurrences across 20 states related to a specific type of E  coli  E  coli O121  between December 21  2015  and May 3  2016  While attempting to track the cause of the illness  the CDC found that approximately half of the individuals reported making  something homemade with flour at some point prior to becoming ill   Of that half  a number of those individuals used General Mills flour 
 As a leading provider of flour for 150 years  we felt it was important to not only recall the product and replace it for consumers if there was any doubt  but also to take this opportunity to remind our consumers how to safely handle flour   said Liz Nordlie  president of General Mills Baking division 
Although most strains of E  coli are harmless  E  coli O121 is a potentially deadly bacterium  Seniors  the very young  and persons with compromised immune systems are the most susceptible to foodborne illness  General Mills has not actually found the E  coli strain in any of its flour products or in the flour manufacturing plant 
The recall covers six types of flour sold under the Gold Medal  Wondra and Signature Kitchen brands  The products carry the following UPC numbers  000 16000 18980  000 16000 10710  000 16000 10610  000 16000 10410  000 16000 19610  000 21130 53001  000 21130 53022 and 000 16000 11710 
Despite this serious E  coli concern  GIS stock has not been affected  Shares of General Mills remained relatively stagnant during Wednesday trading and as of 1 20 PM ET  the stock is up only 0 11

164565,386081,GIS,This Large Cap Belongs In Your Portfolio,opinion,"I often refer to General Mills  N GIS  as the Grampa stock for two reasons  First  it s one of the large cap  high dividend yield stocks  over 3   old people have been told to put in their portfolio for income  Second  because my own father eats about a box of Cheerios everyday for breakfast 
GIS is not a sexy stock that momentum traders latch on to  It s not one that television commentators like  But it is a stock that has been rising in a strong trend    briefly interrupted in 2009    for more than 15 years  Since the turn of the millennium  the stock has returned 373   not counting dividends 

This is a stock to put away and tell your grand kids about in 25 years  And it is giving you a great look for an entry right now  The chart above shows the last year of that trend higher  It also shows the stock trading in a symmetrical triangle bounded by falling resistance and the rising 200 day SMA  Tuesday s candle is a bullish engulfing Marubozu  which bodes well for more upside    the only place to go is up through the triangle 
A break of that triangle targets a move to 64  This pattern tends to give the best result when the break is about 2 3 of the way into the apex  just like it is now  The momentum indicators are both positive supporting the upside push  The RSI is moving into the bullish zone over 60 and the MACD is positive and rising  All it needs now is to break the triangle ",2015-12-08,Gregory W.

Weekly 100SMA  Simple Moving Average  is a predominant supporter of the bulls as you can see in the chart below 
Since 2010 it has been acting providing as strong support levels protecting the buyers  this is how you understand the probability of the potential outcome  As long as the primary term uptrend is perceived as  valid   the trend is assumed to be in effect until it gives us a clear signal that it has been  reversed  
Despite the fact that the overall market has been very shaky last several month  General Mills  NYSE GIS  truly stood it s ground and held up above the weekly 100SMA support level 
As long as we stay above the weekly 100SMA  I would have to assume that the primary term uptrend will continue  along with it s minor to intermediate term ups and downs   

Minor Term  Overbought

Quite a nice trade setup really  with a readily definable risk reward to it  Obviously  this isn t a trade that is going to sky rocket overnight for you  but it has held steady of late  and with a market that is seeing some head winds as well  that is really what you want here 
Use a stop loss of less than  60 for the trade  as a break below that price level would in essence establish a lower low on the stock  and there is no reason to be long when that happens  Furthermore  you have the potential to see this stock hit around  65 if not more  If that happens  you are getting about a 2 to 1 reward to risk return on the trade

General Mills in currently in the middle of a global restructuring where management intend on laying off between 675 725 employees by May 2017  The restructuring has been designed to strip costs in an attempt to boost earnings  As an immediate result of the changes  General Mills is expected to take a hit to the value of approximately  62M caused mainly by the requirement to pay termination benefits  The benefits derived from the restructuring is expected to be between  45M  50M in cost savings per annum 
General Mills is facing similar challenges to those of other companies such as ConAgra  NYSE CAG  due to its product mix  As consumers continue to move toward healthier products  demand for General Mills products including Cheerios and Betty Crocker cake mix is waning  This is reflected in the company s diminishing sales growth rate  as demonstrated below 

Historically General Mills has returned solid income to investors through dividends  General Mills consistently pays a substantial portion of its cash profits in dividends  The chart below represents the stocks dividend yield over time  Currently  General Mills is trading at the mid point of its range bound trading activity 

The benefits as a result of the restructuring are material and will almost certainly have a positive impact on General Mills EPS in the medium term  However  concerns surrounding General Mills ability to produce long term revenue growth as changing tastes and smaller competitors increase competition still persist  The outlook from management and the growth strategy outlined in tomorrow s report will be crucial ",2015-07-01,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/does-general-mills-have-a-weight-problem-here-is-what-to-expect-256810,256810
164605,386121,GIS,How Much Spending Would Generate Inflation ,opinion,"I d like to make the disclaimer that this post is not prescriptive of what should be done for the economy  it s only a rough estimate of where an  inflation boundary   an amount of spending needed to generate real inflation  might be  Based on past experience  we do know that government spending can create inflation  we just don t know how much is necessary  We may have already passed the necessary level  or it may require significantly more  This is an analysis simply to help understand how much spending it took in one historical instance to break the inflation boundary 
The American experience during World War II suggests that the threshold to generate inflation could be much higher than anyone expects 
Even though the Roosevelt administration followed many of the same tactics that we have used today to fight depression era deflation  the administration could not generate inflation  During the 1930s the Fed devalued the currency and the government ran huge deficits  Academics and capitalists warned that the policies would lead to massive inflation  yet inflation did not materialize until World War II 
The amount of spending that it ultimately took to generate this inflation is truly staggering  US defense spending began to rise significantly in 1939  after Hitler grabbed the rest of Czechoslovakia  and then took another step up in 1940  after the low lying countries and France fell to the Nazis  and finally took its last leap in 1942 after Pearl Harbor  During those years  federal government expenditures ballooned from  9 billion to  78 billion and finally topped out at  91 B  By the time spending got to  35 B in 1941  fiscal 1942  government spending represented more than 1 3 of pre war GDP  By 1942 it was almost 3 4 of what the entire economy produced before the war 
These numbers are so large as to almost be unfathomable  The government effectively took control of the economy  Strict production limits were implemented and the entire economy shifted to war production  For example  no automobiles were made after 1941  alcohol production stopped  General Mills  NYSE GIS  started making war goods  GDP overall did more than double  so government spending only ended up being  40  of contemporaneous GDP  but consumer goods production fell  Consumers experienced shortages similar to a depression in gasoline  radios  refrigerators  silk stockings and other goods  Workers earned higher incomes from military spending  but had fewer consumer goods to spend it on  This sort of drastic action  necessary to win the war  did generate inflation though  More money was chasing fewer goods 
Inflation really started to become a concern in 1941 and strict price controls were finally implemented in 1942  meaning that inflation did not really start to become meaningful until government spending was somewhere between 30 75  of peacetime economic capacity 
In today s world  if the government were to spend 30  of peacetime GDP  that would imply a Federal budget of   5 trillion  compared to today s  3 5 trillion  At the 75  level  it would imply a budget of  13 trillion  If that s the spending that it would take to generate inflation that implies extra spending of between  100  800 billion per month  or a lot more QE ",2015-03-16,Scott Krisiloff,https://www.investing.com/analysis/how-much-spending-would-generate-inflation-245189,245189
164606,386122,GIS,Hungry For A Trade In General Mills,opinion,"I have joked over the years about the cornerstone of the  old man  portfolio  General Mills  NYSE GIS   For those of you new to my writing  my dad eats about a half a box of Cheerios every morning and has done so for years  My mom buys it for him a case at a time from the grocery store  He is ok with my calling him an old man now that I am getting mailings from AARP as well  This is where the term  old man  stock comes from  Well  that is only partially true  It also comes from the high yield dividend that tends to attract income investors  another word for old people  
But General Mills has made a few changes recently  trying to lower the average age of their product users perhaps  They bought Annie s  you know them  cheddar bunnies  and fruit bite snacks that resemble gummy bears  So maybe it is ok for younger investors to buy this stock as well now  They kind of look alike don t they 

The chart is really all that matters to me when assessing a trading opportunity  When I look at the chart of General Mills on a short term basis I see a bull flag  After a move out of the consolidation over December and the first quarter of 2015  General Mills has consolidated again  This pattern would target a move to 60 should it break to the upside  And that 7  upside is what makes it attractive for a trade  But even if it does not move higher immediately  but rather retraces to the 52 level  there is that 3 1  dividend  This is what makes it interesting possibly for a longer hold 
So how do you develop a strategy to deal with this  lets build into it  First there is the original opportunity  To capture that and retain access to a longer term dividend look to buy the stock on a break of the flag higher  To cover the potential for a move lower  then add a June 55 52 5 Put Spread  This protects some of the downside but at a cost  So to lower that cost also sell a July 60 Covered Call  The combination of these options is called a collar  and should cost about 10 cents

164654,386170,GIS,A Solid Dividend Growth Pick For The Dividend Yield Passive Income Portf,opinion,Last Friday  on February 01  I purchased 30 shares of General Mills  GIS  for my Dividend Yield Passive Income Portfolio  DYPI   The company manufactures and markets branded consumer foods worldwide  GIS also supplies branded and unbranded food products to the foodservice and commercial baking industries   General Mills has managed to raise dividends over a period of 9 consecutive years and is a Dividend Challenger on the edge to become a    The full DYPI Portfolio has now 18 members with a total cost of  24 984 45  Stocks from the portfolio are up 4 09 percent since October 05  2012   The date of funding  Total capital gain amounts to  1 021 30   As a result   75 147 55 of cash is still available for further stock purchases  With this money I plan to increase the total number of stock holdings to a figure of 50 70 by the end of the year 2013 Income is king for the asset allocation  The current estimated portfolio income after the General Mills buy amounts to  963 04  If I complete the acquisition process  the total dividend portfolio income should grow to a value of  3 000    4 000 per year For the time being  it seems that it s getting harder to find cheap higher yielding stocks with solid growth perspectives  The market is hot and asset prices too  It could be possible that I need to look at stocks with a yield around the 2  mark The DYPI Portfolio has a current yield of 3 66  and the yield on cost is slightly higher because of the capital gains   The amount is 3 82   With growing stock holdings  the average yield should decrease to a value of around 3  Friday s pick of General Mills is not a cheap solution  The company has a P E of 15 55 and forward P E is expected at 14 53  A solid growth of 8 21  is estimated for the next year with a slightly lower mid term forecast for the next five years  7 98   However  price ratios are ok for a high quality dividend growth stock  The only problem could be the low international diversification as well as the high debt amount  GIS generates only 17 percent of its revenue abroad  That s too low in a world were China is the only growth solution for many companies  The market position within the United States is solid  Because of the high debt of  5 5 billion at  1 5 billion net income  the company must act careful when it wants to be consolidation winner The current portfolio performance is good but compared to the return of the whole market  it s a clear underperformance because the Dow Jones is up 5 12  and the S P 500 gained 5 61   What the heck   There are worse happenings The approach of the DYPI Portfolio is not to show you how to get quick rich or to show how you can make fast money by trading stocks  There are so many other tools to realize a quick return  But those tools are also more risky and you need to take a steady look at your prices and assets  With a passive income portfolio  you can place your money into solid dividend growth stocks and participate on the long term business success  It s a strategy with an investment horizon of at least 10 years or more I personally invested money into dividend stocks and other assets for more than 10 years and my annualized return is on average in a double digit range Dividend growth will not make you quick rich but it could hedge your assets against inflation and provide you a good return of at least 8   All you need is a wise investment strategy and a long investment horizon Here is the portfolio ,2013-02-04,Dividend Yield,https://www.investing.com/analysis/a-solid-dividend-growth-pick-for-the-dividend-yield-passive-income-portf-153724,153724
164655,386171,GIS,David Eifrig  Does Your Retirement Plan Have Staying Power  ,opinion,What is the best way to juice up your portfolio for a rich retirement  Natural gas and uranium are here to stay  says Stansberry Research s resident medical doctor and retirement investment guru  David Eifrig  In his interview with The Energy Report  Eifrig shares tips to maintain your financial health but get plenty of rest and exercise so you can enjoy those golden years The Energy Report  David  you ve had successful careers on Wall Street and in the medical profession  Why are you now focused on helping people to prepare for retirement  David Eifrig  The vocation to help others came out of my natural aversion to authority  I don t really like institutions  At heart  I am an anarchist  a Libertarian  a freedom lover  This mindset inspires me to teach people about how to live self sufficiently  I m naturally enthusiastic about combining the important issues of finance and personal health  so I thought  why not share my insights with others  I am a lifelong bargain hunter  And I am evidence based when it comes to evaluating both medical and financial issues  Porter Stansberry heard about my background in biotechnology  medicine and finance  And he convinced me that reaching out in a newsletter is a more effective way of communicating than seeing one person at a time in a clinic  The Retirement Millionaire combines all of my knowledge and various interests about retirement  TER  You ve written that we re entering a new stage of profitability for investing in stocks  Please explain how economic indicators support this prediction  DE  One of the main economic indicators of economic resurgence is the cheapness of bank financing  Interest rates between the banks the Fed funds rate is super duper low  Banks access funds at cheap rates and pay savers next to nothing  Banks charge 6 7  for loans and the interest rate spreads make them rich  As the banks do more lending  the loans generate more business activity  and that means more money flows into the economy at all levels  TER  Do you think there s any danger of excess inventory in energy commodities  DE  I recently published a chart showing that crude oil inventories in the U S  are at record highs  But I do not see that phenomenon as creating excess inventory  We are emerging from economic winter  People are starting to fly more and drive more and use more energy  Chinese and European consumers are slowly coming out of hibernation  too  I am not saying that energy demand is going to go crazy  but there are positive signs of pickup  Energy supplies are building up  in part  because we have made huge technological advances  We suck gas  gas liquids and oil out of the ground more than ever  cheapening it  And energy use correlates nicely with cheaper energy as well as with economic growth  U S   manufacturers are talking about building new plants for the first time in twenty years  TER  Stansberry Research recommends several strong buys in energy stocks  Can you talk about why these investments are good candidates for a retirement portfolio  DE  For retirement capital allocation  I like Exxon Mobil Corp   XOM NYSE   which is a classic leader in the oil and gas industry  as are Chevron Corp   CVX NYSE   Royal Dutch Shell Plc  RDS A NYSE  RDS B NYSE  and Occidental Petroleum Corp   OXY NYSE   For decades  these companies have seen business cycles come and go  they have seen political unrest in countries that they do business in  They will keep grinding away  doing business and making returns on their capital  and supporting a nominal amount of income through dividends  It just makes sense to be there with them in the long term  Particularly  if one is worried about the ecological side that the industry could cut back on fracking then it makes sense to be in companies that are stable  TER  Do you think fracking is in danger of being downsized in the U S   DE  The only good science that I ve seen on that issue concerns the risk of earthquakes  Companies will want to be more careful around fault lines  but that will not stop fracking  TER  Is the U S  poised to become a major gas exporter to the international energy market  DE  My understanding is that natural gas will increasingly be exported as liquefied natural gas  LNG   The international spreads on liquid gas are incredible  It sells for about  17 per million British thermal units   17 MMBtu  worldwide  and about  4 MMBtu in the U S  For example  a gas company called Cheniere Energy Inc   LNG NYSE MKT  is transforming itself from a gas importer to a gas exporter by reversing the direction of flow in pipes connected to the export terminals  It s waiting on governmental permits to commence operations  There is a similar effort being made to do the same thing with crude oil  TER  How do the junior energy explorers stack up against the large cap companies  DE  When the Keystone pipeline and other pipelines from oil producing regions are in place  the stuff is going to remain relatively cheap  Of course  if it gets too cheap  the companies will close down their wells  because they won t be able to make a profit  But then  with reduced supply  the prices will start going back up  and the companies will put the wells back online  There is plenty of breathing space in this cycle for the juniors  TER  In a retirement portfolio  what is a reasonable balance between holding large cap and small cap energy stocks  DE  With 20  of a retirement portfolio in the energy sector  it makes sense to hold about 5  in junior energy explorers  and the rest in the larger caps  both domestic and international  With 5  in the juniors  I suggest holding two or three positions  unless one is confident enough to bet it all on one stock  TER  What s the best way to hedge against inflation in a retirement portfolio  DE  Sticking with the energy theme  If price inflation rises  the large caps will feel the pressure  because they are close to the consumer level  Vertical integration from drill head to retail pump is an important way to reduce the impact of inflation and keep margins sound  As an inflation hedge  Stansberry likes TIPS  Treasury Inflation Protection Securities   TIPS are priced off the government s Consumer Price Index  CPI   Some people don t believe that the CPI numbers are exact or worthwhile  but I find them to be useful economic indicators  It all depends on the individual investor s level of comfort with fixed income  bond yields and wherever securities are at in a given moment  As interest rates start to climb  it makes sense to buy floating rate income funds the short term loans that banks and companies make to institutions  They deliver a little bit of increased interest  The question really is  of course  where do you think price inflation is going to set in  If it s going to happen on the food front  then you can buy integrated food companies  such as General Mills or Tyson Chicken  corporations with pricing power  Similarly  a company like McDonald s  which is close to the consumer  can keep up with inflation through pricing  Technology tends to not be a very good investment sector in inflationary times because its pricing power is based on who has created the hottest new thing  And if your product is not the latest  greatest and hottest  forget it  TER  Will energy prices maintain at current low levels  or is inflation going to hit  DE  There will not be much inflation in the energy sector  because the supply and infrastructure are firmly in place  Look at Pennsylvania  where companies capped producing wells because the price of natural gas dropped to  2 Mcf  Then  it shot back up to  4  If a company can cap a well and then uncap it and make a profit at  3 4  swell  There is going to be a lot of supply emerging if gas goes to  5 6  and then that will drive the cost down again  and the cycle will repeat  U S  railroads are talking about converting train engines to natural gas  Wal Mart is converting its trucks to natural gas  These engines are going off conventional fuel oil because natural gas is really  really cheap  I do not feel like there s going to be runaway inflation on the energy front  because the iron law of supply and demand fluctuates around a market balance  TER  Is there room for alternative energy investments in a retirement portfolio  DE  Without heavy government subsidies  the alternatives do not work  The conversion of sunlight to electricity is expensive  the places where it s really windy are usually far away from where most people live  so it is not cost efficient to transmit that energy  The maintenance cost for alternative energy infrastructure is also very expensive  TER  The price of the solar technology has been plummeting  yet many solar firms are going bankrupt  Why  DE  No one is buying solar because it doesn t work that cheaply so those firms go bankrupt  That s the nature of capitalism  Of course  one hears stories about people buying solar chips or panels really  really cheaply  and throwing them on their house  or buying them from Wal Mart because they ve been dumped on the market by a Chinese company  People are jerry rigging them on top of their houses and trying to make solar financially viable  But on a large scale commercial level  the payback on solar is a long time  especially considering how thirsty Americans are for instant gratification  TER  Do you think fossil fuels are here to stay  DE  Fossil fuels are here to stay  absolutely  In practical terms  there is an almost unlimited supply  Saudi Arabia and the Middle East have not started fracking yet  so  think of the amount of stuff they will pull out of the ground when they start fracking  There are plenty of conventional fossil fuels  And  of course  there is uranium for nuclear energy  If you want to make everyone happy  don t build a nuclear power plant on the edge of the ocean in a fault zone  But  if you build nuclear power plants safely  as the Chinese are doing  then we will enjoy very cheap  very safe  and very clean energy for a long  long time  TER  As a medical doctor  do you have a position on radiation fears  DE  The fears are overblown  Obviously  you do not want to live near or downwind of a nuclear power plant  We are close to developing technology and drugs to protect people after radiation poisoning  They are probably just three or four years away  so that will be exciting  TER  Do you have any personal healthcare strategies that enable people to live long enough to enjoy a happy retirement  DE  It goes without saying your mama used to tell you this  your daddy used to tell you  too  Make sure you get sleep  Sleep is one of the most important things a person can do for health  I talk to people all the time who say  oh  I can t sleep  and you ask them about  sleep hygiene  and the room they sleep in has the TV on  the iPad  the phone  lights streaming from the streetlamp  or the door is open to hear if the baby wakes up in the middle of the night  Stuff like that really affects your sleep  Turn the lights off  get the room as dark as you can  Lack of sleep and heart disease are related  Walking 18 20 minutes a day sounds simple  it sounds easy  but a lot of people don t even do that  If you can t get out for a walk  do what I do  Throw down a big beach towel on the floor and stretch for 15 20 minutes  Exercise affects the joints and the body and secretes chemicals that keep your immune system strong  So those are the two most important items  sleep and movement  And have a happy retirement  TER  Thanks for the advice  Doc  DE  You are welcome   holds an MBA from Kellogg and has worked in arbitrage and trading groups with major Wall Street investment banks  Goldman Sachs   In 1995  he retired from the  Street   went to UNC Chapel Hill for medical school  and became an

164690,386206,GIS,Get Ready For Food Crisis  Part II,opinion,If the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results  then Congress and the Administration must both be stark raving mad  It was just four years ago that the world found itself facing a food crisis  If you are reading this article  you may very well not remember the food crisis of 2007 2008  By virtue of being a MarketWatch reader  chances are very good that your income was sufficient to cover rising food costs without making any major lifestyle adjustments  But in many poorer countries  the spikes in the cost of basic food staples were enough to cause riots and social unrest  not to mention hardship and misery on those struggling to put bread on the tables  Readers may recall the infamous  Tortilla Riots  in Mexico City  which brought more the 70 000 people to the streets  The causes of the food crisis were varied  Weather conditions were a factor  And taking a long term macro view  rising incomes in China and other developing countries have led to higher protein diets  i e  more meat   which in turn means more demand for grains to be used for animal feed  This is certainly a trend that no one would want to stop  Chinese diners deserve to eat steak too  after all  But then as now  one of the drivers of high food prices was government policy and specifically the U S  corn based ethanol program  The United States is the biggest producer and exporter of corn in the world  and roughly 40  of the crop is used to make ethanol for American cars  At a time of rising food prices  this is madness  The price of corn recently hit an all time high and at time of writing is up 57  over the past month  As corn prices rise  so do the prices of substitutes  wheat  soybeans and most other staple crops have seen large price spikes  Every kernel of corn used to make fuel is a kernel of corn that can t be ground into tortillas or used as feed for a cow   You ll have to excuse me  I m from Texas and had beef fajitas for lunch   And while it may sound like I m making light of it  it is anything if not serious  The United Nations considered it important enough to request that the Obama Administration to cease all government mandated ethanol production  following similar pleas from the G20  China  India and France  This puts the Administration and Congress in a bad place  Do they abandon their environmental goals of producing green energy and also risk causes prices to rise at the pump   Biofuels account for roughly 5  of U S  oil consumption according to   or an amount roughly equivalent to the annual production of Libya or Algeria   Or do they risk causing mass suffering among the world s poorest citizens  These are broad moral and political questions  but as investors  our concerns are far more specific  What are our risks during a food crisis  and how do we position our portfolios  I see no obvious buys today  The would be obvious move to trade corn futures is not one I would recommend to an individual investor  The volatility is unacceptably high  Food stocks companies like General Mills  GIS  and Kellogg  K  might eventually be good contrarian bets  though I would hesitate to buy them just yet  Their margins are sure to be crimped in the short term  which will force them to raise prices  But once their input costs start to fall again  say  following a reversal of U S  ethanol policy  they are less likely to lower their prices  This could mean a nice boost to margins  say  a year from now  As for risks  my fear is that rising food prices will put a brake on what I consider to be the most important trend of the next decade  the rise of the new emerging market middle class  The opportunities I see in up and coming markets such as Africa could easily evaporate if spending on basic necessities crowds out discretionary spending  For now  I remain an emerging markets bull  But Food Crisis Part II is something that has my attention  If we see a return of the social unrest and instability we saw four years ago  it might make sense to reevaluate some of your more speculative emerging market positions  Disclosures  Charles Sizemore has no position in the stocks mentioned  This article first appeared on  ,2012-08-23,Charles Sizemore,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/get-ready-for-food-crisis,-part-ii-133922",133922

164719,386235,GIS,A Quick Intro to Commodity Futures Markets,opinion, Sugar  Soybeans  OJ and Coffee   That s not a secret formula to provide energy throughout the day  or the answer to a recent Jeopardy question   I am referring to just a few of the commodities that have been traded for years on exchanges such as the Chicago Board of Trade  CBOT   Chicago Mercantile Exchange  CME   and New York Mercantile Exchange  NYMEX   The CBOT and CME have since merged  and although the original  pit trading  open outcry method dominated for decades  close to 70  of all CME trading now takes place electronically  This trend continues to rise  and I foresee the industry getting to 100  electronic before long  Pit traders and nostalgics may miss the ticket covered trading floors  the brightly colored floor jackets and the hand signals of old  but we re never going back  Enough reminiscing about the past  though  Let s talk more about how futures markets work  Let s quickly cover something for those new to futures  In case you weren t certain   futures trading  and  commodities trading  are basically the same thing  Futures contracts cover the broad range of commodity markets  energy  metals  agriculturals  softs  livestock  though they also cover financial markets as well  indices  currencies  interest rates  single stock futures  A futures contract is simply an agreement to buy or sell at a price set today  for a future delivery date of the commodity in question So if  say  the December corn contract is trading at  5 96 per bushel  and a corn farmer likes that price  he can  lock in   5 96 per bushel nine months early by selling December corn contracts against his crop If the price of corn falls by December  the farmer will get less for his crop in the cash market  but will make an offsetting gain on the futures contracts  If the price of corn rises  the futures contracts will show a loss  but the farmer will gain on the cash side On the other side of the coin  General Mills is a big commercial buyer of oats for its cereal products  So if General Mills likes the price of December oats at  2 95 per bushel  it can buy oat contracts now and  lock in  that  2 95 price before it goes higher  This mitigates the buyers  risk of a big price spike in the cash market due to drought  flood  and so on Either way  futures contracts provide a  hedge  so that producers and commercial end users are not exposed to ruinous price swings  This was  in fact  the original rationale for futures markets  Offering a way for commodity users and producers to transfer their risk to willing speculators  who take on that risk in pursuit of profit What are some reasons to trade futures  Offhand I can think of at least five  Capital efficiency  tax efficiency  diversification  ease of trading long or short  and enhancing skills and performance First  up  capital efficiency The most infamous aspect of futures markets is leverage  While leverage is a two edged sword  one that cuts those who get carried away  the sword has numerous advantages Just as one options contract controls 100 shares of stock at a fraction of the cost of purchasing those shares  a futures contract controls a very large stake in the underlying commodity  The  margin requirement  on a futures contract is actually not even a form of payment  It is just a  good faith deposit  in the event that the position generates losses While there are many commodity based exchange traded funds  ETFs  these days  none of them offer anywhere near the actual leverage embedded in real futures contracts   The ETF currency contracts are the worst  their leverage is so low  the capital efficiency is just terrible  This is deliberate  as the authorities want it harder for Joe Sixpack to find leverage via his stock brokerage account  But the reduced leverage of stocks and ETFs makes it harder to take meaningful trend style positions  a big reason why the original trend followers all made their fortunes in futures markets Next up  tax efficiency Most futures trades are taxed at a more favorable rate than stock trades  Whether you hold a futures trade for two weeks  two months or two minutes  the capital gains will be tallied at 40  short term   60  long term  regardless of holding period Compare this to stock trades which  if they are short term  will be taxed 100  at the punitive short term rate  That kind of tax break can lead to meaningful savings  especially for high volume traders Third  diversification If you are only trading stocks  adding uncorrelated markets and strategies to your portfolio can significantly enhance long term returns  The stock market can get stuck in the doldrums for years  and if you only trade stocks from the long side  you are that much more exposed as you won t make money in prolonged downswings Assuming you are diversified because you have an emerging market fund  a small cap fund and a dividend income fund in your portfolio is worlds apart from having multi directional exposure to the S P  crude oil  corn  t bonds and cotton  Chances increase that  even if the S P is going nowhere  a bull or bear trend is happening elsewhere  and delivering hefty profits  Another futures advantage   ease of trading long or short Compared to the ease of buying them  it is notoriously hard to short stocks  There are uptick rules  and borrowing requirements  and the risk of outright short selling bans when authorities feel panicked  But in the futures markets  it is always just as easy to sell short as it is to buy long  With futures contracts  it doesn t matter at all whether you buy first or sell first  No one cares And there is no stigma or media bias with shorting futures either  No one will call you names on CNBC or accost you at a family gathering for shorting cotton  Compare that to  say  shorting General Motors or heaven forbid Apple  If I short General Motors  be sure I ll keep it under wraps at the family barbecue And last but not least  futures can enhance skills and performance I believe any time you step outside your comfort zone  you open yourself up to potentially great things  Even if you try commodities and simply don t like trading them  I can t imagine not picking up some useful skills and observations that transfer over to the markets you trade now If you are a technical trader  you may appreciate the purity of commodity price patterns  and see new ones jump out at you after some time in the trenches  And if you are working on impulsiveness and risk control  the extra leverage in futures could teach you well with just one improperly attended loss Precaution  Not for the Faint HeartedLet it be said though  The futures markets are certainly not for everyone  There is a reason why it is harder to open a futures account than a plain vanilla stock brokerage account  and why you have to sign a number of scary forms spelling out that 1   I understand the risk   and 2   I know I can blow myself up if not careful  Come to think of it  they should have that exact same language for stock investing too But anyway  point being  the inherent leverage in futures must be respected and taken seriously  There are great opportunities  but only for those who can follow a rational plan and have a natural respect for risk To get used to the bigger swings  I recommend easing into commodities rather than jumping in whole hog  using mini contracts if feasible and only a portion of available risk capital  Some contracts are also much more  beginner friendly  than others  Oats yes  natural gas no If popular demand calls for it  we ll continue this discussion with more on the mechanics of commodities   a must read for those who have never traded on the dark side  Also  if you have any specific futures related questions  let us know Disclosure  This content is general info only  not to be taken as investment advice ,2012-03-11,Mercenary

164721,386237,GIS,General Mills  Food For Thought  ,opinion,General Mills has an impressive dividend yield for the income investor  Its estimated earnings growth is on the mark at about 7 2  and would make a nice contribution to an income portfolio  This article looks at General Mills Inc  GIS   a Dividend Challenger  through the lens of the F A S T  Graphs  Fundamentals Analyzer Software Tool  Since a picture is worth a thousand words  the reader will be provided the  essential fundamentals at a glance  expressed vividly in pictures  In order to provide you the opportunity to research this company deeper and faster we are providing a link to a live  fully functioning earnings and price correlated set of graphs Found Here   Tip   Run your mouse over the various lines and watch the graphs come to life  A Dividend Challenger is defined as a company that has increased its dividend every year for 5 9 straight years  General Mills Inc is a Dividend Challenger that has raised its dividend every year for 8 consecutive years  The complete Dividend Challengers list is compiled courtesy of David Fish   Open as an excel spreadsheet and look at the tabs on the bottom to find the Dividend Challengers list  Dividend Challenger   General Mills Inc One of the world s leading food companies  General Mills operates in more than 100 countries and markets more than 100 consumer brands  including Cheerios  H agen Dazs  Pillsbury  Nature Valley  Betty Crocker  Green Giant  Old El Paso  Progresso  Cascadian Farm  Muir Glen and more  Headquartered in Minneapolis  Minnesota  USA  General Mills had fiscal 2010 global net sales of US 16 billion  including the company s  1 2 billion proportionate share of joint venture net sales  General Mills Inc  A Dividend Challenger with 8 Consecutive Years of Dividend IncreasesLearning from the Past   Looking at Earnings OnlySince dividends are paid out of earnings  a clear perspective of a company s historical earnings growth record is a vital component of a dividend investor s prudent due diligence process  The following graph plots General Mills Inc s earnings per share since 1998  A quick glance to the right of the graph shows that General Mills Inc has increased earnings at a compounded rate of 8 2   see purple circle on graph  per annum  Earnings Determine Market Price and Dividend Income  The following earnings and price correlated  clearly illustrates the importance of earnings to both price movement and dividend income  The earnings growth rate line or True Worth   line  orange line with white triangles  is correlated with the historical stock price line  On graph after graph the lines will move in tandem  If the stock price strays away from the earnings line  over or under   inevitably it will come back to earnings    Since dividends are paid out of earnings  and therefore represent additional return on top of what the market capitalizes earnings at  they are depicted by the light blue shaded area and stacked on top of the earnings line  Therefore  a quick visual of these two important components is simultaneously revealed    1         The additional return that dividend paying stocks provide  2         The percentage of earnings paid to shareholders as dividends  payout ratio     The value in this article is through carefully analyzing the earnings and price correlated fundamentally based graphs  Notice that one glance tells you how well the company has performed on an operating basis historically and how the market valued that historical performance  Therefore  the reader is free to discover whether or not current valuations make sense based on historical norms coupled with fundamental values  Instead of opinion  this article is designed to produce facts that can be analyzed to the readers investing benefit  Performance Table  Capital Appreciation and Dividend Income General Mills IncThe associated performance results  with the earnings and price correlated graph  validates the above discussion regarding the two components of total return   Capital appreciation and dividend income  Dividends are included in the total return calculation and are assumed paid  but not reinvested When presented separately like this  the additional rate of return a dividend paying stock produces for shareholders becomes undeniably evident  In addition to the 5 5  capital appreciation  Closing Annualized ROR   long term shareholders of General Mills Inc would have received an additional  50 404 63 in dividends that increased their total return from 5 5  to 7  per annum  Note   Since this is a Dividend Challenger it  has raised its dividend every year for at least 5 9 years  therefore   negative dividend growth rates shown  if any  will be attributed to special additional dividends paid in excess of the company s regularly reported dividend rate The following graph plots the historically normal PE ratio  the dark blue line  correlated with 10 year Treasury note interest  Notice that the current price earnings ratio on this quality company is as normal as it has been since 1998 A further indication of valuation can be seen by examining a company s current price to sales ratio relative to its historical price to sales ratio  The current price to sales ratio for General Mills Inc is 1 54  which is historically normal Looking to the FutureExtensive research has provided a preponderance of conclusive evidence that future long term returns  and the dividend and its growth rate are a function of two critical determinants 1  The rate of change  growth rate  of the company s earnings2  The price or valuation you pay to buy those earningsTherefore  forecasting future earnings growth  bought at sound valuations  is the key to safe  sound  and profitable performance Therefore  it logically follows that measuring performance without simultaneously measuring valuation is a job half done  At its current price  which is attractively aligned with its True Worth  valuation  General Mills Inc represents a potential opportunity to invest in a Dividend Challenger at a reasonable price  The important factor is that General Mills Inc has real assets and cash flow underpinning its stock price  This solid economic foundation offers shareholders the potential for both a strong margin of safety and an opportunity for an increasing dividend income stream and potentially attractive future returns The Estimated Earnings and Return Calculator Tool is a simple yet powerful resource that empowers the user to calculate and run various investing scenarios that generate precise rate of return potentialities  Thinking the investment through to its logical conclusion is an important component towards making sound and prudent commonsense investing decisions The consensus of 21 leading analysts reporting to Capital IQ forecast General Mills Inc long term earnings growth at 7 2   General Mills Inc has medium long term debt at 46  of capital  General Mills Inc is currently trading at a P E of 15 5  which is inside the value corridor  defined by the five orange lines  of a maximum P E of 18  If the earnings materialize as forecast  General Mills Inc s True Worth valuation would be  50 95 at the end of 2017  which would be a 8 6  annual rate of return from the current price  including assumed dividends Earnings Yield EstimatesDiscounted Future Cash Flows  All companies derive their value from the future cash flows  earnings  they are capable of generating for their stakeholders over time  Therefore  because Earnings Determine Market Price and dividend income in the long run  we expect the future earnings of a company to justify the price we pay Since all investments potentially compete with all other investments  it is useful to compare investing in any prospective company to that of a comparable investment in low risk Treasury bonds  Comparing an investment in General Mills Inc to an equal investment in 10 year Treasury bonds illustrates that General Mills Inc s expected earnings would be 5 4 times that of the 10 Year T Bond Interest   See EYE chart below   This is the essence of the importance of proper valuation as a critical investing component This report presents essential  fundamentals at a glance  on Dividend Challenger General Mills Inc  illustrating the past and present valuation based on earnings achievements as reported  Future forecasts for earnings growth are based on the consensus of leading analysts  Although with just a quick glance you can know a lot about the company  it s imperative that the reader conduct his or her own due diligence in order to validate whether the consensus estimates seem reasonable or not  Follow the link we provided at the beginning of this article to a fully functioning F A S T  Graphs  on General Mills Inc Summary   ConclusionsGeneral Mills  earnings and dividends have increased nicely over the past years  It looks to be at an  in value  price and should continue to give a nice dividend and some growth over time  As always  we recommend you conduct your own thorough due diligence Disclosure   Long GIS at the time
