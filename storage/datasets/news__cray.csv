2508,224023,CRAY,Is It Time To Hold Your Horses On AMD Stock ,opinion,"Advanced Micro Devices   NASDAQ AMD   stock has been soaring over the past month  so it s worth taking a look at whether there s more upside to the stock 
It s not just the slew of positive news stories surrounding the name  but also the company s growing stature as a key deliverer of semiconductor innovation  not just dependent on short term phenomena like cryptocurrency mining but able to take longer term lead in cloud based gaming  server technology and yes  even on the latest manufacturing process  So AMD has come a long way and there s good reason to be bullish on the stock 
The Bull Story
The first sign of a company poised to do better is management delivering on its promises  That s precisely what happened at the Computex trade show in Taipei where AMD delivered on its promise of new products to challenge market leaders 
So we saw CEO Lisa Su announce the 7nm Rizen 3000 series CPUs that are expected to take share from Intel   NASDAQ INTC   and the RX 5000 series GPUs that will take on NVIDIA   NASDAQ NVDA    all of which remain on schedule to launch at various times during the second half of the year across its entire product lineup 
Compounding the effect is the slowdown in innovation at Intel  which still remains a market leader 
Third is the question of market share  According to estimates released by Mercury Research  AMD managed a 13 3  share of the X86 processor market in 1Q19  up from 8 6  share in 1Q18  It had a 12 3  share in 4Q18  Importantly  it saw a 4 7 point gain in overall market share over the year ago quarter  including a 4 9 point share gain in desktops  a 5 1 point gain in laptops and a 1 9 point gain in servers 
It s still a relatively small player however  17 1  share in desktops  13 1  share in laptops and 2 9  share in servers   Its server market share is expected to pick up this year helped by new products and as earlier indicated by Intel s CEO 
As far as the discrete GPU market is concerned  AMD made a 2 3 point gain in share  according to JPR Research  mainly because it saw the lowest shipment decline  while the market shrank 18 6   Intel parts shrank 22 5   NVIDIA 12 7  and AMD only 4 6   The whole market was thrown out of gear because Intel was unable to deliver as promised  which threw the supply chain out of balance  given its size 
Perhaps the biggest driver of the share price was the number of lucrative partnerships the company has been able to rack up  The partnerships signal AMD s growing prowess  legitimize its seat at the leaders  table and indicate that it s in the beginning of a multi year growth phase 
First up is the announcement that Apple s   NASDAQ AAPL   all new Mac Pro to launch this fall will come equipped with Intel CPUs but also AMD s latest generation 7nm Radeon Pro Vega II GPUs  AMD tech is expected to support 8K video  rendering  complex video effects and more in these devices 
What may have a relatively small impact on revenue but is significant nonetheless is Samsung s multiyear agreement to license AMD mobile graphics chip technology  Licensing fees are important because they supplement the product business  which depends on other factors as well  such as the heath  capability and capacity of AMD s foundry partners  One analyst estimates that this could account for around 5  of annual revenue 
It was also recently announced the company s agreement with Alphabet   NASDAQ GOOGL    which will be using AMD custom GPUs in its Stadia cloud gaming project 
Cloud gaming is in its infancy with the biggest positives being that it allows people with limited computing resources to play all games in the cloud  play cross platform  stream to TV  play instantly  without downloading first  which can take a long time   protect copyright  since the game is never on the device in the first place  and online game playing support  since it allows easy spectatorship  
The more advanced players are likely to stick to their devices for now  as there are of course latency issues and rendering may not be comparable  Plus  what you save on your computing resources  you may make up with bandwidth and data cost  These are the issues that will be ironed out over time 
Meanwhile  Microsoft   NASDAQ MSFT   has also been working with AMD for its own cloud gaming effort that may be announced as early as next week at E3  AMD s position at game console makers is likely playing a big role here 
The company is also working with the U S  Department of Energy  Oak Ridge National Laboratory and Cray   NASDAQ CRAY   to deliver its supercomputer dubbed Frontier to the lab in 2021 
Key numbers are generally positive  In the last quarter  the company reported a small surprise on both revenue and earnings  Its 2019 EPS estimate is practically unchanged in the last 12 months  but the estimate for 2020 is up 27 0  
But There Are Some Risks
The good news looks priced into the stock  Its forward 12 month price to earnings ratio of 44 48X is higher than its median value of 39 89X over the last 12 months and the S P 500 s 16 34X  which is below its median value of 16 72X 
The price to sales ratio also doesn t look encouraging  The stock s current 5 71X is ahead of its own median value of 3 83X and the S P 500 s current value of 3 16X 
This could mean volatility in share prices despite the many positives 

 
The other factor we probably can t overlook is the cyclicality of the semiconductor business and the fact that it won t be possible for AMD to reach its full potential while the rest of the market remains in a down cycle  There is unlikely to be a recovery here in the short term 
We also need to keep in mind AMD s fabless model and the capacity constraints at foundry partner Taiwan Semiconductor   NYSE TSM    Any slipup on TSM s part would affect AMD s execution 
Conclusion
AMD s innovation will without a doubt lead to continued share gains  at least in the near term   which will come hand in hand with stronger margins and improved profitability 
But given the huge run up in prices  it s probably a good idea to hold your horses now  especially since there are plenty more fish in the sea  So head over to the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

2517,224032,CRAY,Buy Hewlett Packard Enterprise  HPE  Stock Before Q2 2019 Earnings ,opinion,"Shares of Hewlett Packard Enterprise   NYSE HPE   jumped over 3  during regular trading Tuesday to help extend its recent streak of positivity  The firm also announced its planned acquisition of supercomputer maker Cray Inc    NASDAQ CRAY   last Friday  Now  with HPE set to report its quarterly financial results on Thursday  let s see if investors should consider buying HP Enterprise stock 
Recent News   Overview
Hewlett Packard Enterprise last week said that it agreed to purchase supercomputing leader Cray  in a deal valued at roughly  1 3 billion  The firm will pay Cray investors  35 a share in cash  which represented a 17  premium to last Thursday s closing price  HPE s deal is projected to help the firm compete on a bigger scale in the data driven age and improve its position against rivals like International Business Machines   NYSE IBM   
Company management said that the deal will help create a more  comprehensive end to end portfolio across compute  storage  interconnect  software and services  in the quickly expand artificial intelligence and high performance computing spaces  The deal is projected to be HP Enterprise  since it started trading in 2015 
Hewlett Packard split into HPE and HP Inc    NYSE HPQ   in 2015  Today  HPE sells enterprise level servers  storage  and networking gear  and has lost ground to the likes of Cisco   NASDAQ CSCO   and Dell  Plus  the cloud computing age has seen Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN   and Microsoft   NASDAQ MSFT   eat away at its business 
Overall  shares of HPE have climbed roughly 16  in 2019  which falls below its industry s 18  average climb  HPE closed regular trading at  15 25 per share Tuesday  down roughly 14  from its 52 week intraday trading high of  17 68 
 
 
Outlook   Earnings Trends 
Before we dive into what to expect from HP Enterprise s second quarter fiscal 2019 financial results  let s quickly look at how the tech sector has performed so far this quarter  As of last week  roughly 80  of the S P 500 s tech companies had reported their Q1 results  with overall earnings down  6 6  on  3 8  higher revenues  Meanwhile  81 1  had beat EPS estimates and 69 8  had topped revenue estimates  Investors should note that rough quarters from giants such as Apple   NASDAQ AAPL   helped drag tech down  also read    
Moving  Palo Alto based HP Enterprise is projected to see its quarterly revenue slip 0 33  to  7 44 billion  Last quarter  the firm s revenue dipped 1 6  and fell short of our Zacks Consensus Estimate  At the bottom end of the income statement  HPE s adjusted quarterly earnings are projected to pop 5 9  to reach  0 36 per share  The firm s adjusted EPS figure soared over 31  last quarter and topped our estimate 
It is worth noting that the company has seen zero earnings estimate revisions over the last 60 days  which means analysts  outlooks have remained unchanged  With that said  HP Enterprise has topped quarterly earnings estimates in the trailing four periods by an average of 13 4  
Bottom Line
HP Enterprise is currently a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  based  somewhat  on its lack of earnings revisions  HPE also sports  B  grades for both Value and Growth in our Style scores system  with HPE s price sales ratio of 0 66 marking a discount compared to its industry s 1 84 average  The firm is also a dividend payer with a yield of 3 05  at the moment 
With that said  buying stocks heading into earnings is never easy on the stomach  as it is hard to know how Wall Street will react in the near term  even to a  strong  report  Yet HP Enterprise has shown some signs of life recently and it seems set to expand based on its recently announced acquisition 
HP Enterprise is set to release its Q2 fiscal 2019 financial results after the closing bell on Thursday  May 23  So make sure to head back to Zacks for a complete breakdown after the firm reports

2547,224062,CRAY,Why You re Too Focused On The Major Indices,opinion,"In last week s post  we showed you six stocks with relative strength and the potential to show leadership IF overall broad market conditions started to improve 
Since then  the main stock market indexes have indeed been under the bulls  control  and all the major indices are now trading above their respective 20  and 50 day moving averages on the daily charts  a bullish signal  
Because the NASDAQ  S P 500  and Dow Jones Industrial Average are now in rally mode  you may now be pondering whether current strength will just be a short lived bounce off the lows or the start of a significant rally 
But asking whether or not the major indices will continue improving is the wrong question to ask  Continue reading to learn why 
Do You Need A Paradigm Shift 
While you may spend several hours each week analyzing charts of the NASDAQ  S P 500  and Dow Jones Industrial Average  that valuable research time is much better spent scanning through a universe of stocks with relative strength instead 
Support and resistance levels of the major indices are important  but volatility can be very high at obvious levels of support and resistance  As such  you are typically forced to endure numerous  head fakes  in the broad market before the true move reveals itself 
Therefore  focusing primarily on charts of the NASDAQ  S P  and Dow as broad based market volatility increases frequently leads to getting  shaken out  of your positions 
If this regularly happens to you  it s time for a paradigm shift in your trading mentality to focus more on trade setups of leading individual stocks  rather than the main stock market indexes 
Your Quick   Efficient Stock Scanning Routine
To increase your odds of success in determining a market bottom  you need to run through a few stock scans during the week  making a list of stocks that are trading within 15 20  of their respective 52 week highs  while also forming a constructive  
More specifically  you need to establish and stick to a simple weekly routine  where the same technical stock scans are run each and every week 
This doesn t have to be extremely time consuming  and can be done on the weekend if the demands of life keep you too busy during the week 
How much you need to scan depends on the trading system being run  but one to two hours of flipping through charts while watching a baseball game isn t too demanding 
Instead of relying on just a few chart patterns of the major indexes  your goal is to start referencing your own individual stock watchlist for confirmation of market sentiment 
After getting into the habit of running through your stock scans every week  you will eventually notice the number of stocks your watchlist expanding and contracting with the market 
If broad market conditions are improving  you should see confirmation in the form of an increasing number of stocks breaking out of solid bases to new  swing highs  
If you do not see such confirmation  then be very cautious because something is amiss with the overall stock market 
What s Hot Now
Current market conditions are improving  but more importantly  so is the breadth of leadership  Nevertheless  current leadership is nowhere near as strong as it was in prior years 
This is to be expected considering the broad market is no longer in a strong uptrend and the major indices are all trading below their declining 200 day moving averages 
So  what are recent signs of strength 
Breakouts in Mitek Systems Inc  NASDAQ MITK   Mellanox Technologies  NASDAQ MLNX   Ebix Inc  NASDAQ EBIX   Texas Roadhouse Inc  NASDAQ TXRH   PayPal Holdings  NASDAQ PYPL   First Solar Inc  NASDAQ FSLR   Cray Inc  NASDAQ CRAY   Himax Technologies Inc  NASDAQ HIMX   Oclaro Inc  NASDAQ OCLR   and Ruth s Hospitality Group  NASDAQ RUTH  are a few examples of strong stocks with leadership  and here are a few stock charts to show you the type of action we are looking for 

We have been long Mellanox Technologies  shown above  since our February 24 entry of  14 97 and are currently showing an unrealized gain of 11 6  as of Tuesday s close 
Next up is insurance software outsourcing company Ebix 

If you re not already holding Ebix  it is not a positive reward risk ratio to chase a buy entry at current levels  but you can stalk this stock for a low risk buy entry on the pullback  an entry of  38  39 could be nice  
Online payment giant PayPal is another strong stock we like for pullback buy entry in the coming days 

Finally  on February 16  we posted on  that Mitek Systems was setting up for buy entry as it broke a key downtrend line 
Since then  the stock has jumped a whopping 22  and is still going strong  we also highlighted this stock in post linked above  
Good Habits   Consistent Trading Profits
Some traders obsess over stock charts and stare at them all night long in an attempt to predict future price action  but don t stress yourself out by falling into this trap 
Instead  simply get in the habit of screening for leading stocks every week and ask yourself   Are there any bullish chart patterns   If so  what industry sector do they belong to  Is their confirmation in the form of group strength as well 
Doing the above will not guarantee you will become a better trader in the short term  but developing a solid and consistent work ethic should eventually produce positive results  assuming your  is also in line  
While the herd focuses on whether or not the NASDAQ will bust through this level or that level  you now have the inside edge to knowing what really matters   the performance of leading individual stocks 
Although there is no substitute for hard work and consistency in the stock trading business  building and continually monitoring your list of leading stocks is an excellent  shortcut  to knowing the true sentiment of the market and becoming a consistently profitable trader ",2016-03-02,Deron Wagner,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-you’re-too-focused-on-charts-of-the-nasdaq,-s-p,-and-dow-jones-200120137",200120137

Finisar Corp   NASDAQ FNSR  has done very well  but is choppy over the long term  It was up 85 cents to 17 52  or 5   on 2 3 million shares  I think this stock is going to extend  The daily chart for Thursday shows it breaking out of the declining pattern  popped  filled the gap  came back and retested  and ran up  Recently  having a strong report  it exploded  pulled back and held that gap  It turned around on Wed and followed through on Thursday  Keep an eye on Thursday s high at 17 71  which is resistance  If it gets through that  this stock could be in the 20  and the 23 range going forward  particularly if the volume keeps up 
The Direxion Daily Russia Bull 3X ETF  NYSE RUSL  has taken out a declining topsline  consolidated  and popped out on Thursday  up 91 cents to 13 93  or 7   on 3 8 million shares  That s the biggest volume since the end of Feb  I think it can extend and eventually run up to 19  but first look for it to run to 16  the short term target 
U S  Silica Holdings  Inc   NYSE SLCA  is the one I put a swing on Thursday  because it s the leader in that group  It dropped from the mid 60s down to the teens  but on three occasions it ran up and rolled over  then broke up toward resistance  backed off  formed a wedge  and on Thursday  it broke out  up 1 77 to 22 49  or 8 5   on 10 2 million shares  This is a stock that completed its base pattern and is about to explode  The short term target is 26  and then 30  This is a new swing  so keep an eye on it

Eleven Biothera  NASDAQ EBIO  is looking better  and on Wednesday  in particular  after a 3 wave  corrective pullback wedge  It tested the 43 area by tagging 4 40  and testing the gap as well at 4 35 
It reversed sharply  going from 4 40 to 4 90  closing just a couple cents off the high at 4 88  or 3   The volume increased dramatically  late in the session  in particular  It could run up to the highs at 6 00  and now I m looking for as high as 8 00 
Swing trade Hudson Technologies Inc  NASDAQ HDSN  is doing well after pulling down and retesting the 6 10 area  Wednesday s low was 6 15  it ran up to 6 52 and closed at 6 47  up 22 cents  or 3 5   Nice reversal day  The volume wasn t spectacular  but the OBV was great  I m looking for this stock to make a move to 7 00  and ultimately  we may see it run up to 7 7 1 2 
Stocks on the Short Side   
Cray Inc  NASDAQ CRAY  came down five waves to the fifth wave on Wednesday  down 27 cents  or 2 2   to 22 90  Two or three weeks ago I told everyone to cover their shorts because this stock is at the bottom of the channel  After spiking down on the fifth wave  it may get a rebound  It looks like it could crack here  Technicals look terrible  I would not be surprised to see this run down to 18 1 2 19 
The Michaels Co  NASDAQ MIK  Boxer Short is doing well as it continues lower  down another 25 cents  or 1   to 23 96  on 1 3 million shares traded  It broke last week and has been down five days in a row  I m looking for a test of the 23 area  and possibly as low as 19 19 1 2

2557,224072,CRAY,3 Stocks To Watch  ANF  NUGT  ORBC,opinion,"It was a consolidation day on Wall Street  The pullback wasn t bad  an orderly  5 wave  constructive pullback that wasn t too deep  and the underlying technicals weren t bad  There were actually more advances than declines on New York  I find that to be positively divergent  so I wouldn t give up on this rally yet  I think we have more to go  There are some pretty good looking charts  several of which we re trading and or swinging  Let s take a look at them 
Abercrombie   Fitch Company  N ANF   one of our swing trades  earlier this year pulled back in a 3 wave corrective move right to the breakout point  The move in the last  week is almost vertical from 23 1 2 to 26 81  OBV is making steady progress  It has four waves up  The fifth wave should take it to the 33 34 zone 
The Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bull 3X Shares  N NUGT  had another spectacular move on Thursday  up 8 41 to 54 72  or 18   on 12 5 million shares  There s resistance at the next target at 69 70  and then 85 87  Look for it to get to the low to mid 60 s on Friday 
ORBCOMM Inc  O ORBC   a swing trade of ours  has been acting great  On Thursday  it was up 39 cents to 8 25  or 5   on 1 2 million shares  It has now moved in a 5 wave move and may extend the fifth wave  potentially  up around 9 00 short term  which is the next swing trade target  The secondary target is at 12 00  OBV is surging  the volume is excellent  and we re looking at the possibility of this stock exploding

2564,224079,CRAY,This Tech Dinosaur Looks Ready To Break Higher,opinion,"Need a gift for the nerd that has everything  How about a supercomputer  These babies have the power of 50 million laptops  That should get them the video game edge they crave  There is a catch  though  They tend to be a little expensive  Oh  and they take up quite a bit of space 
Maybe as a second choice you could give them the thrill of supercomputing  but with a supercomputer stock   NASDAQ CRAY  may just do the trick    and just in time for the holidays as the stock looks ready for a price breakout higher 

The chart above shows that the price has pulled back from its March high at  42  But after a long consolidation  Cray again began to move higher in mid October  The current consolidation makes for both a possible Measured Move higher to about 42 50 plus a cup and handle pattern with a target at 44 50  With the momentum indicator RSI also holding in the bullish zone  it creates a mosaic of technical signals for more upside  The low of the consolidation is also a natural stop level for the trade ",2014-12-03,Gregory W.

2566,224081,CRAY,Big Stock Moves Brewing,opinion,"Since gold topped out in 2011  it has been in a confirmed and unrelenting bear market  Since that bull market high in gold the INDU has been outperforming gold in a big way  The first chart I would like to show you is a combo chart which has the INDU GOLD ratio chart on top and GOLD on the bottom  As you can see both the INDU GOLD ratio chart on top and GOLD on the bottom reversed direction in 2011 with the ratio chart on top showing the INDU moving in a near parabolic move against gold  Gold on the bottom chart is showing a near parabolic move lower since its 2011 bull market peak  Since October of this year both have hit their respective parabolic trendlines as shown by the blue arrows  If this combo chart continues to play out then we should see the INDU keep outperforming gold going forward  The ratio chart on top shows the price action getting very close to breaking out into new highs and gold is very close to breaking down to new lows since the big reversal took place in 2011  All this chart means is that the INDU should keep outperforming gold until something changes this fact 



The bottom line for PMs is they are in a bear market and as such cannot be traded from a buy and hold perspective  

However  believe it or not there are other markets that are in confirmed bull phase  where investors   traders have been and will be making a lot of money buying and holding  

This next chart is a 25 year look at the NDX 100 which shows its bull market rally back in the 1990s to its current high which is just shy of its all time high at 4816  I ve shown you this chart several times through the years as the Chartology is very nice  First note the parabolic rise in the 1990 s to its bull market peak in 2000 with the red bullish rising flag as a halfway pattern as shown by the blue arrows  Many parabolic moves end with some type of balanced or unbalanced double top or H S top 

Next you can see the beautiful symmetrical H S bottom that formed out toward the apex of the 10 year triangle consolidation pattern  The right shoulder formed on the backtest to the top rail of the 10 year triangle consolidation pattern while the left shoulder and head formed inside the blue triangle  The brown shaded areas shows how symmetrical the left and right shoulders were which launched the new bull market that began at the 2009 crash low 

What I find interesting is that with all the bear market calls taking place right now in the stock markets  when I look at this chart  I see a stock that is very close to breaking out to new all time highs which is a bull market  Granted there are some areas that have most likely seen their bull market highs but there are other areas that haven t and these areas are where we ll see the big moves take place going forward  think rotation  What generally happens during a bull market is that the initial strongest sectors will top out first and just trade sideways while the other weaker sectors take their turn at making their bull market runs  This is one reason why the topping process can take so long sometimes 



Tonight I would like to show you a few stocks that have yet to have their bull market moves but are setting up for that possibility  As I ve shown you in the past one area that I think will do good going forward are the semiconductors  The long term monthly chart for the SOX shows it broke out of its massive 10 year bullish falling wedge in 2010 which had a small red bull flag form just below the top rail and the blue triangle that formed as the backtest  Note the big support and resistance line that comes in at the 545 area which has been backtested twice  We know that S R line is very hot so above it is positive and below is bearish  At this point the SOX would have to double to reach its bull market peak made back in 2000 which tells us this sector is undervalued on a relative basis 



Another area I ve been showing you that is still undervalued and unloved is the NWX which has a bullish setup taking place with one consolidation pattern that has formed below the massive 12 year neckline and one that is trying to form above the neckline  Here we have a very clean line is the sand with the 12 year neckline showing us where support is located  Positive above and bearish below 



Another area I ve been watching which had big moves in the 1990s were the online brokers  N SCHW was one of the first to kick off the bull market in this sector  After building out a blue 5 point triangle reversal pattern as its bull market top SCHW declined into its bear market low in 2003 or so  It took a massive 13 year triangle to consolidate that huge bull market in the 1990 s  It finally broke out in 2013 and has been in consolidation mode for the last two years above the top rail 



O AMTD is another online broker that built out a beautiful eight year H S consolidation pattern and is also forming a bullish expanding rising wedge just below its all time highs which actually took place in 1999  I can still remember the excitement when the online brokers were born  It was a game changer for the little guy  NO more huge commission fees each time you made a trade 



Below are a few good looking charts that have been behaving pretty well and are still positive  O CRAY built out an eight year unbalanced H S bottom and had a really nice impulse move up  It consolidated for about a year and has broken out above the top rail of a possible blue bull flag and has had a backtest 



The weekly chart for CRAY shows its bull flag up close and personal 



N CUB has been building out a five year six point rectangle consolidation pattern  In big consolidation patterns like this you can see how each reversal point has some type of reversal pattern  Note our most recent touch of the bottom rail has a H S bottom in place and has broke above the neckline  The red circles shows you what I call a false symmetry breakout  What this means is that the distance of the false breakout below the bottom rail  red circle added to the next high that fails to reach the top rail  are about equal  If you add the red circle to the failure point of the price action to reach the top rail it would be a complete and equal reversal which will be the same as the other reversals 



The daily chart for CUB shows the head as a blue 5 point rectangle reversal pattern with the first H S bottom complete and the second one is under construction 



O BRCM has a beautiful looking long term chart and is making new multi year highs  It broke out of an eleven year black triangle consolidation pattern that had to have five reversal points because it formed below the 2000 top 


I m going to stop right here for tonight  I just want you to be aware that there are some really big consolidation patterns that have formed since the tech bubble came to an end in 2000  It has taken many years for some of these stock to consolidate those massive gains made back then  I will be posting many more of these types of stocks as I think there is a lot of potential in many of them to have really big moves as some are doing right now ",2015-12-31,David Tablish,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/wednesday-report…big-picture-,-big-moves-brewing-.-378262",378262

2568,224083,CRAY,3 Stocks To Watch  CRAY  LABD  UVXY,opinion,"It was a pretty nasty reversal after the FOMC meeting on Wednesday  and the market really plunged through several support layers  and in my mind  that actually ruined a really nice set of patterns for a bottoming extension  It still could occur  and very well could reverse on Thursday  because the indices often reverse 24 48 hours after the FOMC  In other words  whatever movement there is after an FOMC meeting often reverses  I would have to say that we are looking at more downside unless there is an immediate reversal  For now  there are some longs and shorts to cover here  so let s go over them 
Cray Inc   O CRAY  has a really nice chart  and possibly a good swing trade if it gets to 42  This stock moved up in the face of a declining market on Wednesday  1 19 to 38 46  or 3   on 871 700  and closed near the high for the day  That is absolute  excellent action for this stock  Support is at 36  target is 42  It has 11 62 days to cover 
The Direxion Daily S P Biotech Bear 3X ETF  N LABD  is rockin  it  After forming a base  breaking out and retesting the trendline  it looks like the spike up of 8 16 to 68 07  or 13 6   on 595 300 shares traded could extend  If it goes down on Thursday  it could get the momentum necessary to get it up into the mid 70 s  The target is 74 74 1 2 
The ProShares Ultra VIX Short Term Futures  N UVXY  jumped 3 45 to 39 80  or 8 3   on 33 4 million shares traded  It has exploded from the 26 range all the way up to 59  and the pullback last week from the market rally has taken it back down near 40  It reversed sharply on Wednesday from 39 80 to 46 22  33 4 million shares is the best volume in four sessions  If it gets through 46 on Thursday  which it could at the opening  the target is in the 50 s  maybe 58 59

Action continues to be very fickle and so far tonight we ve got Amazon com Inc  O AMZN  off large while Visa Inc  N V  is up a tad and Microsoft Corporation  O MSFT  up a few dollars all on earnings and Alphabet Inc  O GOOGL  is reacting poorly to the AMZN numbers to throw another wrench in the spokes 
It s a coin flip market and I avoid those so cash is where I am although I did try one short today 
Cray Inc  O CRAY  has been a bit cray cray lately so I shorted at 37 80 when it looked set to come back to earth but it didn t so I took a small loss and got out of my short at 38 30 
No big deal and it was a very small trade 
Take a week off and come back and see how things are going then would be the best advice  otherwise if you can t sit on your hands this market will chop up your account 
It may seem like a week s vacation somewhere is expensive but much more than that can be taken from your account in the same amount of time and you re brain will be done  or you could come back from the beach refreshed and relaxed and ready 

N SPY continues to chop between the 190 area and 187 50 
A break either way can be traded and I ll likely try it but in small to medium size in this very poor market

Cree  Inc   O CREE  has been acting well  The pattern shows a pop  a wedge  a pop  a pullback retest  and then the breakout on Tuesday  up another 1 39 to 30 67  or almost 5   on 1 6 million shares  Both the volume and OBV look strong  It looks like it s going to test the 31 3 4 zone  maybe as early as Wednesday  but the swing target on it is 36 followed by 40
