20504,242019,KOF,Brown Forman  BF B  Offers A Balanced Risk Reward Right Now,opinion,"Brown Forman Corp   remained on growth trajectory throughout 2019 on the back of strong brand portfolio  given robust momentum in premium bourbons and tequilas  Additionally  investments to strengthen Jack Daniel s family of brands have been aiding its performance  Notably  Jack Daniel s Tennessee Whiskey has been the key contributor of growth in the United States for more than a decade Furthermore  the company is confident of capitalizing on the American Whiskey strategy  with continued benefits from investments in the brand portfolio  These factors have collectively contributed to strong quarterly outcomes for the company  also leading to a solid share price trend  The stock has gained 42 5  in the past year  outpacing the  s growth of 17 9  
However  Brown Forman has been witnessing headwinds related to tariffs imposed on American spirits  which have been hurting underlying sales and margins since the first quarter of fiscal 2019  This along with higher input costs are hurting its gross margin  which should persist throughout fiscal 2020 With these lingering headwinds  let s see how this Louisville  KY based alcoholic beverages company will retain stock momentum Factors Favoring the StockBrown Forman s strong portfolio of globally recognized brands  including the Jack Daniels family of brands  positions it well in the alcohol beverage space  It currently owns and produces a multitude of popular spirit brands  including Jack Daniels  Southern  NYSE SO  Comfort and Finlandia Vodka  We expect the company s continued focus on pricing  product innovation and expanding operations in emerging markets to boost operational performance and further strengthen market position In fact  broad based growth across Brown Forman s brand portfolio and geographies is primarily aiding its results  Brown Forman s underlying sales growth in first half fiscal 2020 reflects notable strength in the United States  its largest market  Results in the United States were aided by premium bourbons and tequilas  Notably  underlying net sales grew 6  in the United States  2  in developed international markets and 5  in emerging markets The company is focused on investing in the diversification of its brand portfolio to drive growth  The company s investments in brands are centered on the broadening of Jack Daniel s family of brands  while exiting weaker brands and expanding the fast growing premium spirit categories  Further  it is increasingly investing to organically accelerate the growth of two fast growing spirits categories  namely bourbons and tequilas  These balanced portfolio investments are supporting the company s track record of attaining consistent growth Factors Hindering GrowthThough the aforementioned factors make us optimistic about the stock s potential  there are some hurdles in its growth path  The most prominent concern is the ongoing impact of tariffs Notably  underlying sales in the first half of fiscal 2019 and 2020 were hurt by tariff related buy ins  which occurred in first quarter fiscal 2019  Further  underlying sales for the company s Jack Daniel s family of brands included negative impacts of last year s tariff related buy ins and related net pricing reductions  In addition to the buying effects  the cost of tariffs have been reducing margins  attributed to lower pricing in certain markets wherein it sells products to distributors and higher cost in markets wherein it imports and distributes products directly In the first half of fiscal 2020  gross margin declined 270 basis points  resulting in an underlying gross profit drop of 2  from the corresponding period of last year  Gross margin decline was mainly driven by tariff related expenses and higher input costs reflecting agave and wood inflation  Further  underlying operating income declined 5  in the first half  including a 6 percentage point negative impact from tariff related costs Moreover  Brown Forman lowered its underlying operating income view for fiscal 2020  based on uncertain economic and geopolitical environments in certain emerging markets  the Travel Retail channel  as well as higher input costs  The company lowered its underlying operating income growth projection by 1 percentage point  It now anticipates 2 4  rise in underlying operating income for the fiscal year compared with 3 5  growth mentioned earlier Wrapping UpThe above discussion clearly shows that Brown Forman has balanced risk reward  with growth efforts likely to offset hurdles  Further  the

the fast growing categories  In sync with this strategy  it increased its shareholding in Shui Jing Fang from 40  to just over 63  in fiscal 2019  This enhanced its presence in the premium Baijiu segment  Further  the company acquired the fastest growing premium tequila brand in the United States  Casamigos  in August 2017  which boosted its market share in the tequila category Prior to this  Diageo enhanced its portfolio with the acquisition of a 26  stake in India s leading brewer  United Spirits Limited  in July 2014   and the premium brand  De Leon Comb Wine   Spirits  in fiscal 2014   Additionally  Diageo s distribution deal with Minnesota based broker  United Brokerage  Inc   in 2013 solidifies its position in traditional markets Meanwhile  Diageo has been divesting assets to enhance its portfolio   including the recent divestiture of 19 brands to Sazerac  The divestiture will enable Diageo to focus on the premium and above premium brands  with stronger growth and profit opportunities We believe that the company s expansion and innovation efforts along with robust organic growth trend instill confidence in reaching its medium term targets  Notably  its organic operating margin expanded 83 basis points  bps  in fiscal 2019  marking a 198 bps organic operating margin expansion over the last three years  The expansion was above the company s long term organic operating margin guidance of a 175 bps improvement from fiscal 2017 through 2019 Backed by better than expected performances over the last three years  Diageo reiterated its medium term guidance for fiscal 2020 2022  which was announced in May 2019  The company continues to expect mid single digit organic net sales growth between fiscal 2020 and 2022  Further  it expects to sustainably grow organic operating profit by 5 7   suggesting growth of 1  ahead of net sales Apart from these  the company  like most other multinationals  is turning its attention to the emerging markets  It is the leading international spirits company in the emerging markets of Africa  Latin America and Asia  Moreover  Diageo caters to the local tastes of the regions  Its products like Johnnie Walker Blue Label bottle  which was designed through a series of exclusive private tasting in China  India  Thailand  Vietnam  Brazil and Mexico along with local cultural relevance  testify this strategy Moreover  the acquisition of United Spirits extended Diageo s reach to one of the most populous countries  with growing middle class population and beer consumption trends  With the opening of the first Johnnie Walker House in Seoul in October 2013  Diageo was able to boost sales in Korea Possible DeterrentsThe company is witnessing pressures from cost inflation and higher marketing expenses  In fiscal 2019  marketing spends increased 8   reflecting a 22 bps increase as a percentage of sales  This resulted from increased marketing investment in all regions  with the largest investments in US Spirits Notably  the company s overall rate of marketing investments over the past two years has risen nearly 50 bps  owing to increased investments in marketing and new technology to build a sustainable growth platform  Moreover  it expects an increase in marketing investment rate in fiscal 2020 on sustaining gains witnessed in the US Spirits segment through investments in new brands In addition  while Diageo reiterated its medium term view  it expects a slowdown in sales growth in fiscal 2020  owing to the lapping of several successful innovation launches in fiscal 2019  For fiscal 2020  the company anticipates net sales growth at the mid point of 4 6   whereas it recorded 5 8  gain in fiscal 2019 We believe that the aforementioned factors will offset these hurdles and help the stock sustain momentum  Currently  the company has a  of A 3 Better Ranked Beverage StocksCoca Cola  NYSE KO  FEMSA  S A B  de C V    NYSE KOF   has a long term earnings growth rate of 9 1   It currently

20571,242086,KOF,Bet On These 5 GARP Stocks With Discounted PEG Ratio,opinion,Pure play growth and value investors have one thing in common   both strategize for long term investments  Yet  their approach and growth goals make them totally distinct from each other when it comes to stock picking During the course of their financial planning and execution  while value investors miss the chance of betting on stocks that have bright long term prospects  growth investors often end up investing in expensive stocks Consequently  investors often wonder whether they should resort to any of these distinctive strategies or follow an approach that combines the best of both  The investing track of the Oracle  NYSE ORCL  of Omaha over the past few decades and his gradual shift from being a pure play value investor to a GARP  growth at a reasonable price  investor might give us all the answers In this regard  we should take note that strategic mingling of both growth and value investing principles gives us a mixed investing strategy that is getting popular with each passing day  What GARPers look for is whether the stocks are somewhat undervalued and have solid sustainable growth potential  Investopedia  And here lies the importance of a not so popular fundamental metric  the price earnings growth  PEG  ratio  Although it is categorized under value investing  this strategy follows the principles of both growth and value investing The PEG ratio is defined as   Price  Earnings  Earnings Growth RateIt relates the stocks P E ratio with future earnings growth rate While P E alone only gives the idea of stocks  which are trading at a discount  PEG while adding the GROWTH element to it  helps finding those stocks that have solid future potential A lower PEG ratio  preferably less than 1  is always better for GARP investors Say for example  if a stock s P E ratio is 10 and expected long term growth rate is 15   the company s PEG will come down to 0 66  a ratio which indicates both undervaluation and future growth potential Unfortunately  this ratio is often neglected due to investors  limitation to calculate the future earnings growth rate of a stock There are some drawbacks to using the PEG ratio though  It doesn t consider the very common situation of changing growth rates such as the forecast of the first three years at very high growth rates followed by a sustainable but lower growth rate in the long term Hence  PEG based investing can turn out to be even more rewarding if some other relevant parameters are also taken into consideration Here are the screening criteria for a winning strategy PEG Ratio less than X Industry MedianP E Ratio  using F1  less than X Industry Median  For more accurate valuation purpose  Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   Whether good market conditions or bad  stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  or  2 have a proven history of success  Market Capitalization greater than  1 Billion  This helps us to focus on companies that have strong liquidity  Average 20 Day Volume greater than 50 000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable Percentage Change F1 Earnings Estimate Revisions  4 Weeks  greater than 5   Upward estimate revisions add to the optimism  suggesting further bullishness Value Score of less than or equal to B  Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of  A  or  B  when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  2 or 3  Hold  offer the best upside potential  Here are five of the 12 stocks that qualified the screening Baxter International Inc    NYSE BAX    It is a renowned medical product company  We believe that Baxter s expanding product pipeline is a key growth catalyst  Newly launched products like SIGMA SPECTRUM infusion pump and AMIA APD cycler

20604,242119,KOF,The Parade Of Weak Earnings Reports Continues,opinion,"The flood of Q1 earnings announcements continues this week  with almost one thousand companies reporting results  including 159 S P 500 members  By the end of this week  we will have seen Q1 results from 72  of the index s total membership 
But with results from more than half of the index s total market capitalization already out  we have a pretty good sense of how weak this earnings actually has been  We knew that growth will be difficult following the massive revisions to estimates in the run up to the start of the Q1 earnings season  But despite those sharp revisions to estimates ahead of this reporting cycle  companies are struggling to beat revenue estimates  At this stage in the Q1 reporting cycle  the ratio of companies beating revenue estimates is the lowest that we have seen in the recent past  The headwinds aren t new   the strong US dollar  global growth issues and Energy sector weakness   we heard about all of them in the Q4 earnings season as well  More on the aggregate earnings picture emerging from the already released Q1 results a little later  but let s briefly touch on the Tech sector s results  A couple of standout performances aside  the Tech sector s Q1 results have been fairly weak relative to what we have been seeing from the sector in other recent reporting periods  Growth rates are weak as is the case with other sectors except Finance  fewer companies are able to beat the sharply lowered estimates and expectations for the current period are coming down   Before we dig into the results already on the books  let s pinpoint the key earnings reports coming out this week
Monday   Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  is the key report today  expected to report  2 18 per share on  56 8 billion in revenues vs   1 66 per share on  45 6 billion in revenues in the March 2104 quarter  Earnings ESP  or Expected Surprise Prediction  our proprietary leading indicator of positive earnings surprises  is showing Apple beating estimates on Monday  While the Tech sector s Q1 earnings growth is currently in the negative territory  Apple s estimated  12 6 billion in earnings on Monday will push the growth rate into positive territory 
Tuesday  On a very busy day with more than 200 companies reporting results  including 40 S P 500 members  the notable ones are Pfizer Inc  NYSE PFE   Merck  NYSE MRK   Ford and United Parcel Service Inc  NYSE UPS   just to name a few 
Wednesday   On another very busy day with more than 250 companies reporting results  including 43 S P 500 members   the more notable reports include Mastercard Incorporated  NYSE MA   International Paper Company  NYSE IP   and Eaton Corporation PLC  NYSE ETN   With positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank  3  Hold   MasterCard and International Paper are highly likely to come out with positive surprises on Wednesday 
Thursday   Today is the busiest reporting day of the Q1 earnings season thus far  with more than 350 companies reporting results  including 53 S P 500 members  We have a bunch of Energy and Media companies reporting results today  the more notable ones being Exxon Mobil Corporation  NYSE XOM   ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP   and Viacom B Inc  NASDAQ VIAB  
The Exxon report will spotlight how much of a drag the Energy sector s woes have been on the aggregate earnings picture  with the company s total earnings expected to be down an estimated  5 7 billion from the year earlier level  down  62 3    Please note that Exxon carries an outsized weight in the Energy sector  bringing in roughly 30  of the sector s total earnings in a typical quarter  Of the major sectors companies  Apple is the only that carries a comparable weight in the Technology   it will be bringing in roughly 27  of the Tech sector s earnings in Q1 
Friday   We have 13 S P 500 members reporting results on May 1st  the notable ones being Chevron  NYSE CVX  and CVS Health Corp  NYSE CVS  
2015 Q1 Earnings Scorecard As of April 24th  we have seen Q1 result from 201 S P 500 members that combined account for 50 8  of the index s total market capitalization  Total earnings for these companies are up  8 7  on  0 3  revenue gains  with 68 3  beating EPS estimates and 44 1  coming ahead of revenue expectations  Figure 1 below shows the current Scorecard for the 201 index members that have reported results  Please note that the second last column  Price Impact  tries to capture how the stock price has moved in response to the earning release  As the small note at the bottom of the table explains the price change is from the day before the earnings announcement to the day after  If we are looking at a stock that has reported that morning  then the day before price is compared to the intraday price on the release date  Figure 1  2015 Q1 Scorecard  as of 4 24 2015 
 Please note that the second last column  Price Impact  in the Scorecard table above tries to capture how the stock price has moved in response to the earning release  As the small note at the bottom of the table explains the price change is from the day before the earnings announcement to the day after  If we are looking at a stock that has reported that morning  then the day before price is compared to the intraday price on the release date Putting Q1 Results in Context Figure 2 below shows the comparison of the results thus far with what we have been seeing from the same group of 201 companies in other recent quarters  Figure 2  2015 Q1 Results Compared
 The left hand side chart compares the earnings and revenue growth rates for these 201 S P 500 members with what these same companies reported in the preceding quarter and the average growth rates for these companies in the preceding four quarters  the 4 quarter average is through 2014 Q4   The right hand side chart does the same comparison for these 201 S P 500 members  but compares only the earnings and beat ratios  Here are the takeaways from looking at this chart
The earnings growth rate   8 7   is notably better compared to other recent quarters 
The revenue growth rate   0 3   is below what we saw from this group of companies in Q4   2 8   as well as in the 4 quarter average   4 1   
The earnings beat ratio is about in line with the recent past 
The revenue beat ratio has improved in the last few days  but is notably below what these same companies reported in the preceding as well as 4 quarter average 
The Finance Effect Total earnings for the 61 6  of the Finance sector s market cap that has reported results are up  19 3  on  1 1  higher revenues  with 61 9  beating EPS estimates and 42 9  coming ahead of top line expectations  This is better growth performance than we have seen from this group of Finance sector companies in other recent quarters  Figure 3 below compares the Finance sector results thus far with what we have been seeing from the same group of companies in other recent quarters  Figure 3  Finance Sector Q1 Results Compared
 Please keep in mind that a big part of the  19 3  earnings growth for the sector at this stage is thanks to easy comparisons for Bank of America  NYSE BAC      Exclude Bank of America and the earnings growth rate drops to  9 5   But even this  9 5  growth rate compares favorably to what we have been seeing from this group in other recent quarters  The right hand side chart above shows the Finance sector s EPS and revenue beat ratios is very interesting  We have the same weak revenue surprises in Finance as elsewhere in the index  But even the EPS beat ratio is lower than what we saw from the same group in 2014 Q4 and just about in line with the 4 quarter average  Bottom line  the Finance sector s strong numbers didn t come as a surprise to investors  they were already priced in  No doubt the  Price Impact  column in the Scorecard table above shows that the stock price impact of the earnings announcements has been negative  at least at this stage Comparing the ex Finance Results Given this discussion of Finance sector results  it would probably make sense to look at the results thus far on an ex Finance basis  Figure 4 below recasts the earlier Figure 2 on an ex Finance basis  Figure 4  Q1 Results Outside of Finance compared
 Comparing Figure 4 with Figure 2 shows  
That the earnings and revenue growth rates outside of Finance are weaker than what we have been seeing in other recent quarters 
That the earnings beat ratio is about where it has been in other recent quarters  but the revenue beat ratio is notably weak 
The Composite Picture for Q1 Figure 5 below presents the composite summary picture for Q1 contrasted with what companies actually reported in the 2014 Q4 earnings season  What this means is that the data below is presenting Q1 as a whole  combining the actual results from the 201 S P 500 members that have reported results with estimates from the still to come 299 companies  Figure 5   The Composite Summary Picture
 As you can see in the above summary table  total Q1 earnings are expected to be down  0 4  from the same period last year on  5 1  lower revenues  with Finance as a big boost and Energy as major drag on the growth rate  Excluding the Finance sector  total earnings in Q1 would be down  4 5  on  5 6  lower revenues  Excluding Energy  total earnings for the remainder of the S P 500 index would be up a decent enough  8 3  on  1 5   Among the major sectors  Transportation  and Autos are big growth contributors this quarter  with Transportation earnings expected to be up  37 9  and Autos earnings up  27 8   Finance up  16 9   Medical up  13 5    We should keep in mind however that a small number of companies are accounting for most of the growth in Finance and Medical  We mentioned earlier how easy comparisons for Bank of America was helping the Finance sector s growth picture  Gilead Sciences  NASDAQ GILD        and Actavis  NYSE ACT     are playing a similar role in the Medical sector Will Q1 be the Low Point for the Year  We haven t had much earnings growth lately and the growth rate for Q1 is expected to turn negative  Not only is the growth rate for Q1 so low  but the overall level of total earnings for the S P 500 index are also expected to be the lowest in two years  This will be a material change from the last two quarters when aggregate earnings for the index reached all time record levels  The chart below shows the earnings totals for 2015 Q1  shaded orange bar    259 1 billion  contrasted with the actual earnings for the preceding four quarters as well estimates for the following three quarters  The hopes are that Q1 will be the low point for the year  with aggregate earnings moving back into record territory towards the end of the year  Recent history tells otherwise  If history is our guide  then the likely result will be revisions to those lofty estimates in the coming days
