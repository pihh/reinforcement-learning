112909,334424,CHRS,AbbVie  ABBV  Stock Hits 52 Week High  More Room To Run ,opinion,AbbVie Inc    NYSE ABBV   shares hit a 52 week high of  71 12 on Friday before eventually closing at  71 05  In fact  shares of the company are up 13 4  since the beginning of this year  outperforming the Zacks classified  industry  which increased 11 4  in the same period Strong first quarter 2017 results coupled with positive pipeline data read outs and regulatory updates this year fueled the upside  Let s analyze the factors that will help the company to continue on this trajectory Factors at PlayThe company s flagship rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira accounted for almost 63  of total revenue in the first quarter of 2017  registering growth of nearly 15  year over year  The drug is the main driver of AbbVie s revenues  currently approved for several indications  The company is also conducting studies to expand its label into other indications  The company expects Humira to bring in total sales of more than  18 billion in 2020 However  quite a few companies are working on bringing Humira biosimilars to the market A biosimilar from Amgen Inc    NASDAQ AMGN   was approved by the FDA in 2016  However  the drug has not yet been launched due to ongoing litigation  In May 2017  AbbVie lost a lawsuit to Coherus Biosciences  Inc    NASDAQ CHRS   regarding the dosing patent  135 for Humira  However  shares weren t affected much as the investment community believes that AbbVie has a robust intellectual property  IP  portfolio beyond the  135 patent  which should preclude biosimilars from the U S  market until 2022  Sales should continue to remain strong until then Although Humira generates most of its revenues  the company has diversified its revenue stream with the addition of Imbruvica to its portfolio  Imbruvica sales increased 44 6  from the year ago quarter to  551 million in the first quarter of 2017  The company expects Imbruvica peak sales of more than  7 billion and revenues of about  5 billion in 2020  Imbruvica  currently approved for quite a few indications  has multi billion dollar potential  AbbVie intends to expand Imbruvica s label into solid tumors and autoimmune diseases  AbbVie co owns the drug with Johnson   Johnson   NYSE JNJ   With expected growth in Humira and Imbruvica sales over the next few years  the company s top line should see an upside  Moreover  AbbVie also has a strong pipeline with several late stage candidates  The company is developing risankizumab for psoriasis and Crohn s disease while ABT 494 is being developed for treating rheumatoid arthritis  RA  In the last couple of months  AbbVie announced positive top line results from a phase III study on upadacitinib  ABT 494  for RAas well as a phase II study for Crohn s disease  These played an important role in driving up the share price  Meanwhile  AbbVie s RBV free once daily pan genotypic combinationregimen  glecaprevir pibrentasvir  G P  is under accelerated assessment in the EU and priority review in the U S  and Japan with commercialization expected this year Also  the company announced some label updates for both Imbruvica and Humira Venetoclax  an oncology pipeline candidate was approved by the FDA in 2016 for chronic lymphocytic leukemia  CLL  and is being studied in other indications as well Investors are focused on the performance of AbbVie s HCV portfolio as the segment is facing competition from Gilead s Sovaldi and Harvoni along with increasing pricing pressure  Viekira suffered a year over year drop of 36 5  in its sales in the first quarter of 2017 to  263 million  The weak performance is expected to continue this year with sales expected to decline to  1 billion in 2017 from  1 5 billion in 2016 Despite these pressures  AbbVie looks well poised to deliver strong earnings and sales growth through the rest of this year backed by its key drugs Imbruvica and Humira  Meanwhile  investor focus will remain on the stock with several late stage data readouts expected in the second half as well Attractive NumbersThe stock trades at an attractive valuation as evident from its favorable P E F12M  forward twelve months   which stands at 11 84 and trades at a discount to large cap pharmaceuticals industry s P E F12M of 15 91  Moreover  earnings are expected to increase 14 62  in 2017 and 18 59  in 2018  The numbers indicate that the stock has the potential to rise further Moreover  the company has delivered a positive surprise in two of the trailing four quarters and met estimates in the remaining two quarters  with an average four quarter surprise of 1 65  AbbVie Inc  Price   Zacks RankAbbVie currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside  Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana Ignited by new referendums and legislation  this industry is expected to blast from an already robust  6 7 billion to  20 2
