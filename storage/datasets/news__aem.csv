119226,340741,AEM,Is Agnico Eagle Mines Stock a Buy ,news,"While plenty of people have undoubtedly resolved to adopt new fitness plans in the new year  some gold minded investors have decided that 2020 will be the year in which they add exposure to the yellow metal  From the purchasing of bullion to picking up shares of a gold ETF  there are a variety of ways to make this new year s resolution a reality  One of the most common options for investors  though  is the purchase of a mining company s stock 
Since there are numerous names from which investors can choose  it can feel overwhelming trying to find the right candidates  so let s start off with one of the more recognizable miners  Agnico Eagle Mines  NYSE AEM   one of the largest gold mining companies by market capitalization  Climbing 53  in 2019  Agnico Eagle s stock certainly helped shareholders  portfolios shine a little brighter last year  but is now still a good time to pick up shares 

Bulls are betting on    
Having generated average annual free cash flow  FCF  of  207 million from 2014 to 2016  Agnico Eagle s inability to sustain the trend in 2017 and 2018 may appear to be a red flag  Management  however  contends that the company s cash flow woes are attributable to its large capital commitment to constructing two new mines in Nunavut    something Agnico Eagle characterizes as  the largest capital spending program in its history  
With completion of the mines coming in Q3 2019 and lower planned capital expenditures  management believes Agnico Eagle is poised to return to strong FCF generation in the coming years 

Another alluring aspect of Agnico Eagle is management s commitment to rewarding shareholders  Raising its quarterly dividend 40  to  0 175 per share for Q4 2019  Agnico Eagle s distribution has risen steadily over the past few years  reflecting a compound annual growth rate of 11 4  from 2014 through 2019  Currently  the stock offers shareholders a forward dividend yield of 1 14   While this is lower than the current S P 500 yield of 1 77   prospective gold investors should remember that gold mining stocks are not known for their high dividend payouts  so in terms of its peers  Agnico Eagle s payout seems more compelling 
With the expansion at Nunavut complete  Agnico Eagle foresees strong gold production growth over the next two years  and based on the numerous projects in its pipeline  it projects continued growth in 2023 and beyond  Besides additional mining opportunities at LaRonde  Agnico Eagle recognizes expansion opportunities at Goldex  Canadian Malartic  and Kittila as ways in which the company can add to its gold pile  Those who are bullish on Agnico Eagle believe the company s strong pipeline is attractive since it provides it with organic growth opportunities  enabling it to avoid the oftentimes more costly option of acquiring assets 
While bears believe    
Although Agnico Eagle s dedication to its dividend glitters brightly in some investors  eyes  bears are more cautious  While the company maintained its quarterly payout of  0 11 per share in each quarter of 2018  it generated a net loss of  327 million  resulting in a payout ratio of negative 31   Through the first three quarters of 2019  the company has returned to net income  and its payout ratio is a more reasonable 63   however  it has yet to report Q4 earnings  so the full year payout ratio is still unknown 
An additional source of concern for some investors is the company s reliance on leverage  With about  1 47 billion in net debt on its balance sheet as of the end of Q3 2019  the company has a net debt to EBITDA ratio of about 3  Though this may not have more risk tolerant investors reaching for a red flag  those who are more circumspect may be inclined to consider other mining companies with a more conservative approach to leverage  such as Yamana Gold  NYSE AUY   The company currently has a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 1 5  and that may lower to under 1 before 2021  While the company has deleveraged  it has also raised its dividend 
Lastly  skeptics will point to the high price tag as another reason for passing on the stock at this time  Valued at 19 times operating cash flow  the stock is trading at a premium to its five year average multiple of 14 2  according to Morningstar  Though it seems to be richly valued at the moment  it s worth noting that many gold oriented stocks are currently trading at premiums to their five year averages  suggesting that a better option at the moment may be a gold ETF 
Should investors look to Agnico Eagle to build their pots of gold 
With a commitment to growing the dividend and a strong pipeline of growth projects  Agnico Eagle has a lot to offer would be investors  At this time  though  shares are trading hands at a price a little too high for my tastes    especially considering the higher risk associated with the company s reliance on leverage  In the coming quarters  though  should the company achieve stronger FCF growth and allocate some of those funds toward deleveraging  it would certainly be worth reexamining the stock ",2020-01-05,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pdvde,2052571

119230,340745,AEM,Gold Likely To Maintain Momentum In 2020  6 Top Picks,opinion,Gold prices have moved downward since the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2019 after a rally in the June September period  Renewed hopes for the signing of an interim trade deal between the United States and China  and a stronger U S  dollar are the primary reasons for the gold price decline Despite recent softness in price  gold has surged nearly 20  year to date and is on track to finish its best year in a decade  Will gold glitter in 2020 Trade Tussle Continues  The phase one deal between the United States and China needs to be signed by Dec 15  after which the U S  government is scheduled to impose a new round of 15  tariffs on  160 billion of Chinese goods  The Trump administration can also

reduced its 2019 and 2020 growth forecasts for the global economy  It predicts growth of 3  for 2019  down from its previous forecast of 3 2   For 2020  the IMF projects growth of 3 4   lower than its previous projection of 3 6   Moreover  the World Bank also squeezed its global growth forecast for 2019 to 2 6  from the previously forecast 2 7  growth   On Sep 19  the Organization of Economic Co Operation and Development  OECD   projected that the world economy will grow just 2 9  in 2019  the lowest since 2009  The OECD had forecast 4  global growth in 2019 just 18 months ago Easy Monetary Stance Adopted by Major Central BanksReversing its highly hawkish monetary stance of 2019  the Fed adopted a dovish stance since the beginning of this year and reduced the benchmark interest rate by 75 basis points in three tranches  On Dec 12  Fed Chair Jerome Powell reiterated that the central bank is set to maintain a stable monetary policy in 2020 and can only think about raising rates if inflation surges systematically The European Central Bank has also decided to maintain a negative interest rate policy and continue its bond purchase or quantitative easing strategy   Moreover  Bank of Japan is also maintaining negative interest rate  Central banks of major emerging economies including China  India  Australia  Thailand and New Zeeland have also adopted low rate policies   Lower interest rates decrease the opportunity cost of holding non yielding bullion  making gold cheaper for investors holding other currencies  Buying pressure on gold is likely to remain firm as investors will focus on precious metals as a store of wealth and hedge against market turmoil   Strong ProjectionsOn Dec 12  gold price for February futures on Comex settled at  1 471 20 per ounce  According to

119233,340748,AEM,Cummins  CMI  To Report Q4 Earnings  What s In The Cards ,opinion,Cummins Inc    NYSE CMI   is slated to release fourth quarter 2019 results on Feb 4  before the opening bell  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is a profit of  2 42 a share on revenues of  5 37 billion The leading global designer of diesel and natural gas engines witnessed weaker than expected results in the last reported quarter due to lower revenues in its Engine and Components segments The company has a dismal record of missing estimates in three out of the trailing four quarters  This is depicted in the graph below Cummins Inc  Price and Consensus   Which Way are the Estimates Headed The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter earnings per share  EPS  has been revised downward by 4 cents in the past 30 days to  2 42  This compares unfavorably with the year ago quarter s reported earnings of  3 48 per share  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at  5 37 billion  suggesting a decline from the prior year reported figure of  6 13 billion Factors Setting the ToneIn fourth quarter 2019  Cummins is expected to have benefited from its collaboration with Hyundai to develop an electric powered mini excavator  and Isuzu Motors to discover opportunity in the powertrain area  Further  the company s partnership with Russia s KAMAZ to supply electrified power solutions for its latest line of battery powered vehicles is anticipated to have fueled top line growth  Moreover  the Hydrogenic Corp buyout is likely to have boosted Cummins  ability to innovate hydrogen fuel cell technologies across commercial markets However  a few of Cummins  end markets are likely to have witnessed lower levels of industry production of trucks amid reduced build rates during this period  Declining demand in China amid economic growth concerns and trade tussle is likely to have marred the company s quarterly performance  Demand for trucks in the U K  and India might have dropped as well  dampening Cummins  quarterly earnings Notably  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Engine segment s quarterly net sales is pegged at  2 196 million  lower than the year ago quarter s  2 698 million  The EBIT estimate for the segment projects a 29 5  decline to  277 million The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its power system segment s quarterly net sales is pegged at  1 083 million  lower than the prior year quarter s  1 199 million  The segment s EBIT estimate suggests a fall of 21 14  to  97 million in fourth quarter 2019 The components segment has a Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 540 million for its fourth quarter net sales  lower than the year ago quarter s  1 772 million  Sales estimate for the distribution segment is pinned at  2 019 million for the to be reported quarter  lower than the year ago quarter s  2 050 million  However  the distribution segment s EBIT estimate suggests an increase from the prior year s  140 million to  161 million  in the quarter Cummins is expected to have countered elevated expenses  due to rising R D expenses for product development toward commercial launch and high material costs during the December end quarter  Further  expenses are anticipated to have flared up due to launch of on highway products that comply with China s standard six emission regulation  Additionally  tariff related commodity costs and fluctuating foreign currencies are likely to have dragged down Cummins  margins in the quarter What the Zacks Model Says Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Cummins this season  The combination of a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  increases the odds of an earnings beat  But that s not the case here  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Earnings ESP  Cummins has an Earnings ESP of  0 83   This is because the Most Accurate Estimate of  2 40 comes in two cents lower than the Zacks

119235,340750,AEM,Silver Hits Downside Support  Gold Remains A Safe Haven Port,opinion,"So how did January work out for ya 
  In a mere month the killer coronavirus has taken  at this writing  259 lives with sadly more in the offing given reports of some 12 000 folks being infected     the global negative economic effect is of macro proportions  from canceled commerce and flights to quarantines and closed establishments 
  The UK technically withdrew from the EU     whoo hooo given next comes 11 months of business and trade issues over which to stew 
  The StateSide President went on Senatorial trial after being impeached     and come Wednesday shall have  albeit expectedly  survived 
  The price earnings ratio of the S P 500 using  TTM   trailing 12 months actual earnings as opposed to unrealized estimated earnings 12 months out  is still 39x as  twas at the end of 2019     which means given the Index is essentially now  unch  thus far in 2020 that Q4 Earnings Season is growthless 
  The Gold Silver ratio mid week topped 90x  the white metal continuing to be regarded  like the red metal  as purely industrial     whilst the yellow metal true to safe haven form resiliently responds to all that s unintended  untoward  unknown 
And in the midst of all these abnormal  becoming normal   goings on  Sister Silver swooned to the downside tune of her divining  Baby Blues   as for the past two weeks we ve proposed she would reaching down to our suggested structural trading support at 17 42 per the red line and arrow as shown on the right in the following two panel graphic  And we  spect that Gold on the left ought also have reached down to its red line at 1521 were the world not coming off the rails  The massive nugget is that upon Silver ultimately being rediscovered  for the umpteenth time  as money just ask any of your Athenian buddies from back in 2020 BC   twill overwhelm Gold in upside percentage gain   write it down  







Indeed across the above three month view  both Gold and Silver were in precious metal harmony for the first two  but are rather diverging as unexpected events ensue  To be sure   tis the safe havens that rule as we turn to the BEGOS Markets Standings with the year s first month now through 







As listed  second only to the Bond   5 3   from one month ago to date in performance is Gold   4 8    But in looking to leverage amongst notable Gold equities in 2020  thus far the royalty company Franco Nevada  NYSE FNV  is  17  and the mining company Newmont  NYSE NEM  is  10    Course in reviewing Gold s equities brethren from one year ago to date  gains are all the more impressive  with Gold itself  20   we ve the Global X Silver Miners exchange traded fund  NYSE SIL   26   NEM  42   the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners exchange traded fund  NYSE GDX   43   Agnico Eagle Mines  NYSE AEM   59   Pan American Silver  NASDAQ PAAS   62   and FNV  65   That s a lotta percent  Here s the graphic 







As for Gold s own year over year view  here are the weekly bars  the rightmost parabolic Long trend steadily maintaining its upward stride per the rising blue dots  Moreover  note the dashed trendline  extend that present rate of ascent   320 points annually  and Gold in a year s time would revisit its All Time Closing High  from 22 August 2011  at 1900   Course the slope of the line shifts a bit from week to week  and to merely satisfy our forecast high this year for 1675 would be pretty neat  But since as far back as 2003  nary has a year gone by without some two to three stints of red dotted parabolic Short trend being thrown in  just to keep us on our tradin  toes 







Now economically  the Barometer has had a pretty good upside run coming into 2020  indeed quite robust through the final quarter of 2019  However  reports of late haven t been as great  although the just reported first peek at Q4 Gross Domestic Product of  2 1  annualized growth handily beat the consensus for just  1 8     course since you follow the Econ Baro  you already knew Q4 nicely grew   But  this past week s reports divulged January s Chicago Purchasing Managers Index descending for the seventh time in the past 12 months  December s Personal Income and Spending and New Home Sales all slowed  and that month s Pending Home Sales were the weakest in six years  Thus the Baro  blue line  has keeled over a bit with the S P 500  red line  in tow  finally   As to whether  tis just a beginner run or that for an expert remains to be seen 







As well  the yield curve is still quite flat from 1 33  for two year dough to just 1 52  for ten years  The yield on the S P 500 is 1 87  but with that comes the  Look Ma  No Earnings   risk  Further  FedHeads are musing over a capping of Treasury yields toward keeping borrowing rates affordable as more states are experiencing economic shrinkage  One wonders if the next arrow in the StateSide opposition s quiver is for crashing the stock market with November s elections in the balance   Got Gold  
Turning to the precious metals  10 day Market Profiles we ve got Gold near the top of the stack  at left  with Silver instead off the boil toward mid stack  at right   Labeled for both markets are their respective three most dominate trading prices for these past two weeks 







Towards this week s wrap and it being month end  here we ve the broad view of Gold s structure by the monthly bars across nearly 10 calendar years  And yes   tis true  Gold has moved up into the  on maneuvers     category for the first time since falling from it during that wretched April of 2013  As denoted  round the mid point of this sector is our forecast high  in blue  for this year at 1675 







So that was January  And so  tis said that  as goes January so goes the year   so forth and so on   Twas this millennium s 20th January  which for the S P 500 since 2001 has been up 10 times and down 10 times  the latter being the case this time 
So how accurately predictive is January for the year s S P direction  Not very  Through the first 19 years of this millennium   which for you counting challenged folks out there was 2001 through 2019   January s direction has turned out to be the year s overall direction just 53  of the time   10 for 19   So much for that January axiom  eh 
Fortunately by currency debasement  tis axiomatic that Gold s highest days are ahead  So bring on Groundhog Day  the Super Bowl  and absolutely the Gold course stay ",2020-02-02,Mark Mead Baillie,https://www.investing.com/analysis/silver-hits-downside-support-gold-remains-a-safe-haven-port-200503796,200503796
119258,340773,AEM,Gold nears  1 300 oz  amid U S  tax reform uncertainty,news,"Gold rallied to its highest close in more than a month  up 1 4  for the day and 1 8  for the week to  1 296 50 oz   getting a boost from a higher dollar amid uncertainty over progress in U S  tax reform legislation 
 They re pricing out Trump s tax reform once again as a result of those two proposals in Congress that are quite far apart from each other   says Mitsubishi commodities analyst Jonathan Butler  who cites  concern that the equity market rally is possibly becoming a little exhausted for now  and that should be supportive of gold in the short term  
 U S  dollar softness can explain some of it  and technical levels  including making a new high for the month   says Rob Haworth at U S  Bank Wealth Management  but  I still think  Fed  policy is the key factor and will limit gains into year end

Capital Economics says gold is a preferable hedge against geopolitical events that directly involve the U S  but the metal s recent gains could quickly reverse   If  the tension  appears to be a lot of hot air  we expect gold prices to fall back quite quickly   says Capital chief commodities economist Caroline Bain

tariff hikes on Chinese imports if the trade negotiation fails to produce an interim agreement  Trump has categorically mentioned that he would only accept the interim trade deal if the agreement worked to the advantage of U S  workers and businesses In a strong statement  he said  since China s entrance into the World Trade Organization in 2001  no one has manipulated better or taken advantage of the United States more    I will not say the word  cheated   but nobody s cheated better than China  I will say that  On Nov 8  President Donald Trump told reports that he hasn t agreed

revenues were up 49  and 18   respectively  Cheap ValuationCommercial Metals  trailing 12 month EV EBITDA ratio is 7 3  while the industry s average trailing 12 month EV EBITDA is 7 9  Consequently  the stock is cheaper at this point based on the ratio Return on Assets  ROA Commercial Metals currently has a Return on Assets  ROA  of 6 6   while the industry recorded ROA of 2 6   An above average ROA denotes that the company is generating earnings by effectively managing assets Return on Equity  ROE Commercial Metals  trailing 12 month ROE of 16  reinforces its growth potential  The company s ROE is higher than the ROE of 5 5  for the industry  highlighting its efficiency in utilizing shareholders  funds Growth Drivers in PlaceSpending in U S  construction activity continues to flare up  which will further translate into improved long product steel demand  Robust markets in Poland and Commercial Metal s recent investment in the country fortify the company s prospects  Moreover  solid fabrication backlog and upbeat rebar margin environment are anticipated to aid Commercial Metal s fiscal 2020 performance The company has completed the ramp up of production volume at the second micro mill in Durant  OK  with higher than anticipated returns  supported by strong rebar demand and elevated metal margins  Also  it introduced a second spooler at the Arizona micro mill in the fiscal fourth quarter Commercial Metals has commenced construction on expanding the finished goods  production capacity by approximately 400 000 metric tons at its Poland facility  The investment will enable the facility to fully utilize its existing melt capacity  and continue expansion into higher margin wire rod and merchant products  The project will likely conclude by the end of fiscal 2020 On Nov 5  2018  the company completed the acquisition of certain U S  rebar steel mills and 33 fabrication facilities from Gerdau S A  The buyout added 2 5 million tons of rebar capacity as well as increased fabrication capacity by almost 50   This gives a dominant share to Commercial Metals in the U S  rebar market  Consequently  the company will have an expanded geographic presence in the nation s largest construction region Hurdles to CounterInflationary pressure on manufacturing costs due to a tighter labor market and consumable raw material prices will drag down the company s margins  Furthermore  its debt to equity ratio has shot up  following the acquisition of certain U S  rebar steel mill and fabrication assets from Gerdau S A  Higher debt levels and interest expenses  hence  are other concerns for Commercial Metals Bottom LineInvestors might want to hold on to the stock  at present  as it has ample prospects of outperforming peers in the near future Stocks to ConsiderA

futures on Comex dropped  3 4 or 0 2  to settle at  1 453 70 per announce  This marked the four straight session of price decline and the lowest settlement for an active contract since Aug 1 However  recent softness in gold prices may be a good entry point  Trade related conflict between the United States and China is far from being completely settled  Meanwhile  a slowing pace of U S  economic growth and global economic downturn are near term concerns Trade Tussle ContinuesOn Nov 12  President Donald Trump delivered a speech at the Economic Club of New York  where he said a U S  China trade deal  could happen soon   and added that a phase one agreement is  close   The partial trade deal was scheduled to be signed by both sides in mid November  However  it has already been postponed to next month At the same time  he threatened more tariff hikes on Chinese imports if the trade negotiation fails to produce an interim agreement  Trump has categorically mentioned that he would only accept the interim trade deal if the agreement worked to the advantage of U S  workers and businesses In a strong statement  he said  since China s entrance into the World Trade Organization in 2001  no one has manipulated better or taken advantage of the United States more    I will not say the word  cheated   but nobody s cheated better than China  I will say that  On Nov 8  President Donald Trump told reports that he hasn t agreed so far to roll back the  existing tariffs in phases that his administration imposed on Chinese goods over the past one and half years  Moreover  senior U S

Sep 19  the Organization of Economic Co Operation and Development  OECD   projected that the world economy will grow just 2 9  in 2019  the lowest forecast since 2009  The OECD had forecast 4  global growth in 2019 just 18 months ago Notably  China s third quarter 2019 GDP growth came in at 6   the lowest in 27 and half years  Several large economies of Eurozone  Japan and certain emerging markets

conflict between the United States and China is far from being completely settled  Meanwhile  slowing pace of U S  economic growth and global economic downturn are near term concerns Against the backdrop of these headwinds  market participants are widely expecting a third rate cut by the Fed this month  Lower interest rates decrease the opportunity cost of holding non yielding bullion  making gold cheaper for investors holding other currencies  Buying pressure on gold is likely to remain firm as investors will focus on precious metals as a store of wealth and hedge against market turmoil   Slowing Pace of U S  Economic GrowthThe U S  GDP in the second quarter of 2019 was 2   well below the 3 1  rate achieved in the first quarter  What is more important is that  the latest estimation of the Atlanta Fed released on Oct 17  reported just 1 8  GDP growth for the third quarter U S  retail sales in September fell 0 3   its first decline since February  Core retail sales declined 0 1   Core retail sales data is highly correlated to the consumer spending component of the U S  GDP  which constitutes 66 70  of the country s economy Moreover  U S  manufacturing  which constitutes 12  of its GDP  contracted in the last two months  Lingering tariff war with China raised input costs for high end U S  products  resulting in slowing business investment  Furthermore  labor market  which remained robust despite trade jitters also witnessed lower job growth in September Global Economic DownturnOn Oct 15  The International Monetary Fund  IMF  reduced its growth forecasts for the global economy for 2019 and 2020  It predicts growth of 3  for 2019  down from its previous forecast of 3 2   The world economy is expected to witness slight growth in 2020  lower than its previous projection of 3 5   Moreover  the World Bank also squeezed its global growth forecast for 2019 to 2 6  from the previously forecast 2 7  growth   On Sep 19  the Organization of Economic Co Operation and Development  OECD   projected that the world economy will grow just 2 9  in 2019  the lowest forecast since 2009  The OECD had forecast 4  global growth in 2019 just 18 months ago Notably  China s third quarter 2019 GDP growth came in at 6   lowest in 27 and half years  Several large economies of Eurozone  Japan and various emerging markets are also suffering from lower export demand due to the prolonged trade conflict between the two largest trading countries of the world Will Fed Opt for Third Rate Cut in October On Oct 8  Jerome Powell gave signals of a possible third rate cut this month  The FOMC is scheduled to meet on Oct 29 30  The central bank already reduced the benchmark lending interest rate by 50 basis points in two equal tranches in July and September  Rate cut happened for the first time in more than 11 years  Notably  as of Oct 24  the CME FedWatch assigned 93 5  probability of a 25 basis point rate cut in October while just 6 5  expects status quo to be maintained Powell cited a slowdown in the job growth rate and muted inflation along with global economic slowdown  due to the U S  China trade war  as the primary reasons for a likely third rate cut this year in

119590,341105,AEM,Gold Perks Up But It s Not Out Of The Woods  XAU  GDX  KL  AEM  NEM,opinion,"Overall  gold has a decent chance of breaking to new highs over the coming months  Yet whether is opts for direct gains or morphs into a prolonged  complex correction could become clear over the next week 




The breakout from the bearish corrective channel on Friday threw a spanner in the works with its bearish pinbar   Whilst this warned of a bull trap  bears struggled to push it lower this week we ve seen another higher low  Whilst this suggests there s demand around the 1475 1480 area  it s touch and go as to whether prices can lift off from here 
Technically  there s two variations of a bullish scenario would could play out  The former requires direct gains  the other could see the correction drag out before the rally truly resumes 
We ve seen the end an ABC correction at 1459  and a break above 1520 assumes we re in wave 3 of an impulsive move  which should break to new high   However  we d need to see bullish momentum return soon and exhibit a directional move associated with a wave 3Or  we re still in a complex correction  and the initial ABC move which terminated at 1459 is the first zig zag of a larger  corrective pattern  This scenario becomes more likely if any break higher fizzles out and retreats lower once more

Still  whilst we wait for spot god to make up its mind  we re also tracking a potentially bullish move on GDX  NYSE GDX   gold miners index   Prices have recently broken out of a bullish wedge formation  a continuation pattern in an uptrend  and on the cusp of testing key resistance at 28 35  If successful  the pattern projects an initial target around the highs near 31 
Bulls could look for a break above 28 35 to assumes a run towards 30 36 Alternatively  if prices reverse  presumably  with gold  then a break of key support around 26 could provide an equally compelling short signal to bears 





Kirkland Lake Gold  TSX KL  CFD DTF 
A tidy correction has seen prices respect the 100 day eMA and compress within a symmetrical triangle formation  Given this is typically a continuation pattern  shows a bullish trend structure is and the 2nd best performer YTD from the top 10 GDX  NYSE GDX  constituents  our bias is for a bullish breakout 
Bulls could either wait for a break or daily close above the descending trendline  For added confirmation  wait for a break close above 47 80 Initial target is the 51 08 high but  due to the overall strength of the trend  we anticipate it to break to new highs if gold s rally resumes If gold struggles to break higher  we could see compression tighten further within the triangle  Unless of course gold rolls over  then it could spoil this otherwise textbook technical setup 





Agnico Eagle Mines  NYSE AEM  CFD DTF 
Strong earnings last week saw prices gap higher out of a bullish wedge pattern  If successful  the pattern projects an approximate target around the base of the pattern at 64 88  And if gold is to break to new highs then perhaps a run towards 70 and 73 are on the cards  the Sep  11 high   For now  momentum remains strong and support levels are nearby at 60 and 57 
Momentum traders could seek bullish setups on intraday timeframes If trading the daily chart  bulls could seek to buy dips around the 60 and 57 support levels The daily trend remains bullish above the 51 47 low  yet we wouldn t be seeking to buy sips if prices retrace to such a level  So we d probably step aside if it broken beneath 57 





Newcrest Mining Ltd  ASX NCM  CFD 
Newcrest is one to consider if the lust for gold fizzles out  Since its August peak  price action became erratic and choppy which itself can be the clues for a top  In mid October  bears drove it beneath 32 into a small bearish flag before breaking beneath the 100 day eMA and heading for the June lows  Whilst the 200 day eMA is holding as support  momentum favours the bear camp and a bearish trend structure 
The bias remains bearish whilst prices trade below the 32 34 resistance zone  therefor the current bounce is assumed to be correctiveBears can fade into rallies beneath the resistance zone  assuming an eventual break to new low Alternatively  wait for a break below 30  as this will invalidate the 200 day eMA and take it to a fresh cycle low",2019-11-01,Matt Simpson,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gold-perks-up-but-its-not-out-of-the-woods-xau-gdx-kl-aem-nem-200481180,200481180

119592,341107,AEM,Gold  A Go Go Or A No Go ,opinion,"There ve been quite the array of excitable headlines running across the spectrum by our great and good gold writing colleagues these many weeks  and rightly so  the yellow metal  were we are year end today  having put in its best performance   18 1   since 2010   29 5   
And yet from the  Au Contraire  Mon Fr re Dept   in looking at the above Gold Scoreboard  price in the broad sense has the appearance of merely flatlining across the last 13 weeks  should you be so inclined to count the weekly dots on the line  
Moreover  we ve penned ad nausea  since Gold achieved our aggressive forecast high for this year back on 12 August at 1526  that such price has become Gold s trading centerpiece  Or some might more negatively couch it as trading resistance  because for the 58 trading days since then  Gold has settled above 1526 but 13 times and below that level 45 times  including yesterday  Friday  with price closing out the week at 1517 
Still  with 10 months plus one trading day now in the books for 2019  one can t complain about Gold s performance this year  in spite of  also per the above Gold Scoreboard  the supply adjusted  currency debased valuation now being 2981  nearly double present price     and exclusive of the usual overshoot upon the inevitable regression to that  mean   But until the wee percentage of Gold owners expands  we ought accept a year like this one as pretty darn good 
To be sure  there ve been ruminations of Gold tapping 1600 by this year s end   that d be another  5 5  run from here  yet there are but eight full trading weeks remaining in 2019  the technical resistance of 1526 seemingly keeping the lid on price and further fundamental impetus  beyond now being the so called start of the  Gold buying season   let alone Gold being excessively undervalued as noted  not as yet driving new buyers to the fore  That stated  from this time a year ago into 2018 s end  Gold ran up nearly 100 points  from 1192 to 1285  i e   7 8    but hardly was that on the heels of a robust year to such point  Then fast forward to just two weeks ago when we cited price as perhaps coiling to spring higher  And yet Gold s journey since then has been only from 1493 to today s 1517  not much impressive boing in that spring 
So given all of that  plus it being month s end and one trading day  we find the order of the BEGOS Markets by their standings essentially unaltered since their end of September rankings   only Copper and the Swiss franc having meekly swapped positions   Thus again we find Gold in third place on the podium with Silver on the steps thereto  And  Oh  that Dollar strength   which is so bandied about  what are they tawkin  about  Look at the standings  chump 





To Gold s weekly bars we go  And from one year ago to date  obviously the two blue dotted parabolic Long trends have been the power moves  whilst the two red dotted parabolic Short trends rather appear as shallow pauses  And Long or Short  they ve all been lengthy  which    should such typical duration continue for this current Short trend    Gold ain t goin  nowhere for awhile  barring the kicking in of seasonal buying and or coily springy boingy and or  The World Ends  Dow Up 2  





What does appear on track to ending is the economy  if solely by the track of the Economic Barometer  Now obviously the StateSide headline numbers are fairly sound stuff given  much better than expected  readings of  1 9  for Q3 s first read on Gross Domestic Product and October s payroll data  plus prior months  upside revisions thereto  Also  September s Construction Spending improved  But the  inside the numbers  data isn t as pretty  For October  readings from both the Institute for Supply Management on manufacturing and the Chicago Purchasing Managers Index continued in contraction mode  the Federal Open Market Committee s favourite read of inflation  Core Personal Consumption Expenditures   was one big zero  and September s growth in Personal Income slowed whilst Personal Spending didn t increase its pace  As well  a fresh survey by the National Association for Business Economics indicates that business hiring is at a seven year low     although a key phenomenon therein is that essentially full employment is making it difficult to find folks not already working 
 Course  we did get the well anticipated FedFunds  0 25  rate cut  now down into the 1 50  to 1 75  target range with little outlook for anything further  Nonetheless  it all makes the stock market happy  the S P 500 further launching to an all time high  now at 3066  Just let s not bring up the subject of earnings  as their season for Q3 rolls along with well over half of the mighty 500 constituents having reported  74  of them have beaten the broker s marketing tool known as  estimates   but the reality is that only 65  have  bettered  their earnings over the like period of a year ago     never is that mentioned   except herein   As for our  live  calculation of the Index s price earnings ratio   tis at present 32 1x   comparably  Bob Shiller s CAPE is a nearby 30 3x   And bearing in mind graphically that  tis the red line  S P 500  that historically finds its way to the blue line  Econ Baro   here s the year over year picture 

 But  mmb  money is so cheap you can borrow it to buy stock and end up way ahead    

And Squire  that strategy has been working great  from stock buybacks to margin jacks  until the day it shan t  But we ve witnessed even far better leverage out there as we turn to our year over year view of Gold s percentage track along with those of key metals equities  From this date a year ago  the S P 500 is basically  12   recall the 20  correction into last year s end   you can even add in 2  for yield and that s  14   But take a look at Agnico Eagle Mines  NYSE AEM    tis  63   Franco Nevada  TSX FNV  is  49   and the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners exchange traded fund  NYSE GDX  is  43   Other sterling performers include the Global X Silver Miners  NYSE SIL   28    Newmont Mining  Goldcorp  NYSE NEM   24   and Gold itself  23   Even oft lagging  Pan American Silver Corp   NASDAQ PAAS  is  11    And from the  Hint Hint Nudge Nudge Elbow Elbow Dept    the Gold Silver ratio remains a whoppingly high 83 7x   Here s the overall graphic 





Next as we zoom in on Gold near term we ve our two panel look at price s daily bars from three months ago to date on the left and the 10 day Market Profile on the right  And if Gold s baby blue dots of linear regression consistency appear completely lacking thereto  we ought not be surprised  across the panel s entirety price is basically congested  Today  Gold is right where  twas three months back  from which it has been up a bit and down a bit and all about a bit  That s it  Trading supports are as denoted in the Profile 





The like layout for Sister Silver places her up a bit more  at left  than is Gold  although her recent  Baby Blues  are  at best  a mess  Similarly we see her denoted trading supports in the Profile  at right  





All of which brings us to the Gold Structure since 2011 s All Time High of 1923   As these are monthly bars  the rightmost one is merely the one trading day we ve thus far had in November   Of note  after having made higher monthly highs in each of June  July  August and September  Gold could not manage same for October  Also  note that October s low was right down to the base of  The Floor   but not through it  we thus take some technical solace from that  Sure   twould be nice if Gold could press up to close out the year in the  on maneuvers  sector  but  tis so dubbed for a reason as price therein per the leftmost portion of the graphic is simply all over the place 





So there  tis  ten months of 2019 in the bag with two months to go   or for Brexit  three months to go  the deadline having just been extended to 31 January   We shan t work in December  December is a holiday    Then call it a  holimonth   As for Gold  the year to here has been  cue The Miracles from  65   Going to a Go Go   but given price stallage  congestion  and  The Fed is done  digestion  does go go from here rather morph into year s end as no go  Nobody knows  But broadly we know Gold s the best show  And well worth the Gold label  that ",2019-11-03,Mark Mead Baillie,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gold-a-gogo-or-a-nogo-200481600,200481600

119633,341148,AEM,5 Gold Stocks To Buy On October s Rate Cut Hope,opinion,Gold prices moved downward for nearly one month after witnessing an impressive rally in during the June September period  However  recent softness in gold prices may be a good entry point for another rally expected from the beginning of next month  Trade related conflict between the United States and China is far from being completely settled  Meanwhile  slowing pace of U S  economic growth and global economic downturn are near term concerns Against the backdrop of these headwinds  market participants are widely expecting a third rate cut by the Fed this month  Lower interest rates decrease the opportunity cost of holding non yielding bullion  making gold cheaper for investors holding other currencies  Buying pressure on gold is likely to remain firm as investors will focus on precious metals as a store of wealth and hedge against market turmoil   Slowing Pace of U S  Economic GrowthThe U S  GDP in the second quarter of 2019 was 2   well below the 3 1  rate achieved in the first quarter  What is more important is that  the latest estimation of the Atlanta Fed released on Oct 17  reported just 1 8  GDP growth for the third quarter U S  retail sales in September fell 0 3   its first decline since February  Core retail sales declined 0 1   Core retail sales data is highly correlated to the consumer spending component of the U S  GDP  which constitutes 66 70  of the country s economy Moreover  U S  manufacturing  which constitutes 12  of its GDP  contracted in the last two months  Lingering tariff war with China raised input costs for high end U S  products  resulting in slowing business investment  Furthermore  labor market  which remained robust despite trade jitters also witnessed lower job growth in September Global Economic DownturnOn Oct 15  The International Monetary Fund  IMF  reduced its growth forecasts for the global economy for 2019 and 2020  It predicts growth of 3  for 2019  down from its previous forecast of 3 2   The world economy is expected to witness slight growth in 2020  lower than its previous projection of 3 5   Moreover  the World Bank also squeezed its global growth forecast for 2019 to 2 6  from the previously forecast 2 7  growth   On Sep 19  the Organization of Economic Co Operation and Development  OECD   projected that the world economy will grow just 2 9  in 2019  the lowest forecast since 2009  The OECD had forecast 4  global growth in 2019 just 18 months ago Notably  China s third quarter 2019 GDP growth came in at 6   lowest in 27 and half years  Several large economies of Eurozone  Japan and various emerging markets are also suffering from lower export demand due to the prolonged trade conflict between the two largest trading countries of the world Will Fed Opt for Third Rate Cut in October On Oct 8  Jerome Powell gave signals of a possible third rate cut this month  The FOMC is scheduled to meet on Oct 29 30  The central bank already reduced the benchmark lending interest rate by 50 basis points in two equal tranches in July and September  Rate cut happened for the first time in more than 11 years  Notably  as of Oct 24  the CME FedWatch assigned 93 5  probability of a 25 basis point rate cut in October while just 6 5  expects status quo to be maintained Powell cited a slowdown in the job growth rate and muted inflation along with global economic slowdown  due to the U S  China trade war  as the primary reasons for a likely third rate cut this year in order to honor the pledge to do the needful to sustain U S  economic expansion Our Top PicksAt this stage  it will be prudent to invest in gold stocks with strong growth potential  We have narrowed down our search to five such stocks

119725,341240,AEM,Cheap For A Reason  Osisko Gold Royalties And Fortuna,opinion,"Osisko Gold Ro   TSX OR   OR TSX  OR NYSE  US 9 69  has moved further away from the pure royalty model with the acquisition of Bakerville Gold Mines for equity valued  at the time of the bid  at CA 338 million  Based on the August PEA  preliminary economic assessment  on Bakerville s Cariboo project in British Columbia  this is an acquisition price of 0 6 times net present value  Osisko  which already held 33  of Bakerville  says it intends to develop the project and then monetize it   ultimately   when the junior market improves 
At the same time  Osisko announced it had formed the North Spirit Discovery Group  intended to develop and finance projects in Canada  in conjunction with joint venture partners or private equity  Few details were revealed 
Royalties or Development  Which Is Primary 
Though the Bakerville acquisition is accretive to net assets it does reduce cash flow per share more importantly to us  it moves Osisko away from the pure royalty model  It has long been a hybrid  with its increasingly important  accelerator model   But rather than financing a junior in exchange for royalties  it increasingly seems to be using royalty revenue to acquire and develop projects  It is fair to say that CEO Sean Roosen is a mine builder at heart  he and his team built Canadian Malartic  one of the largest mines in the country  They lost the mine after a hostile takeover fight initiated by Goldcorp Inc   eventually selling to Agnico Eagle Mines  NYSE AEM  and  Yamana Gold   NYSE AUY   YRI TSX  AUY NYSE  YAU LSE  in exchange for an attractive royalty  the foundation of Osisko Gold Royalties  We agree with Roosen when he says that there are tremendous opportunities in Canada and that the industry has underspent on exploration  drilling and development 
Good Deal  but Increased Risk 
So this opportunistic acquisition may be a good deal  but it adds to the risk at a royalty company that was already a higher risk company than its peers  Because of this  it has traded at lower multiples than other royalty companies  Now the risk is increased  and so too is the justifiable discount at which it should trade  From  12 25 per share at the beginning of the week  the stock plunged after the deal was announced to close at  9 70 
This is overdone  and Osisko can be bought here  but no longer with the expectation that the valuation gap should completely close over time 
New Mine and Saving Another 
In other recent developments  Osisko saw the first gold pour at  Victoria Gold Corp   TSXV VIT  Eagle Gold Mine in the Yukon  on which it holds a 5  royalty  This is a successful example of the company s accelerator model 
It also announced the successful completion of a restructuring of Stornoway Diamond  TSX SWY   with other creditors  Osisko acquires Stornoway  on whose Renard mine it holds a 9 6  stream  Renard  which continues to operation  represents about 3  of Osisko s royalty revenue  so again  this is a significant investment  which may prove successful but deviates from the royalty model 
Not unexpectedly   Pretium Resources   TSX PVG   PVG TSX  PVG NYSE  bought back an offtake agreement from Osisko  following its repurchase of a royalty on its Brucejack Mine  This is a bad result for Osisko since the offtake was a low margin asset after losing the royalty  and adds over US 40 million to the cash balance  Together with an increase in its credit facility  to  400 million   this puts the company in a strong position  with about CA 525 million liquidity by year end 
More Risk and Lower Valuation Than Peers 
Osisko is a dynamic company  with two foundational cash flowing royalties  Malartic and Eleonore   other cash flowing assets  and an increasing pipeline  it has a strong balance sheet  and aggressive and technically strong management  But it carries significantly higher risk than a traditional royalty company  risk that appears to be increasingly not diminishing  So it should trade at a discount to pure royalty companies 
But its current value of price to book of 1 2x  and price to free cash flow of 24x  with a yield of 1 6   compares very favorably with  say  industry leader Franco Nevada Corporation  TSX FNV   FNV TSX  FNV NYSE  multiples of 3 6x book  35x cash flow  the free cash flow number is distorted for this year   and a yield of less than 1 1   Franco remains our core holding  but Osisko is a buy at this level 
Fortuna s Next Mine Nearly There 
Fortuna Silver Mines Inc   FSM NYSE  FVI TSX  FVI BVL  F4S FSE  US 3 27  has announced the start of pre production mining at its Lindero gold project  another milestone toward first gold pour in the first quarter of 2020  In building the mine  Fortuna experienced a modest delay and cost overrun  largely due to unusually heavy rains which flooded the road to the site  But the mine is well on its way to completion  70  complete as of the end of August  The company s website includes a brief video showing the progress on site  Guidance for the mine to produce 145 000 to 160 000 ounces of gold in its first 12 months remains  and representing nearly half of the company s free cash flow by 2021  after the ramp up is complete 
Earlier in the month  Fortuna issued a convertible debenture with interest of 4 65   raising  40 million  The funding was not necessary to complete construction at Lindero  but Fortuna  a very conservative company  wanted a minimum of  50 million cash on hand until Lindero is successfully producing 
Argentina Risk 
Fortuna has three strong mines  long life and a high grade silver mines in Peru and Mexico  respectively  in addition to Lindero   a strong balance sheet  and technically strong and conservative management  The problem is that Lindero is in Argentina  The opposition  with former president Christina Kirchner as running mate on the presidential ticket  is expected to win next month s election handsomely  bringing concerns of a return to the disastrous economic policies of her administration  After a win in a primary election  the peso has collapsed  leading supposedly pro market president Marci to introduce capital controls and renegotiate the terms of much outstanding debt  Although presidential front runner Fernandez has made some placating sounds  there are concerns that the country will see higher inflation  export controls  and another debt crisis 
All this has real impact  Fortuna s VAT refund after mine completion may turn out to be considerably less  in dollar terms  than what it paid  for example  while inflation will lead to higher wages at the mine  and most important  export controls may limit what it can take out of the country in dollars  Since it has  more or less  completed its construction costs  it is now in no need of pesos in the country  In addition to the reality is the perception  which will affect investors  willingness to hold companies heavily exposed to the country 
Buy     and Trade 
Unfortunately  this could get a lot worse before it gets better  so we expect Fortuna to trade below comparable valuations for other growing producers  From  4 33 per share at the beginning of the month to  3 27 today  the stock  already undervalued as discussed in our previous write up  is discounting most of the risks  At this price  it is trading at only 85  of book  with a cash flow multiple of 7 5 times  At today s level  Fortuna is a buy and a strong one  We do expect further volatility as the Argentina situation develops  so you should be ready to trim positions on rallies  and add on any shocks that may come along

119753,341268,AEM,Agnico Eagle Mines  Imminent Return To Free Cash Flow Generation,opinion,"Agnico Eagle Mines Limited  NYSE AEM   AEM or the Company  is a senior gold producer that operates in low political risk jurisdictions with a quality mineral reserve base  The Company has a track record of strong operational performance and has beaten production and cost guidance for seven consecutive years  AEM is nearing completion of a large Nunavut expansion  the Meliadine mine and Amaruq project   which is expected to drive growth in gold production from 1 75Moz in 2019 to 2 0Moz in 2020  A return to free cash flow generation is anticipated in H219 with capex expected to decline significantly as AEM moves to  harvest mode  
Production and cost guidance maintained
AEM has reiterated its full year production guidance of 1 75Moz  which we believe it is likely to achieve with a contribution of c 230koz from Meliadine  including c 47 3oz of pre commercial production  and c 130koz from Amaruq  In addition  the company expects total cash costs and all in sustaining costs  AISC  for FY19 of US 620 670 oz and US 875 925 oz  respectively  albeit the guidance for total capital costs has increased from c US 660m to US 750m  mainly as a result of lower pre commercial production gold sales credited against capital at Meliadine  the advancement of underground development at Amaruq in the wake of positive exploration results and modifications to the Meliadine saline water treatment system  owing to the earlier than expected receipt of a discharge permit  
H219 a cash flow inflection point for AEM
The current year marks an inflection point for Agnico  as capital expenditure falls away sharply at the same time as production increases  resulting in a return to free cash flow generation from H219 onwards  Once production of 2 0Moz is achieved in FY20  moderate growth to an annualised production rate of 2 2 2 3Moz is expected  bringing with it the potential for increases in the dividend from the current level of c US 0 125 per quarter  Even with an increased dividend  we would expect AEM to repay its US 1 7bn in net debt  equating to 26 6  gearing or 36 3  leverage  at end June 2019 by FY22 
Consensus estimates
At the current gold price  we estimate AEM will achieve the lower half of its consensus forecast EPS range for FY19 of US 0 68 1 08 sh  with some of the operational improvements in H219 offset by higher financing and amortisation charges  All other things being equal  however  we expect it to achieve close to the consensus EPS estimate of US 1 45 sh in FY20  range US 0 82 2 27 sh

119782,341297,AEM,The Gold Update  Contango And Tariffs And Fed Oh My,opinion,"If as a trader you found this past week to be boring  then  tis time to hang it up there  Bunky 
Or if on the other hand you suffered from an overdose of analysis paralysis  then hey  we just entered the Dog Days of August  nuthin s gonna happen  so take go take a break   you shan t miss anything  right   Not  
Let s first just stand back for a moment and take a high level look at the track of Gold in the above Scoreboard  Following five weeks of flatlining  Gold finally got off the schneid and gained 2 4    34 points    Twas Gold s best week since that ending 22 June 
 But mmb  they added 13 points of that  contango  thing into the price    
Indeed  they   those who don t wish to perhaps pay more for Gold by waiting until December  did  Squire  Yet even exclusive of that  Gold s gain for the week was 1 5    21 points   still its best performance since that same date  And from an annual perspective  Gold s having settled out the week yesterday  Friday  at 1453 puts price 8 3  above where  twas at this point in 2016  14 9  above where now  twas in 2017  and 18 9  above this date a year ago  That ain t bad  you know 
But as a single adjective to describe the state of the BEGOS Markets spectrum  bond   euro   gold   oil   S P  this past week   twould be  FRAGILE   Be it Federal Reserve Bank Chair Powell sucking the excitement from traders  expectations for multiple rate cuts by instead citing the FedFunds 0 25  rate reduction as merely a  mid cycle adjustment   or be it renewed TrumpTariffTweets  or be it the unspoken truth that earnings are not maintaining their tax cut growth pace    indeed all three of those catalysts    the BEGOS bunch went careening all over the place  As measured against each component s  expected weekly trading range  in points  here s what they actually traced  exceeding the expected in every case 
  Bond  expected 2 5 32  actual 4 17 32   110    week s change  2 8 
  Euro  expected 0 01235  actual 0 01385   12    week s change  0 3 
  Gold  expected 37 7  actual 49 8   32    week s change  2 4 
  Oil  expected 4 12  actual 5 23   27    week s change  1 7 
  S P  expected 67 75  actual 114   68    week s change  2 9 
 Tis said traders love volatility  and yet  be still thy beating heart  for the dogs in these August days may be    instead of the usual sleepy summer bassets    high speed whippets 





And whipped higher per the weekly bars here we ve Gold from this time a year ago  the parabolic Long trend now 10 weeks in duration   the prior Long one having been 24 weeks followed by the wimpy Short trend of 13 weeks    Tis tempting to scale the chart upward to show  as in the Scoreboard  our  aggressive  forecast high for this year of 1526  However as we ve noted throughout recent missives  this mid 1400s area was price consternative back in April May 2013  something which traders may not recall  but which algorithms have in core memory  That cited  should we see firm trading  round 1490  then 1526 becomes very viable before the year is out  indeed quite swiftly so from 1490  But for the present  here are the year over year weeklies 





Year over year as well  here we ve Gold s percentage track along with those of key precious metals equities from best improvement to least  the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners exchange traded fund  GDX  is  33   Agnico Eagle Mines  AEM  is  31   Franco Nevada  FNV  is  23   Gold itself as noted is  19   the Global X Silver Miners exchange traded fund  SIL  is now positive at  3   Newmont Mining Goldcorp  NYSE NEM  is  2   and Pan American Silver  PAAS  which year over year a month ago was  26   has roared back to now just  2   What a difference one month can make  eh 
As well it being month end plus two trading days into August  here s how the BEGOS Markets stand year to date  And remember Silver s being perennially buried in last place   Not anymohhhrrre     
Now to the ever descending Economic Barometer  the broad implication for which ought be an ever ascending Gold price  driven as ever by debased currencies  But did the Fed really need to cut  After all  our recent first peek at Q2 Gross Domestic Product put annualized growth at  2 1   The average GDP growth during the three years of the Fed s rate hike cycle from December 2015 through December 2018 was  2 4   thus we ve slowed a bit  But  tis interesting to see the Fed appearing more proactive than reactive  perhaps a bit of elbowing from Pennsylvania Avenue to the lads and lasses over there on Constitution Avenue  In fact our real concern remains the graphical difference between the high level of the S P 500 and low level of the Econ Baro  To be sure  the Great Tax Cut of 2018 has run its course with respect to corporate earnings  Thus far in Q2 Earnings Season with 361 of the S P 500 companies having reported  only 65  have bettered their bottom lines from a year ago  That compares in 2018 to 85  having bettered their Q2 over those of pre tax cut 2017  As to our  live  price earnings ratio for the S P  34 1x   Yikes  ad nausea  And lying in wait is the signature to approve some  1 3 trillion in additional StateSide debt  Got Gold    Dumb question  that  Here s the Baro 





On to our two panel graphic of Gold s daily bars from three months ago to date on the left and the 10 day Market Profile on the right  And seeing the baby blue dots of linear regression trend consistency themselves having turned erratic  be wary of price swings  too  turning dramatic  Again  Gold is now up into that aforementioned mid 1400s area of consternation from six years ago  so  tis critical through here to prudently manage one s cash  Helpful may be the Market Ranges page at the website  And as for guidance from the Profile  its line in the sand now stands at 1440 
Silver s like display is more daunting  Yes  she s out accelerated Gold of late on the upside  which she provenly can so do on the downside  And per her  Baby Blues   at left   they ve just kinked beneath their  80 horizontal axis which technically suggests lower levels are coming per the table at the foot of the graphic  Moreover  price is now below the Profile s dominant trading apex  at right  of 16 45  How low might Sister Silver go  Structural support is in the mid 15s 





For this week s wrap with another month in the books  here is Gold s broad based structure chart by the monthly bars since September 2011 s All Time High  And  tis been years since this chart has looked this good   which for you superstitious WestPalmBeachers down there means  tis all over   Gold on Friday reached up to 1462  just four wee points from poking its head above the  sous sol   basement  to peek out upon The Floor at 1466  that zone not traded since 09 May 2013  which for those of you scoring at home was 1 570 sessions ago   Now if Silver does indeed pull back through here  it may be some time as well before we ll see Gold
 Dancing on The Floor 
   Third World   81   But keep those shoes shined  for the party is inevitable

119794,341309,AEM,4 Gold Stocks To Buy As Gold Prices Reach 6 Year High,opinion,Gold prices are currently trending above  1 500 an ounce   at levels last seen in 2013  The latest tit for tat tariffs by the United States and China in their year long trade war  losses in stock market  decline in yield on the 10 year U S  Treasury note to below 2  and a weaker dollar have collectively helped lift the yellow metal s investment appeal Trade War Tensions Still Rife  A Positive for GoldThe US China trade war has dramatically escalated in the past week  On Aug 23  China hiked tariff on U S  goods worth  75 billion and announced it will raise import duties on U S  made autos and auto parts  In retaliation  President Trump tweeted that starting Oct 1   250 billion of Chinese goods will be taxed at 30   up from the prior 25   Trump also raised the tariff on  300 billion of Chinese goods to 15  from 10   effective Sep 1 Consequently  investors  hopes for progress on U S  China trade talks faded  Stock markets tumbled on apprehensions that elevated tariffs will add to global economic weakness  The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0 47  to close at 25 777 90  The S P 500 fell 0 32  to close at 2869 16 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 0 34  to finish at 7826 95  The 10 year Treasury note yield slipped to 1 49    its lowest since July 2016  This caused the dollar index  which measures the greenback s value against a basket of six major currencies  to slide   Sales of new U S homes witnessed a drop of 12 8  to 635 000 new homes in July from June s revised rate of 728 000 and projected figure of 647 000 units   So far this year  new home sales have risen just 4 1   reflecting ongoing weakness in the housing market despite the reduction in mortgage rates All these developments led to a renewed surge in gold prices  which had been enjoying a bullish run so far this year  Gold prices have been up 19 4  so far this year on account of a dovish Fed  doubts about the

4 Toxic Stocks to Dump or Sell Short to Avoid Losses
Accurate identification of correctly priced stocks is the key to successful investing  However  in reality  overpriced toxic stocks and rightly priced stocks are mixed in such a manner that it is tough to distinguish between the two 
Generally overhyped toxic stocks are vulnerable to outside shocks  Moreover  these stocks are burdened with a high level of debt  The price of these stocks is artificially inflated  Nonetheless  the higher price of toxic stocks is only temporary in nature as it is higher than its intrinsic value 
Investors are likely to benefit from precise identification of toxic stocks with the help of an investing strategy called short selling  This strategy allows investors to sell a stock first and then buy it when price falls 
While short selling excels in bear markets  it typically loses money in bull markets 
So  accurately identifying toxic stocks and discarding or short selling those at the right time is the key to protect your portfolio from big losses

119818,341333,AEM,Gold   Another Week  Another Milestone,opinion,"Two weeks ago Gold  finally  surpassed the long sought level of Base Camp 1377  check off that milestone box 
Then during this past week  Gold met  per the above opening Scoreboard  our  conservative  forecast high for this year of 1434  check off  that  milestone box 
 You re making this sound like Gold can never go back down through those levels  mmb    
Setbacks certainly do occur  Squire  To wit  Pluto was demoted from planetary status  Senator Clinton won but didn t  and Shrewsbury s Jesse Livermore went from  0 to  100 000 000 to  0  It happens 
Indeed following Gold s monumental setback from the years 2011 through 2015  price then spent 2016 through 2018 directionlessly thrashing about as would a wayward weasel upon a heat shimmerin  Georgia highway  But come this year amongst Fed musings of rate relenting  recognition of the Economic Barometer s sliding for a full year   Chair Powell himself noting this past week to the Council on Foreign Relations that the economy is facing growing uncertainties   dashes of geopolitical discourse  the 3Ds of Debasement  Debt and Derivatives actually making mainstream media coverage   plus we d like to think our weekly reminding that Gold today  ought be  at nearly 3000 simply to get re aligned with the StateSide money supply   and      Jump back  Loretta      Gold in 2019 is getting a bone fide bid   Tis clearly the case since price vaulted up outta The Box  1280 1240  just five weeks for a gain since then  from 1280 through this past week s high at 1442  of 12 7  before settling yesterday  Friday  at 1413 
The point is  as we herein pointedly pointed out last week  Gold shan t rise in straight line perpetuity   Twill go up and  twill go down  But the key now is for Base Camp 1377 to prove its mettle in morphing from essentially three years of resistance back into support as was its stance during May June 2013 following Gold s fall from grace   before it all then really went off the cliff to as low as 1045 on 03 December 2015   But price now having retaken 1377 is a milestone  as is having reached 1434  Here are the weekly bars from a year ago to date 

Note  too  that the week s settle of 1413 is a full 2 0  beneath the 1442 high  Again per last week s missive and the website s daily Prescient Commentary  we ve been pointing to Gold s being some 100 points  high  vis   vis its smooth valuation line  per the Market Values page   so that 2 0  retrenchment is not untoward a bit  Rather   tis all now about Base Camp 1377 being supportive should it be tested 
 But what about looking up the road  mmb  
Squire  let s briefly review as to why we selected 1434 as our  conservative  high for not just this year  achieved  but as well as for last year  not achieved   Nearly six years ago on 28 August 2013  Gold reached up to tag 1434  only to have beneath that level ever since  until just this past week  Every trading algorithm from Bangor  Maine to Honolulu and right  round the rest of the world knows that  Further with respect 1434  here s what we wrote in closing out December 2017  for it has played out    albeit a year and a half later    to a tee 
    at 1377 we look for the fun to begin  You know the old trading expression that  Triple tops are meant to be broken   As price closes in on 1377   twouldn t surprise us a wit see a zillion buy stops hit the market just in or above there  That  in turn  ought open the top fuel dragstrip for the nitro burning drive back above 1400  the finish line being a retest of 1434 for the year s high     Bingo  it just happened   plus a l il overshoot to 1442   and smack in the face of the  barberous relic  never Gold nattering nabobs of negativism 
Moreover  as you day counters well understand  1 977 trading days ago marked Gold s highest ever closing price   twas exactly 1900 on 22 August 2011  And as we next update our chart of Gold s pricing by the  100s     as mathematically remains the case  cause we ain t revisited above here    there s been comparatively scant little trading from the 1400s up to the 1600s   

   and you know the other old saying   All gaps get filled   well  almost all do   Either way  from here in the 1400s up to the 1600s  as you can see there s quite a lot of pricing gap to  fill in   so to speak 
So per Squire s question in looking up the road  beyond 1434 as next shown here in the Gold Structure chart is 1466 from which Gold can emerge from the basement   sous sol   up onto The Floor  that zone also incorporating our  aggressive  forecast high for this year of 1526  But first things first  barring further fundamental push  we now look for price to consolidate  round here  ideally staying north of Base Camp 1377  in turn allowing for some of the stretched technical measures to catch up  Here is the broad based structure chart of Gold by the month 

Next from the  It Goes Quickly Dept   we are reminded of Irma Bunt explaining to James Bond that  So  we are halfway     in transiting through the snow from the horse drawn buggy to the helicopter for the ascent up Switzerland s mighty Schilthorn     OHMSS  Eon Productions   69  as indeed the trading year already is half gone  We thus to turn our BEGOS Market Standings year to date  wherein we find Gold having gained a provisional podium place in third  but with Silver still comprehensively disrespected at the short end of the stack  the Gold Silver ratio now an inane 92 0x  Also note that the dollar is not down despite Gold s being  10   the yellow metal again reminding us that it plays no currency favourites 

As well it being month s end   tis time for our year over year percentage tracks chart of Gold vs  key of the precious metal equities  And at the sound recommendation of a cherished charter reader of The Gold Update  we ve added Agnico Eagle Mines  AEM  to the group  The company s  superb  management has expanded its one time mining operation to now seven bountiful locations  in turn graduating this once mid tier miner to one of senior status  And from a year ago to date  AEM has charted amongst the best of the bunch  which from top to bottom rank as follows  both Franco Nevada  NYSE FNV  and the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners exchange traded fund  GDX  NYSE GDX   are  17   AEM is  15   Gold itself is  13   and Newmont Mining  NYSE NEM  in the wake of taking on Goldcorp is  4   But as still Silver suffers  so do her equities  the Global X Silver Miners exchange traded fund  NYSE SIL  being  5   and Pan American Silver  NASDAQ PAAS  dreadfully  26       can you say  value    

As for the aforementioned Economic Barometer  beyond it getting affirmation this past week of Q1 Gross Domestic Product having grown at a  3 1  annual pace and May s Personal Income Spending remaining firm  there were some potholes  that month s New Home Sales slowed and Orders for Durable Goods again shrank  whilst June s Consumer Confidence materially waned and the Chicago Purchasing Managers Index slipped below the critical 50 level  indicative of contracting activity  Here s the Econ Baro  the red line of the S P 500 well overdue to rocket down toward the level of the Baro s blue line 

Toward this week s wrap  we drill down into the precious metals  pricing at present  First  for Gold in this two panel graphic are the daily bars with their  Baby Blues  on the left and the 10 day Market Profile on the right  And mind those blue dots  for upon their going under the  80  line  the rule of thumb is to then expect lower prices  which barring a surge from here would instead test the supportive mettle of Base Camp 1377  above which the last line in the sand per the Profile is 1387 

As for poor ole Sister Silver  her  Baby Blues   below left  have already crossed below the  80  axis  we re thus expective of a move that could test the high 14s  her Profile s  below right  lower supporter showing at 15 05 

So  another milestone for Gold in the new week  No  Rather we see churning throughout  punctuated perhaps by some reduction in volume given the StateSide holiday here come Thursday  which essentially works into a four day weekend for many a trader out there  But make no mistake  Gold these last two weeks having achieved as milestones both 1377 and 1434 marks the most material technical rise for the yellow metal following three years of endlessly flailing about  Enjoy the moment  weather the near term pullbacks  and we ll see what lies further up Gold s road before this year is out ",2019-06-30,Mark Mead Baillie,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gold--another-week-another-milestone-200435884,200435884

119862,341377,AEM,What Is In Store For The Precious Metals Sector In 2019  ,opinion,"The Newmont Goldcorp merger is the second mega deal in the industry after Barrick acquired Randgold in September  Without question  the two deals reflect the growing need for large gold and silver mining companies to replace reserves  which are being depleted at these two companies more quickly than they are being replenished  The deal will give Newmont access to Goldcorp s portfolio of developing and exploration projects acquired by Goldcorp over the last several years 
While this deal and the Barrick Randgold deal will help cover up the managerial  operational and financial warts on Barrick and Newmont  it will also likely stimulate an increase in M A activity in the industry  I believe that the other largest gold mining companies   Kinross   Yamana  AngloGold Ashanti  Gold Fields  Eldorado  and Agnico Eagle   will look closely at each other and at mid cap gold producers to see if they can create  synergistic  merger deals
The same  impulse  holds true for silver companies  the largest of which are diversifying into gold or acquiring competitors Pan American acquires Tahoe Resources and SRM Mining buys 9 9  of Silvercrest Metals  which will likely block First Majestic from going after Silvercrest  and Americas Silver buys Pershing Gold   Similarly  we could see mid cap producers merging with each other or acquiring the junior producers ",2019-01-22,David I.

119894,341409,AEM,Gold Stocks  Earnings Roster For April 26  NEM  AEM   EGO,opinion,Gold prices were supported by a weaker U S dollar and inflation in first quarter 2018  The Fed s rate hikes also aided gold prices which declined prior to its implementation in March but experienced gains thereafter  Further  Trump administration slapped a 25  tariff on steel imports and a 10  tariff on aluminum imports which triggered fears of a trade war and in turn helped gold prices prop up  Another development that rattled global markets was Trump s appointment of John Bolton  who is considered a foreign policy  hawk   as National Security Advisor  Bolton had previously advocated using military force against both North Korea and Iran  In fact  Bolton s appointment is a clear indication of the United States  aggressive stance toward its adversaries  The increasing geopolitical tensions added to the uncertainty increasing the safe haven appeal of gold  This bolstered the gold prices in the quarter under review  All these recent developments and resulting volatility will continue to fuel gold prices as investors will shun risk assets such as equities and instead turn to gold  There are also plenty of reasons to be optimistic about gold s performance this earnings season and the rest of 2018  A number of new mines entered production in fourth quarter 2017  which might support mine production till 2018  On the demand side  major markets  India and its neighbor China will continue to be growth drivers  Last year  the Indian market had suffered a setback due to the impact of imposition of Good and Service Tax   GST   and anti money laundering legislation   AML   around jewelry retail transactions  We expect it to bounce back as the market adapts to GST  Pent up demand as well as festive buying is anticipated to boost demand for jewelry in the country  Moreover  government measures like mandatory hallmarking in 2018 is likely to be a positive for the industry  Further  the United States continues to be a strong market driven by economic growth  improving employment levels and growth in consumer confidence  Overall Earnings Picture Looks Good Per the Zacks Industry classification  the  industry is grouped under the Basic Material sector   one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors  The sector is currently placed at the top 19  out of the 16 Zacks sectors  and one of the sectors which is expected to record double digit earnings growth  According to our latest   the sector is anticipated to log an earnings growth of 41 0  in first quarter 2018 on the back of 19 8  rise in revenues  The overall earnings picture for all the S P500 members is encouraging this quarter  Total earnings for the S P 500 index are expected to be up 18 3  for this earnings season on the back of a 7 7  rise in revenues  If this materializes  it would surpass fourth quarter 2017 results where the S P 500 recorded 13 4  earnings growth on 8 6  revenue growth   the best quarterly performance in more than six years  Let s see what s in store for the gold miners that are set to report quarterly numbers on Apr 26  Newmont Mining Corporation   NYSE NEM   is one of the world s largest

119895,341410,AEM,BANG  Why These Gold Miners Could Soon Make FANG Look Tame,opinion,"I ve written recently about the FANG stocks and another popular group I call MCBM  Both trade at valuations that look extreme relative to their history  There s another group  though  that I have been watching that appears to be trading at a significant discount to its normal range over the past couple of decades 
This latter group I call BANG  Barrick Gold Corporation  NYSE ABX   Agnico Eagle Mines Limited  NYSE AEM   Newmont Mining Corporation  NYSE NEM  and Goldcorp Inc  NYSE GG   and I like the acronym not just because of the allusion to and juxtaposition with FANG but also due to the fact that rising gold prices could make for explosive gains in these stocks if their valuations begin to normalize at all 
The chart below plots the median enterprise value to revenues for the four stocks over the past 20 years  The thing that really jumps out at me is that BANG is currently cheaper today than it was in the early 2000 s at the end of the last major gold bear market when the price of the precious metal was fully  1 000 per ounce cheaper than it is today 

Some have argued that these stocks may deserve to trade at lower valuations today because the gold price has lost a third of its value over the past several years hurting profits  However  it looks as if the profitability of these companies is significantly better today than it was at the nadir of the last major bear market for gold roughly 15 years ago 

Furthermore  the median 3 year revenue growth for this group has just turned positive again as it did at the start of the last major bull market for gold and the miners 

All in all  it looks as if Mr  Market is currently pricing in a much more dire situation than the companies actually face at present  In other words  this is what a margin of safety looks like  A normalization of the valuations for this group would yield a 50  gain for the stocks even without any upside in the gold price  And if the precious metal is set to embark on another bull market  as I believe it is  the upside for these stocks could make FANG s performance over the past few years look tame in comparison ",2018-05-04,Jesse Felder,https://www.investing.com/analysis/bang-why-the-gold-miners-could-soon-make-fang-look-tame-200312836,200312836

Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is AEM due for a pullback  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers Agnico Eagle s Q1 Earnings Lag  Sales Beat EstimatesAgnico Eagle reported net income of  44 9 million or 19 cents per share for the first quarter of 2018  down 41  from year ago quarter s net income of  76 million or 33 cents  Barring one time items  earnings for the quarter were 15 cents per share  which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 17 cents  Agnico Eagle recorded revenues of  578 4 million in the first quarter of 2018  up about 5 7  from  547 5 million in the year ago quarter  The figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  557 million Operational Highlights Payable gold production in the first quarter fell 6 9  year over year to 389 278 ounces from 418 216 ounces in the year ago quarter  The decline is mainly due to lower throughput levels at Meadowbank  Total cash costs per ounce for the first quarter were  648  up 20 2  from the prior year quarter figure of  539  AISC was  889 for the first quarter  20  higher compared to the prior year quarter figure of  741   This is mainly due to expected lower gold production and higher total cash costs per ounce  Financial Position As of Mar 31  2018  cash and cash equivalents were around  452 3 million  up 43  from year ago quarter  Long term debt was  1 372 4 million at the end of the quarter  up 27 9  from  1 073 4 million the year ago quarter  There was no outstanding balance on credit facility as of Mar 31  2018  This resulted in available credit lines of roughly  1 2 billion  excluding the uncommitted  300 million accordion feature  Total capital expenditure in the first quarter was  179 4 million  Outlook Agnico Eagle has reiterated its previous guidance for total cash costs for full year 2018 that is expected in the range of  625  675 per ounce  AISC is expected in the range of  890  940 per ounce for 2018  The company s production guidance for 2018 remains unchanged at 1 53 million ounces of gold

119897,341412,AEM,Is Gold Now A Beach Ball Under Water ,opinion,"With non commercial gold shorts now at a 25 year high  Rudi Fronk and Jim Anthony  cofounders of Seabridge Gold  discuss the factors behind that  as well the potential for a reversal 
The Daily Sentiment Index reading on gold for Friday  July 27  2018 was unchanged at a low 13  while the Hulbert HGNSI was also unchanged at  2 17   indicating that gold timers were more short than long  In a sign of the times  effective last Friday  the  2 3 billion Vanguard Precious Metals and Mining Inv was renamed the Vanguard Global Capital Cycles Fund  as part of a restructuring intended to broaden the fund s mandate and diversify its portfolio   In short  the fund dumped its gold holdings 
The Vanguard fund s percentage of gold mining stocks dropped suddenly from roughly 80  to 25  as a result of the change in its mandate  which might explain the high volume  capitulation style drop in major gold stocks such as Agnico Eagle Mines Limited  NYSE AEM   Barrick Gold Corporation  NYSE ABX  and Goldcorp Inc  NYSE GG  on Thursday  As pointed out by The Daily Market Summary  Agnico Eagle was the fund s largest position as of June 30  Newmont Mining Corporation  NYSE NEM  was the second largest  and Barrick was its fifth largest 
Also of note  gold stocks have generally performed better than gold itself since the most recent gold price swoon that began last April  And junior gold stocks have fared better than the large caps both positive indicators

Back to last Friday s COTs  The commercial net short position fell 11  to 65 688 contracts as of Tuesday  which is the lowest short position since January of 2016  also a low in gold  The gross speculative short position rose 7  to a new all time high of 172 023 contracts  This COT data obviously hasn t mattered yet  but it will at some point 
The aggressive players on the short side over the past few weeks have been the hedge funds  found in the disaggregated COT data as Managed Money  The gold Managed Money category reported a record net short position last Friday  see chart below   When this reading hits extremes  it typically signals that a turn higher is just around the corner 

Meridian Macro estimates that the hedge fund net short position totals nearly  4 5 billion  see chart below  

Meanwhile  Managed Money players have put on a record short position in Treasuries  a bet on higher rates  and are now crowding back into dollar long positions where their very strong buying has curiously not popped the dollar index above resistance at 95  see below  

In aggregate  we see the potential for a reversal of recent trends where gold rises due to a short squeeze aided and abetted by lower interest rates as Treasury shorts are squeezed and accompanied by a reversal in the dollar  Perhaps gold is now a beach ball under water ",2018-08-01,The Gold Report,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-gold-now-a-beach-ball-under-water-200335135,200335135

successful investing  However  in practice  correctly priced stocks and overpriced toxic stocks are intermixed in such a way that it is difficult to distinguish those Generally  overpriced toxic stocks are vulnerable to external shocks  Moreover  these stocks are burdened with a large amount of debt  The price of these stocks is artificially inflated  Nonetheless  the elevated price of toxic stocks is only short lived in nature as it is higher than its true intrinsic value Investors are likely to benefit from accurate identification of toxic stocks with the help of an investing strategy called short selling  This strategy allows investors to sell a stock first and then buy it when price falls While short selling excels in bear markets  it typically loses money in bull markets So  precisely pinpointing toxic stocks  and abandoning or short selling those at the right time is the key to cushioning your portfolio from big losses And that s what we re screening for today For the

119927,341442,AEM,4 Companies To Watch As Gold Turns Higher,opinion,"Ron Struthers of Struthers Resource Stock Report discusses the downfall of cryptocurrencies and the rise of gold  and presents four gold companies he is adding to his selection list 
It looks like my Christmas present to some was ringing the warning bell on cryptocurrencies  On Dec  8  I was thinking they were going higher but by the 19th the mania looked like a climax and I posted a couple of charts at    and called them mania charts  A couple of days later I commented   I am still nervous on the price of these cryptocurrency and block chain deals  
My alert on Dec  20 was to sell Blockchain   BLOC is breaking down on the chart and is currently  2 20 and I was concerned about a close below  2 23  It might bounce back but I am getting nervous on this whole sector because it is so frothy  I would rather take the profits and visit again in January  
It is now Jan  23 and I am revisiting the sector  and what I see is a train wreck and bear market  The two mania stocks  Riot Blockchain  NASDAQ RIOT  and LongFin  NASDAQ LFIN   have dropped between 50  and 75   Global Blockchain  OTC BLKCF  dropped to  1 40 and is currently in the  1 60s 
The leader in the cryptocurrency space  hands down  is Bitcoin and is the best barometer of the sector  It is not easy to get charts and this is about the best I found for my purpose  This is apparently closing prices  but there is no close because Bitcoin trades 24 7  I believe the actual intraday peak was over US 20 000 and the low on Jan  17 was under  10 000  When something drops 50   the run up or bull market is over  This chart clearly shows a bear market 

I highlighted Dec  8 when I thought it was still going higher and the 19th when I believed it was too frothy  I believe the crypto craze has peaked  The main reason is because it is too competitive with government issued fiat currency  Like fiat currency  cryptocurrency can be created out of thin air  It has no value other than the confidence and credibility of who is backing it  The crypto bulls will argue that it has to be created with computers doing calculations  therefore work is performed and that produces an underlying value  To me  it is just a number in your phony electronic virtual wallet 
Government authorities did not give it a lot of attention until it started to attract billions of dollars    has stopped trading on major exchanges and is initiating proposals to stop bit mining  Currently  China is the largest bit miner in the world so this is significant  China believes bit mining is a waste of their precious energy grid and only contributes to the pollution problem  Another major cryptocurrency player  South Korea has threatened to ban trading  causing quite an uproar  In the U S   cryptocurrency ETFs under SEC pressure 
I will continue to watch the space and will make another point clear  Blockchain is an underlying technology of cryptocurrencies and it does have some good  useful value  I believe the Blockchain technology will survive and thrive even though it was  and still is overhyped  The best way I found to describe Blockchain is a transaction and accounting method for measurement 
Cryptocurrencies can be a threat to fiat currencies just as gold can  However  gold has been used as a currency for so long that it is already embedded into the system  That is why governments central banks have adopted it and hold large reserves of gold  If cryptocurrencies evolve to become a lot more credible  governments will probably just create their own out of thin air as they do their fiat currencies 
 Bitcoin looks like the history of fiat money in the United States and elsewhere   Alan Greenspan told  in early December  comparing it to the 1775 Continental currency created to help the U S  fight the British for Independence  That currency was worthless by 1782   Humans buy all sorts of things that aren t worth anything   he said  pointing to an eventual decline in value   People gamble in casinos when the odds are against them  It has never stopped anybody  
 Gold vs Crypto
There seems to be some buzz about this even though it appears to me that cryptocurrency has less credibility than fiat currency  I find it amazing how everyone can get wrapped up in a mania and jump on board  In   Ron Paul  the former congressman  started an online poll on Twitter asking whether people  if given the option of taking a gift worth  10 000 and had to hold on to for a period of 10 years  would take bitcoin  gold or dollars  Treasury notes   Over half  54   of the respondents showed support for bitcoin  Gold was second at 36  and 10  for dollars  I find this quite astonishing when you consider Ron Paul has been a loud supporter of gold so his followers would be swayed this way  I would think 
A substantial disadvantage crypto has compared to gold is that it is subject to cyberhackers  Over 14  of Bitcoin and Ether have been compromised  according to Lex Sokolin of Autonomous Research LLP   noted in a A gold bar or coin cannot be hacked  but you have to ensure your original purchase is from a reputable dealer as there are a few fake coins and bars around 
In my last update I commented that all markets were moving higher and for the first time in a decade the world economies are all doing well  This will certainly bring on the next wave of inflation forces that  gold bugs  will love   the underlying pace of U S inflation unexpectedly accelerated in December  Excluding food and energy  the so called core consumer price index increased 1 8  from a year earlier  Commodities  USD  Oil  Treasury notes and Gold are all showing signs of inflation and are on the verge of major break out signals 
There is commodity inflation too  but you have to know where to look for it  Ever since the CRB Index was hacked up into a black box computer model in 2005 that adjusts prices to the down side  it has been rendered useless to measure long term trends or historic comparisons  I now use  or the BLS Raw Materials as reliable indicators for longer term comparisons  The BLS Spot Index includes food stuffs along with industrial commodities  There is no energy or precious metals component  so I believe it provides a strong base or underlying measurement of commodity inflation 

The current rally in Commodities is the strongest we have witnessed since the 2011 peak  This chart is until end of December 2017 and the quote today on the index is 437  up about 15  from the 2015 low 
Interest rates are on the rise and this is reflected in this chart of the U S  10 year Treasury bond  Many are already talking about a breakdown and on the yield side the chart equates to around 2 6  yield  Dropping below the line takes out the 2014 bottom 

Trump got his wish of a lower dollar last week as we can now see a breakdown on this weekly chart  Speaking of Trump  last week the  the highly anticipated fake news awards  I am not sure if Trump started the  fake news  saying but he definitely was the one to make it popular 

Below is a monthly chart on oil as I wanted to show a longer term pattern  In 2018  oil has rallied to  64 and is now a clear breakout and confirms the inverted head and shoulders bottom 

Gold has yet to breakout and looks destined for another test of  1 360 resistance 

I believe gold will punch above  1 360 in 2018  but markets are yet to be convinced  Gold stocks believe the gold price is going nowhere  and they remain stuck in this narrow trading range between 180 and 210 on the HUI Gold Bugs Index  I have been commenting on this for the past year  but am now convinced a breakout to the upside is just around the corner  The other positive on this chart is a very solid base has been formed in this trading range 

There is nothing I see on the HUI chart that points to a breakout  but the preceding charts are alluding to it 
Gold stocks represent good value probably because the market is paying attention elsewhere with ridiculous valuations on marijuana  cryptocurrencies and the S P 500  We got stopped out of most of our producing gold stocks in 2017 and now I want to start adding some back on the Selection list 
I spent some time on the weekend looking at major and midtier gold producers and find I just come back to picks I have made in the past  The best seniors are Agnico Eagle  NYSE AEM  and Kinross  NYSE KGC  and that is because they are the only two with good growth prospects 
Midtier  Eldorado Gold  NYSE EGO  is a disaster and Goldcorp  NYSE GG  does not have enough of a growth profile to be of interest  Production at Barrick Gold  NYSE ABX  is falling and Newmont  NYSE NEM  will soon take over the lead as the largest producer  but not because of good growth but the opposite from Barrick  We made very good money with Sibanye  NYSE SBGL  a few years ago but it was a good thing we got out in 2016  I like the acquisition of Stillwater in 2015  but where it mines gold  South Africa  is in political turmoil  I see no sense in buying a Gold stock with so much political risk when other bargains abound 
I am going to add Kinross Gold Corp  Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd   midtier  Alamos Gold  NYSE AGI  and Paramount Gold Nevada Corp   NYSE PZG  to the Selection List 
We bought Kinross in 2015 at  2 60 and were stopped out at  5 10 last year  The previous stop out in 2016 was  5 40 and bought back at  4 65  The stock is currently around  5 30 so we are buying back a little higher than the 2017 stop  but I am betting on better timing  For sake of all the calculations on stop out and buy backs  I am just calling it a wash  I am picking Kinross because of attractive valuation and strong growth with their Tasiast expansion 
The Tasiast mine is an open pit operation located in northwestern Mauritania  approximately 300 kilometers north of the capital Nouakchott  Tasiast processes ore via an 8 000 tonne per day mill and dump leach  Work continues on enhancing the performance of the existing mill and optimizing the operation  The high price Kinross paid for the asset was a thorn in its side throughout the gold bear market  but now it is destined to become a world class asset 
The phase one expansion project at Tasiast is currently two thirds complete and is expected to increase mill throughput capacity from the current 8 000 t d to 12 000 t d  significantly reducing operating costs and increasing production  Phase one is expected to reach full commercial production in Q2 2018  This will almost double annual production to 400 000 gold equivalent ounces 
On September 18  2017  that it will be proceeding with phase two of the two phased Tasiast expansion to increase mill capacity to 30 000 t d  and produce an average of approximately 812 000 Au oz per year with all in sustaining costs of  655 per Au oz  for the first five years of mining  The project is expected to generate strong cash flow and transform Tasiast into a large  world class mine with lower costs  Initial construction for phase two is expected to begin in early 2018 and commercial production is expected to begin in Q3 2020 
Kinross has also initiated plans to extend life on two of its key assets  Round Mountain  Nevada  and Fort Knox  Alaska 
At Round Mountain the company is proceeding with the Phase W project  pending completion of the permitting process  which is proceeding as planned  Phase W is expected to extend mining by five years and increase life of mine production by 1 5 million Au oz  This is one of Kinross  top performing mines located in one of the best mining jurisdictions in the world 
Fort Knox is one of Kinross  largest producing mines and a center of excellence for the company as one of the few cold weather heap leach facilities in the world  In 2016  the site poured its seven millionth ounce of gold  20 years into its mine life  Kinross gained mineral rights to the adjacent Gilmore land in December 2017  Kinross has initiated a feasibility study to analyze a potential layback of the current Fort Knox pit to access known mineralization on Fort Knox and Gilmore land and potentially extend Fort Knox s mine life 
As a result  Kinross added 2 1 million gold ounces in estimated Measured and Indicated resources and 300 Koz in estimated Inferred resources at Fort Knox  Fort Knox now has 1 3 million ounces Proven and Probable reserves along with 3 2 million ounces M I resources 
2016 Mineral Reserves and Resources  not including Fort Knox addition 
Proven and Probable Gold Reserves  31 million Au oz 
Measured and Indicated Gold Resources  30 3 million Au oz 
Company Outlook  Kinross is tracking toward the high end of its 2017 guidance for production  2 5 million to 2 7 million AuEq ounces   and the low end for both production cost of sales   660 to  720 per AuEq ounces  and all in sustaining cost   925 to  1 025 per AuEq ounces   The company expects to be within its capital expenditures guidance of  900 million  plus minus 5 per cent 
Balance sheet    Kinross had cash and cash equivalents of  992 1 million  and available credit of  1 512 2 million  for total liquidity of approximately  2 5 billion  The company has no scheduled debt repayments until 2021 
Summary
Kinross has a very good track record for consistently delivering on results and its large reserve resource base gives good leverage to any rise in gold prices  The balance sheet is in great shape and with good cash flow  it can easily fund all its expansion plans without further dilution 
Tasiast will add around 600 000 ounces to annual production that will more than make up for around 100 000 ounces loss from Kettle at end of life  Chirano in Ghana produces around 200 000 ounces per annum and is slated to reach end of life in 2020  but exploration in the area could prolong the mine  The company s biggest challenge will be to ensure further growth when its Russian mines  Kupol and Dvolnoye  reach end of life in 2021  This operation currently produces 550 000 to 600 000 ounces per year  Tasiast s expansion will replace this production  but I believe Kinross is an aggressive company and it will not sit around for three years without making some kind of acquisition to grow production 

The above chart highlights Kinross  attractive valuation compared to peers  With the stock chart  I note there is an uptrend in place and it is supported by the 200 day MA  but the price has struggled lately to move above US 4 50  If we get a good close well above  4 50   4 65 to  4 70  then a test of the upper trend line is likely 

I will highlight some info on Agnico Eagle in my next report and for now will dive right into Alamos Gold 
  NYSE AGI  Recent Price C 7 60
Shares outstanding  389 Million approx  
Richmont Mines has often been a very lucrative pick in this newsletter and I always liked the company for its quality assets and was well run  When Alamos merged with Richmont  it certainly made it worthwhile to look into further  Alamos has always done a good job with its Mexican assets but they never had enough appeal and growth to interest me  That changed with the acquisition of Richmont and the plunge in the stock price 
To buy something of high quality  one usually has to pay a higher price so Alamos made a friendly deal to acquire Richmont in an all stock offer valued at about  770 million  U S    Since the acquisition was announced Sept  11  2017  the stock dropped from  10 25 to  7 50  The comment often heard among investors is  sticker shock   believing that the price paid to buy Richmont was on the high end compared to current multiples and recent transactions  That aside  the company is well positioned to outperform intermediate peers given its attractive  self funded growth profile  clean balance sheet  and catalysts at development assets 
Transaction highlights from   
Acquisition of a high quality  free cash flowing mine in a world class jurisdiction  Island gold is a long life  high grade underground mine with growing production and first quartile cash costs  located in Ontario  Canada 
Solidifies position as a leading intermediate gold producer  The combined entity is expected to have diversified gold production of over 500 000 ounces in 2017  anchored by three core  low cost  long life operations in Canada and Mexico 
Superior production growth and cost profile  Island gold s near term production growth complements Alamos s existing peer leading growth profile  while lowering the near  and long term cost profile of the combined company 
Improved cash flow generation to support peer leading growth pipeline  Island gold provides immediate cash flow accretion and stronger operating cash flow to support internal growth initiatives of the pro forma company 
Stronger financial position and flexibility  The combined entity will have increased financial flexibility with enhanced free cash flow  no debt  and a strengthened balance sheet with cash and equity securities of approximately  229 million  U S  
Revaluation opportunity through enhanced capital markets profile  The combined entity will become a top 10 gold producer in North America  with nearly 60  of its production in Canada  peer leading growth  a strong balance sheet  proven management team and increased trading liquidity providing a strong revaluation opportunity through its enhanced appeal in the market 
John McCluskey  president and chief executive officer of Alamos  stated   Our combination with Richmont reflects our core strategy of creating long term value through operating high quality assets  The Island gold mine is a high quality asset in every respect  We see excellent potential for reserve and production growth from one of the highest grade  lowest cost gold mines in Canada  With this production base  growth and balance sheet strength  Alamos will be the leading intermediate producer and presents a compelling revaluation opportunity for both Alamos and Richmont shareholders  
I would bet Mr  McCluskey did not expect a downward revaluation  but that is now our opportunity  Let us have a closer look at its assets 
Alamos is a Canada based intermediate gold producer with diversified production from four operating mines in North America  including the Young Davidson and Island Gold mines in northern Ontario  Canada  and the Mulatos and El Chanate mines in Sonora  Mexico  These are long life mines  projected to produce between 480 000 to 520 000 gold ounces in 2018 with a low  950 all in sustaining cost and declining through 2020  Alamos met production guidance for the third consecutive year and with 10  growth in 2017 driving record performance  Growth is forecast at 28  for 2018

Paramount Gold Nevada  PZG  Recent Price US 1 30
Shares outstanding  23 1 million
PZG is an old favorite but it is an entirely different company now  We made huge returns with this stock in a bear market when  Paramount for  146 million at the end of 2014  It was an all stock deal for Coeur shares  plus shares in the new Paramount spinoff  Like most miners  Coeur shares were languishing around  4  but after a bit more weakness in 2015  Coeur stock soared to  16 in 2016  We ended up stopped out at  12  so made about 300  on top of the 25  premium we got on the Coeur takeover 
The stock in the new Paramount spin out is tightly held and I believe one of the lowest values per ounce for an advanced project

Sleeper Gold  100  owned  15 500 hectares
The Sleeper Gold Project is a former high grade open pit gold producer located off a main highway approximately 25 miles NW of the town of Winnemucca  Nevada  The famed Sleeper mine was operated by AMAX Gold Inc    Amax   from 1986 until 1996  producing 1 66 million ounces of gold and 2 3 million ounces of silver  Paramount has assembled a district scale project with significant unexplored gold potential 
Paramount conducted drill programs from 2010 to 2013 that increased and upgraded the NI 43 101 resources and demonstrated strong exploration potential on nearby targets  Measured and Indicated resources within pit constraints total 3 143 million ounces gold at 0 33 g t along with almost 29 million ounces of silver  Paramount filed a PEA in late 2015 and updated it  that highlighted 
Low Initial Capital of  175 million for a 26 600 tonnes per day operation
Estimated annual production of 92 400 ounces of gold and 91 800 ounces of silver
Low cash operating cost of  529 per ounce of Gold Equivalent produced  2015 report 
Base Case has a  290 million pre tax net cash flow  a  126 million net present value at a 5  discount rate and an internal rate of return of 28 4 
Quick capital payback period of 3 5 years based on after tax cash flows  2015 report 
Confirms the potential to add mineralized material
Sleeper has been put on the back burner as the company is focusing on bringing its high grade Grassy Mountain project to production 
Grassy Mountain  100  owned  9 300 acres
The Grassy Mountain Gold Project is located in Malheur County  Oregon  approximately 22 miles south of Vale  Oregon  and roughly 70 miles west of Boise  Idaho  Paramount acquired the project in July 2016 that fit its strategy of acquiring advanced mid stage undervalued assets in the U S 
Paramount will build upon the Preliminary Economic Assessment  PEA  which was completed in 2015  The PEA contemplated a 10 year underground mining operation with low cash operating costs driven by a high average underground gold grade of 5 32 g t  The PEA estimated average annual production of 53 000 ounces of gold and 82 000 ounces of silver  yielding robust economics at a  1 300 per ounce gold price and at a  17 50 per ounce silver price  The project contains a total Measured plus Indicated mineralized inventory of 1 7 million ounces of gold and 4 9 million ounces of silver 
Paramount s current focus is to put the 500 000 ounces of high grade  underground resources into production and use that cash flow to advance Sleeper  Gold recoveries look to be around 95  and capex to build the mine should be quite low at    120 million  Paramount is currently working on a Preliminary Feasibility Study and I expect the results of this in Q1 2018 The PFS will establish the parameters of a mining and milling operation  define capital and operating costs  convert resources to reserves  and advance the project through the permitting process with the BLM  DOGAMI and local agencies of Malheur County 
Financial
Paramount is in good shape with about  7 million in cash  The last financing was for almost  7 4 million at  1 40 per share   Both FCMI Parent Co  and Seabridge participated 
Summary
Paramount has a very low valuation for a company with advanced stage projects in the U S   especially with one advancing to production 
Valuation  23 1M shares at  1 30    30M    5M cash  assumes some burn    US 25 million 
Paramount has 4 8 million M I Gold ounces  ignoring silver  valued at a mere US 5 20 per ounce 
If we assume Sleeper at lower grade is worth nothing  the 1 7 million M I ounces at Grassy Mountain are valued at only US 14 70 per ounce 
The way I see it  Paramount is undervalued based on their Grassy Mountain project alone and Sleeper provides very high leverage to rising gold prices  In addition  we can buy the stock near two year lows 

In a better market during 2016 when it acquired Grassy Mountain  the stock almost hit  3 00  Insiders bought around 1 5 million shares around these prices in late 2017 and I believe we should buy now too ",2018-01-24,The Gold Report,https://www.investing.com/analysis/four-companies-to-watch-as-the-gold-market-turns-upward-200282920,200282920

Spot gold headed for the biggest gain in three weeks after the Fed hiked interest rates by a quarter percentage point at its December policy meeting  This was because the market had already factored in the possibility of a rate hike given the upbeat economic data  Gold prices trended upward interpreting the Fed s statement as dovish considering that it is planning only three rate hikes in 2018 and not four The bullish momentum for the yellow metal has continued in 2018 so far  with gold currently trending above the psychological level of  1 300 an ounce  The rally can be attributed to weaker dollar and renewed safe haven buying prompted by heightened geopolitical tensions According to the World Gold Council  there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about gold s performance in 2018  A number of new mines entered production in fourth quarter 2017  which might support mine production till 2018 
On the demand side  major markets  India and its neighbor China will continue to be growth drivers  Further  the United States continues to be a strong market driven by economic growth  improving employment levels and growth in consumer confidence  Demand from central banks is also expected to remain strong As per the Zacks Industry classification  the gold mining industry is grouped under the broader  sector  which is among those Zacks sectors that are expected to rack up the strongest gains in the fourth quarter  Fourth quarter earnings for the sector are projected to climb 43 5  while revenues are expected to spike 20 7   per the latest  In this write up  we run a comparative analysis on two major gold mining stocks   Barrick Gold Corp    NYSE ABX   and Newmont Mining Corp    NYSE NEM     to figure out which of these stocks is better placed ahead of their fourth quarter earnings report Barrick   the biggest producer of gold on the planet   is scheduled to report its fourth quarter numbers on Feb 14  while Newmont will post its fourth quarter results on Feb 22  Both Barrick and Newmont carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  Other major gold stocks reporting earnings this week and the next include Goldcorp Inc    NYSE GG    Kinross Gold Corp    NYSE KGC    Agnico Eagle Mines Limited   NYSE AEM    Yamana Gold Inc    NYSE AU   and AngloGold Ashanti Ltd    NYSE AU   Let s take a closer look at how Barrick and Newmont are stacked up against each other in terms of certain key metrics ESP and Earnings History is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have high chances of surprising in their upcoming earnings announcement  It shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Our research shows that for stocks with the combination of a favorable Zacks Rank  1  2  Buy  or 3 and a positive Earnings ESP  the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70   Newmont is likely to beat earnings in the quarter to be reported  This is because the stock has an Earnings ESP of  1 49  and a Zacks Rank  3  However  the picture is different for Barrick with an Earnings ESP of 0 00  and a Zacks Rank  3  a combination which makes surprise prediction difficult With respect to surprise  Barrick beat estimates in two of the trailing four quarters while missed twice  In this timeframe  it came up with an average negative surprise of 8 2   On the other hand  Newmont has a fairly impressive surprise history  having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters with an average beat of 17 6  Growth ExpectationsIn terms of earnings growth expectations  Newmont scores way above Barrick  The expected earnings per share growth rate for Newmont for the fourth quarter currently stands at 21 2  compared with an expected decline of 4 6  for Barrick Price PerformanceNewmont clearly outpaced Barrick in terms of price performance in 2017  Newmont s shares rallied 10 1  for the year while Barrick lost 9 4   Newmont also outperformed the broader s gain of 9 2  
While Newmont s stock performance is partly supported by its forecast topping earnings performance  efforts to improve its production profile and strengthen its balance sheet  Barrick s shares were hit by the disputes surrounding Acacia Mining  the largest gold producer in Tanzania  in which Barrick holds a 64  stake  that had sparked concerns among investors 

Dividend YieldIn the past year  the dividend yield for both Newmont and Barrick was higher than the broader industry  The industry has an average dividend yield of 8   lower than 65 7  for Barrick and 36 2  for Newmont  Hence  on a comparable basis  Barrick shareholders earned a better dividend yield than Newmont 

Debt to Equity RatioThe debt to equity ratio is a good indicator of the financial well being of a company and is a good proxy for its debt servicing capacity  Barrick has a debt to equity ratio of 55 5  while the industry has debt to equity ratio of 33 4  In contrast  with a debt to equity ratio of 33 1 Newmont wins this round 
Current RatioThis metric measures the ability of a company to meet its short term debt obligations efficiently  In other words  it is the ratio of the current level of total assets and versus the current level of liabilities  Here  Newmont is a clear winner with a current ratio of 4 18  which is superior to Barrick s reading of 2 73 
ValuationGoing by the EV EBITDA  Enterprise Value  Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization  multiple  which is often used to value mining stocks  Barrick looks cheaper compared with Newmont In case of Newmont  the trailing 12 months EV EBITDA ratio is 8 1  which is above its own average of 7 9 in the past one year and also near the high level of 8 3 it scaled over that period  Moreover  it is overvalued than the industry that has a reading of 7 5  On the other hand  Barrick is cheaper with a trailing 12 month EV EBITDA ratio of 4 5 
Return on Equity  ROE ROE is a measure of a company s efficiency in utilizing shareholder s funds  ROE for the trailing 12 months for Barrick and Newmont is 7 7  and 6 2   respectively  While both stocks have scored above the industry s level of 4 7   Barrick holds an edge here 

The VerdictNewmont scores higher in terms of price performance  earnings surprise history  growth expectations  current ratio and debt to equity ratio  On top of that  the company has higher ESP reading vis   vis Barrick 
However  Barrick holds an advantage when it comes to valuation  dividend yield and ROE measures  Overall  our comparative analysis shows that Newmont has an edge over Barrick on most of the parameters The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of AllLast year  it generated  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  47 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce  the world s first trillionaires   but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early ",2018-02-13,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/abx-vs-nem-which-is-the-better-gold-stock-ahead-of-earnings-200290101,200290101

120002,341517,AEM,The Harsh Truth About Gold ,opinion,"Is gold dead 
Over the last three years  the SPDR Gold Shares  NYSE GLD  has lollygagged in a sideways direction 
I d honestly rather watch paint dry than analyze a gold chart 
Given such an uninspired performance  I don t believe that gold warrants a major weighting in your portfolio 
Of course  my assertion above constitutes sacrilege to any  gold bug  
So let me explain 
Please don t confuse a gold ETF with owning physical gold 
A gold ETF is a piece of paper that represents a loose claim  at best  on gold 
Vaulted gold  however  is real   and can be called upon in any crisis event 
Still  some folks will insist on owning proxies for gold  rather than actual gold bullion 
If you re among those who favor paper gold  don t simply buy an ETF 
Below are three more intelligent routes into gold 
An Alternative to Owning Gold
While the Fed prints money like confetti  it s important to gain some exposure to gold 
As Louis mentions above  ETFs are not a suitable way to do so 
Gold ETFs suffer from a tracking error against physical gold s price  And that error can increase if the gold price zig zags violently 
But even physical gold has its drawbacks 
Physical gold yields nothing  It incurs storage costs  And it s difficult to sell for full value when you need cash or your gold view has changed 
So what s the best route into gold investing 
Buying shares of carefully selected gold mining companies 
Gold mines offer the following advantages over owning gold or gold ETFs 
They earn money each year  and many pay dividends 
They are leveraged  So if gold doubles  mine shares should do much better 
If they have good exploration teams  their gold reserves per share will increase 
Of course  there are some pitfalls to watch out for that can offset these advantages 
For instance  some mines have very high mining costs  Or they can be located in politically risky areas  Or the mines can be close to depleted 
But when you isolate a mining play that s free of these risks  you boost your chances of a homerun 
One substantial mine that s on my radar is Agnico Eagle Mines Limited  NYSE AEM  
The company boasts good reserves  low costs and little political risk 
AEM has mines in Canada  Finland and Mexico   all solid jurisdictions   Aside from the risk of snow in Canada and Finland  of course  
In the second quarter  its all inclusive sustaining cost of production  AISC  was  785 per ounce   500 below the current gold price  It s profitable  with earnings reaching  0 27 per share  And it pays a quarterly dividend of  0 10 per share  to yield 0 9  
In August  it increased its production guidance for the year to 1 62 million ounces  While its Meliavit project in Nunavut territory  northern Canada  with 3 2 million ounces of reserves  should come on stream in 2019 
The precious metal has largely underperformed stocks during this incredibly resilient bull market 
But as inflation picks up around the globe  gold stands to shine brighter than pricey stocks and bonds 
Paper gold ETFs like GLD won t capture the coming gains  but gold miner ETFs will 
As Martin noted above  miners are leveraged to the price of gold  So they will outperform the metal as its rises 
But not all investors are comfortable in picking single stocks 
An ETF like the VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF  NYSE GDX   though  offers investors a piece of the world s smallest  most explosive miners 
Over the last two years  GDXJ has soared 60  as gold has come back  During the same period  GLD has gained just 10 4  
Bottom line  If you re after upside in gold  paper gold ETFs aren t worth the time of day  But gold miner funds will soar as the precious metal pops 
Supercharged Gold Gains
Gold shines most when inflation rears its ugly head  And there s increasing evidence that an uptick is right around the corner 
After enduring years of sluggish growth  the global economy is projected to increase by 3 6  this year and 3 7  in 2018 

 Inflation will start to come in that environment   says Bank of England Gov  Mark Carney 

Indeed  And for those who loaded up their portfolios with gold nearly a decade ago  on the expectation that historic central bank intervention would lead to hyperinflation  it s about time  They ve been earning virtually nothing on their  sure thing  gold investment since then 
I m not here to heap on the criticism  though  Instead  I want to share a third way to invest in gold  This one represents a way to supercharge your gains to make up for lost time   or to reward those who knew better to wait 
I m talking about buying just out of the money long dated call options on the VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF that Jonathan shared above 
You can go out as far as January 2019 right now 
Doing so effectively gives you double leverage to gold prices 
First  by owning the gold miners   which typically rise faster and higher than the metal itself  And second  by purchasing options   which amplify the price movements of the underlying asset  in this case  the miners  
Some would argue this is a much more speculative way to invest in gold  But I disagree 
Gold should only account for a small percentage of your overall asset allocation  no more than 5    Instead of tying up all that cash indefinitely  you can limit your outlay by purchasing the options  which also limits your downside risk 
In the end  this small amount of capital can go a long way to make up for lost time and or make a fortune in a short period of time  Or it goes nowhere  just like gold has done for years 
In other words  it represents a lower risk  lower cash outlay  and higher reward  gold trade in today s market

120037,341552,AEM,Juniors To Recover As Gold Moves Ahead,opinion,"Fund manager Adrian Day discusses several mining and energy companies in his portfolio that he believes should appreciate now that the recently released Canadian budget does not include a tax rate increase 
Many Canadian juniors had seen significant deterioration in prices in the last few weeks  even as gold and large mining companies rallied  This decline in juniors particularly affected stocks that had seen large capital appreciation in the recent past  This was the result of Canadian investors selling shares to lock in capital gains tax rates ahead of a widely anticipated increase in the tax rate  But in the budget just released  the government said there would be no rate increase  We expect  therefore  that there will be some buying back of shares sold in coming days and an overall firming in the Canadian junior market  Below are three stocks  LRA  AXY  MD   among others  that could benefit from such buying

Meanwhile  Codelco  Lara s joint venture partner  and Vale continue their court case over the Liberdade Copper project  also in Brazil  We remain optimistic on a resolution if not the timing thereof that would revolve to the benefit of Lara  Codelco has the right to earn into 75  of the project  but the value of Lara s remaining 25  would exceed the current market cap  The company  with about CA 3 5 million in the bank  has sufficient cash for its programs 
Lara is a strong buy here for patient investors with a certain tolerance for risk 
Company continues to grow towards long term goal Alterra Power Corp  TO AXY  continues to make progress towards its goal of being a dividend paying  diversified green energy company  Last year was  in the words of founder and chairman Ross Beaty  a transition year  Power production is up 20   with a new hydro project in British Columbia starting production  a new solar farm acquired  and the first full year from the Shannon wind farm  The company now has eight operating plants  in three countries  and has growth projects that could conservatively double production  in the next few years   A modest dividend was introduced last year  yield of just over 1    but the goal is to increase the dividend significantly once the company reaches a critical mass  Alterra is a buy for long term investors 
There s been no news from Reservoir Capital Corp  V REO  the last substantive press release announcing an interim CEO  was in August but we expect some development in coming months  Because of the extreme low price we would not sell  but are not buying until the future course becomes clearer

120038,341553,AEM,4 Gold Stocks To Avoid Despite The Gold Rally,opinion,"Gold has peaked to a five month high amid mounting geopolitical tensions  News of the U S  airstrikes in Syria as well as the latest terrorist attack in Europe has continued to fuel the safe haven demand of the yellow metal  Further  weaker than expected numbers from the highly anticipated non farm payroll report also worked in favor of gold prices  Spot gold has shot up to  1 272 75 an ounce  clocking a year to date gain of 11  Safe haven buying will remain strong ahead of the looming French presidential election as well as continuing geopolitical tensions  In the U S   uncertainty runs rife despite positive expectations about the economic proposals of Trump  However  this will be a positive for gold  An upward inflationary trend is also likely to support demand for gold  The yellow metal is historically seen as an inflation hedge  Further  higher inflation will keep real interest rates low  which in turn makes gold more attractive  Moreover  inflation makes bonds and other fixed income assets less appealing to long term investors Much hope is pinned on Asia  particularly India  to drive gold demand  In Asian economies  gold demand is generally closely correlated to increasing wealth  As Asian countries become richer  their demand for gold will increase in tandem  However  India s gold industry suffered last year due to the imposition of excise duty that prompted a strike in early parts of the year and the demonetisation initiative in the fourth quarter that caused a liquidity squeeze that affected the entire economy 
This year a banking system flush with liquidity as well as expectations of bumper crop following a good monsoon will boost gold demand  The imposition of General Sales Tax in mid 2017 nonetheless poses a short term challenge to household gold buying  Overall  the World Gold Council anticipates consumers to buy between 650 tons and 750 tons of gold during the year

120039,341554,AEM,Can Cabot Corp  CBT  Pull A Surprise This Earnings Season ,opinion,"Specialty chemicals and performance materials producer  Cabot Corp    NYSE CBT    is  set to release second quarter fiscal 2017 results after the market closes on May 1   Last quarter  the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 21 74   It reported adjusted earnings of 84 cents per share that beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 69 cents Net sales of  611 million rose 1 3  year over year  and exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  600 million  Fixed cost reductions and higher margins led to a year over year improvement in operating profits and earnings The company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters while missing in the other one  with an average positive surprise of 5 03  Can the company surprise investors again or is it heading for a possible pullback  Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement Cabot Corporation Price and EPS Surprise
 

   Factors to Consider
In first quarter fiscal 2017  Cabot Corp  performed well  with its adjusted earnings per share increasing 64 7  year over year  The increase was primarily driven by improvement in sales volume across all segments One of the key strengths of Cabot Corp  is the ability to generate robust cash flows  In the last reported quarter it generated cash flows of over  100 million from operations  which it used for capital investments and also returned  35 million to shareholders in the form of share repurchase and dividends According to the President and CEO  Sean Keohane  the company will continue to drive the core strategy which is focused on delivering value to shareholders  The company aims the annual adjusted earnings to grow by 7   10   while implementing a balanced capital allocation investment strategy for growth and cash return to shareholders The company s Reinforcement Segment saw its EBIT  earnings before interest and tax  increase by  14 million year over year in the last reported quarter  The higher EBIT was primarily driven by higher sales volume and unit margins arising from improved demand environment in China   The Purification Solutions EBIT increased by  9 million year over year in first quarter fiscal 2017 mainly due to favorable inventory comparisons and higher volume due to MATS related demand The Specialty Fluids segment s EBIT increased by  2 million year over year in the first quarter fiscal owing to increased project activity in Asia that partly offset lower activities in North Sea The Performance Chemicals segment EBIT dropped around 1  to  205 million year over year in the last reported quarter mainly due to unfavorable product mix and higher maintenance cost associated with plant turnarounds  Cabot Corp  expects the demand of Performance Chemicals end markets to remain strong  but margins are likely to be affected from higher oil prices The company  in the second quarter  expects reversal of inventory benefits it saw in the previous reported quarter Cabot Corp  s shares gained 8 7  in the last three months  outperforming the Zacks categorized  industry s gain of 4 2

120075,341590,AEM,Gold  End Of The Year Excitement,opinion,"For gold investors  some days are more awesome than others  and I ll boldly suggest that today is one of those days  Here s why 


Inflation is no longer near  It s here  Measured by  stuff used   China is the world s largest economy 
Producer prices there have surged steadily since the start of 2016  and the index has now crossed above the key 100 marker 
China is poised to become the world s biggest exporter of a product that most analysts have forgotten about  inflation 

Also  gold stocks  which I call the canary in the inflationary coal mine  may be poised to start a fresh uptrend  The  Eagle  just staged a one day close above the key round number of  50 
This great company is one of my key lead indicators for the entire precious metals sector  and a three day close above  50 could indicate that a new intermediate term uptrend is underway 
Agnico Eagle is sometimes able to cover its entire gold mining costs just from its silver production  and it s an important component in the GDX  NYSE GDX  ETF 
Also  Friday is US jobs report day  and a post report rally could see Agnico Eagle Mines Limited  NYSE AEM  stage a weekly close above that important  50 mark 

Top Islamic financial organizations have teamed up with the World Gold Council to launch the new Shari ah Standard  It will be launched December 6  just two days after the upcoming Italian referendum 
The new  Standard  will allow Muslims to invest in gold in accordance with shariah law  and the World Gold Council predicts the Standard will add a whopping 500 tons to global demand  over just the next four years 
It s going to become increasingly difficult for mining companies to grow their production enough to keep up with this kind of demand growth 
It s becoming very clear that investors who are looking for gold price discovery  action  won t be bored in the last few months of this year  Chinese New Year buying also begins in another month or so  and the US election is now only about a week away 

Bitcoin often leads gold bullion  I implore the Western gold community to view bitcoin not as a competitor with gold  but as a solid part of a diversified anti fiat investment portfolio 
Gold has no competition  It s the leader of the anti fiat team  but not the sole player  I cover the bitcoin price action in my juniors high risk newsletter  I own it  and I m extremely happy with the price action 

A week ago  I predicted gold would rally straight to trend line resistance at  1285  and recoil from there  That s exactly what happened  So  what now 
Well  it s going to take a few days of closing above  1285 to launch a serious rally  and even that technical action won t be enough  without fundamental news that is positive for gold 
The critically important jobs report will be released on Friday at 830AM  and the US election follows that just a few days later  Indian festival buying is also accelerating  which should act as good background support for a big fear trade oriented rally 

Japan has one of the world s biggest economies  but gold demand there has never been a big factor in price discovery 
I ve predicted that demand in Japan will grow surprisingly quickly  as more confidence is lost in the nation s central bank and government  Clearly  some top Japanese economists are beginning to take that same view 

This is the short term Dow chart 
The US stock market has a tendency to strengthen in the November to December time frame  but I would caution stock market enthusiasts from betting too heavily on that scenario this year  Seasonally  stock market crashes tend to be most likely in September and October  but the US election  a December rate hike  and the Italian referendum are all factors that may have moved the time frame for a crash to November   December 
The bottom line is that the danger of a US stock market crash is actually greater now than it was in September and October  If there is a crash  gold could surge straight to substantial resistance in the  1425    1432 price zone 

Silver tends to follow gold  but it can also lead gold at key turning points  There s a clean upside breakout from an ascending triangle in play  There will be substantial battle at the sizable sell side resistance at  18 50  a battle I expect to be won by the world gold community  It s almost certain that the upcoming US election will be the catalyst that launches the battle 

Newcrest Mining Ltd  AX NCM  is the biggest gold producer in Australia  Like Agnico Eagle  I use it as a bell weather for the entire sector  The price action is extremely positive right now  there are bull wedge and inverse head and shoulders bottom breakouts in play  and a run to the  27 area highs appears imminent  The world gold community should probably fasten their seat belts now  and get ready for an end of the year upside ride

120077,341592,AEM,5 Stocks That Got Run Over By The Trump Train,opinion,"It seems the Trump rally is in no hurry to fade away  U S  stocks enjoyed their best day since the election on Wednesday and gained on Thursday as investors continued to exit bonds and enter the equity markets  Speculation that the new administration would bring about tax cuts  introduce fiscal stimulus measures and deregulate key sectors continued to boost markets upward 
Financials led the charge yet again  with Goldman Sachs   NYSE GS   leading the charge for the Dow with gains of 2 5   Bank stocks continue to rise following expectations that the Dodd Frank Act will be repealed and the Federal Reserve will hike rates later this month 
However  it hasn t been smooth sailing for all sectors since Trump registered his surprise victory  Some of them have fallen out of favor as investors rotate into cyclical stocks  Ohers are expected to feel the downside of the new administration s policies 
Utilities  Consumer Staples Out of Favor
Though utilities and consumer staples remain in the green year to date they have fallen out of favor with investors  Some analysts and market watchers had gone as far as to upgrade this category right after the election  However  the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR  has lost 2 7  over the last one month  Similarly  the Utilities Select Sector SPDR  has declined 3 5  over the same period 
One factor working against these categories is an imminent Fed rate hike later this month  Additionally  Trump has promised to introduce strong fiscal stimulus measures which will in turn lead to higher interest rates  This is why the future doesn t look any rosier for this category even as the allure of cyclicals increases 
Healthcare Dragged Lower by Uncertainty
Trump s election had allayed fears among investors in healthcare since Hillary Clinton had promised to introduce price controls on the pharma sector  However  Trump s criticism of the Affordable Care Act had led to a completely different set of concerns  Any changes to this landmark law would lead to major disruption for the entire sector 
Meanwhile  Trump has also raised concerns about exorbitant drug prices  Healthcare stocks took a major hit on Wednesday after the Time s cover story  Person of the Year  highlighted that U S  President elect Trump had declared strong intentions to reduce drug prices  This led the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF  to plunge 2 9   which in turn had a negative impact on the Nasdaq 
Investors Rotate Out of Gold
Metal and mining stocks had moved higher immediately after Donald Trump s election  At that point  investors had chosen to focus on his promises to resuscitate the country s manufacturing sector and boost infrastructure spending 
Since then gold prices have moved lower with the SPDR Gold Trust   V GLD   losing in excess of 8   The yellow metal continues to move lower on speculation that Trump s proposed fiscal stimulus measures will boost growth  leading to higher interest rates and a stronger dollar  An increase in rates will rob gold of its sheen since it is not a yield generating investment 
5 Major Losers
As markets continue to move upward on hopes that Trump s policies will lead to gains for cyclical stocks  defensive sectors are losing their allure  Meanwhile  healthcare s outlook seems uncertain as investors remain concerned about the nature of the administration s policies  Below we examine five of the major losers during this period which have also been impacted by sector specific factors

For example  Whether you believe in seasonality or not  January s stock performance mirrored that of the last 10 years 
Since 2006  the   DJIA  has logged an average decline of 2 3  in January  Over the first month of 2016  the DJIA declined 4   The prevailing monthly downtrend has held 
From intraday peak to trough  the DJIA plummeted even more   13   But the DJIA rallied sharply off the mid month lows and tested its overhead 20 day moving average  DMA  
Now  a familiar bullish pattern is showing up on stock charts across the entire market  Today  I m going to show you how to read it and trade it like a pro 
The Triangle Offense
One of the chart patterns you should always watch for following a steep selloff is the ascending triangle 

The ascending triangle pattern forms as the support line for a stock rises and shares meet overhead resistance at the same time  This chart pattern tells us that demand for shares in a company is rising   a bullish sign by any measure 
So  what does this chart pattern have to do with selloffs 
When share prices reverse a previous downtrend  they usually test recent highs as buyers return  A trader who wants to take a long position in such a stock need only wait for shares to  break out  above the resistance 
More aggressive traders who are confident in the trend will often take their positions ahead of the break  These traders buy when shares retrace to the support line after a failed test of resistance 
Either way  if the resistance becomes support  shares will likely enjoy a nice run up the chart as new buyers rush in 
Let s take a look at a company that s showing this pattern right now 
A Golden Opportunity
Agnico Eagle Mines Limited  TO AEM  is a Canadian gold mining company founded in 1957 and headquartered in Toronto  The company operates nine mines across Canada  Mexico  and Finland 
From peak to trough  shares have fallen 76  since hitting their all time high in 2011  But after bottoming out last August  shares have broken their long term downtrend and stormed up the chart  In fact  share prices are up 18  year to date versus a 5  decline in the broader market 
Of course  gold prices   as well as mining stocks   are now on the rise as the Federal Reserve will likely delay further interest rate hikes on weak economic data 

As you can see  following Agnico Eagle s fall from May to August  shares rallied and tested previous support around  30 23  And since September  the support line has trended upward  creating a triangle 
An aggressive long trader could have traded this pattern by taking a new position in December when shares retraced to the support line 
But shares have just broken through the resistance   which has now become support  All traders can now take new positions with confidence and ride the shares upward 
The key to confirming a break above the resistance line is increased volume  If the breakout occurs on light volume  it could be a false signal and a sign of some coming downside  However  if shares break out on heavy volume  the potential for greater upside is high 
In this case  shares broke out on above average volume and closed up 5  on the day of the break  As such  Agnico Eagle provides the perfect opportunity to cash in on gold s resurgence right now

120107,341622,AEM,Yamana Gold  AUY   What s In Store This Earnings Season ,opinion,"Yamana Gold Inc    NYSE AUY   is set to release first quarter 2016 results after the market closes on May 4 
Yamana has posted an average negative earnings surprise of 25  in the trailing four quarters  Its adjusted loss for fourth quarter 2015 was a penny per share compared with a loss of 2 cents in the year ago quarter  Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors to Consider
In 2015  the company delivered annual production of roughly 1 28 million ounces of gold which was within its guidance  9 million ounces of silver  also within its guidance  and 131 million pounds of copper  which was above management s guidance 
Production was achieved at lower year over year costs  with cost at mines among the lowest in the industry and cost at Yamana s cornerstone mines in particular also among the lowest in the industry 
During the fourth quarter  Yamana focused on managing core and cornerstone assets without overlook smaller assets with considerable leverage to gold price  The company set up an Executive Vice President structure and promoted from within into these positions to gather the experience in exploration  business development and operations through common oversight 
Yamana remains focused on debt reduction and cost improvements actions  Following debt reductions of over  286 million during 2015  the company aims at a further debt reduction of at least  300 million between 2016 and 2017  This is expected to be achieved through organic cash flow generation and other available means  including the monetization of secondary metals and assets 
The company expects Net Debt EBITDA to be between 1 5 and 2 times  which management believes to be prudent financial policy and planning  It expects the Net Debt EBITDA ratio to improve starting this year  The company expects to achieve its target through organic cash flow generation at current gold prices 
For 2016  the company expects gold production in the range of 1 23 1 31 million ounces  Silver production is expected in the band of 6 9 million and 7 2 million ounces  and copper production is projected at between 122 million and 125 million pounds 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Yamana is likely to beat earnings this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP for Yamana is 0 00    as both the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at breakeven 
Zacks Rank  Yamana holds a Zacks Rank  2  which increases the predictive power of ESP  However  the company s ESP of 0 00  makes surprise prediction difficult 
We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions

120141,341656,AEM,Gold Mining Industry Slowed By Headwinds ,opinion,"For the gold mining industry  demand will remain strong in the years to come given the demand for jewelry  bars and coins as well as a safe haven investment  However  the industry remains saddled by a number of headwinds  Below  we discuss some of the key reasons and what investors in the gold mining sector can look forward to in the coming months and years 
Inherent Risks in the Industry Gold exploration and mining is a time consuming and expensive task  Given gold s scarcity and remote location of deposits  exploration for new gold is difficult  Once an economically viable deposit is identified  bringing a mine on line can take a decade or more  and it requires substantial capital investment  Moreover  the mining industry is subject to several risks such as political conflicts  environmental hazards  industrial accidents  unexpected geological conditions  labor force disruptions  unavailability of materials and equipment  weather conditions  pit wall failures  rock bursts  cave ins  flooding  seismic activity and water conditions  However  once the mine development project is successful  returns can be enormously high  which more than offsets the risks and the capital invested Lack of New Projects  Production to Flatten Annual mine production grew for the sixth straight year in 2014  edging up 2  to a record of 3 114 4 tons  Mine production grew 2  year on year to 729 2 tons in the first quarter of 2015  Mines that have been developed and became operational in recent years continue to add to the supply stream  However  the growth in supply from such projects continues to diminish and is likely to flatten in 2015 as the supply pipeline thins  Some gold companies  including Barrick Gold Corporation  NYSE ABX   Goldcorp Inc  NYSE GG  and Newmont Mining Corporation  NYSE NEM   are currently high grading at certain mines  The high grade portion is mined first as this increases the grade of the mined ore and lowers the cost per unit  However  it has its cons as it depletes reserves very quickly  thus affecting long term supply 
Gold miners  grappling with far lower gold prices than in previous years and cost pressures  have not been in a position to invest in developing new projects in recent years  To name a few  companies including Anglogold Ashanti Ltd  NYSE AU  and Agnico Eagle Mines Limited  NYSE AEM  have slashed capital and exploration spending  Given the lack of new projects  mine production will eventually plateau in the next couple of years Restricted Margins The price decline has added to the woes of an industry that was already fighting rising costs  labor issues  strikes  delays and or the cancellation of projects  If prices fall further  margins will be constrained as the price of gold closes in on the cost per ounce of the companies  In the wake of falling prices  the industry would see a rise in the number of producers reducing output or even shutting down operations  Costs are difficult to curtail beyond a point for long  so miners will only profit if gold prices rise in response to demand and other macroeconomic factors  Production cutbacks and mine closures would spell more financial pain for producers and investors  who have watched gold mining stocks slump Substitution with Cheaper Material in the Technology Sector Demand for gold in technological applications dipped 2  to 80 4 tons in the first quarter  the lowest quarterly level  affected by sluggish economic conditions in key markets and substitution away from gold  Despite inferior durability  copper and palladium coated copper have made vast inroads into the share of gold in the bonding wire sector and this trend will continue through 2015  Gold also witnessed a decline of 11  in dental demand  The decade long decline in the dental sector shows no sign of abating as gold continues to lose ground to ceramic alternatives  which have improved steadily in quality  strength and durability Recycling will Remain Low Recycling activity will remain low in 2015  and might deteriorate further given that a large portion of near market supply has been flushed out in recent years  Less distress selling may further suppress recycling volumes  Many collectors are struggling to source feed stock Rising US Dollar  Cheaper Oil
There is an inverse relationship between the trade weighted U S  dollar and the price of gold  The dollar is gaining strength against major currencies on the back of positive macroeconomic data  such as the improving job market and growing industrial activity in the United States  A stronger greenback will continue to keep gold prices under pressure  Cheaper oil means lower inflation  This indicates gold would be affected negatively as it is usually considered a hedge against inflation  Low U S  inflation is negative for gold stocks such as Goldcorp  Barrick Gold  Newmont Mining and Kinross Gold Corporation  NYSE KGC Bottom Line Rising U S  dollar  lack of new projects and decline in recycling activity are some of the sector s worst detractors  But what about investing in the space right now  are there opportunities for short term investors overriding the headwinds  Check out our latest Gold Mining Stock Outlook for more on the current state of affairs in this market from an earnings perspective  and how the trend is shaping up for this sector going forward ",2015-06-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gold-mining-industry-slowed-by-headwinds-256048,256048

As it stands right now  we are at the point where the six month time cycle is due  On the three year chart below are the six month time cycles that I have followed for many years  which shows this time of the year is often a good season in which to take a position  On this six month time cycles chart you will also see two inverted  six month time cycles during which  instead of making a low  gold was making a high  red arrows  
When that six month cycle bottom inverts  gold generally will decline for close to six months  red circles   Our current situation is shown by the last red arrow on the right hand side of the chart  with the question mark 


The next chart for gold shows the six month time cycles going back to the 2008 crash low  From the crash low in 2008 to the bull market top in 2011 you could bet the farm that the six month time cycle bottom was going to come into play  Along with the Chartology at that time  red consolidation pattern   that near parabolic rally was a whole lot easier to play than our current  four year bear market that is punctuated by just two consolidation patterns so far  the blue two year rectangle at the top of the chart and our current two year falling wedge pattern that still hasn t broken down yet 
This six month time cycle is slightly different than the one above by a few weeks or so 

Shortly after I became aware of the bull market in precious metals stocks during the spring of 2002  everyone was talking about the six month time cycle for gold  Since I was curious  I built out my own chart for the Gold BUGS Index  HUI  which also shows the six month time cycles 
It quickly became apparent to me that there was something to the six month time cycles for the PM complex  When I began charting the six month cycle bottoms for the HUI  I had an epiphany similar to the one I had on the US dollar  when I first discovered the two huge fractal bottoms that long term readers will remember  Keep in mind we are talking about the middle of 2003 when I discovered what I call  THE SEQUENTIAL 6 MONTH TIME CYCLES  for lack of a better name 
When I looked at the bull market that begun in 2000 for the HUI  the six month time cycle stuck out like a sore thumb  The chart below is a static chart that goes from 2000 to the 2008 H S top  The thin black vertical lines are the six month time cycles and the heavy thick vertical lines are the sequential six month time cycles tops 
What I discovered back then was this  each six month cycle top was growing further apart by six months  Note the first impulse move up in the HUI s brand new bull market  marked with the red A  That rally lasted six months before the first consolidation pattern was built  Now notice there are two six month time cycles between the tops at A and B  with one thin black vertical line showing a six month cycle low within the red triangle  Next you have the rally to the sequential six month cycle top at C which is made up of three six month time cycles before the next consolidation pattern started to build out 
We re now entering into the fourth sequential six month time cycle  Note the reversal points within the red triangle which shows each reversal point came during the smaller six month cycles  This sequential six month time cycle was actually off by six months as shown by  D   which should have been the next top 
I clearly remember wondering  at that time  what did this mean because the HUI wasn t following the script as it had before  I still knew the smaller six month time cycles were dominant  and the Chartology suggested that the HUI was breaking out of a two year triangle consolidation pattern  so I held on 
The blue arrows show that impulse move that lasted one year and ended at the first reversal point in the red triangle within the 5th sequential six month cycle The fifth sequential six month top ended during the formation of the 2008 H S top  It didn t nail the top precisely  but again  with Chartology on my side I could see the H S top forming and mentioned it at a website I was posting to at the time  I m not going to mention anyone s name Sir Fullgoldcrown  but at that time nobody and I mean nobody was looking for a serious correction  I believe I took more flack for calling that H S top than any other top I ve ever called 
One last note on the chart below  Notice where the 2008 crash low stopped  right on a six month time cycle that launched the sixth sequential cycle top which I will show you after this chart 


This next chart starts where the chart above left off  The sixth sequential cycle top was now three years long  with the sequential six month cycle top due in May of 2011  point F on the chart below  Again  notice the smaller  thin vertical lines which mark the smaller  six month time cycles within the massive H S top 
That brings us up to the seventh sequential six month time cycle top  This was the first major failure for the sequential cycle tops  at G  which also marks the smaller six month time cycle low that came last year in November  The smaller six month time cycle marked the beginning of our latest consolidation phase which I believed ended at the April high of this year  Earlier in the bull market  the six month time cycles were usually in May and November  but for the last several years October and April have marked the six month cycles 
One last very important note on the chart below  Notice where the next six month time cycle comes into play  Does October of 2015 ring a bell  If we see the HUI falling in to the October time frame I think there will initially be a strong bounce that may mark the end of the bear market and the beginning of a bottoming formation that will take some time to develop 
How long is anyone s guess  but the initial bounce off a bottom is usually very strong  Think of a super ball  The first bounce will be the highest and strongest 


This last chart for the HUI shows the complete  sequential six month time cycles going all the way back to the beginning of the bull market in 2000  I ve always said the precious complex creates some of the best chart patterns and symmetry of all different descriptions which you just don t find everywhere 
That is one reason I ve never believed in manipulation theories  If the precious metals complex was being manipulated  then I believe you would have very ugly Chartology along with cycles and symmetry  Nature strives for symmetry and we are just a part of nature creating these chart patterns 

Now I would like to update you on some of the PM stocks I ve been showing over the last month or so  which are showing us what is actually happening under the surface  I have placed some price objectives at the bottom of the charts so we can get a feel for when this next low which I m expecting in October will occur 
Let s start with Barrick Gold  NYSE ABX   which is now testing the bottom rail of its blue rectangle consolidation pattern 

Anyone who has bought ABX over the last 20 years is currently underwater 

Is Agnico Eagle Mines  NYSE AEM  building out a double top at reversal point  7 

ProShares Ultra Silver  ARCA AGQ  is a silver ETF that is in the process of backtesting its neckline 

ASA Gold and Precious Metals  NYSE ASA  is following through to the downside after breaking out from its red triangle consolidation pattern just two weeks ago 

The monthly chart for ASA shows just how critical this area is right here  Note all the previous lows going all the way back to 2003 

Avino Silver   Gold Mines  NYSE ASM  is still working its way lower after breaking out of an H S top 

Anglogold Ashanti  NYSE AU  is moving lower after backtesting the bottom rail of its blue triangle consolidation pattern 

Yamana Gold  NYSE AUY  is breaking below its 2008 crash low after breaking out from the red bearish falling wedge 

These are only the PM Stocks starting with and  A  But one can get the idea  The rest of the multitude of PM Miner s charts that I follow will be posted in a separate post for subscribers 
However  the reason I m spending so much time and energy showing you all these precious metals stocks is to give you confidence that the impulse move is for real  It doesn t take a rocket scientist to see all these consolidation patterns breaking down from the November lows of last year 
We are in an impulse move in the precious metals stocks that has a very good chance to run until October   November of this year  That s still another three to four months away and will be right at the one year mark  which is normal for the PM stocks  Go back and look at the HUI time cycles charts I posted earlier  You will see several of the big impulse moves up out of the red consolidation patterns took close to a year to complete  These types of moves don t come around every day 
When you re looking at your minute charts and start to get nervous about a small pattern that might be forming  see how it relates to the big picture that I just showed you on all these stocks  above  The big picture trumps the minute charts in the long run  This impulse move still has much further to run before it runs out of gas  per all the consolidation patterns that are just now breaking out to the downside  October   November is a reasonable time for this impulse move to finish ",2015-07-13,David Tablish,https://www.investing.com/analysis/weekend-report…gold’s-peculiar-6-month-cycles-258029,258029
120143,341658,AEM,Gold Stocks  Earnings Make Charts,opinion,"Most gold analysts think that gold is in a bull market  or a bear market  They use charts and US economic reports to try to prove that the gold price price is ready to move substantially higher or lower 
In contrast  I ve argued that the world gold market is in a state of transition  It s transitioning from a Western fear trade orientation  to an Eastern love trade orientation  and thus gold is on the cusp of a  bull era  
The last century was dominated by the America  During America s  heyday   companies like Xerox  NYSE XRX  and General Motors  NYSE GM  staged relentless increases in quarterly earnings  and this was consistently followed by massive increases in their stock prices 
That s because institutional money managers base their liquidity flows on earnings reports  They don t care if a chart looks bullish or bearish 
They care about earnings growth and cash flow growth 
Even more importantly  mainstream money managers look for consistency of earnings growth  and consistency of cash flow growth 
Price drivers like QE  Greece  and OTC derivatives don t create cash flow and earnings growth consistency for gold stocks  They create volatility  and that s not something that an institutional money manager likes to see 
I don t think most investors realize what kind of sea change is taking place in the gold stocks sector right now  It s a process that can turn gold stocks into one of the most stable cash flow cows  in the history of investing 
In China and India  good economic news is a reason to buy gold  and bad economic news is also a reason to buy gold  The steady rise in demand created by industrialization in these countries  coupled with static mine supply  is poised to turn the gold stocks sector into an institutional darling 

That s a snapshot of recent quarterly earnings for Newmont Mining Corporation  NYSE NEM  
Once a company starts to show sizable increases in quarterly earnings and cash flow  institutional money managers of size begin to pay serious attention to that company 
Newmont is a gold stock sector leader  and it s staged some phenomenal and consistent growth in quarterly earnings  That has stunned institutional money managers  and brought them to the investment table 
The next Newmont earnings report is scheduled for July 22  If there s another upside surprise  institutional money is going to pour into Newmont  and the stock should begin a new leg to the upside 

That s another look at Newmont  using the weekly chart  Chindian demand can realistically add about  100    200 to the gold price floor  over the next 18 months  It can do it in a very stable manner 
To most amateur investors living in the legacy of fear trade era  that might not seem like much of a price spike  To an institutional money manager following earnings reports from companies like Newmont Mining Corporation  NYSE NEM   Barrick Gold Corporation  NYSE ABX   Agnico Eagle Mines Limited  NYSE AEM  and Goldcorp Inc   NYSE GG   it turns those companies into consistent cash cows 
Gold stock charts can t be used in isolation from earnings reports  The reason that most investors were so negative about gold stocks at the end of 2014 was because they were focused on things like QE and rate hikes  rather than corporate earnings 
That s why they missed the boat with Newmont  and it s why they may miss the entire gold stocks sector boat  as it sails up the chart  in 2016 
Newmont is probably going to move steadily toward the  40 area in 2016  Investors who waste time waiting for some magical  chart breakout  will never make any serious money in the market  and certainly not with a key stock like Newmont 

As Newmont moves toward  40  I expect Market Vectors Gold Miners  ARCA GDX  will rise toward  38  That s the weekly chart for GDX 
No chart formation is going to move GDX higher or lower  It s institutional liquidity flows that matter  and as mining costs stabilize  and Chindian demand is already quantified by top bank economists as steadily rising  good earnings reports will make the entire Western gold community happy  and GDX will move toward  38 
When the fear trade dominated gold price discovery  it was very difficult for money managers to make long term projections about the gold price  That s changed with the rise of the love trade  and the rise in oil supply 
As Iran is welcomed back into the international community  even more oil supply will make its way onto the market  Also  China may have large reserves of oil and gas that can be tapped by the use of fracking  Fuel prices for gold mining are becoming incredibly stable  and the love trade is creating stable and consistently growing demand 

The bottom line is that here s never been a better time in history to confidently invest in gold stocks  than right now  That s the daily chart for Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners  ARCA GDXJ   Junior and intermediate gold stocks that have decent AISC  all in sustaining costs  can do extremely well in the bull era 
Yesterday s price  volume  and oscillator action was impressive  Note the beautiful position of the 14 7 7 Stochastics oscillator  at the bottom of the chart  The traditional summer rally for gold stocks may now be in play ",2015-07-14,Stewart Thomson,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gold-stocks:-earnings-make-charts-258299,258299
120144,341659,AEM,Gold Stock Rally  More To Come ,opinion,"Something very interesting is happening with gold stocks 
Over the past few days share prices of companies in the beleaguered industry have experienced sharp rallies  Take Agnico Eagle Mines   NYSE AEM  for example    the Canadian gold miner is up 16  over the past four trading sessions 
See for yourself 

As you can see  AEM is rallying to multi month highs over  28  While the chart is impressive  the best way to shed light on the recent gold stocks rally is through the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF  NYSE GDX  

As you re likely aware  GDX holds a diverse basket of the world s largest gold mining companies  Names like Barrick Gold  NYSE ABX   Goldcorp  NYSE GG  and Newmont Mining  NYSE NEM  are all held in this closely watched ETF 
Without question  it s refreshing to see GDX up 15  the past few days  After months of bearish price action  an upturn brings much needed relief to beaten down bulls 
But what s really catching my eye is the technical pattern in the chart above   
Notice how GDX is breaking above an important resistance trend line  declining red line  from the May 2015 highs  What s more  the gold mining ETF failed to drop below technical support at  13  horizontal red line  
With GDX rallying sharply higher from this consolidation pattern  there are good odds of additional gains to come  In fact  I wouldn t be surprised to the see the mining ETF trading at  17 in coming weeks 
What s so important about the  17 area 
Let s look to a long term chart 

As you can see in this 2 year weekly chart  GDX still has a strong resistance line to overcome at the  17 area  This downtrend from the 2014 highs will provide a considerable hurdle for the gold mining ETF to conquer 
Is there a fundamental reason for gold stocks to rally to that level 
Last Friday s US nonfarm payroll report was a huge disappointment  In case you haven t heard  there were only 142 000 jobs added in September    a far cry from the 203 000 job additions expected by economists 
This dismal jobs performance lends to the idea that the US Federal Reserve will delay raising interest rates until early 2016    and possibly longer 
Of course  that s good news for the price of gold 
Speaking of gold   
The yellow metal is on the verge of breaking above an important resistance trend line of its own 

Should gold surpass  1 500 an ounce  which roughly corresponds with the red line in the chart above  we ll likely see an additional rush of short covering in the commodity 
It s not out of the realm of possibility to see the yellow metal rally to  1 200 should the red line be breached 
Such a bullish situation would add even more fuel to the fire for gold mining stocks 
Bottom line
While I m not yet willing to suggest a long term bottom has been hit in gold mining stocks  I do believe there s a good chance of solid upside in the near term 
The combination of the technical factors above  along with September s lousy jobs report  should have gold stock bears getting more nervous by the day 
Trade accordingly ",2015-10-06,Justin S. Bennett,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gold-stocks-rally…-more-to-come-267283,267283
120145,341660,AEM,Gold In 2016  Janet And Chindia,opinion,"When times change  champions change with the times  To survive in the West s new era of long term slow growth  business owners have essentially had to reinvent themselves  Their mantra is adapt or die 

The gold market is also changing  and so the champions known as the Western gold community need to change with it  Gold price discovery is moving  slowly and consistently  from the West to the East 
In another two to three years  Chindian and mid East demand will probably surpass global mine and scrap supply  It s already adding stability to the gold price discovery process  and that will accelerate  Having said that  it s important to remember that gold is money  and like fiat money  there is more to price discovery than just the demand supply balance of physical gold 
It s true the amount of physical gold held in the COMEX and LBMA vaults that is eligible and registered for delivery is not that large  but most euros and dollars traded on the FOREX markets alongside gold are not delivered to the buyer by the seller either 
Price discovery for an asset can be determined with a casino like process  with legitimacy  The gold trading volume in London and New York  although stagnant  dwarfs that of the rest of the world 
Because gold is a currency  price discovery for gold is not so much about  who has the fizz   physical gold   but about who trades the most volume  betting on the price 
I ve predicted that Shanghai will surpass New York in terms of trading volume  and thus in domination of price discovery  That process is in play now but it will take another 2   5 years for the actual volume to rise above the levels of London and New York 
I ve also predicted that gold trading volume in Dubai will ultimately surpass Shanghai  making the  city of gold  the fitting master of global price discovery  The bottom line is that most of the world s physical gold trades through the Dubai and Shanghai exchanges  but the bets on the price of that gold are far bigger  for now  in London and New York 
The good news for Western gold community investors is that the growth of trading volume in both Dubai and Shanghai is strong and consistent  and that is occurring while London and New York volumes are stagnating 
Events and processes in the West will continue to have a big effect on gold price discovery  for many years to come  even after price discovery becomes dominated by Shanghai and Dubai 
On that note  the December 15   16 FOMC meeting is arguably the most important meeting of the past seven years  That s because Janet Yellen can t simply  flip a switch  to raise rates the way her predecessors could 
Because of the Fed s QE program  the refusal of the US government to downsize itself has not resulted in a debt crisis  That may be about to change 
Most gold gurus think rate hikes are about supposed economic growth  while I ve vehemently argued they are about putting pressure on the government to shrink itself  and about reversing money velocity  From a  PR  perspective  it s very difficult for Janet to state publicly that she s planning to raise rates to essentially attack the US government s ability to borrow  and to reverse the deflationary effects of Ben Bernanke s QE program 
MSM  mainstream media  and many pundits in the gold community talk endlessly about  rate hikes decisions   but the new era reality of implementing those hikes is highly complex  and potentially dangerous 
Janet is experimenting with using non bank entities to raise the Fed Funds rate  but her experiments have involved limited amounts of capital  As things stand now  the amount of bonds Janet would have to sell in the open market to hike rates  and keep them hiked  would probably collapse the bond market  creating a massive panic in stocks and real estate as well 
To actually raise interest rates on the reserve currency of the world is much harder than it seems  when open market sales are ruled out  In my professional opinion  Janet is going to deliberately force some bank reserves out of the Fed and into the private sector 
She ll attempt to replace those with non bank assets  Non banks can t loan out their investor money  while banks can  So  even a small movement of loanable bank reserves into the private sector could produce a dramatic reversal in US money supply velocity  which is the main driver of inflation 
Janet s plan to raise rates appears to have significant inflationary implications  which is fabulous news for gold investors  It may be why gold stocks are staging what is arguably a historic bullish non confirmation with bullion right now 

That s the hourly bars gold chart  I predicted a strong decline ahead of the US jobs report  and a big rally when it was released  and that s exactly what happened  I sent a key intraday alert to my subscribers on Friday  to sell some gold  and short some  near the height of the upside action 
Now  the FOMC meeting comes into focus  Gold may pull back to the  1057 area  before moving towards  1097  but there is a nice little inverse H S bottom pattern in play  That s good news for rally enthusiasts 

That s a longer term gold chart  using daily bars  Gold may be entering what I refer to as  technical head and shouldering   where one small inverse H S bottom pattern morphs into a bigger one  This technical action also fits with what Janet appears to be trying to do with money velocity via her rate hikes experiment 

Gold stocks and silver stocks had a fabulous day on Friday  and a horrific follow up yesterday  That s the  N GDX  daily chart  Volume has risen on the rally  and yesterday s down day volume was a little softer than on Friday s up day volume  GDX refuses to make new lows while bullion does 

That s the daily chart for Agnico Eagle Mines  N AEM   It s arguably a better proxy for the gold stock sector than Barrick  Yesterday  the  Eagle  only gave back a portion of Friday s superb performance  and it s soaring far above its recent lows  while bullion struggles 
Gold stocks like Agnico Eagle are poised for a great year in 2016  partly because of policy changes from Janet Yellen  and partly because of growing Chindian demand  but the most important catalyst of all for gold stocks may now be institutional players who view any move lower in bullion from here  as a reason to buy gold stocks aggressively

120146,341661,AEM,2016  The Golden Year,opinion,"The year of 2016  for a veritable myriad of reasons  looks very good for gold and related assets 
First  while gold bullion recently traded below its summer low  about 75  of N GDX component stocks are trading higher  That s a classic technical bullish non confirmation  it is significant 

The company  N ABX  has reduced debt levels significantly  and is trading sideways during tax season  That carries bullish implications for the entire precious metals sector 

N AEM  The  Golden Eagle  appears to be establishing an upchannel in the face of lower bullion prices  and the company does not engage in hedging 
For gold bullion itself  a substantial array of bullish price drivers appear set to take the  price discovery stage  

From a technical perspective  there s a commodity style double bottom pattern in play  and that may be part of something much bigger  and much more bullish 

Gold appears to be steadily carving out a large inverse head and shoulders bottom formation 
Gold is traded as currency on major bank FOREX desks  but because it is a central bank reserve asset  it s very difficult to assign clear cut bull or bear market labels to its price action 
Regardless  volume must rise with a primary trend  If price declines and volume does not rise  the primary bull market remains intact 

That s the quarterly bars gold chart  At some point in the future  the highs in the  1900 area will become a major support zone  as the  1033 area is now 
Note the rising volume with rising price  and declining volume  with declining price  The primary trend is unchanged  and it is bullish 
An analyst carries a degree of responsibility  When an investor in a major asset class has drawdowns  care must be taken not to break the spirit of that investor  Investor spirit needs to be nurtured and strengthened 
In that regard  when gold declined into significant quarterly bars support in 2008 at  728  my job was to nurture the spirit of gold community investors  so they could muster the intestinal fortitude required to hold positions  and buy more  I did that job to the best of my ability 
The Western gold community is now entering the year 2016  as gold approaches another mighty support zone  this time at  1033  It s unknown whether gold enters that support zone  or rallies from just above it 
What is known is that this is a major buying area  and a generational low appears to be in the works for both the bullion and the miners  Intestinal fortitude  and nurturing of investor spirit  are all that is required now 
Many investors have asked me if US bond and real estate markets could be topping  now that the Fed is raising rates  The answer is that junk bonds have probably topped and are likely headed vastly lower  Real estate  except beachfront property  appears set to ooze lower in price  and it will probably do for several decades 
In regards to the US T bond itself  the tools Janet Yellen is using to raise rates are somewhat supportive of long term bonds  I think the best way to summarize the T bond market is that the party is ending  but rather than getting  blown away   long term T bonds are more likely to fade away  like the rotary phone did 
So  I would not short the T bond  Shorting enthusiasts should focus on junk bonds and leveraged real estate 
Geopolitics is a bullish 2016 wild card  and the PBOC gold buy program looks set to continue relentlessly  The SGE gold fix is scheduled for a spring launch  and that coincidentally comes at the same time as cycle master Marty Armstrong predicts a horrific sovereign debt crisis will appear  Marty is widely followed by many money managers  and their liquidity flows can be sizable 
It can be persuasively argued that Indian demand is the most important big picture driver of the gold price  When India  sneezed  with a gold duties virus in 2013  the Western gold price immediately looked like it caught financial Ebola  For the past two years  India has suffered from drought  and that s reduced the rate of demand growth significantly 
The bottom line for 2016 is   Out with El Nino  and in with La Nina   Bumper crops across India would create a huge surge in both official and unofficial gold market demand 
The 2000 stock market crash involved retail stock market investors  The 2008 crash involved institutional and local government OTC derivative investors  Each crisis is intensifying  and each crisis is affect the price of gold to a greater degree 
I ve argued that the Fed must raise rates  to reign in the US government s insane obsession with debt  If that creates a government debt crisis  so be it  Gold price parabola fans should know there is nothing more bullish for gold than a global sovereign debt crisis  Santa has been pretty good to the Western gold community during the 2015 tax season  and 2016 looks like it may be a truly golden year

120147,341662,AEM,Cantor Fitzgerald s Rob Chang Names 4 Miners That Can Survive  1050 ,opinion,"The price of gold has see sawed since the Federal Reserve raised interest rates on Dec  16  and market experts debate if the action is good or bad for gold  Rob Chang of Cantor Fitzgerald Canada believes that after the small rate hike doomsayers are overstating their case and that gold should sell in 2016 for about  100 oz more than today  In this interview with The Gold Report  he argues that in today s climate cash costs below  1 000 oz are the bare minimum requirement for survival  Happily  Chang highlights three gold producers and one silver producer that have what it takes 
The Gold Report  Some say the price of gold has for some time been suppressed by fear of a Federal Reserve rate hike  What do you think 
Rob Chang  Now that the Fed has finally raised the rate by a small amount at its December meeting as we expected  we will see a continued sideways trend for gold 
TGR  It has been suggested that the Fed has been exceedingly reluctant to raise rates because of fears that would kill the economic recovery and blow up the deficit 
RC  I agree absolutely  Raising rates is likely a bad idea  especially raising them significantly  The key question is whether the Fed will continue to raise rates  and if so  by how much  Higher rates cause issues across the board  issues that frankly I don t believe the U S  economy can handle 
TGR  Given the lack of a robust economic recovery since 2008  and the ever increasing geopolitical instability throughout the world  the latest being a possible war between Turkey and Russia  are you surprised that gold has continued to fall rather than stabilize or rise 
RC  Yes  Given the geopolitical tensions you mentioned  one would expect the gold price to go up  To be honest  I don t know why it hasn t  I can only point to recent good U S  economic news and the potential interest rate increases as the reasons 
TGR  Goldman Sachs  N GS  predicted Nov  19 that gold will fall to  1 000 per ounce   1 000 oz  over the next 12 months  What are your predictions for the prices of gold and silver 
RC  For gold   1 173 oz for 2016   1 185 oz for 2017   1 200 oz for 2018 and  1 250 oz by 2020  For silver   15 69 oz for 2016   17 oz for 2017   18 oz for 2018 and then  19 oz long term 

TGR  We ve seen that producers are already walking a tightrope  To give a recent example  Rubicon Minerals Corp   N RBY  TO RMX  ran into geological problems at its Phoenix Lake project in Ontario  and suddenly the future of the company was in doubt  At  1 050 oz gold  would you expect a perhaps final wave of consolidations 

RC  I certainly think that we re due  and I m a little surprised we haven t seen more mergers and acquisitions already  Producers that do have cash would be well served to cherry pick among the many companies trading at extremely low valuations 

TGR  What are the attributes of the producers that will survive at  1 050 oz gold 

RC  First  all in sustaining costs  AISC  such that they can at least tread water for the time being  Second  management teams that will resist the temptation to buy cheap companies simply because they can  Third  projects in safe jurisdictions  At Cantor  we look for companies in world class areas such as the Carlin and Battle Mountain trends or Red Lake  places where you don t worry that you ll wake up one morning to find your asset nationalized 

TGR  A bunch of juniors with late stage development projects have been treading water for years in the hope the gold price will rise  If it doesn t  will these companies drown 

RC  Some will  others will be acquired by midtier producers  There are some companies that have good access to capital and have been very opportunistic in picking off companies or their assets at good prices 

TGR  Gold producers outside the United States  such as Canada  Australia  Brazil  Russia  are currently enjoying a tremendous dollar premium  How much of a leg up does this give them over U S  gold producers 

RC  It s pretty significant  and the premium has increased by over 20  over the past year  With the direction the U S  Fed is going  and the associated strength in the U S  dollar because of it  this premium has a good chance of getting even better 

TGR  Will we see mining capital flow out of the U S  and into those four gold producing countries 

RC  That would certainly make sense  All things being equal  of course  But at the end of the day  a fantastic asset will always attract investment dollars no matter the macro environment 

TGR  You make frequent visits to mining sites  What are the qualities you look for on site 

RC  I try to see the things management is trying not to show  the corners  the cracks  how the workers are interacting  the condition of the machines  how clean certain areas should be relative to what they are  I try to discover the actual conditions on site  and you can get that only from good conversations with the employees 

I look also for good infrastructure and for a sense of how projects are perceived by area residents  If community relations are poor  that could really sidetrack a mine no matter how good the other metrics are 

TGR  What have you learned from your recent visits to Mexico 

RC  Every company operating there says that its locations are safe  that the problems with the drug cartels are not there but in other locations in other states  That can t always be true  That typical response has become something of a challenge  and we are working out the best way of getting a better handle on it 

TGR  What is it about Nevada you like so much 

RC  As they say  when you want to find a mine  the best place to look is in the shadow of a head frame  Nevada is the home of many world class mines  It has the Carlin and Battle Mountain trends  It is easier to find elephants there because Nevada is where the elephants roam 

TGR  Which Nevada gold companies are your particular favorites 

RC  Let s start with Pershing Gold Corp   O PGLC   It has the past producing Relief Canyon mine  which has 809 000 ounces  809 Koz  gold Measured  Indicated and Inferred  The project has a short term path to production  6 12 months  once the decision is made  It is fully permitted and will require capital expenditures of only   12 million   12M  

In addition  the company has been finding some spectacular gold intercepts just north of the mine  including 9 grams per ton over 14 meters  9 g t over 14m  and 7 03 g t over 16m  Pershing s management actually thinks that it might be hitting a feeder system that could be a source for millions of ounces of gold 

Finally  the company has a good management team  Steve Alfers  the CEO  is the former head of U S  operations for Franco Nevada Corp   TO FNV  N FNV   He left Franco to join Pershing  which speaks to how highly he values it  Alfers has experience in finding assets  including Long Canyon  which was sold to Fronteer Gold  His permitting people are quite strong  This is a solid company from top to bottom 

TGR  What s your opinion of the Relief Canyon internal cost estimates published Nov  19 

RC  What s significant is the AISC of less than  800 oz  If this number holds  Relief Canyon will make money pretty easily  even at  1 050 oz gold  We are currently more conservative and are forecasting AISC to average  866 oz for Relief Canyon more conservative  but still economic in the current gold price environment 

TGR  This Nov  19 estimate does not include the latest assay results  correct 

RC  No  it does not  Given how good these results are and that the company continues to drill  it could potentially add many more ounces and improve the economics further still 

TGR  How does Pershing stand for cash 

RC  It s in a fairly good position with about  13M now  It will likely need to raise a little more once the production decision is made 

TGR  Pershing s land package was augmented significantly in January with the purchase of land from Newmont Mining Corp   N NEM   Could Newmont be a suitor for Relief Canyon 

RC  Potentially it could be  Newmont may be waiting to see how much exploration upside there really is at Relief Canyon before it decides to pull the trigger 

TGR  How do you rate Pershing 

RC  A Buy rating and a 12 month target price of  8 55 

TGR  What else do you like in Nevada 

RC  Premier Gold Mines Ltd   TO PG   This is one of those companies that has bought good properties at good prices  Its 100  owned McCoy Cove project is looking pretty solid  but more important is South Arturo  which we recently visited  Premier owns 40  of this  and Barrick Gold Corp  TO ABX  N ABX  owns 60  and is the operator  South Arturo should go into production in the middle of 2016  and will transition Premier Gold into a producer for the first time in its history 

We re excited because Premier Gold will probably get a multiple expansion as a result  The key thing to note about South Arturo is that there is likely tremendous upside here as Barrick could be keeping its numbers on the project in house  As far as we know  this project has   440 Koz gold  which speaks to a two year mine life  Of course  a company such as Barrick wouldn t spend all this capital just for two years  So we expect a significant increase in ounces underground  In the meantime  Premier should realize  50 60M in cash flow over the first two years from South Arturo 

TGR  Besides the properties listed above  Premier has three others in Ontario  Hasaga is 100  owned  while Trans Canada Geraldton is a 50 50  joint venture  JV  with Centerra Gold Inc   TO CG  CADGF OTCPK  CADGF OTCPK  and Rahill Bonanza at Red Lake is a 44 56  with Goldcorp Inc   TO G  N GG   Is this JV strategy a good one 

RC  It makes a lot of sense in the current environment  Premier has several good assets  but it does not have a history of developing and building mines  Its team is composed of a lot of former executives from Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd   TO AEM  N AEM   These people do have the history  but it s a bonus that the company can get some of the best names in the business  such as Barrick and Goldcorp  to help it out  Premier has its fingers in many pies and has spread the risk to bigger and more experienced companies so that it can devote more attention to its earlier stage projects 

TGR  How do you rate Premier 

RC  A Buy rating with a 12 month target price of  4 25 

TGR  Which Canadian junior producer do you like 

RC  We like Primero Mining Corp   TO P TSX  N PPP   which produces in Ontario and Mexico  Primero was once a market darling  It got a real kicking for its acquisition of the Black Fox mine in Ontario through its purchase of Brigus Gold  That mine has struggled for quite a bit but what we ve seen over the last couple of quarters is that it seems management may be turning Black Fox around  It looks to be on the path to becoming an economic mine  as opposed to being a fixer upper 

TGR  What about Primero s Mexico mine 

RC  That would be San Dimas  a world class mine located on the border of Sinaloa and Durango states  a safe part of Mexico  It had a strong Q3 15  reducing its gold equivalent AISC there to  454 oz 

TGR  What is the company s overall gold equivalent AISC 

RC  It s  775 oz for Q3 15  As Black Fox continues to progress  the overall AISC should continue to come down  I really am a little surprised just how fast Black Fox has come along 

TGR  How do you rate Primero 

RC  A Buy rating with a 12 month target price of  6 80  Right now  it s trading at  3 19  so we see it doubling  There s good value there 

TGR  What other company do you like in Mexico 

RC  Avino Silver   Gold Mines Ltd   TO ASM  N ASM  GV6 FSE   This is a silver company that has gold  It has two mines  San Gonzalo  which began production in 2012  and the past producing Avino mine  which began production in January and is ramping up 

We expect the San Gonzalo mine to produce  1 15 Moz silver equivalent   1 15 Moz Ag eq  annually for several years  We expect Avino to produce 1 5 1 7 Moz Ag eq annually going forward  This company has pretty decent cash costs  We expect long term AISC for the company to average around  13 oz Ag eq 

TGR  How do you rate Avino 

RC  A Buy with a target price of  3 10  This is an extremely underfollowed name  so it s usually a surprise when I mention it to people 

TGR  Baron Rothschild supposedly said   Buy when there is blood in the streets   Howe Street and Bay Street have seen blood in the streets for years  Is now the time to invest in precious metals companies 

RC  I do think so  Given how few gold miners can make money at  1 050 oz  I struggle to see how gold prices can make a further significant downward move  On the other hand  I see lots of potential for the gold price to move a lot higher  Looking at the relative downside to upside  we can say that gold could possibly move another  100 oz down  but on the upside  if events move in the right way  gold could move up several hundred dollars

120148,341663,AEM,2008 Redux  The Gold Fear Trade Is Heating Up Again,opinion,"Plunging oil prices  rising market volatility  surging global debt it s all beginning to remind some investors of 2008  Earlier this month  billionaire former hedge fund manager George Soros warned of an impending financial crisis similar to the last major one  which sent shockwaves throughout global markets 
The comparisons to 2008 have triggered gold s Fear Trade  with many investors scrambling into safe haven assets  Jeffrey Gundlach  the legendary  bond king   recently made a call that amid further market turmoil  the metal could spike as much as 30 percent  to  1 400 an ounce 
Making such predictions is often a fool s game  but there s no denying that gold demand is on the rise  both in the U S  and abroad  For the one month period ended January 20  gold  and silver  outperformed  comfortably beating domestic equities as well as a basket of other commodities 
I ve already shared with you the fact that gold has historically had a low correlation with equities  This point is worth reiterating  When equities have zigged  gold has zagged  And with volatility high in global markets right now  many investors are choosing to rotate a portion of their portfolios into the precious metal 
This was the advice of my friend Marc Faber  who recently warned investors in his influential  Gloom  Boom   Doom Report  newsletter that global stocks could fall an additional 40 percent on mounting liquidity and debt problems  In the event such a crisis occurs  Marc says  investing in gold which  again  has been shown to be inversely correlated with stocks might be one way to protect one s wealth 
I ve always recommended a 10 percent weighting in gold  5 percent in physical bullion  the other 5 percent in gold stocks or mutual funds  This applies in all market conditions  good or bad 
Something else I want to draw attention to in the chart above is the extreme divergence in performance between gold and oil  which is trading at levels we haven t seen in a long while  Declines in oil have traditionally invited enormous selloffs in other commodities  making gold s resilience at this time all the more impressive 
China Consumed Nearly All of Global Gold Output in 2015
Investors in China appear to recognize the importance of gold in times of market uncertainty  Since June 2015  the Shanghai Composite Index has dropped close to 45 percent  prompting scores of retail investors to pivot into safe haven assets such as gold  As you can see below  2015 was a blowout year for the Shanghai Gold Exchange  SGE   which in the past has served as a good measure of wholesale demand in China 
Not only did gold deliveries climb to a record number of tonnes in 2015  they also represented more than 90 percent of the total global output of the yellow metal for the year 
The SGE has made it incredibly easy for Chinese citizens to participate in gold investing  Recently it rolled out a smartphone app  making it more convenient than ever before to open an account and begin trading 
Gold Miners Are Winners of the Currency Wars
Gold priced in the strong US dollar might have netted a loss in 2015  but in many other parts of the world prices were either stable or even made gains  For buyers of gold in non dollar economies  it s the local price that matters most  not the dollar 
In Russia  the third largest producer  the metal rose 12 percent and came close to an all time high  In South Africa  the sixth largest  it was well above the all time high  Investors there saw returns of greater than 20 percent in 2015 
This has been beneficial to many mining companies based outside the U S  Operations are paid for in local currencies most of which have weakened in the last year but companies sell their production in U S  dollars  This has helped offset the decline in gold prices since they peaked in 2011 
Canadian based companies such as Claude Resources Inc   TO CRJ   Richmont Mines Inc   TO RIC  and Agnico Eagle Mines Limited  N AEM  are performing well  even in the gold bear market and amid high volatility 
For the last three years  gold miners all over the globe have been thoroughly beaten up  Today  they re heavily discounted  and there are signs that conditions are stabilizing 
Managing Expectations
With the Fear Trade heating up  it s important that we manage our expectations  The length and extent of the current bear market  which began in September 2011  might seem unprecedented to many investors  In actuality  it doesn t veer very far from what we ve seen in the past  according to data presented by the 
Reaching back to 1970  the WGC identified five bull and bear markets  with bull markets defined as periods when gold prices rose for longer than two consecutive years  bear markets as the subsequent periods when they fell for a sustained length of time  Although these lengths vary  the cumulative loss in each bear market is relatively uniform  with median returns at negative 42 7 percent 
The present bear market  at negative 44 1 percent  falls easily within the realm of normalcy  Further  this suggests that a turnaround in gold prices is overdue

120184,341699,AEM,Gold  The Bewitching Hour Of A Triple Bottom Nears,opinion,"Background
The last time gold sparkled was in the summer of 2011 when an all time record of  1900 oz was achieved  Alas since then it has been a torturous journey as gold prices has trekked south arriving at today s price of  1216 oz  registering a loss of 36   However  for the year to date gold is still trading above its low of  1180 oz as it grimly hangs on to a modest gain of 3   The question we face now surrounds gold s direction  will it test the previous low of  1180 oz and bounce to higher levels or will it penetrate this support level and set the stage for sub  1000 oz gold prices 
Gold s precarious position
In the past we have expressed our skepticism regarding gold s capitulation which we saw as a  capitulation of sorts  and not a final capitulation  The bulls fought back through a number of promising rallies  all to no avail as these petered out and prolonged gold s ability to find its real bottom  A lot of the weak hands have gone and some of the stronger ones who still hold long positions must be having second thoughts as to the wisdom of such a strategy 
 
The above chart shows that gold formed a wedge from which it unfortunately broke out to the downside which is negative for future prices  Also note that gold is now preparing to test the  1180 oz level for the third time  If this support level can hold then it will be a good platform on which to build the next bull phase of this bull market  Should it collapse then the patience of those who are not already out will be severely tested with the next stop on the way down being the  1000 oz level 
Also worth watching is the price of silver which could support gold prices  however  support from gold s little sister has not been forthcoming   have now penetrated the support it had established at  18 00 oz and could head lower testing the  15 00 oz level 
The miners are offering little in the way of support and they won t be spared if this rout takes place  The Gold Bugs Index  ARCA Gold BUGS  stands at 202 today just 12 points above its low for the year of 190  Many of the precious metals mining stocks are now trading at prices which are way lower than those achieved over the summer which in turn follows a couple of bad years whereby the HUI has lost around 66  of its value  Should the 190 level fail then a retest of 150 is on the cards  The last time the HUI traded at 150 was in 2008 when Endeavour Silver Corp  NYSE EXK  traded below  1 00  Agnico Eagle Mines Limited  NYSE AEM  at  20 00  etc  This may sound ridiculous to you at the moment but for us it is a distinct possibility as the bears are in control  This decline may not be of the  spike  variety and it could include the occasional bounce particularly as current prices are severely oversold 
On the bullish side we could argue that supply is dwindling  demand especially from China is growing  there is a rise in turmoil across the planet  a new gold exchange in Shanghai  the London mint is to produce gold coins  money printing  etc  We are all aware of the above along with the many metrics and data points that normally support higher prices and suggest that gold prices should be much  much  higher than they are today 
Conclusion
We are finding it difficult to come up with a catalyst that would ignite gold and silver prices and despite the positive factors bearing on gold they are having no effect whatsoever 
The next bounce in prices  if and when it comes could be another false dawn disguised as a rally and we have had many of those over the last three years  Our preference is to watch the market and use any bounce in prices to establish short positions  It may be possible to trade the bounce with long positions but as investors we would need to be very nimble and move in and out with some speed and gusto  which is not everyone s cup of tea 
Disclaimer  We have kept most of our funds in  and are pleased to have done so as we can now buy at cheaper entry prices or open short positions without feeling too pressured if a trade goes against us in the early days of its existence  By adopting a flexible approach whereby we can be bearish or bullish in any market sector  our  trading team has generated a profit of 932 79  in just 5 years  
Do try not to be a perma anything  as such rigidity takes from you the opportunities that are presented by the markets in both directions 
Got a comment  then please fire it in whether you agree with us or not  as the more diverse comments we get the more balance we will have in this debate and hopefully our trading decisions will be better informed and more profitable

120185,341700,AEM,Can A Mining Company Grow In A Precious Metals Bear Market ,opinion,"Chuck Jeannes is the CEO of Goldcorp Inc   the largest gold mining company in the world by its market cap of almost  17 billion 
Goldcorp operates mines all over North and South America  This year  Goldcorp Inc  NYSE GG  took part in a takeover battle for Osisko Mining  After Goldcorp made an initial hostile bid  Osisko did what most companies do in that situation   it shopped around for another bidder  In the end  Osisko succeeded in soliciting a substantially higher bid  which it finally accepted  from Yamana Gold Inc  NYSE AUY  and Agnico Eagle Mines Limited  NYSE AEM  
Mr  Jeannes explained the reasoning behind its Osisko takeover attempt  among other subjects  In the end   that opportunity for value creation evaporated so we walked away   he explained  But takeover battles have not been all bad for him   that s actually how he first encountered Ian Telfer  the man who would later put him at the helm of Goldcorp 
Goldcorp is the third largest holding of Sprott s new ETF  the Sprott Gold Miners ETF  NYSE SGDM   As of November 20  the ETF had a 12 91  weighting in Goldcorp Inc   which is subject to change  
How does a major mining company like Goldcorp use a bear market in precious metals to grow its business 
Well  many of the mining businesses that have been successful over the last 10 to 15 years had their start in the last bear market  The current market feels a lot like 1999 2000 and that was a time when the companies that had the ability to do so had fantastic opportunities to go out an acquire assets at deflated prices and build new companies 
If you look back at the success of Goldcorp  for example  it started with Ian Telfer doing exactly that with Wheaton River  At that point in time  I was part of Glamis Gold and we were doing the same thing   acquiring assets in a bear market at low prices  The result is what you see today   Goldcorp  which has become the largest gold mining firm in the world by market capitalization  after we put Glamis and Goldcorp together  Sorry  that s a long answer to a simple question  but I see this market as one of opportunity for a company like ours that has the balance sheet to do something 
Ian Telfer  a well known figure in the mining sector who is credited with building up several multi billion dollar   is the person who nominated you for the CEO position at Goldcorp  How did you first meet Ian and how did your business relationship with him come about 
Well  it s kind of interesting  Of course  you meet a lot of people at conferences and so on  and I think I maybe had shaken hands with him a few times before  We really got to know each other when Glamis Gold made a hostile bid to take over Goldcorp in late 2004  Goldcorp turned to Wheaton River for a friendly transaction as a defensive measure against our bid  Ian was the CEO of Wheaton River and he and Rob McEwen at Goldcorp were fighting off the bid from Glamis Gold  Of course  during the period of a hostile bid  there isn t much socializing among the antagonists  But at the end I will always remember how gracious Ian was  They won the day and Wheaton River and Goldcorp merged  I then went to the shareholders  meeting to be the official Glamis representative  Ian was  as I said  very gracious as a winner and reminded me that it was a small business and that we d be crossing paths again  Indeed  a few years later  we did   when Glamis and Goldcorp got together on a friendly basis 
Goldcorp recently faced off against Yamana Gold and Agnico Eagle to take over Osisko  a producing mining company  It looks like Yamana and Agnico Eagle have taken the prize with a larger bid  Are big miners changing their strategy to take over producing mining companies instead of raw deposits  Are they becoming purely mine operators instead of mine builders 
No  I wouldn t say so  I think the bid for Osisko was an opportunity that we saw to create value based on a mispricing of that company and its shares late last year and early this year  With a low gold price and a lack of interest in the equity markets  we just felt that Osisko was extremely undervalued  If we could acquire that company at the right price  we liked the asset and it would fit well into our portfolio  It s all about price  though  and after we made the bid  the gold market came back a bit and the equities all traded up  That opportunity for value creation evaporated so we walked away 
You ve said that the mining business is a  people business    it s not all about the rocks in the ground  How does having the right team impact the viability of a mining company over the long term 
I think it s all about the humans that are making the decisions at these mining companies  The business is based on getting rock out of the ground  doing it at the right costs and with the right capital expenditures  but there are people making every one of those decisions  doing the initial resource modeling  the feasibility studies  and then actually building and operating the mines 
The better the people  the better the success you re going to have  I absolutely believe that success in this business  or any business  is about having the best quality people  You can look in our industry   there have been some big strategic decisions made over the last decade  Some of those have turned out really well  and some not so well  Those decisions were all made by people  So  I think you have to look first to the quality of the people in a company as the critical item for your investment criteria 
In your experience of operating and building mines  what have been some of the positive surprises  and what have been some of the negative surprises or unforeseen risks that have materialized 
On the positive side  it s usually always the geology  If you look at our Eleonore project in Quebec as an example  we based that decision to build the mine on the belief that we had 4 or 5 million ounces of gold in potential resources that would eventually become proven reserves  and this would justify building the mine  As we started building it  we increased that to 7 million ounces and I m confident that it will move up well above 10 million ounces over time  When you get to know a deposit  you find that you often had more ounces than you initially expected  That s consistent over the entire industry  Most mines outlive their initial feasibility study mine life because additional resources are found along the way  That s one of the reasons  I think  that people make a mistake by valuing mining companies just based on current proven and probable reserves  Historically  those reserves tend to grow over time 
As to negatives  it would be  country risk   That s something that is part of our business and we just have to deal with  For instance  along with Barrick as the operator  we built the Pueblo Viejo mine in Dominican Republic and just after we finished constructing it  the government came back for another piece of the pie  That is something that you have no power to stop  but when it happens it can be fairly detrimental  That mine is operating fairly well and spinning off a lot of cash  They still did take an extra piece of it ",2014-11-24,Commodity Trade Mantra,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-a-mining-company-grow-in-a-precious-metals-bear-market-233536,233536
120186,341701,AEM,Going For Mexican Gold,opinion,"Mexico s massive precious metals belts are some of the world s finest  As global  1 in silver production they are obviously quite well known for the shiny white metal  But these belts have also been flexing their gold muscles recently  placing Mexico among the world s top 10 producers 
Mexico really has come a long way over the course of gold s bull market  Back in 2003 there were actually 20 other countries producing more gold  But with prices trending higher after a long bear  this country s favorable geology  generally friendly geopolitics  and mild climate physiography started attracting attention  And the exploration cycle that followed has yielded numerous discoveries 
The development of many of these discoveries has resulted in a greater than four fold increase in production since 2003 to  3m ounces annually  Major miners like Goldcorp Inc  NYSE GG  and Agnico Eagle Mines Limited  NYSE AEM  have built some big mines  Smaller miners the likes of Alamos Gold and Timmins Gold have also contributed several mines to the mix  And exploration companies like GoGold Resources are grooming the next generation of Mexican gold mines 
Despite a robust mining history that pre dates the Spanish colonials  the modern day miners are finding that the miners of yore had literally only scratched the surface  Mexico s abundant high grade surface deposits kept them busy over the centuries  but ultimately they didn t have the knowledge  understanding  and technology to tackle the lower grade ore or to go very deep to find the source deposits 
Today s miners have had great success not only making fresh new discoveries  but using the historic workings as treasure maps to find quality deposits  And a treasure map is what GoGold used to zero in on its flagship gold deposit 
This asset is the Santa Gertrudis project located in northeastern Sonora  about 65km south of the Mexico USA border  And it was historic mine workings that initially attracted the modern miners to the area back in the 1980s  These miners performed systematic exploration that identified several sedimentary rock hosted gold occurrences  And this led to a fantastic discovery that was eventually developed into a profitable mining operation 
Blast from the past miners Phelps Dodge and Campbell Red Lake operated the Santa Gertrudis open pit mine from 1991 to closure in 2000  over which time it produced an impressive 564k ounces  This deposit was far from depleted though upon shutdown  which was prompted by Campbell s demise and ultimately bear market low metals prices  So really it would only be a matter of time before Santa Gertrudis got another look 
The first meaningful work occurred several years later  conducted by junior Animas Resources  And positive results from Animas  field studies and drilling is what eventually captured GoGold s attention  After due diligence and a bidding war with another potential suitor  GoGold was able to acquire Animas in a deal that closed in April 2014  And its work over the last year or so has been incredibly encouraging 
Work completed by GoGold Resources Inc   TO GGD   includes an extensive data review  which incorporated assays from over 2500drill holes  It also created 3D models using 200 000 blast holes from dozens of pits on the property  And it performed confirmation and resource drilling of its own in order to feed an updated resource estimate and preliminary economic assessment 
This resource estimate showed Santa Gertrudis to be a high quality million ounce pluscomplex of deposits  including 810k ounces in the indicated category and 255k ounces in the inferred category  These resources grade over 1 0 g t  which is excellent for surface oxide ore  And since the majority of the ore is oxidized  it is amenable to heap leaching 
The PEA that was announced in September indeed outlined a conventional open pit heap leach operation to extract the ore  which would run at a rate of 7 5k metric tons per day  The pregnant solution from the cyanide leach would be fed into centrally located carbon in leach and absorption desorption recovery plants for processing  And over a proposed 12 year mine life  Santa Gertrudis would produce an average of 56k ounces of gold per year 
And what s really appealing about this prospective mine is its potential economics  It would only cost an estimated  32m to develop  And paying back this capital would be really quick with projected life of mine all in sustaining costs of only  699 ounce  This allows for a staggering 58 after tax internal rate of return at  1250 gold  and a still impressive 34  IRR at  1000 gold  Building this mine really is an economic no brainer 
Santa Gertrudis also has huge upside potential with the mineralization in many of its resource zones still open in several directions  GoGold will however focus on mine development before throwing too much capital at exploration  And fortunately it has a managerial technical team that is very adept at building mines 
CEO Terry Coughlan and Strategic Advisor Brad Langille had previously developed the Ocampo mine  one of Mexico s largest gold silver mines  while running Gammon Gold  And they hope to make a development decision at Santa Gertrudis by mid year  If the decision is positive and permitting financing fall into place in a timely manner  I suspect the Santa Gertrudis mine will pour its first gold in 2016 
Front running Santa Gertrudis  highly anticipated development decision is the ramping up of operations at GoGold s fascinating Parral tailings project  Parral is located in the Chihuahua city of Hidalgo del Parral  And yes  this project literally resides in the city 
Hidalgo del Parral was founded as a mining town way back in the early 1600s  And centuries of successful silver mining grew it to become one of Chihuahua s largest  Also large is a tailings pile from the region s largest mine  And rather curiously  this pile resides near the center of the city  Needless to say this massive pile of rocks has grown to become a nuisance  And the city got creative in its effort to remove it 
Not surprisingly historical recoveries were low  leaving this pile with quite a bit of metals remaining  The city thus partnered with a mining company  GoGold Resources  to reprocess it  To do so GoGold built a heap leach operation about 10km outside of the city  which just recently achieved commercial production  So not only does Hidalgo del Parral get its tailings pile relocated for free  it gets a 12  net profits interest on whatever is recovered 
GoGold of course gets a sweet deal out of this too  After operating costs and paying out the city s NPI  it gets whatever profits remain  And with silver cash costs expected to be in the range of  6 ounce  there should be some good profits on anticipated production of 1 2m ounces of silver and 11k ounces of gold per year 
The Parral tailings recovery operation was originally expected to have a 12 year mining life  But it gained even more longevity with the recent addition of a second tailings pile   1km away  that has resources of 9 1m ounces of silver and 49k ounces of gold  bringing the project total to 36m 263k ounces respectively 
GoGold was able to construct Parral 7  under budget  which shows its acumen in mine development and ultimately provides confidence in Santa Gertrudis  capex estimate  And it will use Parral s cash flow to help fund the development of its gold mine as well as to pay off some upcoming debt obligations 
Overall a newly producing low cost operation  a prospective low cost development  and a strong exploration portfolio makes GoGold Resources a very attractive junior mining stock  It has performed very well since its 2010 IPO  And based on its recent price action  I suspect it ll be one of the leaders when precious metals prices recover 

Like all precious metals companies  GGD s fortunes are ultimately slaved to gold  Its profits and the value of its projects directly fluctuate with the price activity of the yellow metal  So naturally its stock  in blue  is generally going to respond to gold s  in red  daily movements  And also as is the case for all precious metals companies  GGD s 4 year chart isn t very pretty 
It s been an incredibly tough season for PM stock investors  there s no sugar coating it  But when the PMs finally run higher  these stocks will fly  And I want to be in on the companies with the highest probability for success  Fundamentals are of course the most important factor to a stock s future  But when I consider buying one  I do like to take a look at its chart to see how it s done in the past  And for a gold stock  how it s responded to its underlying metal 
One way to evaluate a stock in a down environment is to see how it responds to spells of upward momentum  Since its 2011 all time high  gold s had five meaningful uplegs  And an initial glance at GGD s leverage numbers  in yellow  are certainly cause for a head scratcher  But as you ll find  there s more than meets the eye 
In gold s first upleg in early 2012 GGD positively leveraged gold nearly 2 to 1  which is good but not great  I d like to see at least 3 to 1  but interestingly GGD s performance was pandemic of the sector  Gold stocks in general didn t exhibit the outstanding positive leverage expected during this upleg 
In 2012 s second upleg GGD didn t leverage gold at all  Normally this would be very concerning  but you ll notice GGD s flatline over the entire quarter leading up to and into the first part of that upleg  The reason for this flatline is the stock was halted due to its acquisition of the company that owned Parral 
At the time GGD was listed on the TSX Venture Exchange  it now lists on the larger Toronto Stock Exchange   and the TSXV requires trading in stocks of GGD s tier level to be halted until the acquisition is accepted by the exchange  If GGD had been trading over that period  I suspect its stock would have fallen way lower along with the entire sector  It thus would have had a lower base going into upleg  2  which ultimately would have led to a much higher gain 
In upleg  3 in 2013 GGD again didn t positively leverage gold much  This also would normally be very concerning given the big run most gold stocks had during this time  But again  there s an explanation for GGD s underperformance  First is it was right at the beginning of this upleg  in July  that GGD announced a major financing agreement to fund Parral s construction  The markets never like financings 
Second  and perhaps more important  was GGD s price action prior to this upleg  Provocatively from its upleg  2 high to the base where upleg  3 began  GGD onlyfell 41   This is still painful  but far less so than the rest of the sector  Most junior gold stocks fell twice as hard over this period  It was a brutal soul sucking stretch for investors as they watched their juniors lose in the neighborhood of 80 of their value  If you can believe it  GGD actually had relative strength amidst 2013 s epic blood bath 
In upleg  4 GGD was an all star  gaining 88 to gold s 16   5 4x leverage   But in the latest upleg GGD has yet again seemingly underperformed the metal  Again this would normally be very concerning  but take a look at the trend channels over the last year or so  Unfortunately gold has trended lower on balance  hitting a new bear low in Q4  GGD on the other hand has moved countertrend to the metal en route to achieving a new multi year high 
Putting these trend channels into perspective  from their late 2013 lows GGD is up a whopping 73 while gold is up only 1  to this week  If GGD can deliver this kind of strength in a very weak gold market  imagine what it can do when the metal gets some legs  GGD s fundamentals are solid  and despite its mixed leverage in gold uplegs the chart shows that this stock is capable of great things 
The bottom line is GoGold Resources is going for gold in Mexico  Its excellent Santa Gertrudis project has one of the most attractive development profiles you ll see anywhere  And when it pulls the trigger on construction  it should be able to fast track to production 
In the meantime GoGold is working to ramp up and fine tune its fascinating tailings recovery project  Once firing on all cylinders  its Parral operation will be a spectacular low cost silver gold producer that ought to provide solid cash flow even at lower metals prices  And judging by its performance  GGD is already a stock that investors fancy  It ought to soar once gold finally turns the corner ",2015-03-01,Scott Wright,https://www.investing.com/analysis/going-for-mexican-gold-243407,243407
120187,341702,AEM,Positive Outlook On Gold From PDAC,opinion,"In 2014  the tone at the Prospectors   Developers of Canada  PDAC  Convention was decidedly chillier inside the hall than it was outside 
I couldn t get one gold or silver company executive to look me in the eye  Some didn t even come to the conference 
But today  the atmosphere inside the convention hall is warm and jovial  There s a heavy layer of snow on the ground  but hundreds of  and industrial metals companies are out in full force 
That s because gold has started to emerge from a six year slump  And the reasons to own gold and mining shares are piling up like mountains of bullion 
Bullish Indicator No  1  Lean  Mean Miners
Last year  share prices for metals companies were hitting multi year lows 
The price of gold  silver  and other metals had crashed hard in 2013  and many much lauded acquisitions had gone bust as a result  The biggest was a  14 billion write down by Rio Tinto  NYSE RIO   much of which was related to the  38 billion acquisition of Alcan  the aluminum giant 
Barrick Gold Corporation  NYSE ABX   too  has written off close to  9 billion for entities it owns 
In fact  miners have written off more than  50 billion in projects in the past two years after some overly optimistic asset buying sprees over the past decade  totaling close to  200 billion 
But things are different this year 
Instead of buying up any ol  hole in the ground when gold prices were hovering around  2 000 per ounce  miners are making deals at more rational levels 
Last year  Goldcorp Inc  NYSE GG  announced plans to buy Osisko  a miner with potentially more than 10 million ounces of gold in the ground  It offered  2 6 billion  only to be outbid by a joint partnership of Agnico Eagle Mines Limited  NYSE AEM  and Yamana Gold Inc  NYSE AUY  
This is notable because  a decade ago  Goldcorp would likely have counter offered instead of walking away  Instead  Goldcorp moved on and bought a smaller miner  Probe  for just over  400 million 
Similar smaller deals have taken place across the market  And at the PDAC  there s talk that two giants  Barrick and Newmont Mining Corporation  NYSE NEM   may restart merger talks 
The point that I m trying to make is that miners have learned a very hard and expensive lesson about overpaying for assets in a frenzied bull market  These days it s about the costs and overhead 
The miners you can buy today are leaner and more equipped to make profits with prices where they are  Plus  a move higher will result in stronger profit numbers  as they ve dumped many of the cash holes that were dragging down their finances 
And when it comes to the metal itself  there are a few more reasons to invest 
Three More Bullish Signs for Gold
The second reason is that from a technical point of view  gold has made a triple bottom  It s bounced off the  1 150 to  1 200 level nicely  It s even jumped to  1 300 recently before pulling back 
Now  gold is up against a surging greenback  which has an inverse correlation to gold prices  as the metal is priced in dollars  When you look at other currencies  like the euro and yen  gold prices are surging 
Which bring me to the next factor to consider  Currency wars and devaluations are prime reasons to own gold  since it s seen as a historical store of value   Speaking of currencies  Founder Robert Williams recently discovered a new currency that could take on Bitcoin  
Third  central banks all over the world are lowering interest rates  with China being the latest 
Low rates or even negative rates  as we ve seen from Switzerland and Denmark   are terrible for those seeking income  But it weakens the argument against holding gold  as one of the major benefits of holding cash is the interest rate 
Fourth  lower interest rates in emerging markets will foster economic growth 
India is a major gold buyer  and its gross domestic product is expected to grow in excess of 7  this year  That puts it ahead of China  which is also beginning to stimulate its economy  That s means a lot of rupees and yuan will be chasing gold in the coming months 
Bottom line  If you don t own gold  you should consider adding some to your portfolio 
The stage is set for a rally in the sector after more than six years of pain  And if the mood at PDAC is any guide  the market is shining with a new luster 
And the chase continues

120188,341703,AEM,Auryn s Management Finds Success,opinion,"After Agnico Eagle Mines Limited  NYSE AEM  gobbled up Cayden Resources in a mostly share based deal worth CA 205 million  Shawn Wallace and Ivan Bebek are back with another gold exploration story  Auryn Resources Inc   TO AUG   The successful tandem with Wallace as CEO and Bebek as chairman have a following among junior gold investors and hope to grow the Committee Bay gold project in Nunavut into a district scale project worthy of a suitor s interest  If that s not enough  the company has plans to acquire a low cost  high quality gold asset to add to its project portfolio  In this interview with The Gold Report  Wallace shares his perspective on the junior market and his lofty goals for Auryn 
The Gold Report  Please give us an overview of Auryn Resources and its genesis 
Shawn Wallace   Auryn Resources Inc   AUG TSX V  is the third company that Auryn chairman Ivan Bebek and I have started  Previously we founded Keegan Resources and later Cayden Resources  Keegan became Asanko Gold Inc  AMEX AKG  and it merged with its neighbor  PMI Gold  While working with Asanko in Ghana  we met Auryn COO Michael Henrichsen  a brilliant structural geologist with Newmont Mining Corp   NYSE NEM NYSE  
After Cayden was bought by Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd   AEM TSX  AEM NYSE   our team began a global search for an asset with three key attributes  it had to be a district scale opportunity  which means a land package where multiple deposits could be developed in the same geological setting  it had to be situated in a stable jurisdiction where people get mining permits in a reasonable timeframe  and it had to be high grade because it s only in times like these when you can economically acquire high grade assets  We searched in a bunch of countries but Committee Bay ticked off all the boxes 
Auryn has people from Cayden and Keegan on the board  which has made the integration of a new company into the group almost seamless  We had about  9 million   9M  in cash at the start of this year but it is about  7M now because we have started spending money on Committee Bay  And a lot of that money came from us  We invest in our company 
TGR  Why has your group had so much success  even in difficult markets 
SW  The key to our success is that we re a disciplined group with skilled people  We know what we re good at and what we want to achieve  Ivan and I get a lot of the pats on the back  but frankly  it s our technical people the geologists and geoscientists who go into the field and create value for our shareholders  I was with the Hunter Dickinson Group for 15 years before Ivan and I formed this group about 10 years ago  That is where I learned how to do things 
Our ability to adapt and be flexible to changing times and not getting too hung up on the things that we can t control and trying to mitigate the risk of the things we can control has helped us in these difficult markets  We re not going to issue shares just to keep the lights on  Many companies have fallen into that trap  We re not going to let that happen 
TGR  What are some examples of how you have mitigated risk 
SW  It s about picking where and how we spend our capital  For example  with Keegan in 2008 when the markets crashed and our share price went from about  4 to  0 50  we had about  7M in the treasury when Ivan and I sat down and said   We have to stop drilling in order to preserve our capital   whereas a lot of companies continued to drill  Why would you drill holes and put results into a market that could not care less  But because we ceased drilling we didn t have to raise money until the markets had recovered  That sort of prudence kept dilution to a minimum  If a company has too much cheap stock  it usually can t recover 
TGR  What are some ways that you are creating value with less money 
SW  Right now we are preserving value  rather than creating it  by being prudent  But we are also in acquisition mode  We re creating value by purchasing or getting involved with high quality assets that would not be available in a better market  The Committee Bay Joint Venture is one example  We will spend  6M over 18 months to earn a 51  stake in Committee Bay  We have a top technical team that will make its decisions using a precise  science based approach to exploration  We re not drilling for the market 
The best way to add value is to either acquire gold through transactions or discover more gold  We d rather spend more time exploring the land package because  frankly  that s what we do  Cayden is an excellent example  Agnico is going to build it and carry on but because of the share rollover  if people want to continue to have exposure to the El Barque o asset that we were developing in Cayden  they can remain Agnico shareholders and get paid a dividend along the way 
TGR  Pitch me on Committee Bay 
SW  It s really simple  It s a 300 kilometer  300km  greenstone belt where  100M was spent on exploration over the last 20 years  The Three Bluffs deposit has a 1 1 million ounce gold resource with a grade of over 8 grams per ton  8 g t  gold  The deposit holds together beautifully and we re going to make it even bigger  But the even bigger opportunity is the potential of the belt  Every stepout hole that has been drilled has met with success  but then it wasn t followed up  That s very exciting 
I mentioned that we wanted a project in a good jurisdiction  Well  this is a good jurisdiction  You can permit mines in Nunavut  Agnico is there  Privately held TMAC Resources Inc  is there  This part of Canada is challenging because it s remote but you can permit and finance projects there and  frankly  the price was right  This is an asset that s had  100M spent on it and probably three quarters of that is scientific data that we can use to strategically explore this asset 
TGR  Are you the operator 
SW  We are the operator right now and when it turns into a joint venture we ll still be the operator  North Country Gold Corp  TO NCG  has been working there for 20 years so we re leveraging its experience  There are five drills turning at Committee Bay  The company did a fantastic job making discoveries from outcrops  and there are not many mineralized outcrops  It speaks to the endowment of this particular mineral belt  Without using induced polarization surveys and other forms of geophysics  it s difficult to find targets on this type of belt 
TGR  Cayden was working on the Guerrero Gold Belt in Mexico  Your team is certainly familiar with that type of geological setting 
SW  When we went out to make acquisitions with the Hunter Dickinson Group  they always had to be significant  With Auryn we did not want a postage stamp somewhere that would produce 45 000 ounces  45 Koz  a year  That s not for us  We re going for large scale  It s all about getting that critical mass because that s the only way we re going to get a major mining company interested in making a transaction 
TGR  What are your biggest challenges with Committee Bay 
SW  Certainly the remote location is a challenge but it s not as remote as it is perceived to be  One of our challenges is properly communicating to people that we can mitigate those costs and risks through proper planning and execution  There is an old Italian tailor s adage that says measure twice  cut once  We re going to measure three times here because if you get it wrong  it s expensive  Good execution is really important 
TGR  How far away is Agnico Eagle Mines  Meadowbank open pit mine in Nunavut 
SW  From the southern part of our project  the West Plains target  where we have 15 g t gold over 10 meters  10m  in some drill holes  Agnico Eagle is only 60km away  In that part of the word that s next door  It s exciting that the company is there and having success but it shouldn t imply anything just because Agnico bought Cayden  This is almost coincidental  We both happen to like these types of jurisdictions  Agnico brings a lot of credibility to the idea that the Arctic is a good place to be 
TGR  What are your near  and long term goals with Auryn 
SW  The near term goal is to execute on an exploration program this summer at Committee Bay  Our team of geoscientists has reprocessed older drilling and exploration data and will head to Committee Bay to do some more geophysics and mapping  We re going to bring in a rotary air blast drill in July and drill 3 000 5 000m  These drills only go down about 100m  but we don t think prospecting with diamond drills is capital efficient  We won t be able to drill 500m deep holes  but we re trying to make new discoveries  If we can t get the imprint of a new discovery in the top 100m  then it s probably not going to be something that we want to pursue  We re pretty excited about what s coming this summer 
The other near term goal is to acquire additional assets  You can expect that  it can take months or even years to make an acquisition  It s not important how long it takes  It s important that we get the right deal on the right asset 
Our long term goal is to develop a company that is full of high grade  high quality gold assets because that s where we can create the most value  We want to use our currency that we have with our shares  with our ability to raise capital thanks to recent successes  and make these acquisitions at a time when others are financially challenged 
TGR  Are you looking at properties in the vicinity of Committee Bay or are you looking in different jurisdictions 
SW  It would be good for us to get something farther south but Canada is definitely a good theme  But it s all about the right asset  We could easily see us doing something in Nevada or Ontario or even Mexico again 
TGR  Is there a risk of spreading your resources too thin 
SW  No  We won t do that  The Committee Bay project is fully staffed  We brought in the team from our joint venture partner  so we re not stretched  From a cash perspective  however  we would certainly need to raise additional capital if we found what we believed was an accretive transaction 
TGR  You and other members of your management team have made considerable money in previous deals  Why not just walk away 
SW  If it were about money I could have stopped doing this 20 years ago  It s not been about the money for a long time  Money is the trophy but we re a pretty young group  I m only 45 years old  Ivan is 37  We just spent 20 years getting good at it and we continue to improve  There s no way we re going to stop now  We want to be the people making the wave  not the people riding it 
TGR  Your team has a following among investors  How does that change how you do business 
SW  We do have a following  I ve lacked the perspective of what it s like not to have a following  That s not to say that we haven t had our lean times  That just comes with being in this business  We are very respectful of our following and we don t take it for granted  Capital is fickle  The most important thing is that we continue to take a science based approach to exploration and properly communicate what we are doing to the market  Everybody knows that the odds of crossing the goal line the way we did with Cayden are not high  but there are ways you can increase your odds  We make every effort to make that happen 
TGR  How much capital will you end the year with 
SW  Over the next four months we re going to spend about  4M as part of our earn in agreement  Our current budget has us coming to the end of 2015 with about  2 5M and then spending some cash on general and administrative  G A  expenses  We ve kept our G A down  We re in a B class building off the beaten path in Vancouver  We ran Keegan and Cayden from here  Capital efficiency is a big theme for us 
TGR  Roughly what percentage of Auryn does management own 
SW  About 30 35   with another 35  owned by people close to us even family members are in Auryn 
TGR  Does that concentration of ownership pose liquidity issues 
SW  Auryn is certainly not the most liquid stock  We have to weigh that against how tightly held the stock is  I d rather be tightly held and have some liquidity issues as opposed to be being very sloppy  We try to strike a balance  One of the reasons that Ivan and I are successful business partners is that we share certain principles and one of them is to be antidilutive 
TGR  When will you have to go back to the market 
SW  We will probably do that sometime between now and the end of the year  We ll wait for a window  We have some things that we want to get out to the market before we would contemplate a financing  We recently returned from a marketing trip in Toronto and New York  Our story was very well received  I think you re going to see some analysts initiate coverage 
TGR  Auryn is not a well known name in the junior mining space  What are three or four things that you believe are going to change that 
SW  There are very few others in the space competing for attention  Three things would be continuing to make accretive acquisitions  having some exploration success and spending money prudently on marketing efforts  That s important  We have an adage here  If you re spending money on the ground  you need to be spending money on marketing  Those are things that are going to help us be better known 
TGR  What are some things that this market has taught you that perhaps a bull market would not 
SW  I ve been through a few of these so this one isn t anything special  But I m glad it s here because now we can buy things in a rational manner  Patience is probably the most important skill that anyone who tries to do what we do needs to have because people tend to make more impetuous decisions in a bull market  both technical and financial  Now those people have to live with those decisions  To be patient and measured in everything you do is important 
TGR  You now have merger and acquisition  M A  experience  What are some specific project attributes that make them more likely to be takeover targets than others 
SW  One type of project that is going to trigger more M A would be district scale projects  Major gold producers want assets significant enough to impact their balance sheets  That means a potential takeover target has to be something where a major could get in and produce a significant amount of metal at a proper margin for years and years  That s why we were so adamant that we wanted a project with district scale potential  If a project has good grade in a significant land package in the right jurisdiction  it is only a matter of time before suitors take notice 
TGR  Please tell our readers some things they can look forward to before the end of 2015 
SW  People can look forward to seeing Auryn continue to make accretive acquisitions for the company  and we will launch our first exploration program at Committee Bay  We should generate a fair bit of excitement with the kind of results that we re expecting  This is an exciting time in the markets  I m looking forward to the next three to five years

120189,341704,AEM,Gold Stocks Love Janet Yellen,opinion,"In the Western gold community  there seems to be a fairly widely held view that gold prices can t rise much higher  unless confidence in central banking is lost 
I beg to differ  Investors who bet against central banks generally don t fare very well  The 2008 crisis saw the Fed use some of its tools  but not all of them  The Fed s most powerful tools  gold revaluation and money printing  were never employed in that crisis 
Until the Fed has used all its most powerful tools  and those tools have clearly failed  a  loss of confidence  event that creates massive gold buying is highly unlikely 
What is likely in 2015  is that the bond market won t crash  but will modestly decline  as the Fed raises interest rates later this year  in a calm and rational manner 
It s important to understand the effect on the US economy of absolute changes in bond yields  versus relative changes in yields 

That s the monthly T bond chart  I would expect to see T bonds decline toward the 120 area by 2016 
The dollar is unlikely to rally much as bonds decline  because the rate hikes will provide incentive to commercial banks to increase their loan activity  increasing money velocity 
That increase in velocity will produce a noticeable rise in inflation  putting upwards pressure on commodity prices and downwards pressure on the dollar 
The upwards pressure from rate hikes and downwards pressure from inflation should produce sideways to lower price action in the dollar  At a price of 120  absolute T bond yields are still historically low  but the large spread between loan and deposit rates at that price would create enormous profits for the banks  and noticeably higher inflation 
Even without factoring in the staggering growth of the Chindian love trade  gold should be generally well supported just by the US inflation created by heightened bank loan activity 
Analysts who are trying to use the 1970s gold bull market as a  template  for the current period of time are probably making a horrific error  Unlike the late 1970s and early 1980s timeframe  when the Fed used dramatic rate hikes to curtail inflation  the Fed will now use modest rate hikes to create inflation 
Heightened bank loan activity can extend the business cycle  QE4  if used to fund government infrastructure spending  can be inflationary  but if the next crisis is severe  only gold revaluation will work to end it 
Gold trades mainly in dollars  so it doesn t have to be the US central bank that orchestrates a gold price revaluation  I expect the next global super crisis to be resolved by a PBOC  Chinese central bank  publicly announced gold buy program  It could be announced even before the next crisis occurs  to prevent it from happening 

This daily gold chart looks good  Gold clearly penetrated resistance at  1220 yesterday  with a spike to the  1232 area 
Unfortunately  the current rally is getting  long in the tooth   Note the lead line of my key 14 7 7 Stochastics oscillator  at the bottom of the chart  It s close to the overbought zone at 80  Gold has rallied about  80 since that oscillator bottomed 
I m open to a minor trend surge to the  1240    1252 area  before the gold community has to feel some price pain  Light profits need to be booked into this strength 
When gold does decline  albeit in a minor way  I expect numerous gold stocks to rally throughout the sell off  That s because more and more institutional investors are embracing the idea that Janet Yellen will be successful in her reflationary mission 

Clearly  top economists and analysts at major banks are not betting against Janet and her reflationary mission  That s good news for gold stocks and bad news for the general equity markets 

That s the  ARCA GDX  daily chart picture  and I certainly think it speaks a thousand  bull era  words  Unlike most analysts  I think GDX and most gold stocks will display this type of upwards price grind for not just weeks or months to come  but for many years and probably for several decades 
That s because gold is driven by three key themes now  Indian demand that is in its earliest stages of massive growth  Chinese gold market infrastructure growth  and US reflation  Simply put  there s never been a better time in history to own gold stocks  from both a risk and reward standpoint 
Key individual gold stocks are leading the gold stock indexes higher 

That s the daily chart for Agnico Eagle Mines Limited  NYSE AEM   When the fear trade  system risk  dominated price discovery for gold stocks  the  Eagle  soared  and then crashed  In the love trade era  fuelled by Chindian jewellery demand and modest US reflation  I expect Agnico to glide higher steadily  rather than soar or crash 
Outrageous returns can be produced by this kind of  stealth rise  in the price of a gold stock  particularly when the rise in price is relentless  A pullback to the blue uptrend line would be normal after the recent price advance  but a successful breakout above the  35 area is likely imminent 

This daily chart of Barrick Gold  NYSE ABX  looks spectacular  Investors need to  kick their fears to the curb and boldly buy this stock on all two and three day pullbacks in the current price area 
There s a chance of a bigger pullback toward  11  but the odds of that happening are fading  A two day close above  13 70 should herald a much stronger advance  towards the  20 area 

That s daily ARCA Gold BUGS chart  a widely followed gold stocks index  Note the nice position of the 14 7 7 Stochastics series  and the gentle rising price channel  The HUI index is a great golden tortoise  plodding her way to much higher prices

120221,341736,AEM,Time For Junior Mining Investors To Wake Up From Summer Doldrums  ,opinion,"Its time to wake up from your summer doldrums   The technical signals are turning positive for precious metals and the junior gold and silver miners   The record shorts such as hedge funds and high speed traders who have been manipulating the paper market may soon run scared as major accumulation has entered the sector this month 
Gold and silver have held the lows and major volume and big money is coming into the sector   The record short position may already be running from cover   The Junior Gold Miner ETF ARCA GDXJ  is already up 15  this month 
With geopolitical tensions increasing in the Middle East and Eastern Europe get ready for a big breakout at  1400 on gold   The move in the junior miners and silver could be huge and provide great leverage 
Also watch the oil price making a big jump as all of Iraq s oil is at jeopardy of being lost as Al Qaeda takes over key areas   Higher energy prices could influence the inflationary forces hear in the United States creating a possible stagflation 
Remember the US  European and Japanese economies are not growing  yet equity and food prices are soaring   The stock market and US bonds are way overvalued  while gold  silver and junior miners are just beginning to breakout of a multiyear base   As accumulation continues in the precious metals look for the record short position to cover 
The accumulation in high quality junior gold miners is happening right before our very eyes   For instance look at one of our featured companies Integra Gold  TO ICG  who just  that their Private Placement is oversubscribed due to major demand from investors 
Integra hopes to be Quebec s next major gold producer and is raising  8 million to advance their Lamaque Project in Val D or   This is probably the highest grade undeveloped gold mine in Quebec right now with over 3 3 million tones at over 7g tonne 
Integra came out with a positive Preliminary Economic Assessment  PEA  in April which I was very excited about and shared with my premium subscribers   The numbers look excellent with low capex  quick payback and a high rate of return   The metallurgy is excellent 
The money raised should be able to expand the resource with more drilling and increase the mine life as management continues to actively explore   They are that are thick and higher grade   There are assays pending and over 57 000 meters of drilling has not been added to the previous resource   An updated resource should come public after the next round of drilling later this year which may be exciting for shareholders able to get in at these lower prices 
Integra Gold may be a classic takeover target as they have one of the highest grade advanced stage gold projects in Quebec and is located in the same district as Osisko s 10 Million gold ounce Malartic Project which is currently under acquisition by Yamana Gold Inc  NYSE AUY  and Agnico Eagle Mines Limited  NYSE AEM  who outbid Goldcorp   Integra s Lamaque Project sits near Agnico Eagle s 1 6 Million Ounce Goldex Mine 
With the recent PEA on Integra s Lamaque Project published I expect some of the majors to show interest in the exceptional high grade gold project with impressive economics   At a base case of  1275 gold  Integra showed an IRR of 51  and a payback of 1 5 years with an NPV of  146 million   This PEA is a major milestone as it shows strong financial returns with quick payback at a relatively low capex 
It must be noted the resource has the potential to grow   Integra has seven exploration drills turning on the property right now   In addition Integra has 30k meters of drilling already completed and 10k meters pending that has not been added to the 2013 resource or factored into this PEA 
One of the most important decisions in investing in a development company is to study the infrastructure and local community support 
Its great to have high grade and fantastic metallurgy but what about the infrastructure and skilled local labor force   Integra s Lamaque Project is located within 3 km of the city of Val d Or  Quebec   Val d Or is a mining community with over 35k people   There is a high level of expertise in underground gold mining   Miners can live and work in the same community which is a major benefit given the fact that it is rare in the industry 
The Lamaque Project is within 200 m of the Trans Canada Highway   The land where the project is located has no homes or businesses which would require relocation   Over the past six months  Integra has been proactive in building a relationship with local community by participating in 25 private and public meeting with stakeholders   The company is encouraged by the support of the local community and is already commencing environmental studies 
Quebec was ranked  11 by Fraser Institute as a mining friendly jurisdiction   Despite the weak junior market  Integra has been able to raise money and attract equity interest from Shandong Gold Group  a  4 7 billion dollar gold producer who owns 5  of Integra and has a seat on the board of directors 
Look for Integra to find support under the 200 day moving average and reverse above it at   23   Notice the large volume accumulation in 2014 signifying major buying   I expect this to continue as they continue to drill and provide a resource update later this year 
Listen to my recent interview with the CEO Steve de Jong after the recent PEA was published below

120222,341737,AEM,A Golden Lift Off Approaches,opinion,Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners  ARCA GDXJ  just took out the 200 day moving average on its second highest volume ever  and record volume in GDXJ was just last week  This is big time accumulation going on  Furthermore checkout mining stocks like MAG Silver Corp   AMEX MVG   Agnico Eagle Mines Limited  NYSE AEM   Sandstorm Gold  ARCA SAND  to name a few  As soon as gold completed the failed breakdown they have gone on a moonshot  This is something that few are talking about because everybody is so beat up and tired of the bear market in gold  But this is exactly the type of behavior that launches a new bull market  big volume and explosive price moves ,2014-06-19,Justin Smyth,https://www.investing.com/analysis/a-golden-lift-off-approaches-216631,216631
120223,341738,AEM,Lawrence Roulston  In A Sea Of Gold  Three Juniors Stand Out,opinion,"According to Lawrence Roulston  the continuing woes of the junior gold sector present a tremendous opportunity to those with the knowledge  savvy and will necessary to take advantage  In this interview with The Gold Report  the publisher of the Resource Opportunities newsletter showcases three companies with management teams that never relent in adding value to their projects 
The Gold Report  Given how troubled the junior gold space has been since 2011  why should investors continue to place their money there rather than the Dow Jones Industrials  which go from strength to strength 
Lawrence Roulston  The simple answer is that there are extraordinary bargains to be had in the junior resource space right now  We re seeing a bifurcation in the sector as the quality companies are beginning to move up  while the majority of companies are still on a downtrend  Anyone who can differentiate between the good companies and the others has the potential to make a lot of money 
TGR  You ve argued that it s a fool s errand trying to predict the near term outlook for metals prices  especially gold  as there are too many variables involved  and the variables change too quickly  Should investors therefore base their decisions on an assumed future gold price of roughly  1 250 ounce   1 250 oz  
LR  When I look at a company in the gold space I m using that number as a baseline  When I examine companies  I consider them first and foremost as investments in projects and management  Metal prices are a secondary consideration  If it doesn t make sense at  1 250 oz  then it s not a good investment  If the gold price rises  that s a bonus 
TGR  Gold prices and gold equities have spiked in recent weeks due to rising tensions in Ukraine and the chaos in Iraq  How should investors regard these events 
LR  I think they are primarily short term reactions  These events cause prices to rise one day and fall the next  And they are really hard to predict 
TGR  A gold price of under  1 300 oz  as compared to over  1 900 oz in 2011  makes the all in production cost crucial  In today s market  how high can production costs go and still remain acceptable 
LR  That s a tough and a complex question  The all in sustaining cost incorporates a large amount of capital expenditure that is spent to get the mine into production  In the long term  of course  it s very important  If the capital is already committed and the company is generating profits on the basis of its cash cost  it makes sense for the company to continue operating in the short term 
It all comes down to margins  Most of my attention is devoted to companies that are in the development stage  not the production stage  Mine developers must be able to demonstrate substantial margins based on the current gold price 
TGR  Is an all in cost of  1 000 oz still doable  or must costs be lower than that 
LR  I look at specific companies  and I tend to evaluate them based less on all in sustaining costs and more from the perspective of discounted net cash flow 
TGR  You have declared   We do not need higher metal prices to make money in the mining business  We just need to own companies with high quality metal deposits   How do you define high quality 
LR  Important determinants are grade  metallurgy and size  Grade is really a function of the specific circumstances of any given deposit  A big open pit deposit at 1 gram per ton  1 g t  may make a lot of sense  In an underground situation you probably need a much higher grade  perhaps as high as 8 10 g t  But grade is only one factor  Metallurgy is important  How is the metal recovered  There is a big range of costs across the different recovery techniques  In some cases  it simply isn t economic to recover the metal  Size is important too  as well as the ability to meet a production level that will result in interest from larger companies 
It s really hard for a small company to develop a single mine and make money off it  The real money is made when those deposits are rolled up into larger  multi mine producing companies  I ask the question   Will a particular deposit be of interest to a midtier or a larger production company in terms of size  production profile  location and other relevant criteria  
TGR  Since 2011  many gold companies have come to grief because they accumulated ounces for their own sake  When larger companies are looking to buy smaller companies and their assets  what are they looking for 
LR  Barrick Gold Corp   NYSE ABX  wrote off  5 1 billion   5 1B  from the value of Pascua Lama  and Kinross Gold Corp   NYSE KGC  wrote off  3 2B from the value of Red Back  These are both big  low grade deposits  So these kinds of deposits have gone out of style 
And yet a bidding war broke out for Osisko Mining Corp   TO OSK   which was eventually bought for  3 5B by Yamana Gold Inc   NYSE AUY  and Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd   NYSE AEM   Osisko s primary asset was the Canadian Malartic mine in Quebec  which produces gold at only 1 g t  So the blanket condemnation of low grade deposits doesn t really make sense  Potential buyers are most interested in the specific characteristics of any particular deposit  High grade deposits are back in style  but the challenge is finding deposits that are both large and high grade 
TGR  You ve noted that 12 of the companies your newsletter follows have raised a total of  184 million   184M  so far this year  Besides high quality deposits  what else do these companies have in common 
LR  Quality management is the crucial attribute of all companies able to raise money in this market  People committed to success  People with skills and experience but also the drive and determination sufficient to overcome obstacles and move projects forward  We hear a lot of people complaining about how difficult it is to raise money today  That attitude is just not going to cut it  There is money available  Management just has to justify to the potential investors that they will achieve a decent return commensurate with the level of risk 
We need managements than can recognize the benefits of a market like this  Many of the companies I follow look at current conditions and see opportunities rather than challenges  Opportunities such as buying high quality deposits from distressed companies 
TGR  When we speak of quality management  does this require individuals who have proven they can bring a mine into production or sell it to a larger company for a healthy profit 
LR  The fact that a management team has achieved success in the past is a pretty good indicator of its ability to repeat this success  Many analysts consider track record the determining factor in management  I agree 
But it s also important to look for rising stars  One of the great joys I ve had in my career has been identifying the young people who will become the success stories of the future  That involves a lot of hard work  meeting them face to face and really understanding where they re coming from and what their plans are  This is a good way to make good profits in mining investment because the companies with established management trade at a premium  Investors who find companies with rising stars benefit from a much lower share price starting point 
TGR  As you mentioned  many people complain how difficult it is to raise money today  Of course it is difficult  and given this fact  how important is it for companies to have financing experts in management or on their boards 
LR  It is critically important  A really successful management team needs a range of skills  and that range of skills is typically much broader than one or even several people can have independently  You need a team that boasts engineering and geological skills  financial skills  as well as someone who can coordinate these skills and keep the project on track 
In today s market  it s very difficult for small mining companies to acquire all these necessary skills  One solution is collective management  a pool of people managing several different companies  This enables them to collectively have all the required skills and to spread the costs over a number of companies 
TGR  Which gold junior operating in Canada is your favorite right now 
LR   Balmoral Resources Ltd   TO BAR   The company has had tremendous exploration success in Qu bec  It made a substantial gold discovery at Martiniere and continues to expand its limits  adding size and scale 
TGR  Where in Quebec are Balmoral s properties located 
LR  Balmoral has huge holdings that extend for about 80 kilometers into the Sunday Detour Lake deformation zone of the Abitibi Greenstone Belt  Its properties are south of James Bay  just on the other side of the Ontario border  On the Ontario side  Detour Gold Corp   TO DGC  is producing over 100 000 ounces  100 Koz  of gold quarterly from a resource in the order of 30 million ounces  30 Moz  
Balmoral has decided  quite wisely  to focus on Martiniere  much of which remains unexplored 
TGR  In addition to gold at Martiniere  Balmoral also has the Grasset nickel platinum group metal  PGM  project  How does the latter make Balmoral more prospective 
LR  Grasset is really a standalone project  I m just guessing here  but it s the sort of thing it might be able to spin off or sell  Balmoral is likely to remain a gold company because that will result in a higher valuation than base metals 
TGR  Balmoral announced June 4 a  4M bought deal  flow through private placement  How does that set it up for financing 
LR  Balmoral has enough money to get through 2015 and possibly beyond 
TGR  When can we expect an initial resource estimate for Martiniere 
LR  Probably by the end of the summer drilling season  but keep in mind Balmoral has only begun to define that deposit 
TGR  How do you rate Balmoral s management 
LR  Very high  CEO Darin Wagner has had considerable success  including the sale of West Timmins Mining to Lake Shore Gold Corp   AMEX LSG  for  424M in 2009  Other members of the geological and management team have had a considerable degree of exploration success 
TGR  What s your favorite gold play in South America 
LR   Columbus Gold Corp   TO CGT   Its Paul Isnard project in French Guiana has 58 1 million tons at 2 22 g t gold  4 15 Moz  Nordgold N V   NORD LSE  is to acquire a majority position in Paul Isnard in exchange for funding it through to feasibility 
TGR  The company announced May 5 that the Paul Isnard resource is to be re evaluated by a different engineering company  Should investors be worried 
LR  I think it s just a blip  I ve spent time talking to the company  and the re evaluation should have no material impact on the overall size and quality of Paul Isnard  I expect that the revised resource number should come back very close to what was announced previously 
Nordgold made a  4 2M option payment May 23  If Columbus had any concern over the validity of the resource  I m sure it would have asked for a deferral on that payment until the matter had been resolved  but it didn t  It s very clear that Nordgold is comfortable with the resource 
TGR  WheneverThe Gold Report asks experts about the best junior gold projects in the world  their lists invariably include Columbus  And yet the company s shares trade at only  0 45  and its market cap is only around  54M  How do you explain this 
LR  One of the challenges that Columbus faces with investors is that they don t really know much about French Guiana  They don t appreciate that it is a department of France ruled by French law and thus a very secure place for investment and very favorable for mine development 
Another factor is uncertainty or misunderstanding the joint venture with Nordgold  When a junior the size of Columbus has a deposit of such size  investors expect a takeover by a larger company  But Columbus  joint venture with Nordgold probably lessens the likelihood of Columbus being taken out  As it stands  Columbus is in the strong position of becoming a significant gold producer without much risk on the financial side 
TGR  Which junior gold company do you like in the United States 
LR   Klondex Mines Ltd   TO KDX  in Nevada  The company just bought the high grade producing Midas mine from Newmont Mining Corp   NYSE NEM   Many of the majors are going through asset rationalizations  and this presents company making opportunities to juniors like Klondex 
TGR  How is the acquisition of Midas company making 
LR  It s an excellent complement to Klondex s Fire Creek gold project 100 miles to the south  which is effectively in production  Fire Creek still needs a full scale development permit  but Klondex is operating under a bulk sampling permit with the ore being trucked to Midas  The Fire Creek ore is exceptionally high grade  284 Koz at 41 5 g t Measured and Indicated and 424 Koz at 23 3 g t Inferred  This means that the trucking cost is essentially inconsequential 
The Midas acquisition is a perfect fit  The Midas operating team is quite accomplished at high grade underground mining situations  such as Fire Creek 
TGR  According to Klondex s April preliminary economic assessment  PEA   the all in cost of Fire Creek gold is  636 oz  Impressive 
LR  It s a very attractive number based on the fact that no mill will be needed on site 
TGR  At the start of this interview  you mentioned the  extraordinary bargains  available today in the junior gold space  Which qualities distinguish a bargain 
LR  Many companies are bargains today  but a year from now they re still going to be bargains  When investors are trying to determine whether a low share price is really an opportunity  they should look for a trigger that will create a higher share price in the foreseeable future 
It comes back to management advancing projects and adding value  for instance  Klondex buying Midas  which gave it a short term path to production for Fire Creek  Or Balmoral  which applied some really smart geological thinking to make a significant discovery and push up share price  Just sitting back waiting for the market to recover is not a viable business plan 
TGR  Is it possible that we might fairly soon get to the point where we stop talking about companies that clearly aren t going anywhere and focus entirely on companies with genuine prospects and that this new focus could engender a general recovery in the junior gold space 
LR  I would very much like to see investor focus shifting to companies with real merit  There are 2 000 companies in the North American junior resource space  Having so many diffuses investor attention and diffuses the talent pool to the point where most don t have realistic prospects of success  A number of struggling juniors have already gone into the marijuana business or other areas outside of mining  More power to them 
We need fewer companies with a greater concentration of talent providing a better focus for investors  It is now more important than ever for mining investors to be selective in their investments because only a few mining companies are going to prosper while most will continue to lose value until we see a general turnaround  which might take another year or two

120225,341740,AEM,Bj rn Paffrath  Mining Sector Bottom Is In And Opportunities Abound,opinion,"Bj rn Paffrath  Switzerland based fund adviser and newsletter writer  is so convinced that we ve seen the bottom in the mining sector that he s launching a new gold and silver fund in Europe  He says capital is trickling back into long forgotten mining equities as the smart money seeks to rotate out of frothier sectors and into real assets  In this interview with The Gold Report  Paffrath also forecasts a broad market correction as he tells us about some promising equity positions 
The Gold Report  Do you expect a broad market correction over the course of the next two years or so 
Bj rn Paffrath  Since the crisis in 2008  most of the well known indexes  such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average or the German DAX  have almost doubled  and many individual companies have performed even better  Of course it is all liquidity driven  but it s at a level where we have to ask  Is it still justified or are we already in the next bubble 
On one side  indexes skyrocketed on the liquidity provided by the central banks  But interest rates and bond yields are so low that they are not keeping pace with inflation  so people put their excess cash in the stock market  And more money exited the underperforming mining sector as the general markets went up 
At some point we will have a painful correction of 30  or more  Maybe it started already  but it s tough to say because there is still a lot of liquidity in the market  There is a good chance that after the correction the bull market could run quite a bit longer  But we all know that we only bought time in Europe and the United States  A lot of Western countries have excessive debt  The painful end will definitely come at some point 
Outside events or black swans also could trigger it  Tension rises between Russia and the Ukraine almost daily now  In the Middle East there are uprisings in Turkey and Libya  Israel and Hamas are battling and there is a civil war in Syria  And Iraq is more and more lost to the IS terrorists  Any of those events getting out of control could trigger further events on the market side 
TGR  Where should investors look for the first signs of problems 
BP  You have to first watch the U S   then Europe and China  The U S  made it out of the recession  but how sound is the foundation without the money that the U S  Federal Reserve is pumping in  That money will probably stop this year  but my guess is that the Fed will find other opportunities to pump more money into the market  We have to watch the U S  closely 
Europe came late to the bond buying game and the peripheral countries Spain  Portugal  Greece are not in great financial shape  The Portuguese recently used bailout cash to shore up Banco Espirito Santo  and Greece will likely require a third bailout  Europe put a curtain on the debt crisis  Everybody is happy with the stock market  but we didn t solve any problems 
China  the future engine of the world  certainly of the mining industry  also has a problem  The central bank there recently warned about a real estate bubble  We never can really trust the economic numbers from China but if the Chinese volunteer information on some potential problems  we have to watch carefully  China could cause a lot of problems for the global economy 
TGR  How should investors plan ahead 
BP  Investors have to find a way to still participate in the buoyancy of the market  yet be hedged against trouble  How do you hedge yourself  If you made good money in stocks  you should buy a hedge like precious metals  It s insurance  You may lose a few percentage points a year but you sleep better knowing you have it  You have insurance for your house  your car  Why shouldn t you have insurance for your portfolio  Warren Buffett said   Be greedy when others are fearful  and be fearful when others are greedy   We don t know where the Dow Jones or DAX will be in a year  At least take some of your big wins off the table and find a sector that is undervalued  In our case  that s mining 
TGR  You re a fund adviser based in Switzerland  Tell us about yourself 
BP  I am an adviser to Stabilitas GmbH  a group of resource funds in Germany  Also I consult to various Swiss or German portfolio managers on the institutional side with regard to mining investments  Smart money with deep pockets thought it is the right time now for investments into the mining sector  so we launched a new gold and silver equity fund for them in Lichtenstein  We plan to cap it at around  100 million   100M  with a soft closing because we still want to play the junior and midtier stocks 
On top of that  we work with some wealthy private investors who look to invest not only in mining equities  but also in production streams  Therefore  we created a new loan fund to work with smaller companies to help them finance through to production  In most cases we have an 8 12  bond  Then we negotiate a royalty stream or financing fee for 10 15 years  Our money helps small companies with low share prices that can t raise sufficient funds in the equity market  Our latest investment is Inca One Resources Corp   IO TSX V  in Peru 
I also write a subscriber based newsletter called Cashkurs Gold  which mostly covers large cap precious metals producers   400 500M and up  Cashkurs roughly translates to  money direction   We educate mostly German and European retail investors on how the mining sector works and what constitutes a good investment  We also run a real portfolio there 
TGR  In an interview prior to the 2014 Prospectors and Developers Association of Canada  PDAC  conference in Toronto  you said the junior mining market had bottomed  Where is it now 
BP  In 2012  and especially in 2013  we saw one or two good breakout months  We all thought that maybe that could be the turnaround  but it wasn t  The biggest difference this time is that the volumes are picking up  Volumes on the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF  ARCA GDXJ  are increasing and we know that people are bringing fresh capital back to the sector  It s not a lot but there is inflow  It might be traders or generalists seeking value in gold and silver stocks but I think we have seen the worst in the junior sector 

We focus on the small producers and near term producers  Most of the exploration stocks still have liquidity problems  Last year  brokers and banks did a lot of bought deals  So money is still there and some people are taking advantage of undervalued assets 
TGR  Is that where the smart money is headed 
BP  It s still a small amount  The people who look for sector rotation see that the sector is beaten up  When we look at the long term chart for the Philadelphia Gold Silver Sector Index  XAU   there were buying opportunities in the early 2000s  and 2008  of course  We actually had a bottom building phase here at similar levels  That means we really have a chance  Banks and other institutions  are investing into our new fund now in order to find the right investments  They want to get back into real assets  ultimately they know almost everything around us comes from mining  Before you own it  it s mined  So the smart money is starting to very carefully turn toward the mining sector  But if we combined the value of all the stocks in the Philadelphia Gold Silver Sector Index and compared it to the market value of Apple Inc   AAPL NASDAQ   it s a tiny market  It doesn t need much capital to raise it 10 20   Even this year we have seen nice gains already

TGR  One of the common complaints among investors is that junior mining equities have little to no liquidity  How important is that 
BP  That is key  These companies need to have experienced management that earns the trust of investors and large institutions to fund their activities  Look at Detour Gold Corporation  TO DGC   It needed more and more money  but it is going to make it in the end  The latest quarter wasn t great  but that was expected 
If no one will give you more money  especially in the junior sector  someone will take you out or you will go in default and someone else will take your assets  The gold will still be in the ground  Liquidity is almost as important as management  geology and jurisdiction 
TGR  What s your pitch to investors 
BP  In general we tell people that mining is an important part of their lives  It s a great investment if you know how to play it  and if you do so at the right time 
We like gold and silver equities right now  That s why we launched a new gold and silver fund at what we believe is the bottom of the market  Even if the gold market drops a bit more  there are companies out there with all in sustaining costs around or below  1 000 per ounce   1 000 oz   which means they can still make good money and survive at  1 300 oz gold  and are well positioned if gold goes higher 
TGR  What are some gold and silver equities you re following 
BP  In the short run we like some large caps like Goldcorp Inc  NYSE GG   but we see the biggest potential in the junior market  We prefer the smaller producers that have been hammered down due to the market 
We like Rio Alto Mining Limited  TO RIO   and Timmins Gold Corp   AMEX TGD  and Lake Shore Gold Corp   AMEX LSG  are some of our bigger positions 
Timmins had another great quarter  It recently fended off a move by Sentry Investments to take over the board  In my view  Sentry only wanted to sell it  CEO Bruce Bragagnolo did a fantastic job during that struggle  He does not come from a mining background but he runs that company better than most people I see in the mining industry  At around  2 share  Timmins either buys something else  which it needs  or gets taken out  On a pullback  it s a great buy  even if you only want to speculate on a takeout 
TGR  The rumor is that Argonaut Gold Inc   TO AR  is going to make a bid for Timmins Gold  Your thoughts 
BP  I know the rumor  but I am not so sure about Argonaut  if I look at its stock price  Everybody s darling has fallen quite a bit  This may not be the right time for it  But of course there s a chance of a takeover by other companies  There are certainly a few sniffing around  In general  Timmins would be a nice fit at 120 000 130 000 ounces  120 130 Koz  gold annually  It would have to be a company where adding 120 130 Koz significantly increases its production profile and also the region has to make sense  Timmins probably can t lower its all in costs much more but it has some healthy margins at the moment and even more if the gold price rises  Even at  1 300 oz gold  Timmins added another  11M to the cash balance last quarter  I think management is building up the cash to find a good takeover target itself  Timmins appears to be very selective  and that s probably because there are not many options out there that make sense 
TGR  You mentioned Lake Shore Gold  It s up 155  year to date  Is there any room left to climb 
BP  Good question  Maybe it s a little pricey right now  but it has some great assets  Lake Shore turned things around on the cost side at its Timmins West complex and now has free cash flow even after paying back some debt  It s sustainable at that level  It is building bullion and cash  President and CEO Anthony Makuch has done a great job  Of course  we were shareholders much earlier  You have to believe in management  It stumbled  but stood up and changed its course 
Lake Shore must eliminate its debt and it still has to prove in the next quarter and beyond that the expansions will continue to work  I would put it on a watch list and wait for a buying opportunity 
TGR  You mentioned that Inca One was the latest investment with your loan fund  Tell us more about that story 
BP  Years ago Dynacor Gold  OTC DNGDF  started the toll milling business in Peru because it is a country with a lot of high grade ore and small miners who need a processor for that  We own Dynacore and like it a lot  It s a good model  if you have the right people and connections  We were looking for the next play there and came across Inca One  We liked the management CEO Ed Kelly  COO George Moen  They are not mining people  but they found the right partners in Peru  We have been to Peru a couple of times to check everything out  We liked what we saw so we made sure it does not have to worry about any financing in the near term so that it can build the plant 
TGR  Inca One says it wants to be the processor of choice in Peru  Is there much competition 
BP  There are lots of small miners but Peru recently changed its laws because it lost a lot of revenue on gold that was being smuggled out of the country  Since then a lot of small processing plants were shut down by the military  We have followed the Inca One story for more than a year  We wanted to be involved  learn about the process and make sure our investment was sound  The business is about how you treat the miner how quickly you process the ore  pay him back and what the discount is to the spot price  But first Inca One has to build a 300 ton per day  300 tpd  refinery  The company started with a pilot plant to make sure everything was formalized and that it had the right team  Hopefully  it is at 100 tpd by Q1 15  Once it s there  it should have no problem getting access to more capital  The stock already went up to  0 17 share but the price will follow operational performance  We re happy with what we see so far 
TGR  What are some other miners that you have positions in 
BP  We like to find sweet spots in the gold space  About six months ago we took a position in Caledonia Mining Corporation  TO CAL   which owns 49  of the Blanket gold mine in Zimbabwe  I met the management in London and I was convinced that these people were doing a great job  The stock was about  0 70 share with a great dividend  and nice  steady small gold production  Now  it is above  1 share  At some point we probably have to think about a sell but right now there is lots of room to grow  so we re quite happy 
TGR  There is incredible value across the junior gold and silver space  Why would you willingly take on exposure to Zimbabwe and Robert Mugabe s regime 
BP  As we listen to the company and checked out the setting of the mine and how it fully indigenized  we got a very good and positive feeling for the investment  It s one of the opportunities most of the people miss  We always like to learn  right  Also the mine brings a lot of value to the locals and it treats the miners very well  This mine helps the local community  We watch the company closely  but so far it always has delivered and that builds trust in the management 
TGR  What about some other smaller gold plays 
BP  With the recent success Osisko Mining Corp  CEO Sean Roosen had with the takeout by Yamana Gold Inc  NYSE AUY  and Agnico Eagle Mines Limited  NYSE AEM   Quebec s Abitibi region started getting more traction  We like Falco Resources Ltd  TO FPC   with its huge project database  Also we think that a few big names bought into the stock through a transaction from QMX Gold Corporation  TO QMX   which had to sell a block of 7M Falco shares  A privately owned Ontario company took it  No names where disclosed  but I think we have a pretty good idea who is behind it  There s absolutely a chance this company could be taken out sooner than later  It s certainly a great buy at these levels 
Balmoral Resources  OTC BALMF  President and CEO Darin Wagner is on the Falco board  too  Balmoral itself had a huge run  It was presenting in Europe at  0 50 0 60 share  now it is around  1 90  You never really lose money with Darin  I like him very much  He s not overpromising or underdelivering  He has a good nose for the right asset  The latest high grade discoveries are very promising and also the nickel deposit was a nice add on  Let s see how long the company will be around 
TGR  Parting thoughts 
BP  For an investor who looks for a good opportunity  the mining sector is the place to be  You have to have patience so that you don t get shaken out on the pullbacks  but I would be quite surprised if you are not making a lot of money in this sector within the next two or three years

120227,341742,AEM,Brien Lundin Says Don t Miss This Buying Opportunity,opinion,"Brien Lundin  founder of Jefferson Financial  producer of the New Orleans Investment Conference and Gold Newsletter  believes at least a small amount of the massive liquidity produced by loose monetary policy in Western economies will find its way into mining equities following a summer pullback in equity prices but don t wait long  Lundin expects the  buying opportunity  to last for two  maybe three weeks before seasonal Gold demand pushes prices higher  In this exclusive interview with The Gold Report  Lundin discusses a select group of gold and precious metals equities that he expects to perform well as near term news reaches the market 
The Gold Report  On July 30  you sent out a Gold Newsletter alert that forecast a pullback in the midsummer bull market  The next day the Dow dropped 317 points  while the NASDAQ fell about 93 points  Since then the Dow has climbed back above 17 000  the NASDAQ above 4 600  Should investors dismiss that drop or do you believe it was akin to a tremor preceding an earthquake 
Brien Lundin  That particular call made me look like a genius at the time  but right after that drop the stock market took off and reached new highs  The stock sell off in late July was a sign that investors were nervous because we haven t had a meaningful correction during this bull market  However  there are potential pitfalls ahead for the economy we still have to navigate the U S  Federal Reserve s ending of quantitative easing and its first interest rate hikes  There s nothing directly ahead that indicates a major correction will occur  yet these things happen when you re least expecting them 
TGR  You ve been warning investors in Gold Newsletter about the erosion of the foundation of the U S  equity market  Please give our readers a few points to underpin your thesis 
BL  When I put forth that thesis  Q1 14 gross domestic product  GDP  had missed consensus estimates by 3 3   The consensus going into that report was for 1 2  growth but it turned out to be just 0 1  only to be subsequently revised further down to  2 1   The miss for the consensus estimate was remarkable 
I posited that these reports had possibly captured some underlying weakness in the economy  I expected a rebound in Q2 14 because a lot of economic activity was put off due to the unusually cold winter weather  But Q2 14 GDP was over 4   I certainly wasn t expecting anything like that  and neither was anyone else 
So  the idea of a major stock market decline stemming from a weakening U S  economy has become more remote  at least for the time being 
TGR  What are you seeing now 
BL  The massive amount of money created in developed economies since the 2008 credit crisis really has not resulted in significant retail price inflation  If anything  there has been disinflation in major economies  such as in Europe where the European Central Bank is now turning to quantitative easing  The real result of quantitative easing in the U S  and loose money policy throughout the Western economies is a virtual flood of liquidity looking for places to land  It s why we have U S  Treasuries being bid down to their lowest rates ever  while the U S  stock market is hitting record highs  Those two asset classes should be at opposite sides of the seesaw  but there s so much money looking for a home that both are soaring simultaneously 
TGR  The Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners  ARCA GDXJ  has been trading lower since mid July  In fact  the Dow Jones Industrial Average has outperformed that ETF over the last month or so  Is that a buying opportunity 
BL  I think so  The timing is critical  though  While I don t see a near term  fundamental driver to push the market higher in the very near future  there are some factors that I think will push the junior resource stocks and the metals higher this fall  So your real buying opportunity is probably over the next couple of weeks 
All of the liquidity that I referred to earlier has to go somewhere  There s a broad consensus that gold is going lower and a lot of money is shorting gold  At some point over the next month or so at the first sign that gold is not going lower we re going to see some short positions get covered  and that ocean of money is going to start sloshing into gold and silver  At that point we should also see stronger seasonal demand for gold and that also will help power the gold equities market forward 
TGR  One company that you follow in Gold Newsletter  Cayden Resources Inc   TO CYD   recently received a takeover bid from Agnico Eagle Mines Limited  NYSE AEM   The cash and share deal values Cayden at about CA 209 million  a 45  premium to Cayden s share price on the day the bid was made  What stands out in that transaction 
BL  A lot of people were surprised by that transaction because Cayden does not yet have a resource estimate for El Barque o  nor even all the necessary permits to drill the targets it had found through surface sampling  It s a very early stage takeout bid  but as we ve been reporting in Gold Newsletter  anyone looking at El Barque o could see how the geological model was fitting together and the clear potential for a multimillion ounce deposit 
Cayden also has a great land position with the Morelos Sur project  which is next to Goldcorp  NYSE GG  Los Filos mine  That gives Cayden a lot of leverage  and thus the bid by Agnico Eagle could be just the first volley in a bidding war  It s quite possible that Goldcorp will make a counterbid to acquire the important land next to Los Filos 
TGR  Keegan Resources  Cayden Resources  Both juniors received takeover bids  Should investors follow Ivan Bebek and his team to the next company 
BL  Absolutely  Bebek and his team had Keegan  which became Asanko Gold  AMEX AKG   We have followed Asanko in Gold Newsletter from its inception and still recommend it  That team now has another winner with Cayden and already has other things in the works  I m not certain what that venture would be but it would really behoove investors to jump on board once this team gets moving on it 
TGR  What are some other junior gold names you re following in Gold Newsletter 
BL  I like Almaden Minerals Ltd   AMEX AAU   The company recently published a revised preliminary economic assessment  PEA  on its Tuligtic project in Mexico that improves its net present value and rate of return  while lowering capital costs which are still about  400 million   400M   but that s much better than before  Almaden is now focusing on drilling some targets outside the resource zone  It s an intriguing exploration area around the current resource  The project has a long way to go up the value curve as it works more on the economics and toward feasibility 
TGR  Almaden just raised more money to drill other targets on Tuligtic but it spent a lot of money trying to find the high grade core of the Ixtaca deposit  which really hasn t been found yet  Now it s going to focus on other targets  How should investors read that 
BL  The other targets where Almaden is drilling are areas where it has already done some exploration drilling  Almaden is attempting to expand its resource  but Ixtaca is already a multimillion ounce deposit that justifies development  What the company doesn t have right now is a market where these kinds of achievements are rewarded  When the market turns around  the major producers will cherry pick the best of these deposits at reasonable prices  There aren t many at the top of the list but I think Almaden is going to be there  Companies that control these projects will be taken out at significant premiums to their current levels  Cayden may just be the first shoe to drop as these larger companies become more aggressive before the market takes off again 
TGR  What are some others 
BL  I also like Columbus Gold Corporation  TO CGT   It is about to get a third drill turning on its Montagne d Or deposit  part of the Paul Isnard project in French Guiana  Joint venture partner Nordgold N V   NORD LSE  is funding all of the exploration up to  30M or a bankable feasibility study to earn 50 1  of the project  The drill results have been great  One recent hole hit 33 5 meters of 3 15 g t Au  Essentially  the company is expanding the resource even as they re infill drilling 
Columbus also raised some money that will help it advance a great suite of exploration projects in Nevada  It s a company that is going to keep turning out news for the foreseeable future and is a great buy for a long term investor looking for real value 
TGR  In May  Columbus announced that its PEA on the Paul Isnard project in French Guiana overstated the grade and ounces contained in the deposit  Nonetheless  a few days later  Nordgold made its scheduled  4 2M payment to Columbus to continue its earn in  The share price is now about  0 40  What s next 
BL  It s obvious that Nordgold didn t see that hiccup with the resource estimate as an issue  Some of the grades were  smeared  across areas where there wasn t enough drilling density to support those grades  As the companies continue infill drilling at much tighter drill spacing  they are bringing Inferred ounces into the Indicated category  The deposit is growing because a lot of those ounces were never included in any previous resource estimate  The resource will probably end up significantly larger than it was before that little hiccup  It has a clear path toward production at this point  and it s all paid for 
One other company I like in the gold space is Precipitate Gold Corp  TO PRG   The company is drilling its project in the Dominican Republic that s adjacent to GoldQuest Mining Corp  s  GQC TSX V  Romero discovery  Precipitate has found some great surface gold anomalies from trenching and is drilling below these trenches  We expect some results fairly soon  That s an exploration play that has a lot of potential in the very near term 
TGR  In your newsletter you call Precipitate a  buy  yet the 12 month price charts for Precipitate and GoldQuest look quite similar  Why a  buy  for one and not the other 
BL  The charts may look similar  but the market values certainly aren t  Precipitate is a buy right now precisely because GoldQuest had made a discovery  and Precipitate has yet to  Thus  the upside potential is very large for Precipitate at this point 
TGR  It s a good sign that you re once again adding companies to Gold Newsletter and placing some of them on your buy list  Please tell us about some recent additions 
BL  One is Lion One Metals Limited  TO LIO   We had previously recommended the company  but it went relatively dormant as the market went into its multi year malaise  Lion One is headed by noted mining financier Wally Berukoff and it was rejuvenated when it became apparent that Berukoff was going to move the company s Tuvatu gold project forward  Berukoff is a proven entrepreneur in the resource industry and his decision to once again advance the company caused me to put it back on our recommended list  Lion One has a clear path to production  The capital cost to build a mine is going to be  40M or less and I don t think raising that amount will pose a problem for that group  even in this market  That s a company looking to take advantage of the next up cycle 
TGR  Is  40M all Lion One needs to build a mine in Fiji 
BL  That s all it needs in capital  It will obviously need some permits but a good bit of that work was done while the company had supposedly gone quiet  Fiji is generally pro mining and many locals are looking for work  so I don t really see any big roadblocks as Lion One advances Tuvatu toward production 
TGR  What are some others that you ve added 
BL  An interesting company I recommended recently is   Illegal mining In Peru has created an environmental catastrophe  so the government is clamping down on illegal miners and forcing them to process their ore at approved facilities  Inca One is taking advantage of the new laws by building milling facilities  buying ore from the miners and making a markup on that ore  The business model is eminently scalable 
When the company reaches a production rate of about 100 tonnes per day  which it should shortly  it expects to deliver free cash flow of about  9M per year  This concept can be applied throughout Peru  It s a huge market so  although there are competitors  there s more than enough artisanal gold production in Peru to accommodate them all  Inca One has great management  a great business model and it should remain ahead of the pack  It s not the type of company that will be leveraged to the price of gold because its margins will remain fairly constant 
TGR  How does it actually work 
BL  The miner delivers the ore  the ore gets tested and the miner is paid once the test result is in  The miner can take it or leave it at that point but if he takes it  he gets a cash payment and doesn t feel that he s been misled or cheated if the recovery rate is lower than expected  I think that transparency will help Inca One get more business from local miners than other companies in the same business 
TGR  We have talked a lot about gold companies  What are some other junior resource companies that you re following 
BL  I like Wellgreen Platinum  OTC WGPLF   The Wellgreen deposit in the Yukon is absolutely enormous  The challenge is how to develop it at a reasonable capital expense  The plan is to attack the higher grade zones first to achieve a quicker payback on capital as development ramps up  The deposit is so large that it is essentially a strategic deposit that some larger company will own at some point  A smaller company like Wellgreen can only keep advancing it toward production  The next PEA will go a long way toward convincing the market that this is a viable  highly economic deposit 
TGR  Perhaps a few more companies 
BL  Fission Uranium  OTC FCUUF  continues to plough ahead with drilling on one of the world s richest uranium deposits  The company has been boring the market with one stellar drill result after another so the price has actually slid some over the summer  This is a great buying opportunity 
TGR  New drill results have expanded the high grade R780E zone on its Patterson Lake South property in Saskatchewan  In fact  all of the drill holes so far have hit uranium mineralization  Is this still a standalone company if spot uranium was at  50 lb 
BL  Absolutely not  Fission is really a bet on higher uranium prices  The uranium story is inevitable  just not necessarily imminent  We keep waiting for these supply demand factors to impact the uranium price and they will eventually  Once that happens Fission is going to be one of the first companies taken out  As it stands now  it s just a great value play  We talk about all of these separate mineralized zones  but all these zones are going to connect in one very large deposit  It s worth every bit and more of what the company is selling for right now  People should just buy it  hold it and wait for a takeout scenario 
TGR  Do you want to discuss another uranium explorer 
BL  There s an interesting new uranium exploration play Roughrider Exploration Ltd   REL TSX V  that I think could make some waves soon  As you ll remember  Hathor was a huge success with its Roughrider uranium discovery in the Athabasca Basin  The name isn t a coincidence  Roughrider Exploration is being advanced with the help of Dale Wallster  the geologist who discovered the original Roughrider property and vended it into Hathor  Now this new venture is exploring its extensive land position on trend from the original Hathor discovery  It s a new recommendation of mine  and I m excited about the upside if the company can find even a sniff of a new discovery 
TGR  One last company 
BL  I ll give you two that I m looking closely at  but have yet to recommend in Gold Newsletter  
One  Aftermath Silver  TO AAG   has a very interesting  high grade Silver deposit that could be brought into production very quickly  The company still has to raise the necessary funds  which is tough to do in the current market  But once silver begins to rebound  that won t be hard at all  and this will be an extremely leveraged play on silver
Another is Source Exploration  TO SOP   The company has been getting very impressive grades from its Las Minas gold project in Mexico  and the mineralization is looking like it s holding together very well  As I say  I haven t recommended the company yet  but I m watching it closely  The drill results have been quite remarkable 
TGR  Every year your company  Jefferson Financial  puts on the New Orleans Investment Conference  This year the show celebrates its 40th anniversary from October 22 25  The headline event is a panel discussion with former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan  legendary investor Porter Stansberry and Marc Faber  publisher of the Gloom  Boom   Doom newsletter  What can investors learn from this 
BL  On the Greenspan panel we re going to pointedly ask him about the Fed and the Treasury s role in manipulating the gold price and how that occurs  if it occurs  He no longer has any reason to obscure the truth  There will also be a moderated Q A with Greenspan where he ll take questions from the audience  Those two panels with Greenspan are going to make headlines  if not history  He has a fascinating story  Greenspan was one of the most ardent and eloquent goldbugs in the 1960s  He was a close follower of Ayn Rand and some of his writings on gold still stand today as among the best ever produced on the role of gold in protecting citizens from currency depreciation 
The rest of our lineup includes Dr  Charles Krauthammer  Peter Schiff  Rick Rule and Doug Casey  People come back year after year because they get to meet these experts and talk with them  They get stock recommendations and strategies that they ll never get anywhere else  It s always a dynamic event

120228,341743,AEM,Speculating  The Next Junior Mining Takeout ,opinion,"Three junior mining pros have tipped me off about the same company in the past week 
While almost every good mining promoter believes his deal is the next to go  these three people are better than my average sources  so I decided the rumour was worthy of basic investigation 
The richest places in the world for gold are the sediment hosted gold trends of northern Nevada  According to Thomson Reuters  Nevada is responsible for 74  of the United States  annual gold production or roughly 172 3 tonnes  Nevada is the largest production center for industry leaders like Barrick Gold Corporation  NYSE ABX  and Newmont Mining Corporation  NYSE NEM   and home to ongoing large discoveries  The Carlin trend is also where Gold Standard Ventures  AMEX GSV  has its flagship Railroad Pinion project 

Earlier this year  Gold Standard Ventures consolidated ownership of the Pinion  pronounced pinYON  project to become its first 100  owner  This was a hefty undertaking by the company as some 80 individual owners had to be negotiated with over the past three years  CEO Jonathan Awde says 
GSV just released their maiden NI 43 101 resource estimate at Pinion  with over 1 million ounces of close to surface  oxide gold  read  the good stuff   Nevada has been well explored and undeveloped oxide deposits are now scarce  These projects are advantageous because they are amenable to heap leaching and don t require an expensive processing plant and tailings pond to build 
The market is currently valuing Gold Standard at roughly  89 million  and its shares are 50  institutionally owned  according to a recent corporate  
The thesis for GSV  It has the last remaining turnkey project that could give a mining company entrance into the Carlin Trend at relatively low cost  This is potentially desirable to the likes of Agnico Eagle Mines Limited  NYSE AEM   which just began the process of acquiring another company  Cayden Resources  last week  It s reasonable to speculate that any gold miner would want to have a toe hold in Nevada  Newmont  which operates the heap leach oxide Emigrant Mine next door  may even want to stymie competition in the area with their own takeout of GSV  Emigrant is apparently one of Newmont s most profitable mines and was built for a small capex 
Travis and I met Gold Standard CEO Jonathan Awde briefly in Vancouver last week to hear the story 
Awde said he is the money raiser and communicator for a talented technical team of geologists in Nevada 
Resource expansion drilling at Pinion is under way  and the company will test other targets on the property over the next few months  including Bald Mountain 
The company also has the North Bullion discovery  which produced some spectacular drill results in 2012  but in more challenging host rock  so was deemed as a lower priority in the current low gold price environment 
 In this kind of market  drilling  250 000  300 000 holes into a refractory deposit  versus drilling  25 000  30 000 RC holes into a near surface  oxide resource  We felt it was a lot better use of our capital in a market like this   Awde said in Colorado of the company s focus on Pinion 
Whenever you hear takeover hype in the junior mining business  it s wise to consider the source  In one week I was tipped off about GSV by three relatively credible junior mining pros  one geologist promoter  one newsletter writer  and one broker  These are men I like and trust  but it s important to remember to temper your expectations in the mining business 
Of note  Gold Standard s flat stock chart is not suggestive at all of a takeover right now  while Cayden s share price tripled in the past year  In fairness to GSV  Cayden had a lot of news flow from a new discovery helping them 

Disclaimer  I haven t bought any GSV stock yet  Thom Calandra owns it   129 for Thom s The Calandra Report newsletter here     ",2014-09-18,Tommy Humphreys,https://www.investing.com/analysis/speculating:-the-next-junior-mining-takeout-226242,226242
120253,341768,AEM,Heiko Ihle  Something s Got To Give In The Precious Metals Market,opinion,These are scary times for precious metal investors  Resource equities are in the tank and  adding insult to injury  the gold price took a precipitous fall just days before summer  notoriously one of the slowest seasons for precious metals  Heiko Ihle  an analyst with Euro Pacific Capital in Connecticut  tells The Gold Report that something has to give  And soon  Ihle sets out a likely scenario and highlights some miners that are able to produce profitably at current metals prices  The Gold Report  Heiko  in late June gold had its biggest weekly drop in two years  What s your take on that  Heiko Ihle  It was set off by far reaching talk of a slowdown in quantitative easing  However  an awful lot of U S  dollars are still floating around and the price of gold is pegged to the U S  dollar  In the long run  companies can t sell gold for less than it costs to take it out of the ground  At some point something has to give  TGR  So  what s going to give  HI  Either the cost of mining or the price of gold  Quite frankly  the cost of mining has been reasonably sticky thus far  TGR  Can miners profitably mine gold at  1 200 ounce   1 200 oz  and silver sub  20 oz  HI  This is the first time in quite a while they ve dipped this low  but there are miners that are able to produce profitably at these prices  One is Fortuna Silver Mines Inc   FSM NYSE  FVI TSX  FVI BVL  F4S FSE   The company s mine site cash costs were about  5 oz last year  and we forecast less than  6 oz this year  Even at  19 oz silver  Fortuna will be quite profitable  TGR  Fortuna is planning in the third quarter to begin a 1 500 ton per day  1 500 tpd  mill expansion at its San Jose mine in Mexico  HI  At current prices  Fortuna is more concerned about cutting costs than trying to increase production  That said  San Jose is a very profitable mine  It is a great location  fully permitted and operational  The site has a large amount of ore that can be mined over the next decade or two  I would continue to encourage the company to expand the mine  TGR  What s your price target on Fortuna  HI  It s  4  Given where the stock is trading  it s actually pretty aggressive  TGR  What are some of the companies under coverage doing to curb costs in this environment  HI  There have been some cutbacks in every department  There have been layoffs  I ve talked to a number of CEOs who are going to be doing more layoffs  Marketing budgets have been cut  A number of road shows have been flat out canceled  There are cutbacks on exploration and general improvement budgets  Would Fortuna be expanding its mill if it started the whole process today  Probably not  TGR  How does this trough compare to previous ones  HI  There is general disinterest in nonproducing assets  Clients ask me almost every day  Why would I deal with a permitting process if I can get a producing asset for cheap  There s also less interest in small cap names because investors can buy Barrick Gold Corp   ABX TSX  ABX NYSE  and Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd   AEM TSX  AEM NYSE  at a discount  Overall  it s been quite hard to get investors excited about some of the names that we follow just because of a lack of interest in the space all together  TGR  Many of the companies you cover have operations in Latin America  particularly Mexico  Mexico was the world s largest silver producing country in 2012  with about 162 million ounces  162 Moz   up 6  from 2011  Silver production was up 4  globally in 2012 to 787 Moz versus 757 Moz in 2011  Tell us about your favorite precious metal stories  HI  Endeavour Silver Corp   EDR TSX  EXK NYSE  EJD FSE   run by Brad Cooke  has a reasonably low cost of production of about  8 oz this year  We forecast about  7 oz next year as the El Cubo plant should be fully on line  Endeavour Silver has a great business model  It buys underappreciated mines  puts some money into renovations and puts them into production at much lower cash costs with more efficient operations  The company tends to get a lot closer to reserve grade than the prior owners  Today  for the first time since I ve been looking at this company  Endeavour traded under  3 share  It s a very good value play  TGR  El Cubo was purchased from AuRico Gold Inc   AUQ TSX  AUQ NYSE  and turned around  Are there other underperforming assets that Endeavour could work its magic on  HI  Certainly in this environment  where everybody wants to sell and nobody wants to buy  However  I don t think Brad is going to make any acquisition that s going to be transformational for the company  given the overall capital market conditions  These are scary times for all these guys  The cost structure that they operate under has changed substantially in those 34 months  TGR  Endeavour s Guanacev  mine in Mexico has cash costs around  16 70 oz silver  With silver currently trading at around  19 oz  does that put that mine at risk of a short term shut down  HI  Not yet  The overall headquarter costs remain intact  The company will likely start mining the high grade veins and leave everything else behind  It lowers production  which leads to overall lower cash costs  TGR  What about some other Latin American plays that you have under coverage  HI  I like Rio Alto Mining Ltd   RIO TSX V  RIO BVL   The company has the La Arena project in Peru  It s a great company with good management  CEO Alex Black is a great manager  Rio Alto is producing about 200 000 oz gold at slightly more than  700 oz this year  It is expanding its sulfide operation  The grades are decent  The company has been lucky because it kept hitting higher grade zones than it anticipated  which helped it beat production figures every quarter last year  Those times have  unfortunately  ended  The stock has dropped substantially over the past two months  Its shares are currently below  2  There s speculation in the marketplace that one of its largest holders is selling  which is creating an overhang on the name  but I think it s a valuable asset  Rio Alto has proven that it can perform  TGR  What is the next catalyst for Rio Alto  HI  When the sulfide goes on line  but that s not until around 2016  TGR  One more precious metals story in Latin America  HI  Fortuna Silver  CEO Jorge Ganoza is a third generation miner  The family knows exactly what it is doing  Peru remains a politically safe environment  Labor costs are pretty decent  The company has a fairly low cash cost  in fact the lowest cash costs of companies I follow  That s in part because of the decent gold byproducts  but it s also because its San Jose mine in Mexico is a very efficient operation with fairly low tonnage costs  The mine site in Peru is fairly remote  however  I ve been there  It s an eight hour drive from the beautiful little town of Arequipa  It s high altitude mining  but the grades are good  TGR  Gold and silver prices are down about 3  today  but you still have a number of companies with buy recommendations  You still see upside  What are some turnaround stories  HI  The whole market could be a turnaround story  In markets like this everybody remembers that gold is down  160 oz over the past 30 days  Well  guess what  Gold could be up  160 oz in the next 30 days  There is demand  but it is on the sidelines because everybody is scared  Ultimately  I genuinely believe that gold is money  I believe that companies need to be able to make a profit in addition to their cost of mining because otherwise the overall supply is going to dwindle down  I believe once that happens  either production costs will decrease or the gold price will increase  It will happen  Something has to give  We can t have every single company in the space losing money for eternity  There is another company that I like  but it s not in production yet  Romarco Minerals Inc   R TSX  doesn t have a full permit  but I feel strongly that it will be able to get permitted  The mine is going to have about 91 million tons of ore at 1 6 grams per ton for a total of 4 8 Moz gold  You are essentially buying this thing for  50 oz at the current trading price of  0 39 share  I believe Romarco will get up and running  because its management knows a lot of large institutional shareholders who would be willing and able to front them some more cash  I believe the Haile project in South Carolina will be a mine in a couple of years  TGR  How does that  50 oz compare to its peers  HI  They range from  40 oz to almost  120 oz  It is definitely in the lower range  and it should be because it doesn t have a permit  It is not as derisked as a producing mine  TGR  How likely are those permits to come within the next year  HI  If you asked me that question a year ago  I would have said about 75   Today  I am going to give you the same answer  There is a very decent chance that the permits are going to come reasonably soon  The permitting process  especially in South Carolina where there are no real mines  is not easy  The company has to have constant discussions with the U S  Army Corps of Engineers  Romarco claims to be making progress  I am inclined to believe that  but these things always take a lot longer than you would like  TGR  Meanwhile  Romarco has increased its resource and it has brought in more experienced personnel  What institutional support does it have  HI  Van Eck Global  BlackRock  Baker Steel Capital Managers  Oppenheimer   Co   Tocqueville Asset Management and so on  the usual suspects  Seventy percent of shares are institutionally owned  Those firms haven t owned this and watched the stock sink in order to throw in the towel when it actually comes time to build a mine  TGR  Can this management team get the permitting done  HI  Yes  it should be able to do it  TGR  How much lower can gold go  HI  That question is a trap  Long term  gold cannot sell below the cost of production  One of the two things has to give  Either the cost of production has to go down  which is doubtful  or the price of the gold has to go up  which is the camp that I fall into  TGR  We are into the summer months  which are some of the quietest months for precious metals equities in general  How should investors approach the summer months  HI  For one thing  don t panic  Next  look at the companies you own or want to buy and see what they have done lately  Have they delivered on what they said they would  I am not talking about the price of gold  I am talking about production  grades  recovery and cash costs  If they have delivered  the overall thesis remains intact and hold on as hard as that might be to do  TGR  Thank you very much   joined Euro Pacific Capital in November 2011

120254,341769,AEM,Are We On The Cusp Of A Bull Market For The Ages In Gold ,opinion,"Jay Taylor understands why investors in gold and gold equities are consumed with caution  But the publisher and editor of J  Taylor s Gold  Energy   Tech Stocks and host of the radio show  Turning Hard Times into Good Times  urges them not to lose sight of the big picture  The big  bull market picture  Gold juniors with cash and good projects are trading at tiny fractions of their worth  But not for long  In this interview with The Gold Report  Taylor argues that we are on the cusp of a bull market for the ages and suggests eight junior candidates for mind blowing multiples 
The Gold Report  Janet Yellen s about face on quantitative easing  QE  makes two panicked pullbacks so far by the Federal Reserve from the end of QE  Is it fair to say we now have QE forever 
Jay Taylor  I don t know about forever because nothing lasts forever  Your premise is largely correct  however  because the discontinuation of quantitative easing would be so painful it s a pretty good assumption that it will continue for a long time to come 
It will probably end only when the system breaks down  which is inevitable because it is becoming increasingly insolvent 
TGR  We ve been hearing for three years about the end of QE and the zero interest rate policy  ZIRP   It has been argued that this is unlikely for several reasons  QE is the only thing responsible for whatever recovery we ve had since 2008  and if ZIRP ended  the U S  government couldn t pay the interest on its debt  and trillions of dollars in derivatives would go south 
JT  That s exactly right  Not to mention that the private sector too is dependent on the narcotic of easy money  As I say  QE and ZIRP won t end until the system breaks down and forces the creation of a different monetary regime 
What we call  the economy  is really more of a casino  The money that is created isn t getting into the real economy  The Wall Street guys with the Ph Ds in mathematics have built pick pocketing machines that misallocate capital into their wallets  into endlessly bigger government and further military action on the part of the United States  It s going to end very badly  All we can do is try to prepare as best we can to protect ourselves and our families 
TGR  How does the system break down 
JT  We saw the first hint of that with the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy in 2008  Generally  the banking system goes first  They can pretend that they ve fixed it  but I see that Citicorp just failed its stress test  After the banking system fails  the commercial system fails because you can t stock the shelves in stores  Then you can t pay the fire and police departments  Then you have chaos 
TGR  You ve agreed with Jim Rickards that attempts by the U S  to  get tough  with Russia will fail  Can you explain why 
JT  Russia has its own interests to protect  but so does Europe  I m not so sure that the Europeans will necessarily side with the United States  There could be a real crack in the NATO alliance  The Germans need natural gas  and the Russians have it  I see that the French energy company Total S A   TOT NYSE  is helping Russia increase its gas and oil production through fracking  Many German companies are very much involved in Russia  as well 
TGR  You ve talked about the petrodollar being replaced by  petrogold  
JT  An enormous amount of gold is flowing into China  And China has established a second gold exchange that will allow non Chinese to buy and sell it  Not paper gold  which is fantasy gold  but real  physical gold  The gold price is being manipulated by the futures markets  by the very people we were just talking about  the bankers  the bullion guys  the people that really can t afford to lose the dollar confidence game 
The Chinese want no part of this  They have enough dollars and don t want more  Moreover  they don t want to finance America s military industrial offensive  which is paid for by dollar manipulation 
TGR  How would petrogold work in practice 
JT  Russia would provide China with much of its energy needs and would be paid in renminbi  The Russians would then take their renminbi to the Chinese exchange and get gold for it  if they so desire  I think the infrastructure is being set up  both with petroleum exchanges and gold exchanges  in Russia and China and other countries in Asia 
We would have a much more balanced world right now if Nixon hadn t taken us off the gold standard  That allowed the elite and the military industrial complex to pull the whole of the world into the American orbit and saddle them with American debt and American power 
Now there s blowback against American power  the currency wars and the U S  dollar as reserve currency  Russia and China and other countries are saying   enough already  
TGR  Gold and gold equities had an excellent winter  but spring has not at all been kind to them  Why 
JT  I think what we ve seen recently is just part of the natural ebb and flow  This is probably the last good buying opportunity for many junior mining stocks  I am more excited now than I have been at any time since 1981 when I first started writing my newsletter  I think we re going to see a bull market that s going to shock even the most ardent goldbugs 
TGR  Which gold junior most excites you 
JT   Novo Resources Corp   NSRPF PK  and its Pilbara project in northern Western Australia  It is listed on the CNSX  a secondary exchange that is not very well established 
TGR  Quinton Hennigh is Novo s CEO  What does that mean to you 
JT  His involvement gives me great confidence  as does the fact that Newmont Mining Corp   NMC TSX  NEM NYSE  owns 32  of the stock  with 18  owned by management  There are only about 55 million  55M  shares outstanding  although there will be another 23 6M issued in exchange for the acquisition of an additional 70  or 18 000 kilometers of prospective land in the area  Those additional shares will be issued to Mark Gareth Creasy  a major mine prospector in Australia 
TGR  The term  world class  has become a clich  in our industry  Could Pilbara be the real thing 
JT  The Witwatersrand deposit in South Africa has produced 1 6 billion ounces of gold since the late 1800s  more than any other district in the world  Quinton Hennigh wondered if there could be another such district elsewhere  When he was a Ph D  student at the Colorado School of Mines he began to doubt the prevailing geological theory of how the Witwatersrand was formed 
TGR  What did he eventually conclude 
JT  He hypothesized that Witwatersrand was a precipitation event  There was virtually no oxygen on earth 2 7 to 3 billion years ago when simple plant life and photosynthesis began to appear on earth  With photosynthesis came the production of oxygen  which is required for the precipitation of gold and other minerals out of the sea water  As oxygen appeared  very large amounts of gold present at that time in the oceans was attracted to carbon layers on the sea floor that also became more abundant with a growing abundance of plant life  Thus  Quinton believes the abundance of gold at Witwatersrand is explained by the large amount of gold at that time being precipitated out of sea water on to the shallow seabed 


Note  The thin layers or reefs of conglomerate rock in the illustration above left are where the extremely high grade gold is contained  Mining is now taking place at very deep levels in the Witwatersrand in South Africa but in the late 1800s it was initially at or near surface  Above top  the prospective ground picked up by Novo is illustrated by the pink areas  which represent Archean Fortescue formation rocks  It is interesting to note that this target is massively larger than the gigantic Witwatersrand  as you can see from the lower illustration  
Hennigh then searched for basins old enough and in the right kind of geological environment to host another Witwatersrand  And he thinks he found one in northern Western Australia in the Pilbara Region 
TGR  What has Novo done to prove Hennigh s hypothesis 
JT  Like most companies  Novo preserved its cash in 2012  But the company did some auger drilling and came up with an NI 43 101 resource on a very small portion of the project  421 000 ounces  421 Koz  at or near surface with 1 47 grams per ton  1 47 g t  
It s my understanding the Newmont has sent up to a dozen geologists to Pilbara to map the outcrops  This will in effect outline the shorelines of this ancient seabed  Quinton told me that Newmont will be sharing this information with Novo and I expect Novo will put that out into the public domain very soon  I believe this process will be helpful in setting up drill targets  all of which will be shallow  near surface  I expect there will be very extensive drilling and that we should receive a significant number of drill results over the next number of months this year 
TGR  How close is Hennigh to success 
JT  I think he may be very close based on my discussion with Quinton at the Prospectors and Developers Association of Canada  PDAC  conference in Toronto in March  He is obviously thrilled at having found gold hosted in carbon chunks in the drilling that has been carried out so far  He says that Novo has not yet found what are known as the  carbon leaders  or  reefs  that are typical at Witwatersrand and which measure not in ounces per ton but in percentages  He believes a carbon leader has not yet been found because the exploration is still up higher in the system  near the shoreline 
TGR  How speculative is Novo as an investment 
JT  It is very speculative and it will remain so until the market understands whether or not Hennigh is right about his theory and whether or not the deposit is economically viable  The stock is thinly traded and is held by Newmont  32   and management  18    and Creasy will soon own 17   The technically oriented people who are on to this story are not willing to sell  so a small amount of demand has driven the stock dramatically higher since I talked about it at the PDAC  If the market starts to get the sense that Henning has discovered another Witwatersrand  the sky is the limit for this stock  Of course that is a big  if   so if the market is disappointed for one reason or another  these shares could fall dramatically  It s selling now at about  1 80 share but it was as low as  0 80 in January 

As to the probability of success  all I can say is that Quinton Hennigh s hypothesis looks pretty good so far  With just a small portion of this shallow target drilled last year  see illustration above  the company has an NI 43 101 Resource of 421 Koz gold with an average grade of 1 47 g t  But equally important  I think  is the presence of gold hosted carbon 
TGR  Closer to home  you ve written extensively about gold juniors in Qu bec  What are your favorites there 
JT  I ve just written about a new one  Alexandria Minerals Corp   AZX V   The company has the Cadillac Break properties in the Abitibi Greenstone Belt  1 4 million ounces  1 4 Moz  gold Measured  Indicated and Inferred  The company just sold 14 claims to Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd   NYSE AEM  for  5M  with Alexandria keeping a 2  net smelter royalty  Agnico owns 9  of the company  Teck Resources Ltd   NYSE TCK  owns 3 5   and IAMGold Corporation  IAG  owns 3 5  
Alexandria s exploration potential looks absolutely phenomenal  The company has good management and  5M in cash  At  0 05 share  this stock makes a lot of sense  I see the stock has picked up a lot of volume over the past couple of days  so it seems someone is waking up to the story 
TGR  What s your second Quebec favorite 
JT   Metanor Resources Inc   MTO V  is finally coming into its own  Its Bachelor Lake mine has begun commercial production at 4 5 Koz per month  In addition  Metanor has the Barry project  which gives it real blue sky upside  That s an open pit  very large  low grade  bulk tonnage target in which Metanor has already established a fairly decent resource 
Unfortunately  Metanor has seen an awful lot of dilution  267M shares at  0 18 
TGR  How many ounces could we see at Bachelor Lake 
JT  It s underground  so those ounces are harder to prove up  but their exploration has been quite promising  These systems run very deep  I think we could be looking at something in the order 1 5 Moz ultimately 
TGR  Is there anything else you like in Quebec 
JT  I ve recommended Eastmain Resources Inc   ER TO  and Globex Mining Enterprises Inc   GMX TO   I think they both have great prospects  Globex is a project generator  It is prudently managed and does what project generators are supposed to do use other people s money 
TGR  Which juniors are your favorites in Nevada 
JT  I like two  The first is Canamex Resources Corp   CSQ V   I like its ownership structure  Gold Resources Corp   AMEX GORO  owns 18   Hecla Mining Co   HL  owns 11 7  and management owns 6 2   Its Nevada Bruner project has a historic non NI 43 101 resource of 385 Koz  Canamex has had some exciting recent intersections  4 08 g t over 110 meters  110m   3 1 g t over 91m and 5 23 g t over 58m 
The company s target here is a shallow oxide  heap leachable deposit  which looks very good for building the ounces that would make this project economic  And Canamex believes it may have found the feeder zones in these high grade intercepts  It is planning an NI 43 101 resource and a preliminary economic assessment  PEA  by the end of 2014  At  0 105 a share  add a little more excitement in the gold industry  and I can see this doing extremely well this year 
TGR  And what s the second 
JT   Paramount Gold and Silver Corp   AMEX PZG  This is really well funded with a major Toronto financier standing behind it  The company has the Sleeper project in Nevada and San Miguel in Mexico  Between them  that s around 6 9 Moz gold and 160 Moz silver 
The company did a PEA on San Miguel   707M net present value based on  1 500 ounce   1 500 oz  gold  More recently  Paramount did a PEA on Sleeper   695M based on  1 300 oz gold  There s a lot of exploration potential at both  At last look  shares were  1 26  When gold moves higher  Paramount could be a takeover target because it has the ounces to attract a major mining company 
TGR  Let s talk about companies you like in Central America 
JT   Cayden Resources Inc   CYD V  in Mexico 
TGR  Another takeover target 
JT  I think so  There are only 41 8M shares outstanding and it has very savvy management  CEO Ivan Bebek co founded Asanko Gold Inc   AMEX AKG   and he has brought in strong technical people  Cayden is very well funded  On April 1  it closed a  9M financing at  1 70  The stock is trading at  1 93 now 
The company has two properties  El Barque o is a shallow target that can be developed fairly quickly  Cayden has something like nine targets there  and on the first target Cayden drilled  the Azteca  it hit commercial grade gold on 24 of 25 holes 
Cayden s other property is Morelos Sur  That s in the Guerrero Belt  which is an up and comer  Cayden thinks this might have greater long term upside than El Barque o  Some of its claims there are right smack dab in the middle of Goldcorp Inc  s  G TSX  GG NYSE  Las Calles property  and Goldcorp is going to have to have them  In fact  Goldcorp s pit runs onto its territory  I think Cayden wants Goldcorp to know that it is not desperate and won t be forced to take whatever Goldcorp offers it 
TGR  Heading down to South America  what strikes your fancy 
JT   Columbus Gold Corp   CGT V and its Paul Isnard project in French Guiana 
TGR  This is perhaps the most acclaimed of all junior gold projects  and yet it sits at  0 55 a share with a  71 8M market cap 
JT  This goes back to what we were talking about earlier  Investors haven t really come out of their shells yet  As you mentioned  we ve had another dip in the gold price  and people are saying   Oh no  here we go again   Well  I don t think so 
That said  Columbus Gold is a tremendous bargain  Paul Isnard has 5 37 Moz  but the most important part of this story is the outstanding agreement the company made with Nordgold N V   NORD LSE   That s a Russian company that produced somewhere around 800 Koz last year  Nordgold is very aggressive and growing very rapidly 
According to the agreement  Columbus has a 49 9  interest in Paul Isnard carried to feasibility  Then  if it decides against putting up its 49 9   it gets a 25  carried interest to production  It cannot be knocked below 25   French Guiana is probably not the easiest place for English speakers to work  but it s got French law  so its legal system is reasonably good  And Nordgold has shown it can work anywhere and do well 
Columbus also is a project generator  It has two properties in Arizona and 18 in Nevada  Some are earlier stage  but it has gotten some good drill results in Nevada  I think Columbus is looking to farm some of those out  This is a company that won t need to spend a lot of cash to stay in the game 
TGR  And your final gold junior pick is 
JT   Brazil Resources Inc   BRI V   I ve known its founder and chairman  Amir Adnani  for a long time  And  of course  many people know his American energy company  Uranium Energy Corp   AMEX UEC  
Adnani went out and took advantage of the weak gold market to pick up Brazilian gold properties  2 59 Moz gold in three properties that are relatively close together  Added to the property he had before  that makes something like 3 9 Moz all told  Amir said to me that he hopes we don t see a resumption in the gold price right away  He d like to see more weakness so he can get his hands on more low priced properties  The companies that have the cash and the resources to finance themselves are today in a great position to enrich their shareholders 
This company has a really good ownership structure  Management and insiders own 25   and 30  is held by institutional investors  This includes a very wealthy Brazilian financier who has the deep pockets  Adnani is a very smart manager  He s done very well in the past  and I think he s on to something here  I like this one a lot 
TGR  Final thoughts 
JT  Investors are still shell shocked  And the mainstream is convinced that gold isn t going anywhere because they ve been sold on the idea that the Ph D  standard is much better than the gold standard  And if you believe that  why would you buy gold stocks  I d say that 99  of American investors aren t in the least bit interested  Canadians are a little different because mining is a big Canadian industry 
But I think we re on the verge of a secular bull market for the ages  something greater than I ve seen in my lifetime

120255,341770,AEM,Joe Reagor  Prepare For The Attack Of The Short Sellers,opinion,"Despite the ongoing attack of the short sellers  the fundamentals of gold and silver production are increasingly robust  ROTH Capital s Joe Reagor tells The Gold Report why he believes the price of gold is steaming toward  1 500 oz  with silver prices following in the wake  Reagor highlights several junior precious metals miners in a market that is out to prove the bears on Wall Street wrong 
The Gold Report  Let s talk about the growth and stability of Gold and Silver sales in Q2 14  What catalysts are on the horizon 
Joe Reagor  The biggest national markets for gold right now are India and China  U S  investors are bearish on gold and silver  Europeans are more toward neutral  But there are more than 2 billion people living in China and India  They are the largest gold buying market  outweighing the larger financial markets of the U S  and Europe 
Conversely  silver has underperformed gold during the last nine months  The average grade of a solid silver project is 100 grams per ton  100 g t   while the average grade of a good gold project is less than 1 g t for open pits  Advancements in recovery technologies mean that the silver gold recovery ratio is moving toward 100 1  That is a much greater ratio than when I started on The Street  when gold traded at 53 1  and it presages well for silver 
TGR  What s the balance between industrial uses and retail uses for gold JR  Gold s only real use is as jewelry  Otherwise  it serves the ups and downs of investment demand and the requirements of banks buying it for reserve purposes  It is used a little bit in dentistry and a little bit in high end technology  but those applications are not enough to be determining factors of the gold price  The jewelry usage is the largest use  but even that it is not enough to consume the total world gold supply  Normally  the recycling market alone is almost enough to support the jewelry market  especially in recent years with the get cash for gold boom that occurred in the U S  and in other countries  People were taking old jewelry items and getting  0 85 on the dollar for the gold content 
In reality  gold investment demand is going to continue to drive total demand  but it might not necessarily drive the price  If we look at most commodities that have an investment demand  when they are at peak  the pricing is determined by demand for investment  And that is what has happened with gold  The price rise toward  1 800 ounce   1 800 oz  was solely driven by peaking investment demand  But in the current pullback  the valuation is not so much based on investment demand  There are large gold buyers who set a price floor  China creates a floor around  1 200 oz when it buys everything it can get its hands on through Shanghai  But above that  pricing is based on the cost of production  If every gold mine in the world shut down  the price of gold would go up tremendously  counteracting the low price regime essentially instantaneously  The better producers are performing at  1 250 oz all in cash cost numbers  Most industries need a 20  economic profit margin to survive  That puts the real price of gold at  1 500 oz 
TGR  What about silver  JR  The cost to produce silver is a bit lower than gold because silver comes with valuable byproducts  such as lead and zinc in some cases  But silver only mining can still cost in the  20 oz range  so that suggests a rational silver price above  20 oz  It is important for silver miners to concentrate more on producing silver than on producing byproducts  however  For example  Hecla Mining Co  s  HL  Greens Creek would survive at a much lower silver price  The existence of single entity silver mines producing in the  17 20 oz cost range suggests that the price of silver should be about  24 oz 
TGR  Which larger firms do you like in the precious metals mining space 
JR  Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd   NYSE AEM  has always been a quality run company in the midtier space  One of the larger companies that we cover is Pretium Resources Inc   PVG   It has been a very controversial story this year  But it now appears that Strathcona Mineral Services Ltd  has stepped away a little too early from Pretium  If it had stayed on for the full 10 000 ton bulk sample that Pretium produced  the situation may have been different  We think that Pretium is a good story because a lot of people lost interest in it after Strathcona got cold feet  prematurely  And this is the type of situation that provides a value opportunity because it has not been perfectly mediated by the market 
TGR  Which companies do you like in the junior gold and silver producer market these days JR  We like SilverCrest Mines Inc   AMEX SVLC   Its valuation peaked at about  2 60 share  and then it did a Canadian bought deal for  20 million  That resulted in a pullback when people questioned the need for the new money  But management played it safe and used its high valuation to sock away cash for the possibility of future problems  which is a very rational strategy  Our valuation on SilverCrest is  2 50 share  It currently trades around  1 85  SilverCrest is going through a transitional period as it commits to underground mining  As a result  it is going to have a lower production level in Q2 14  But by Q4 14  we should have a full picture of its new mining operation with its combination of underground extraction and blending off its leach pad at the mill 
TGR  Any other juniors that you want to draw our attention to JR  Paramount Gold and Silver Corp   AMEX PZG  is a great story  Its stock is a play on two assets  The first asset is the San Miguel project  which is adjacent to Coeur Mining Inc  s  CDE  Palmarejo project  Coeur has stated publicly that it is looking for high grade ore sources  and it has one sitting next door to it  There are a number of ways in which this play could work out  There could be an offtake agreement to Coeur  where it mills the ore for Paramount  because Paramount is closer to production than Coeur is on its own discoveries  Or Coeur could buy Paramount and develop and process the ore itself  There is also a less likely scenario in which Paramount could develop the asset on its own  Taking these three scenarios into account  Paramount s share valuation is on the less expensive side in today s market 
Paramount also has an intriguing asset in Nevada  the historical Sleeper mine that used to produce both gold and silver  Today  it has more than 5 million ounces gold in resources  albeit at very low grades  But it could be a story comparable to Allied Nevada Gold Corp   AMEX ANV   which developed a similar asset at a reasonable cash cost by streamlining the production process  As an investment for Paramount  the Sleeper is a kind of call option on the gold price  It bought the mine when the gold price was  1 270 oz  Now  it s  1 300 oz  The property is technically worth more than when Paramount bought it before the strong run up began in 2010  At the time  it seemed like a great decision  It has yet to arrive at the finish line  but the company continues to show steady advancement toward its goal 
The only other really interesting junior that we follow in the gold and silver space is Solitario Exploration   Royalty Corp   SLR TO   It owns the Mt  Hamilton gold project  We consider that to be an exceptional small scale project  the company is hoping to develop it by itself  The thing we like about Solitario is that it looks for carried interests in projects because then it can sit back and wait for the money to come in  And if the project proves to be unsuccessful  it did not spend its own money on it  Along those lines  Solitario has a 30  carried interest in a zinc mine in Peru with significant upside  There are no initial costs because its partner is carrying the mine to production 
Carried interests are a great scenario for small companies to take  allowing somebody else to develop their assets  Solitario has taken that approach with a few other assets  too  The firm is still in its early stages  and it is hard to assign a value to it today  but it is positioned to move up the value curve  Solitario can develop value for its shareholders without expensing large amounts of capital today and diluting the shares  It is a unique way of doing business for a mining company 
TGR  Can you take a wild guess at what the prices of gold and silver will be in a year 
JR  A year from now  I expect that the price of gold will be in the  1 500 oz range  My rationale for that is twofold  If we look historically at the last four gold cycles  the recovery the year after the bottom has been strong all four times  In fact  it has averaged 25  more than the average price the year following the bottom of each gold cycle  Our latest bottom was  1 192 oz on June 28  2013  Applying 25  to that for this year  the price averages out to  1 492 oz  I do not believe that we will fully get there this year  though  For one thing  it is clear that there are forces invested in keeping the gold price down for the immediate future  But  1 500 oz is a doable number  if based solely on the cost of production methodology that I explained 
Silver tends to be more volatile  when it does move  Silver could be significantly higher than our  25 oz number for 2015  which is a bit less than the movement in gold on a percentage basis  That is based on the expectation of a 20  margin on the  20 oz cost producers  of course 
On the other hand  if enough mining companies manage to save 5  across the board on cash costs  that could move gold and silver prices down by 5  as well  And vice versa  If the cost of mining were to rally up again  that could result in even higher precious metal prices 
The other thing that affects price concerns crisis situations around the world  Currently  the Ukraine issue is important  although it does not look as if the U S  will become involved there militarily  Military engagement between the U S  and Russia would be a bad thing for the global economy  But there are goldbugs out there who are betting on gold prices rising due to the possibility of war  The gold price could go up in a war scenario  but I do not advocate that as a rationale for buying gold  On the other side of that coin  when political situations diffuse there can be pullbacks in gold and silver pricing  But timing pullbacks tied to worldwide political issues is very tough to calculate  as are wars 
TGR  You mentioned that there are people with a vested interest in keeping the price of gold down  JR  The most heavily shorted stock on the Toronto Stock Exchange is Kinross Gold Corp   NYSE KGC   and there are a number of other gold companies with large short positions on them  There are also some large scale trading shorts on gold by the larger banks  which were put into place as gold declined from  1 600 oz to  1 200 oz  There is some concern that some of those might be in the red today  because they were still putting shorts into place when the gold price was around  1 200 oz  If that is the case  it is in the best interests of the short holders to encourage the bear argument against gold  The bearish swaying of the investor mentality causes an additional bear movement on gold that is not supported by the fundamentals of gold production  Avoid the bears

120256,341771,AEM,6 Gold Miners That Might Be Goldcorp s Next Acquisition Targets ,opinion,Osisko Mining Corporation s  OSK TO  takeover fight appears to be over  On April 21  2014  Goldcorp  NYSE GG  bowed out of the bidding despite increasing its takeover offer to  7 65 a share  The bid  though  fell short of the  3 9 billion  or  8 15 per share  50 50 joint offer from both Yamana Gold  NYSE AUY  and Agnico Eagle Mines  NYSE AEM  that was announced on April 16  2014  Osisko shareholders will receive  2 09 in cash  0 26471 of a Yamana common share  0 07264 of an Agnico Eagle common share  and one share of the new Osisko  which the companies estimated would be worth  1 20  for each share held Yamana Gold had taken the markets by surprise when on April 2  2014  it announced a friendly deal to acquire 50  of Osisko s mining and exploration assets for  930 million  or  7 60 per share  in cash and Yamana stock  besting Goldcorp s initial  5 95 per share unsolicited bid  Osisko s flagship asset had become an appealing prize  Malartic has 9 37 million ounces of gold in reserves and is located in a mining friendly jurisdiction  Its mine is expected to produce more than 500 000 ounces of gold in 2014 at an estimated cash cost of between US 527 and  577 per ounce  The following six companies  although not as attractive as Osisko  could also be potential acquisition targets for Goldcorp  1  Alamos Gold Inc   AGI   This gold producer owns and operates the Mulatos Mine in Mexico  and has exploration and development activities in Mexico  Turkey  and the United States  Alamos has approximately  410 million in cash and cash equivalents and is debt free  The company said it expects to produce between 150 000 and 170 000 ounces of gold in 2014 at cash operating costs of  630 to  670 per ounce of gold sold  excluding royalties   2  Argonaut Gold Inc   AR TO   Argonaut s primary assets are the production stage El Castillo Mine in Durango  Mexico  and the La Colorada Mine in Sonora  Mexico  in addition to the advanced exploration stage San Antonio project in Baja California Sur  Mexico  and the Magino project in Ontario  The company currently has  81 million in cash and no debt  It has a Measure and Indicated gold resource of 12 5 million ounces  Argonaut expects 2014 gold production of 135 000 to 150 000 gold equivalent ounces at a cash cost per ounce sold of  750  775  3  Detour Gold Corp   DGC TO   Detour is similar to Osisko in that it has a single  producing mine in Canada  that being Detour Lake in northern Ontario  but it is a higher cost operation with estimates of between  800 and  900 an ounce this year  The company has 15 5 million ounces of proven and probable gold reserves and it expects to produce about 600 000 ounces per year for the next 10 years  Given that its stock has surged 88  to its current price of  10 91 since the initial Osisko offer  Detour seems to be the market s first choice for Goldcorp or another suitor  4  AuRico Gold Inc   AUQ   AuRico has a producing mine in Ontario  Young Davidson  as well as in Mexico  El Chanate  in addition to development assets in both of those countries  The miner estimates consolidated production of between 210 000 and 240 000 ounces of gold in 2014  which would be an increase of up to 25  from 2013  at expected cash costs of between US 675 and  775 per ounce  AuRico has proven and probable gold reserves of 6 5 million ounces 5  New Gold Inc   AMEX NGD   The miner currently has four producing assets  the New Afton Mine in Canada  the Mesquite Mine in the United States  the Peak Mines in Australia  and the Cerro San Pedro Mine in Mexico  The company s total gold production in 2014 is estimated to be between 380 000 and 420 000 ounces at total cash costs of US 320 to  340 or all in sustaining cash costs of  815 to  835  using a  1 300 per ounce gold price assumption  New Gold has 18 5 million ounces of proven and probable gold reserves  6  Pretium Resources Inc   PVG   Although its Brucejack gold project in northern British Columbia isn t expected to go into production until 2016  the 6 6 million ounces of probable reserves in its Valley of the Kings area grading 13 6 g t is difficult to ignore  A feasibility study done last year estimates average annual gold production of 425 700 ounces during the mine s first 10 years at all in sustaining cash costs of  508 per ounce using a US 1350 per ounce gold price assumption  While other companies could have been included in this list  these six were chosen based on one or more of the following factors that include  North American assets  reserve resource size  production costs or estimated production costs that are below US 1200 an ounce  as well as having mines and or development projects located near existing Goldcorp interests  which could result in potential cost saving synergies ,2014-04-25,"Sean Mason,

120257,341772,AEM,Duncan Hughes  Quartet Of High Grade Winners,opinion,"With gold hovering around  1 300 an ounce  there s not much room for error  says Duncan Hughes of RFC Ambrian  In this interview with   Hughes counsels that investors should seek high grade  low cost projects with exploration upside in stable jurisdictions  He suggests three such companies in West Africa and another with Silver  Gold and antimony resources in Chile and Australia 
The Gold Report  After hitting  1 380 an ounce   1 380 oz  in March  gold fell below  1 300 oz and has hovered around there since then  Do you expect the price to change much either way in the next few months 
Duncan Hughes  That s not easy to predict  I think  1 300 oz seems a sensible assumption for 2014  If it were to fall much below that  most of the sector would be operating at a loss 
TGR  Assuming a gold price of  1 300 oz  what are the qualities that will distinguish the junior gold companies that become successful 
DH  In the recent past  companies paid too much attention to the size of resources and potential scales of production  The focus now is profitable production scenarios  Low cost producers and undervalued developers that look likely to become low cost producers are the key for investors 
One way to achieve stronger profit margins is through higher grade ore bodies  Grade has always been king but is now even more so  Low cost producers are not only most likely to survive this difficult market  those making profits may also pay dividends  Given that share price appreciation is more challenging than previously  dividends have become more attractive 
TGR  To what extent should investors restrict themselves to companies with management teams with winning track records 
DH  If I were an investor  I d look for management with a track record  If management doesn t have that track record not only finding mines but bringing them to production then the asset is the overriding factor  If the asset is strong enough  I d want board members with a nice mix of technical skills a geologist  an engineer  perhaps even a metallurgist complemented by members with financial skills and access to equity and debt finance 
TGR  After rejecting a bid from Goldcorp Inc  G TO   Osisko Mining Corporation  OSK TO  has agreed to a friendly takeover by Yamana Gold Inc  NYSE AUY  and Agnico Eagle Mines Limited  NYSE AEM   Does this battle over Osisko suggest we will see an increase in mergers and acquisitions  M As  
DH  There have been rumors about Barrick Gold Corporation  NYSE ABX  and Newmont Mining Corporation  NYSE NEM  getting together  I do anticipate an increase in M As in the gold space  Capital expenses  capexes  are generally smaller there  as compared to the iron ore space  where they run into the billions 
Many gold explorers are looking to reinvent themselves to stay alive  Companies with projects but no money will look for companies with cash but no projects and vice versa  There are a lot of opportunities out there at current pricing 
TGR  Which type of company is most likely to be taken out 
DH  Because funding is much harder to secure than it once was  the main focus will be developers with strong projects that require significant initial capital expenditures  We saw this with the takeover of PMI Gold Corp  by Asanko Gold Inc  AKG TO   Asanko had a large cash balance  and PMI had a good project  Other examples would be Endeavour Mining Corporation  EDV TO  buyout of Adamus Resources Ltd  for its Nzema project in Ghana and B2Gold Corporation s  AMEX BTG acquisition of Volta Resources Inc  for its Kiaka project in Ghana 
We re also seeing this in the Australian junior space  Gold producer Northern Star Resources Ltd  NST ASX  has recently acquired Barrick s West Australian gold assets 
TGR  Are there any likely takeover candidates among the companies you cover 
DH  Two quality juniors with good projects facing capex challenges are Papillon Resources Ltd  PIR ASX  and its Fekola project in Mali  and Orbis SA  ORBP WA  with its Natougou project in Burkina Faso  Fekola will cost about  300 million   300M  and Natougou about  200M  It would have been pretty easy for these companies to have found such financing in 2007  but it s difficult now 
The likes of Randgold Resources  RRS LONDON   Endeavour or B2Gold might be looking at these opportunities 
TGR  Is there a capex sweet spot for these midlevel project takeovers   200 300M  perhaps 
DH  That sounds about right  Papillon s market cap is  416M  so when you add the takeover premium  you re getting up there  Orbis  market cap is only  60M  so that s a different story 
TGR  What s your top Buy recommendation 
DH  Mandalay Resources Corporation  MND TO   This is a good example of a low cost producer that pays dividends 
TGR  Mandalay announced on April 23 its intention to borrow  60M  What s the reason for this 
DH  The announcement states that it is to take advantage of opportunities in current debt markets  Mandalay has long said it is looking to acquire undervalued assets  as it has done successfully in the past  The opportunity to tap into a debt facility obviously puts Mandalay in a much stronger position to make further acquisitions 
TGR  How does Mandalay s acquisition of the Challacollo silver gold project in Chile complement its Cerro Bayo silver gold project in Chile 
DH  I wouldn t say they really complement each other as they re geographically a long way apart  Challacollo is in northern Chile and Cerro Bayo is down in Patagonia  Challacollo will not go into production for several years  It s more a case of management following its strategy  Mandalay said it would pick up an undervalued high quality asset  and Challacollo certainly looks to be that  More metallurgical work needs to be done  but Challacollo has good potential to be a low cost silver producer 
Mandalay is still all about two successful operations  Cerro Bayo produces silver  after gold credits  at  11 oz all in  That s low cost  Cerro Bayo was not being mined optimally by Coeur Mining Inc   CDM TSX  CDE NYSE  when Mandalay bought it in 2010  Now Mandalay is making a nice profit on it  Costerfield  Mandalay s gold antimony mine in Australia  has always been a challenging project  Mandalay has turned it around and made it profitable as well 
TGR  Mandalay shares are trading at  0 93  Is it undervalued 
DH  Yes  considering the possibility of expansion in 2014 and the fact that Mandalay is actually making money at current metals prices  Cerro Bayo and Costerfield are high grade operations  and when you do a standard discounted cash flow model  you obviously can t factor in too much future production  This means that the net present value you generate probably doesn t do the company justice given that it takes many years to drill out the resources and reserves of these ore bodies 
At Cerro Bayo  for example  Mandalay recently had some really significant exploration drill results  demonstrating that the current veins being mined continue for some distance under the shallow Laguna Verde  I don t think the market has picked up on the significance of that 
TGR  You called Papillon s Fekola gold project in Mali  good   How good is it 
DH  It would be difficult to find another junior gold project as good as Fekola  It has 5 15 million ounces  5 15 Moz  at 2 4 grams per ton  2 4 g t  with good metallurgy and low strip ratios  It could be mined from one open pit  and recent company work has suggested that there may be opportunities for shallow satellite pits as well  Production is forecast to begin in 2017  320 000 oz per year over the first 11 years at an all in cost of  740 oz 
And Papillon has strong management  Mark Connelly is the CEO  He worked at Adamus and has developed projects from exploration through to production  The non executive chairman  Ian Middlemas  has a strong track record of developing projects to the point of being taken out  Fekola is close to Randgold s 17 9 Moz Loulo Gounkoto projects  AngloGold Ashanti Ltd  s  AU NYSE  ANG JSE  AGG ASX  AGD LSE  13 1 Moz Sadiola project and Endeavour s 3 8 Moz Segala Tabakoto project  Given Middlemas  track record  I would say that Papillon has to be a target 
TGR  Could you compare Papillon to another company operating in Mali  Legend Gold Corp  LGN V  
DH  Legend s Tiekoumala project is at a much earlier stage than Fekola and has 590 000 oz  590 Koz  Indicated and Inferred  Legend has just announced a joint venture agreement with Randgold on seven of its permits  Randgold is  of course  a producer with high quality assets throughout Africa 
TGR  How should investors balance potential reward and risk in West Africa  specifically with regard to the various gold producing jurisdictions 
DH  Several years ago  gold companies in West Africa traded at a premium because of the excellent exploration opportunities engendered by the geology  Since then markets have changed  and investors have become risk averse  In Africa  we have seen the Arab Spring  a push for nationalization and the coup in Mali  These events remind investors that the African political landscape is not as secure as some other parts of the world 
But the geology of the Birimian Greenstone Belt hasn t changed  A number of countries  such as C te d Ivoire  Liberia and Burkina Faso  have vast fortunes in land that is still relatively underexplored  Ghana has a track record of political stability and stable gold production  Next door  in C te d Ivoire  which lacks this stability  there is the same geology but many fewer mines  Guinea is working through a new mining code  and I would say that it is still a risky place to consider 
Burkina Faso  on the other hand  is a great place  It has got seven gold mines coming into production there 
TGR  Liberia was considered a failed state for decades  How great has its recovery been 
DH  I see real opportunity there  It s like Burkina Faso  at an earlier stage of development  obviously  I visited after the 2011 election  which was peaceful  Ellen Johnson Sirleaf  who won the Nobel Peace Prize that year  was re elected 
I met the minister of mining and came away with the feeling that the Liberian government is very supportive of mining  Before the political strife began in 1980  Liberia was a significant iron ore producer and retains that infrastructure 
TGR  Which gold company in Liberia do you rate a Buy 
DH  Aureus Mining Inc  AUE LONDON  is looking to bring Liberia s first gold mine  the New Liberty mine  into production in Q1 15  The government demonstrated its support of the company by amending its mineral development agreement and reducing the corporate tax rate from 30  to 25   while reaffirming the 3  royalty 
The government takes a 10  free carry  This is typical in West Africa  New Liberty s license has been affirmed for 13 years  which is more than Aureus needs based on current reserves 
TGR  Aureus closed a  15M offering April 22  What s the significance of that 
DH  I wasn t expecting it because the company went to the market late last year to raise money for exploration  That made sense because Aureus has excellent exploration upside  Going back to the market now suggests that it might be falling slightly short of the  125M New Liberty capex requirement  I would hope that only a small part of the  15M financing will be needed for New Liberty and that the rest will be used for exploration 
TGR  What s the size of the resource at New Liberty 
DH  It is 924 Koz at 3 4 g t and a quite high strip ratio  According to the definitive feasibility study  the mine is expected to produce 119 Koz annually for the first six years of production at  900 oz  This should be a profitable operation 
TGR  That s a short mine life  How much exploration potential do you see 
DH  A lot  Not necessarily at New Liberty itself but instead at Aureus  Ndablama project about 40 kilometers away  In that part of the world  that s probably a bit too far to truck to New Liberty  but what s exciting about Ndablama is that it is shaping up to be another standalone gold operation  New Liberty is the present  but Ndablama is probably the future 
TGR  How good is Orbis  Natougou project in Burkina Faso 
DH  It s the grade that wins there  1 8 Moz at 3 7 g t with good metallurgy  All shallow and open pittable  a relatively flat lying ore body  It should be profitable and has the opportunity for a quick payback because the high grade comes to the surface  It has quite a high strip ratio  but the exploration upside at Natougou is substantial  Less than 5  of a 50 square kilometer gold anomaly has been tested  but the company is quite rightly focused on developing Natougou first 
Orbis also has very strong exploration ground elsewhere in Burkina Faso  in the Hound  Greenstone Belt  which hosts SEMAFO Inc   SMF ST  Mana operation and also Roxgold Inc  ROG V  Yaramoko project  It s a very fertile belt  and Orbis has been hitting some really exciting intersections there  All this and a market cap of only  60M makes for a good opportunity  Natougou is a good two years away from production  Orbis is doing a feasibility study now  We estimate that permitting should take about one year  I have a Buy rating on Orbis and a target price of  0 70  which is significantly higher than the  0 26 it trades at now 
TGR  SEMAFO has had a great deal of trouble in recent years  and in response the company has consolidated its operations  SEMAFO is pretty well just Mana now  How much difference will this make 
DH  I think it will make a difference  SEMAFO s other operations in Niger and in Guinea were not the big picture  Mana has always been the prize asset  It s a great project  2 3 Moz at a pretty good grade of 2 8 g t  The question for the company is whether its billion dollar market cap can be justified based solely on Mana 
TGR  Sticking with Burkina Faso  how do you rate B2Gold and Roxgold s assets there 
DH  B2Gold  because it has assets throughout the world  is not a peer of Orbis  Kiaka  however  which B2Gold acquired from Volta  can be compared to Orbis  Natougou  Kiaka s a big project  but it s very low grade  I think that in this market it would be very difficult to get it up and running 
Kiaka looks to be a project waiting for the gold price to lift substantially because in order to justify the high capex  B2Gold would need to put through a lot of tons to get the economies of scale with the low grade ore 
TGR  How is Roxgold doing on grade 
DH  Yaramoko is a great asset  a probable resource of 759 Koz at 11 8 g t  It s going to be an underground operation rather than open pit  And Roxgold s market cap is  163M  which is more than twice Orbis  market cap  But that s the premium you d expect given the grade 
TGR  We recently did an  and he pointed out that 200 of the 700 ASX listed mining and resource companies are effectively moribund 
DH  You could make a similar judgment about the TSX Venture Exchange 
TGR  Certainly  Karn argued that the culling of these  zombie  companies would be a positive step  Do you agree 
DH  Yes  Many companies on the Australian Stock Exchange  the TSX Venture Exchange and London s AIM exchange are not going to make it  and that consolidation will be a good thing  As I mentioned earlier  investors in the recent past just looked at the size of a resource and said   Wow  There s 2 Moz there  and this stock looks cheap   But they weren t looking at the quality of those ounces  I think investors have since wised up  Too late  however  for many companies 
TGR  Some 12 months ago  when it seemed that gold might fall to  1 000 oz  financing pretty much dried up  Now that gold seems to have stabilized around  1 300 oz  has the funding picture improved 
DH  I don t think it has improved that much yet  You said that the gold price seems to have settled  but let s face it  this stability has only existed for a very short time  I think major financiers and the equity markets need to be persuaded that there is a floor of perhaps  1 200 1 300 oz  When this occurs  funding will improve

120258,341773,AEM,4 Reasons Gold Miners Look Poised For A Summer Rally,opinion,"We re all well aware of the bearish summer seasonality  June and July  for the precious metals sector  However  there are suddenly a few reasons to believe that this summer will break the mold of what investors have become accustomed to 
The sell off came early this year with a 10   decline in Market Vectors Gold Miners  ARCA GDX  between May 5th and May 28th  Moreover  the bullish divergence between the gold price and the senior producers became quite pronounced in recent days 

Last week s gold futures Commitments of Traders report is easily the most bullish report of the past year

Tuesday s large decline appears to have been led by large speculators  hedge funds  establishing short positions while small traders  trend followers  initiated new bearish bets as the gold price broke support near  1275 
With so much fast money betting on further declines in the gold price  it is much more likely that we will witness a short squeeze back to  1300 before we see a decline below the double bottom near  1180 
The following two slides from a recent Agnico Eagle  NYSE AEM  investor  help to illustrate the increasing operating leverage also known as all in sustaining costs  AISC  that the major gold producers are creating 


The herd will call you crazy  but it might be time to get ready for a summer rally in the major gold producers  Stay tuned ",2014-06-01,Tommy Humphreys,https://www.investing.com/analysis/4-reasons-gold-miners-look-poised-for-a-summer-rally-214535,214535
120259,341774,AEM,Will Gold Regain Its Shine ,opinion,"After a lackluster 2013  which represented the end of the 12 year bull run for Gold  the yellow metal somewhat regained its shine in 2014  Concerns about the economy and geopolitical tensions acted as catalysts to gold prices which shot up to a high of  1 388 per ounce in the first quarter  It remains to be seen whether the momentum is sustained through the balance of 2014    In 2013  gold suffered a 28  drop  ending at around  1 200 per ounce    the steepest plunge in more than three decades  It was not one event that affected the gold market in the year  A plethora of factors    the Federal Reserve s taper or no taper confusion  conflict in Syria and the U S  government s partial shutdown  and finally the taper call at year end    pushed gold prices down throughout the year and tarnished its image as a safe haven asset   A See Saw Ride for Prices in 2014 So Far   Gold started 2014 at  1 223 per ounce and rose steadily  thanks to the growing demand for jewelry in China  the largest consumer due to the Lunar New Year  In mid March  gold attained a six month high of  1 388 per ounce  The 13  gain since the start of the year was stoked by Ukraine worries  fears of slowdown in China and weak U S  economic data that drove investors to bullion as a safe haven    However  the bubble soon burst with gold prices again falling below  1 300 per ounce in late March on stronger than expected U S  economic data  After see sawing on either side of  1 300  gold prices plummeted to around  1 250 per ounce in late May  Positive U S  economic indicators boosted the dollar and pushed the gold price in the opposite direction 
Investors took the opportunity to shift from gold and flock to the stock markets instead  sending New York indices to record territory  Gold s safe haven status during times of turmoil was tarnished by the waning concerns about Ukraine  Furthermore lower demand in China as well as India in contrast to the record levels last year also kept prices at check    The wipeout of a chunk of gains by the metal witnessed earlier led to a heavy sell off in gold stocks  Barrick Gold Corporation  NYSE ABX   Anglogold Ashanti Ltd  NYSE AU   Goldcorp Inc  NYSE GG   Yamana Gold Inc  NYSE AUY   Agnico Eagle Mines Limited  NYSE AEM  and Kinross Gold Corporation  NYSE KGC   all took a beating Demand Flat in Q1   As per the World Gold Council  total gold demand in the first quarter of 2014 remained flat year over year at 1 074 5 tons  as increase in jewelry demand was offset by lower demand in the investment space and in the technology sector  The overall volume of 570 7 tons was the highest first quarter volume recorded since 2005    Jewelry demand maintained its bullish run for the seventh consecutive quarter  Demand went up 3  as prices fell  The advent of the Chinese New Year  followed by Valentine s Day  led to record first quarter jewelry demand in China  Demand in India  however  dipped due to the ongoing restrictions on gold imports as well as the governmental elections  There was an uncertainty  particularly with respect to the import curbs and whether these might be lifted  Customers were reluctant to buy until a clear post election picture emerged  One of the most noteworthy developments in the quarter was in the investment sector  Demand dipped only 2   a marked improvement from the substantial decline in the past few quarters  Net ETF outflows in gold were zero in contrast with the 177 tons of outflows witnessed in the year ago quarter  Tensions in Ukraine made investors flock to gold as a risk diversifier which resulted in positive monthly inflows to ETFs in February  for the first time in over a year  which was repeated in March  However  it was short lived as economic recovery in the U S  as well as worldwide again led to outflows    Demand for gold bars and coins bore the brunt of the unconducive circumstances  falling to their lowest levels for four years  Demand plunged 39  from record levels year over year  As gold prices steadily increased during the quarter contrary to expectations of falling further  investors maintained a cautious stance  awaiting a clearer price trend 
A degree of profit taking also contributed to the year over year decline  The opportunistic buying that contributed to a portion of last year s surge resulted in some of these relatively tactical buyers closing out of their positions as the price rose in the course of the quarter    Central banks remained the primary acquirers of gold  albeit at a slower rate  purchasing net 122 tons in the period  accounting for around 11  of total gold demand  In the technology sector  gold demand was down 4  due to shift to other cheaper materials    In terms of demand  2013 was an exceptional year  which saw consumers flooding to purchase jewelry  bars and coins as the price went downhill  In 2014  year on year comparisons will be affected by the extraordinary levels of demand that were witnessed in the consumer space last year   Supply Up a Meager 1  Due to Reduced Recycling   Mine production in the first quarter of 2014 was at 720 5 tons  up 6  year over year as new operations either ramped up production or came on stream  Canada stayed atop the leader board with contributions from the new Detour Lake  Canadian Malartic and Young Davidson mines  In the Dominican Republic  production continued to ramp up at the Pueblo Viejo mine  which came on stream in late 2012    Recycling of gold contributed 322 tons to the total supply  down 13  year over year  The drop in gold prices led to a decline in recycling activity as consumers are less inclined to part with their stocks at lower prices  Overall  gold supply inched up 1  to 1 048 5 tons in the first quarter  dragged down by lower recycling activity    In the first quarter  mining companies continued to contain costs and increase operational efficiencies  This should feed through to continued growth in mine production in the coming quarters   Survival Tactics   The price decline added to the woes of the industry that was already grappling with rising costs  labor issues  strikes  delays and or the cancellation of projects  If prices fall further  margins will be constrained as the price of gold closes in on the cost per ounce of the companies  Gold miners have decided to suspend projects  curtail their capital spending and resort to employee layoffs to conserve cash  The companies are actively pursuing opportunities to optimize their portfolio  including the divestiture of certain non core or non productive assets    In line with this strategy  Barrick Gold has divested non core assets for a total consideration of over  1 billion since July 2013  including the sale of the Kanowna and Plutonic mines in Australia  Goldcorp and Barrick sold their respective stakes in the Marigold mine in Nevada  Barrick Gold s sale was part of its effort to rid itself of some higher cost assets  thereby reducing debt burden  On the other hand  the sale of the mine is consistent with Goldcorp s plan of concentrating on core assets  thereby creating value for shareholders   
As part of its continued portfolio optimization actions  Newmont Mining Corporation  NYSE NEM  signed a deal to divest its Jundee underground gold mine in Australia  The divestment underscores Newmont s strategy to focus more on its core assets that have a longer life and lower cost  Staying true to its objective  the company has sold its Midas mine in Nevada to Klondex Mines Ltd  It has also sold its equity interest in Paladin Energy Ltd  Agnico Eagle Mines recently sold off 8 6  of the issued and outstanding common shares of Sulliden Gold Corporation Ltd   SUE TO  as they were a non core asset   Consolidation   The austerity in the mining sector has led to more measured mergers and acquisitions  M A   Companies have slowed down M A deals since last year  but Chinese gold miners remained active on the acquisition front to capitalize on the strong domestic demand for gold and lower gold prices    This year  Agnico Eagle Mines and Yamana Gold have come together to acquire Osisko Mining Corporation  Agnico Eagle and Yamana will jointly acquire 100  of Osisko s issued and outstanding common shares  The deal came after rival miner Goldcorp made another bid to take over Osisko    The agreement is a strategic fit for both Agnico Eagle and Yamana  The acquisition is expected to be mutually accretive and improve both companies  total cash cost and all in sustaining cost profiles  They will also get access to Canadian Malartic  the largest producing gold mine in Canada which has the potential to produce an average of roughly 600 000 gold ounces per year for 14 years    It is clear that M A activity in the mining industry is expected to remain slow  Deals will come through only when companies have enough cash to seize the opportunity to take over assets unloaded by peers  It remains to be seen whether the Osisko Mining acquisition could lead to a fresh round of M As in an otherwise dormant market   Sector Q1 Earnings Scorecard   Disappointing   With all the companies in the Basic Material sector having reported for the first quarter  the curtains have fallen on first quarter earnings season  Earnings decreased 2 7  in the first quarter of 2014 while revenues nudged up 0 9   This is a marked deceleration from the fourth quarter of 2013  in which the sector s earnings had risen 16  while revenues had moved up 2 9   Nevertheless  the Basic Material sector had a beat ratio  percentage of companies coming out with positive surprises  of 54 5     The earnings dip should not make investors shy away from the Basic Material sector as the feebleness in the first quarter is broad based and not concentrated in any particular sector  For further details about earnings for this sector and others  please read our    Q2   Beyond   Holds Promise   For 2014  earnings at the sector are expected to grow at a rate of 8 4  in the second quarter and 14 6  in the third quarter but decelerate to a growth rate of 5 7  in the fourth quarter  Overall  in 2014  the sector s earnings are projected to grow 9 6   In 2015  the growth will almost double to 18 5    Industry Ranking   Outlook   Positive   Within the Zacks Industry classification  the gold industry falls under the broader Basic Materials sector  one of 16 Zacks sectors   We rank all of the more than 260 industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook for the constituent companies in each industry  This ranking is available on the     The way to align the ranking and outlook from the complete list of Zacks Industry Rank for the 260  companies is that the outlook for the top one third of the list  Zacks Industry Rank of  87 and lower  is positive  while the outlook for the bottom one third  Zacks Industry Rank  174 and higher  is negative  Currently  the gold mining industry is featured in the topmost tier with a Zacks Industry Rank of  68  indicating a bullish stance    Please note that the Zacks Rank for stocks  which are at the core of our Industry Outlook  has an impressive track record  verified by outside auditors  to foretell stock prices  particularly over the short term  1 to 3 months   The rank  along with the Expected Surprise Prediction  ESP   Read    helps in predicting the probability of earnings surprises   So What Lies Ahead    One of the research firms  The Goldman Sachs Group Inc  NYSE GS   with a particularly bearish attitude on gold  expects gold price to fall to  1 050 per ounce by the end of this year pinned down by the easing of Chinese credit concerns and Ukraine tensions along with stronger U S  and Chinese economic activity  However  other research firms feel that the yellow metal still has potential to get its act together and forecast prices in the range of  1 250 to  1 400    Gold is expected to bounce back from the dismal lows in May as India has slashed import duties in view of weakness in bullion prices  India had curbed bullion imports last year  including a record 10  duty on overseas purchases to address the high current account deficit  Gold is the second largest import item for India after petroleum 
The easing of restrictions and the upcoming wedding season would again stir up gold demand in the second largest consuming nation  Even though strength in the U S  and European equity markets will distract gold investors  gold prices will get a solid thrust from retail demand for gold  particularly in India and China    Moreover  production pullbacks in response to lower gold prices last year and mining development delays  could lead to a supply crunch which would push prices higher  Additionally  the Fed is committed to keep interest rates at lower levels for some time  Thus  even with the tapering in place  gold might regain its shine this year  A positive Zacks Rank and projected earnings growth for 2014 injects optimism in the so far faltering gold mining industry ",2014-06-04,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-gold-regain-its-shine-214952,214952
120274,341789,AEM,Gold And Silver Still Better Off Than Earlier This Year,opinion,Even though this summer  for the precious metals markets  right now feels like a close second  After rallying strongly in August and September the metals have declined for almost 3 months now  culminating in a recent smash down  And it feels especially worse since the reaction of gold and silver to the open ended  85 billion per month quantitative easing announcement from Ben Bernanke has been the opposite of what most would expect  Seeing through the negativity though  the situation is better off for the metals than it was 6 months ago  During the summer  gold built a multi month base in the  1500s which further validated that zone as being a massive support zone  Then the surge higher off of that base has created a big positive divergence in momentum that often precedes a major move higher in price  Even if gold were to drop back into the  1500s  the divergence in momentum should still be in place  and technicians will undoubtedly pick up on that fact if a bunch of demand comes rushing back into the gold market Silver looks similar to gold except the positive divergence in momentum is larger and extends back to the start of 2012  This could be a sign of even more underlying strength in silver than in gold  Notice that just like gold  there s a bunch of hammer candlesticks over the last 2 years  once silver breaks below a certain level  This reinforces the supply and demand dynamics at that level  which is about  27 50 on silver  as strong support  Buyers were able to overwhelm sellers repeatedly once those levels were attempted  to be breached to the downside for both metals  that it would be hard for silver to break  25 since the entry point on that trade would be phenomenal for anyone wanting to enter a long term  long position in this ongoing secular bull market  The reason was  it took silver almost three years to build a base at the  20 level and then it broke out of that base on huge volume  So the closer silver got to  25  the better the risk reward of the trade for someone wanting to buy a pullback  and have strong support at  20 for downside risk  Since silver is likely still in a secular bull market  that would give the trade 20  or so risk to the downside  which is pretty good considering the upside potential could be much higher  So I assumed that  25 would be a good level of support for silver as it  on the correction from  50  Mining stocks are continuing to demonstrate that they are in the later throes of this ongoing correction in the metals  Back during the summer  almost every mining stock was trading at its lows for the year  or close to them  Now the situation is mixed across the mining space  which indicates some underlying strength  Some mining stocks  such as Agnico Eagle Mines  AEM  and Franco Nevada Corporation  FNV   are barely off of recent highs  Others are about at the mid range between their summer low and their September high  such as Yamana Gold  AUY   Hecla Mining  HL   and Kinross  KGC   And some mining stocks have made new lows below their summer lows  Due to more mining stocks holding above their summer lows the Gold Miners ETF  GDX  to Gold ETF  GLD  ratio continues to form a Stage 1 base with positive divergence in momentum  And this continues to be significant since major rallies in gold usually are accompanied by outperformance by miners Looking at the short term picture  the trading on December 20th looked like possibly an important turning point or maybe the beginning of one  It was definitely a throw in the towel day for many metals bulls  possibly a lot of weak hands  as both the GLD and SLV ETFs saw the biggest downside volume they ve seen since March  But looking at a daily chart  their emotional distress was causing them to dump their positions right at the upper range of support from the summer  And the miners showed some nice strength last Thursday as almost every mining stock performed better than the metals that day  This often happens towards the bottom of pullbacks in the metals as first the miners get dumped early in the correction  then the metals get dumped and the miners show some divergent strength Bottom Line  There s some short term and long term underlying strength to this recent pullback in the metals  Even if the bears can panic the bulls into selling their positions further into support levels  the bulls still have a positive divergence in momentum that has formed over multiple months and demonstrated long term support at lower levels  It isn t uncommon to see the lower end of a trading range tested one last time before a new rally either Disclosure  The views and opinions expressed are for informational purposes only  and should not be considered as investment advice   Please see the  ,2012-12-24,Justin Smyth,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gold-and-silver-still-better-off-than-earlier-this-year-148736,148736
120275,341790,AEM,David Skaria  Junior Gold Investors Living The Movie  Groundhog Day   ,opinion,Gold stocks  especially juniors  have been undervalued for longer than most investors thought possible  The result is what David Skarica  founder of Addicted to Profits  calls a  maximum pessimism trade   In this interview with The Gold Report  Skarica summarizes his analytical tools and provides clear examples of companies that meet his criteria as  screaming buys   Gold junior investors might feel as if they live in the movie  Groundhog Day   but the undervaluation cycle will eventually be broken  Is spring just around the corner for the junior gold miners  The Gold Report  In your recent newsletter  you wrote about  screaming buys  in gold stocks  Over the past couple of years  many investors have thought that gold stocks have been too cheap to pass up and have been burned  Is this a new position for you or has your view changed  David Skarica  Unfortunately for gold investors  historic valuations of gold stocks linked to the price of gold have remained undervalued for too long  If you look at valuation metrics of large cap gold stocks compared to the price of gold  many of these stocks are historically at very cheap valuations and that has persisted for some time  The AMEX Gold BUGS  Basket of Unhedged Gold Stocks  Index  HUI   is trading at roughly  420 430  It broke  400 to the upside for the first time back in 2006 when gold was in the  600 700 range  That tells us where we are  In the past year  gold stocks have been undervalued by anywhere from 20 50  based on historical valuation methods  Despite the bargain prices  a rally has failed to materialize  I have refined my message to focus more heavily on junior mining stocks because they have underperformed compared to the large caps  Juniors will fall harder and faster in a weak market even though there is value in the stocks  I  like everyone else  can learn my lessons from the market  The one thing I ve really learned the last couple of years is when you re trading the juniors  you need to be very disciplined  The reason that I m going so heavily toward juniors now is based on recent history  If you look at the rebound after the last big down market of 2008 2009  there were many juniors that had quality assets that were five   ten  or twentybaggers  There will be companies that come through this market that will have similar performances  TGR  Do you have a particular phase that you like exploration  development or near term producers  Or are there other factors  DS  There are a lot of dynamics  If I find an exploration company that s in the early stages yet has good management and lots of cash in the bank  I will definitely consider it  I like the stories that have a well defined resource or can build upon a resource  Near term production stories often have huge upside potential  They still have execution and financial risk  but near term producers are the ones that really can take off when the market finally turns  Near term cash flow coming down the pipeline and the capital investment behind them make them attractive to the market  Such stories can get punished in a market downturn because there s no news flow  They re quietly building the mill  building the mine and  finally  when the production starts  it s     wow  An example that follows this pattern is Avion Gold Corp   a gold producer in Mali  During the financial crisis  it went to  0 05 share  We put it in the newsletter at  0 06 share and the stock went as high as  2 share  Avion was taken out by Endeavour Mining Corp   EDV TSX  EVR ASX  for  0 88 share  The catalyst was production and cash flow  TGR  Was Avion a near term producer when you recommended it  DS  It was on the cusp of starting production when I first discussed it  Buying near term producers isn t quite that easy  you still need to look at the fundamentals of the project  A different type of example is Baja Mining Corp   BAJ TSX  BAJFF OTCQX   which is over budget  over budget and over budget  The company response was to dilute  dilute and dilute  As an investor  that is probably not something that you want to get involved with  My strategy is to look for projects that are relatively within budget  A lot of mine building goes somewhat over budget because capital expenditures and basic inputs have increased in price  That is even true in the emerging world  where cheaper labor is not as cheap as it was 20 years ago  Look for projects with costs under control and no delays  I also look for companies that are takeover targets  An example is one that I own now  Castillian Resources Corp   CT TSX V   Castillian has the same head geologist as Desert Sun Mining   Gems  DEZ NYSE MKT  and Central Sun Mining Inc   CSM TSX  SMC NYSE A   both of which were taken over by majors  To be clear  we re talking about a  0 03 share stock with a minimal market cap  Companies of that size could have liquidity and cash concerns  but Castillian has built up a small resource of 0 5 million ounces  Moz   It is a situation where it could grow to well over 1 Moz and build a nice little project  If that works out  it has real upside  Sometimes it is hard to understand the reason why a stock is priced the way it is  Some stocks go to  0 02 share and become  0 02 stocks that won t rebound in the next cycle higher  But not all stocks are that way some stocks are simply oversold  As John Templeton used to say  it s  maximum pessimism   In some of those cases of maximum pessimism  the stocks are going to turn around and be ten   twenty  or thirtybaggers  We are talking mining stocks for this interview  but the same market psychology applies to many sectors right now  from solar to coal to stocks in many countries in Europe  TGR  Because you were describing Castillian  what conditions are needed to improve the share price  DS  Castillian has used flow through to finance  Some of that money can be used to drill  There are three factors that are needed to help out its share price  Improved market conditions  A lot of financial issues can be solved just if the juniors begin to rally  Looking back to 2008 2009  there was a real V bottom in many juniors because the selling dissipated and most investors left  That set the stage for a turnaround  Overall market conditions are critical for individual companies to succeed Resource increase  If there is new drilling success  it will be reflected in the share price Secure financing  In the current market  it doesn t make sense to finance at  0 03 share or  0 05 share  because it s too dilutive  Castillian is under the  umbrella and may be able to tap into corporate resources that other juniors cannot The three conditions are related  especially with improved market conditions that could create a snowball effect  With improved market conditions  then the stock goes to  0 10 share  Financing becomes easier and the company can drill  And that creates a positive feedback loop  A lot of times  you just have to wait for the market to turn around to get things moving  TGR  When evaluating juniors  there are a lot of things that you could look at  but what are the three most important things that you must look at  DS  I have five  and I call them the Five P s  And I am paraphrasing from   I first saw him write about these back in the 1990s when I got involved in this industry  The five are  People  That is obvious because people do everything  You need solid management  people with a history of getting quality assets  making things work and hiring the right specialists Property  You need good geological properties  You don t want moose pasture in the middle of nowhere  you need something that can become viable and economic Politics  You want to be in a stable mining country  It could be somewhere in Canada  Nevada or Mexico  which is not a stable country in other ways but is a very solid mining jurisdiction  A lot of countries in South America  especially Chile  have become solid mining jurisdictions where maybe some places in the middle of Africa haven t Phinancing  You need the ability to raise money  It could even be directors with deep pockets to do a personal loan during a tough time Promotion  Although it sometimes gets a bad name  you need the ability to tell the story  Consider a tree that falls in the forest  If nobody tells the story  then you re done TGR  Your analysis includes considering the Five P s and looking for  maximum pessimism   Do you have other companies that fit that model  DS  Western Pacific Resources Corp   WRP TSX V  is one  It is an exploration company with a mine from Pegasus Gold Inc  in Idaho  The company has solid management  The property has excellent infrastructure and Idaho is a politically safe location  In terms of financing  Western Pacific has  2 million  M  in the bank  When it hit its low   0 10  0 11 share  it had a  3M market cap with  2M in the bank  You re getting everything else in the company thrown in for free  Even after it rebounded to  0 20 share  the market cap was still only  6M  I would call that stock an exploration company even though its flagship property is a past producer  Like many other stocks I watch  it will rise with the overall market  A typical recent pricing pattern for junior stocks would be to go from  0 80 share to  0 20 share in this weak overall market  But when this market turns around  many of those stocks will rise back into the  0 50 0 60 share range  That would be an example of the maximum pessimism trade  A similar pattern might fit to another stock I like  which is also under the Forbes   Manhattan group  That one is an iron ore project called Black Iron Inc   BKI TSX V   which is located in the Ukraine  This project will be a massive producer starting in Q4 15  However  at the moment  it is in the  quiet stage  prior to production as the mine and mill are being built  The stock has fallen with the rest of the market  At this point  Black Iron is a  45M market cap  with a potential 16 to 20 year mine life  The infrastructure and the properties are fantastic  TGR  You like gold  but iron ore is a very different commodity  Does it concern you to pursue a commodity like iron ore that is linked to a healthy economy and financial system  In some ways  isn t the iron trade the opposite of the gold trade  DS  One of my best performing deals was a company called Consolidated Thompson Iron Mines Ltd   CLM TSX   which I bought between  1 and  2 share  I sold around  10 share  It eventually got taken over for roughly  15 share  That was an iron ore deal  People tend to forget that something like Diamond Fields wasn t diamonds  it was nickel  You have to get back to your belief system in this situation  I like to consider the macro trends  the kind of the things that Jim Rogers talks about and I ve talked about in my book   The Great Super Cycle   where we are in an inflationary stage  The last year or two we haven t seen a huge move up in commodities  which are digesting huge gains from the last 10 years and especially from the 2008 lows through 2011  It s perfectly normal to see one   two  or three year consolidations on these macro moves higher  I believe we re in a re inflation cycle  Things we need  like energy  are going to go up in price  And things we want but don t need  like flat screen TVs and cell phones  are going to go down in price  Japan is now joining the money printing fray  and that should put more pressure for higher commodity prices  It s the old monetarist arguments by Milton Friedman too much money chasing too few goods is inflationary  You re going to continue to see all commodities increase because of that  I m a little more bullish on parts of the global economy in the short to intermediate term  Longer term  I feel as if the U S  is going to have a debt crisis  similar to what happened in the European countries  Most of the economic indicators in Europe  at least in the short term  are positive  Probably in H1 13 we should see a short  to intermediate term bottom in the Italian  Spanish  Portuguese and Greek economies  Markets may be already discounting that bottom  Interestingly  no one talks about the potential for those markets to recover  From a technical point of view  those markets are looking attractive as they build a base  TGR  That s your maximum pessimism trade applied to a set of countries  DS  The PIGS  Portugal  Italy  Greece and Spain  were the maximum pessimism trade for last year  and they have stabilized  Recent indicators out of China show that China is beginning to stabilize from its slowdown  Similar things appear to be happening in India  My thesis is that the rebound in Europe and China will drag U S  markets higher  That same macro analysis can be applied to make a bullish case for precious metals stocks  Recently  the chart of the HUI is not similar to the Standard   Poor s 500  The HUI is more similar to Italy  Spain or the emerging Asian markets  The gold stocks are behaving as risk on trades  as have these markets  If the emerging markets are showing signs of stabilizing and climbing  so will the gold and precious metals stocks  Another index to watch because of positive macros is the S P TSX Venture Composite Index  CDNX   which is building a great base  It has a range from  1 120 on the downside to  1 350 on the upside  It s right in the middle of that range now  The chart appears to be an example of a classic bottoming base  The big money printing that we saw in the U S  after the 2008 2009 financial crisis is detrimental in the long term  But in the short term  it does boost the economy and I think we are seeing that in Europe  That will stabilize the rest of the world in the short term  Long term  it will have inflationary consequences  I am a bit of a contrarian on Europe I m not as bearish as many  The simple reason is that the European countries are doing some excellent things to modernize the regional economies  In many parts of Europe the economies are 20 years behind Germany  Germany modernized after the fall of the Berlin Wall and went into a production based  efficiency based economy  It may not apply to all areas  but the Germans are opposing free market restrictions and want the Spanish and the Italians to do the same  Italy has a large industrial base  so it could probably pull it off  Spain is a little more of an unknown  With austerity  the Europeans are addressing some of the problems of bloated government  There is short term pain for long term gain  and that has been something that Americans have not been willing to address  We keep hearing this thing about the fiscal cliff  The fiscal cliff wasn t a one day event on Jan  1  2013  it s a permanent condition  At some point  we have to solve these trillion dollar deficits  Coming back to gold and precious metals  there is flight away from risk assets into bonds and the U S  dollar  If there is real growth in Europe  the next crisis could be a run on the dollar  All these crises have seen gold stocks fall with the market  but what we could see in the next crisis is the gold stocks rise while the S P flounders  Again  that s two to three years off  The next couple of years are the transition period  The U S  has really led in the last couple of years during this European crisis and Europe will now probably outperform  the dollar will weaken  and that s another positive factor for gold  TGR  Are there any other particular stocks that you watch that fit the maximum pessimism trade  DS  I think that what has happened in Newmont Mining Corp   NEM NYSE  and Barrick Gold Corp   ABX TSX  ABX NYSE  is interesting  It s similar to what happened in Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd   AEM TSX  AEM NYSE  in late 2011 when it essentially threw the baby out with the bath water  Agnico had bad earnings  it downgraded the resource on one of its mines and wrote off a bunch of assets  It downgraded future production  future profits  etc  Agnico has performed well since then  It bottomed at roughly  30 share and rallied to the mid  to high  50s  and it s about  50 share right now  If you look at Barrick and Newmont s Q4 12 earnings  they did the same thing wrote off assets  wrote off resources  wrote off future profits  Both of those companies had minor warnings last year  but what they decided to do is throw everything out  Now the expectations are very low  Both Newmont and Barrick trade at ridiculously low valuations  Barrick has a forward price earnings ratio of 6 or 7  which for the whole mining sector is unheard of  Newmont has a dividend linked to the price of gold  There are many reasons to like each of these companies  Now that expectations are so artificially low  which the companies themselves created  there is a solid base for stock performance in the future  Another producer I like is Eldorado Gold Corp   ELD TSX  EGO NYSE   Eldorado is in a similar position to where Yamana Gold Inc   YRI TSX  AUY NYSE  YAU LSE  was a few years ago when Yamana was expanding rapidly and issued stock to fund that expansion and mine building  Eventually  the production and profit show up in the bottom line  As a result of that well timed expansion  Yamana has held up much better than the rest of the mining sector  That is where Eldorado is right now  From a valuation perspective  those are my three top picks of the senior gold producers  TGR  In The Gold Report  in February 2011  when gold was at  1 355 ounce  oz   you said   I think that after the next rally we re going to see a significant pullback in gold probably in the 2012 2013 period  but that will just be a buying opportunity   So two years ago  it looks as if you pretty much nailed it  Do you have an update to that forecast or the next forecast to layer on top of that  DS  From a technical perspective  in mid 2011  we had a big spike in gold prices over  1 900 oz  We are now in the second longest consolidation of the gold bull market  The only one that was longer was the 2004 2005 consolidation  and that was longer by only a couple of months  Technically  a spike high followed by a sideways trading range that builds the base between  1 530 oz and  1 650 oz is a positive development  As the saying goes   The longer the base  the more the space   It could also be called a  coiled spring   The longer we trade sideways  the bigger the break out should be  I don t anticipate new lows  It appears that we are nearing the end of the base and  though I don t want to sound like an out and out goldbug  I believe the breakout will be huge when it happens  One driver of the breakout  which no one is really talking about  is what s going on in Japan  Japan has now decided to devalue and print for the first time in 20 years  It is going to print more money than the U S  and Europe combined  even though it is a much smaller economy  That third nation of money printing counting the Eurozone and the European Central Bank as one nation is going to be phenomenal for the price of gold  Now you just have to be patient  I don t know if this breakout is going to start in March  June  September or December  but I really think that 2013 will be the year that we will break out  If you re looking at a price target  I ll just use the easy price target of  2 000 oz by the end of the year  TGR  Fair enough  I hope your forecast for the next year works out  We look forward to checking in with you again  In 1998   started   a

120279,341794,AEM,Michael Fowler  New Strategy Adding Value To Junior Midtier Gold Miners,opinion,A lackluster U S  economy is creating a positive environment for gold  according to Michael Fowler  senior mining analyst with Loewen  Ondaatje  McCutcheon Ltd  By calculating ounces in the ground values and assessing risk  Fowler has concluded that the junior midtier sector offers the best growth potential  He expects to see companies of all sizes try to control costs instead of looking for mergers and acquisitions to add value  Read on in this Gold Report interview for Fowler s take on companies that he believes fit the bill  The Gold Report  Michael  in August you   2 000 ounce  oz  gold would push up equity prices in 2013  Are you still of that mindset  Michael Fowler  Yes  although it has taken longer than I expected  The U S  dollar price of gold was up 6 2  in 2012  but the real increases in the gold price took place in other currencies  For example  in 2012 gold was up about 15  in the euro  The strengthening U S  economy has been a headwind to gold  I remain bullish on gold and am keeping my  2 000 oz average for 2013  TGR  A  1 675 oz gold price would require an increase of almost 20  to reach  2 000 oz  Will it require a downturn in the U S  economy to accomplish that  MF  To some degree  I hope the U S  economy will not speed up because that would be a major risk to my analysis  The U S  economy is relatively lackluster  We think the Fed will continue with quantitative easing and increasing the money supply  Interest rates will continue to be low  All of that creates a very positive environment for gold  The risk factor here is that if the U S  economy does speed up and outperforms expectations  it will create a renewed headwind for gold  However  that is not my scenario right now  I think the U S  economy will move along at 1 2  growth rate per annum  basically static  I expect more quantitative easing around the world will cause gold to rise  Japan  for example  is intent on devaluing its currency  In Washington  D C   the recurring debt ceiling debate may be a potential flashpoint  Potential downgrades by the rating agencies and the Federal Reserve continuing to buy up bonds are other factors  TGR  Tom Albanese  CEO of Rio Tinto Plc  RIO NYSE  RIO ASX  RIO LSE  RTPPF OTCPK   was sacked in mid January due to a  14 billion  B  write down on assets  mostly owing to overpaying and takeovers  Similar firings have happened in the gold space  Do these dismissals signal a changing mindset toward merger and acquisition  M A  activity among the largest players  MF  Yes  I think so  I am not predicting numerous M As  although I would suggest that this is a good time to acquire  The CEOs you mentioned made acquisitions at the top of the market  Major strategic mergers are  in my opinion  value destructing  I do not think we will see another Rio Tinto Alcan merger or takeover in this environment  I think we will see a lot of smaller transactions happen  such as what occurred with Alamos Gold Inc   AGI TO  and Aurizon Mines Ltd   ARZ TSX  AZK NYSE MKT  M A activity will be lower this year  TGR  You cover Aurizon and know its assets well  What do you think of the Alamos offer  is it fair value  MF  No  I do not think it is fair value  I also am surprised at the move by Alamos because there are no synergies here  Alamos  assets are in Mexico and Turkey  The company has nothing in Canada  so there are no synergies with Aurizon  whose mines and projects are in Qu bec  I think Aurizon would provide a better fit and more synergy with a company like Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd   AEM TSX  AEM NYSE    IAMGOLD Corp   IMG TSX  IAG NYSE  or even Osisko Mining Corp   OSK TSX   As far as valuation  over the last three years Aurizon s stock has traded mostly over  4 65 share  Alamos  bid is too low  Alamos will have to bid over  5 share  Before the offer was made  my target price on Aurizon was  5 90 share  Having said that  kudos to Alamos for picking a time when Aurizon is fairly weak in terms of its production in Q4 12  spilling over into Q1 13  TGR  So Alamos has vastly underbid  MF  Yes  it is a good premium  but not enough  I am pretty sure the Aurizon board will try to defend as much as it can  TGR  Does Aurizon have a poison pill in its governance bylaws  MF  Yes  it has just enacted one  I expect Aurizon will entertain white knights  such as Agnico Eagle or IAMGOLD  TGR  Alamos obviously sees value in the small cap gold producer space  Is that where you see the most value among the gold equities  MF  That is where we agree  Alamos picked Aurizon because it is producing good cash flow  has  200 million on the balance sheet and no debt  The junior midtier environment is the sweet spot for me  TGR  Does that not come with a fair amount of risk  MF  Yes  indeed  Aurizon  for example  has operational risk in its Casa Berardi mine  which is not an easy mine to work  Alamos which is really a junior midtier producer has risk at its Mulatos mine in Mexico  Having said that  the upside potential in these companies far exceeds that of a big company such as Barrick Gold Corp   ABX TSX  ABX NYSE  or Newmont Mining Corp  NEM NYSE   which do not have any growth potential  The junior midtier sector offers growth  and that is why you have a higher degree of risk  It is up to the analyst to assess the risk and the growth potential  This is where I see the major price increases coming  TGR  Some experts in the gold space are floating the idea that some major gold producers may change their model to something closer to an exchange traded fund  ETF   They would sell a portion of their produced gold and hold the remainder  What do you think of that as a business model  MF  I have not heard that  but there is a precedent  At one time  Goldcorp Inc   G TSX  GG NYSE  held a lot of gold on its balance sheet  As the gold price went up  so did the value of the company  essentially like an ETF  I like the idea of holding gold on the balance sheet because it shows that the company actually believes in its own commodity  However  I do not think the market would view a company like Barrick  for example  as an ETF  These companies have to find a way to be more judicious with their capital and to focus more on return on investment rather than go down the ETF route  If they are not growing  they could increase their dividends to the 4  range  That would be of interest to investors  Quite frankly  I am more interested in companies that grow their reserves and resources  their earnings and cash flow  TGR  With gold equity prices slumping badly  have you had to adjust your price to ounces in the ground valuations or make other changes to your model to reflect what is happening in the market  MF  The valuations are all over the place and they are cyclical  In 2009  the value per ounce in the ground values went for about  20 oz average  In 2010  they went to  90 oz and are now at about  40 oz  It looks as if the cycle now is one to two years  and we are on one of the lows  But as an analyst you have to look at what that value might be in a one to two year horizon  Therefore  I do not adjust my models for swings in sentiment  Although we are on a low valuation right now  good valuations are out there  We are using a range of  50 70 oz for target prices on small companies  TGR  In a February 2011 research report you rated Clifton Star Resources Inc   CFO TSX V  C3T FSE  a spec buy at  11 share  Your target price is now  5 96 share  That is a dramatic shift in two years  Is that representative of how things have changed in 24 months  MF  We had a feeling that Clifton Star s resource was going to be a lot bigger than it turned out to be  In 2009  Osisko Mining was involved and the thinking was that the deposit would resemble the Malartic deposit in Qu bec  a 10 million ounce plus  Moz  bulk tonnage deposit  While Clifton Star has a very good deposit  it is more specific and focused  probably in the region of 4 5 Moz  There also is some risk aversion built into the target price due in part to the global debt problems  TGR  Clifton Star recently tabled a preliminary economic assessment  PEA  on its Duparquet deposit in Qu bec  It has an internal rate of return of 15 5   Does that seem low to you  MF  It is a good number  The PEA was done fairly conservatively  A lot of drilling backs up that data  A 15  after tax return on something with a high degree of confidence  in a good jurisdiction like Qu bec  is a good number  I would say that anything above 10  in Qu bec is a good number  TGR  Did anything in the PEA surprise you  MF  Not really  The resource was close to 4 Moz gold and Clifton Star will recover only about 1 7 Moz  so there is a slight difference there  Some of the ounces included in the resource are in the town of Duparquet  under a golf course  Those were not included in the PEA  which in my mind is fairly conservative for a scoping study or a PEA  TGR  Which other companies that you follow offer what might be considered unprecedented value per ounce in the ground right now  MF  We just put a report out on St Andrew Goldfields Ltd   SAS TSX   a junior producer with mines in Ontario  Canada  Up until 2007  it had a terrible history  which it has now turned around  The company is producing free cash flow  has rising earnings and a good looking future  It has good value because of its legacy and upside potential  TGR  What is St Andrews  production  MF  It is producing 95 000 oz  with total cash costs just a tad over  900 oz  including royalties  TGR  That seems on the high side  What is St Andrews doing to control costs  MF  There are two elements to those costs  One is high royalties  The company cannot do much about that  The other element is the cost of operations  and it can do something about mining more efficiently  St Andrews is mining better and the costs are going down by increasing throughput in the Holt mine  If you took away the royalties  St Andrews is probably mining close to the world average cash cost  You are right  it is a high cost producer  But  along with the high costs  you get a very attractive share valuation  St Andrews is cheap  TGR  When can investors expect St Andrews to increase production  MF  We see increased production in 2014  when the Taylor deposit comes fully onstream  TGR  Has management thought about buying out those royalties or will the company just have to live with that headache  MF  Management may talk bravely about trying to buy them back  but I doubt Franco Nevada Corp   FNV TSX  FNV NYSE  will sell them  TGR  And what is your target price on St Andrews  MF  It is  1 06 share  TGR  Can you give us another name that offers good value per ounce in the ground  MF  Brigus Gold Corp   BRD NYSE MKT  BRD TSX  is in a turnaround situation  I would not be surprised to see Brigus and St Andrews combine in some way  They are right next door to each other and both are turning themselves around  A combination would be a good idea  TGR  Brigus just quadrupled the resource on its Grey Fox property  MF  Correct  and Grey Fox is right next door to St Andrews  which has been finding similar types of resources on its side of the border  TGR  Having a resource that goes under a border can complicate things  MF  Both companies have to mine it somehow  To mine it separately is a bit more difficult  If they mine it together  they can use economies of scale to greater advantage  We have also reported on   which also is right next door to St Andrews  The whole Timmins area is an intriguing consolidation play  TGR  What other companies would you like to discuss  MF   has a porphyry deposit in the Yukon  a large bulk tonnage gold copper deposit  There are two main deposits  the Revenue deposit and the Nucleus deposit  with a higher grade core  TGR  The resource is smaller  but the grade is higher  which is actually more important  MF  Exactly  It is more economic  which is exciting  Western Copper and Gold Corp  s  WRN TSX  WRN NYSE MKT  project is 70 kilometers from Northern Freegold s  I mention that because Western Copper recently released a very positive feasibility study  Its deposit is geologically similar to Northern Freegold s  Western Copper came out with more than  1B in net present value  Northern Freegold has better logistics than Western Copper  In fact  Western Copper has to use and extend Northern Freegold s road to its property  Northern Freegold has greater access to a power line than Western Copper  I point that out because Western Copper s market price has gone from  0 60 to  1 60 share because of the feasibility report  Northern Freegold should not be forgotten  TGR  The Nucleus deposit has a potentially higher grade starter pit of about 850 000 oz  Does that increase the odds that the deposit will be developed  MF  Indeed  It usually takes a huge amount of capital to get these big bulk tonnage deposits into production  If you have a starter pit  you can do a phased approach  You can put in less capital up front  get your money back and then expand your pit  This is what Western Copper is facing  Its capital costs are about  2B  Northern Freegold should have to spend a lot less  and if management chooses a phased approach  the company will recoup its money a lot faster  TGR  And  in its copper gold deposit  Northern Freegold also has molybdenum and silver  MF  Correct  Of the two deposits which may actually be connected the Nucleus deposit is gold copper and the Revenue deposit is copper gold moly silver  TGR  What is your target price on Northern Freegold  MF  It is  1 44 share as a Speculative Buy  TGR  Do you have one other name  MF  International Northair Mines Ltd   INM TSX V  is a very interesting silver play in Mexico  This is an open pit situation  The deposit is in the region of 70 Moz  although the company has not yet issued an NI 43 101 report  That is expected at the end of Q1 13  The stock is trading for  0 29 share and I am looking for  1 share on it  Fortune Minerals Ltd   FT TSX  has two deposits  one is metallurgical coal  the other is a cobalt bismuth gold copper deposit  Both have feasibility studies that  combined  show well over  5 share of value  The stock trades for  0 53 share  I have a target of  2 65 share on it  The catalyst here is that POSCO  PKX NYSE   the big Korean steel company  is already a partner and the company is looking for other partners to build the mines  TGR  Michael  can you give our readers a reason or two to stay positive about the gold market  MF  All is not lost in the gold sector  First of all  the gold sector is cyclical  We have been on a down cycle for about 20 months  Although that has been pretty depressing  history shows us that 20 months is about as long as a typical down cycle lasts  Second  institutions and money managers have been selling their gold juniors  Typically  when the institutions are long juniors  it is time to head for the hills or sell them and vice versa  They tend to be contrary indicators at extremes  Institutions are overly negative on juniors right now  So now I would not head for the hills  I would accumulate  Valuations are cheap  I expect the mid junior midtier producers to be the first to move  followed by some of the junior explorers  Quite frankly  the negativity floating around now sets us up for a very good  positive environment going forward  TGR  Michael  thank you for your time and your insights    senior mining analyst with

120281,341796,AEM,Killian Charles  Gold Breaking Points How Low Can They Go ,opinion,Killian Charles  an analyst with Industrial Alliance in Montreal  isn t too concerned if the gold price hits  1 300 an ounce or even  1 000  He s more concerned with the gold breaking point  How low can the gold price go without breaking a project  Investors will be surprised to know that a wealth of junior miners are lean and mean enough to survive a pint sized gold price  Charles talks with The Gold Report about which companies have resized and redesigned their projects to make it in this unforgiving market  The Gold Report  Killian  what are the main causes of the disconnect between commodity prices and the share prices of mining companies  Killian Charles  It s the fundamental difference between the commodity itself and mining companies  There s an unspoken belief that  when you invest in a junior mining company  you re essentially buying a portion of the deposit  Investors are looking to diversify by having gold as a commodity in their portfolios and they look to gold junior companies  Yet the exit strategy from those gold junior companies results in cash  so they re left tangibly playing the gold space  but not having what initially brought them in  That is why a lot of companies are considering gold dividends  At least that way investors playing the gold space are actually being paid in the commodity that interested them at the start  TGR  Do you think that s going to gain traction  KC  The smaller producers are having a lot of difficulty getting good traction in this market  A lot of them are going to explore some of these alternative routes  Just as we ve had alternative routes for financing  we re going to start seeing alternative routes to increase shareholder value  TGR  The fall in precious metal values has shaken a lot of investors  What is Industrial Alliance s forecast for gold  KC  We are less worried about noise surrounding the price of gold  We re focused on the breaking point of the projects we cover  Even if the gold price may be  1 300 ounce   1 300 oz  at the end of the year  we are more concerned if the project may survive at  900 oz  The gold price is important to companies that have producing assets  however  Into 2014 and out to 2020  we typically take a conservative approach and go well below  1 300 oz  Beyond 2020  we forecast roughly  1 100 oz because a lot of companies should not be getting excessive value for production that is too far down the pipeline  TGR  What would you be doing to gain traction in this market if you were in the shoes of a junior precious metals company  KC  Instead of showing how well a project works at  2 000 oz  I would show the market how well a project works in any environment  All gold projects have decent leverage to higher gold prices  What s more important is showing that there is a smaller sensitivity to the downside  showing how they can still stay relevant on a downturn  Quite a few companies out there would survive and make money in almost any scenario  TGR  Many of the companies you cover are working on mining projects in the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Qu bec  Is the safety of those jurisdictions a considerable factor  KC   Yes  you can t split it any other way  When people here think about royalties  they re haggling at the details  By and large  there s never really going to be any threat of nationalization  There are no military coups happening in the U S   Canada  U K   Sweden or Norway  etc  I find that is very important because work will keep going and I do not have to be afraid that an election might change that suddenly  I can plan for royalties and taxes  I cannot plan for a government getting kicked out of a country and losing my property  TGR  Some industry insiders are saying that only the better projects will get financed in the current tight market  How do you define  better  projects  KC  For us  better projects are those that are difficult to kill off  We are big believers in finding the project s  gold internal rate of return   What gold price gives us a net present value  NPV  of zero  We try to find that gold price breaking point for different projects  The lower the gold price breaking point  the more interested we are in the project  and the stronger we feel a project could be  This allows us to have an agnostic approach to what a better project may be  We find that projects with slightly lower capital expenditures but offset by higher operating expenditures end up being stronger and that s not very surprising  It s much more important to get the mine into production through almost any means necessary  Even though it might be a little smaller and might not immediately benefit from economy of scale  expansion could come at a later point  Projects that may not be initially strong could  through a simple redesign  turn out much healthier in this market simply because they scale everything down to a scope that is manageable  TGR  Some development stage gold and silver projects are getting financing by forward selling a portion of their production to banks or royalty companies  while others have arranged credit facilities backed by board members  Some even manage equity financings despite record low share prices  What s your preference among those options  KC  I d rather see a company do a royalty or gold streaming when it is in a position of power  but that s rarely the case  At the end of the day  I find that most 3 5  royalties don t affect the final NPV greatly and still provide an injection of much needed cash  We ve seen some companies manage to do equity financings  A lot of companies that our group previously approached to do a financing initially told us they were waiting for better times  As an example  company A s stock was trading at  1 share and went down to  0 50 share  Instead of thinking about the present  it is stuck looking in the rearview mirror at the  1 share  Sure enough  a few months go by and now the company is really hurting for cash  Its share price is possibly even lower and now it has no choice but to raise cash  Importantly  the market opportunity that presented itself previously may not be there anymore  Convertible debt never really works out  These companies have no real way of servicing the debt so it almost always ends up being converted into shares down the road or renegotiated repeatedly to push back the payment schedule  TGR  The great thing about royalty streaming is that royalty companies have such efficient and effective people vetting those projects  If a royalty company is willing to give a junior money up front  you know that it s going to go into production and generate cash flow  KC  That is very true  A lot of streaming or royalty companies do more due diligence than large funds that might take a large position in an equity raise  TGR  Some Qu bec based mining companies can draw on Qu bec government owned funds and the expertise of SOQUEM  the province s mining and exploration company  How much of an advantage is that in today s finance market for junior mining companies  KC  SOQUEM is more of an advantage in a bull market  It operates as a government owned project generating company that will flip or joint venture early stage projects out to other companies  It does help  What s much more interesting is the Qu bec government owned funds  They move a lot slower  but what I find interesting with these funds is that there s no secret game being played  there are no backhanded maneuvers  Once they believe in your asset  they ll be stable  They re not going to try to short run your stock before an issue  That said  if your share price is stuck middling in the  0 10 range  they re not going to help you drive it up to  0 30 share either  TGR  Have any of the companies that you cover taken advantage of those funds or do any of those funds own a position in any of the companies you cover  KC  Nearly every company that runs through Qu bec will have some interaction with them  Metanor Resources Inc   MTO TSX V  is a good example  it relied on Investissement Qu bec to provide some necessary financing  TGR  Sandstorm Gold Ltd   SSL TSX  has agreed to purchase about 20  of gold produced from Metanor s Bachelor Lake mine  which is now up and running  Is everything going as planned at Bachelor Lake  KC  I think so  but I m still waiting to see last quarter s numbers  Metanor did have issues last year advancing the underground development as fast as it wanted to  It simply didn t have enough miners  Next quarter will be key to it demonstrating to the market that it s not just another company promising to produce thousands of ounces per year and is one that actually produces  TGR  What is the production guidance for 2013  KC  It hasn t put out any large guidance number yet  It should be able to hit anywhere from 30 000 40 000 oz  30 40 Koz  if everything moves along nicely  TGR  What s your rating on Metanor  KC  I have a Speculative Buy and a  1 target  It s at about  0 13 share  However  I m waiting to see quarterly numbers so that I can revalue it  TGR  I d like to hear about some other interesting companies that you have under coverage  KC  I m a fan of Moneta Porcupine Mines Inc   ME TSX V   The company s asset is about 100 kilometers east of the town of Timmins  Ontario  We re going to see some projects that are in a more agreeable location come in favor  Moneta Porcupine has  by and large  that potential  The project is right along the highway  It has power  There are mines nearby  including Brigus Gold Corp  s  BRD NYSE MKT  BRD TSX   Moneta has a sizeable resource of about 4 million ounces  4 Moz  of Indicated and Inferred  It put out a very positive preliminary economic assessment  PEA  late last year  The company s story is changing  It used to be a simple open pit and now it wants to look into an underground component  There s a lot of work being done  Moneta recently hired some personnel from Detour Gold Corp   DGC TSX   It will be interesting to see if Moneta is able to leverage its experience to expand the bulk target tonnage and develop the asset  TGR  Gold Canyon Resources Inc   GCU TSX V  has a similarly sized resource  KC  There s a difference between the companies  however  Gold Canyon is a little more remote  It s able to leverage a high grade core that should allow it to be one of the richest open pits in Canada  considering the tonnage it wants to move  Some of the grade has gone down slightly in subsequent resource estimates  but a high grade core still accounts for almost 1 5 Moz of the resource  At 200 300 Koz production per year  for five to eight years of production  at anywhere from 1 5 2 gram ton material for Canada  that s stellar  There s really nothing that compares to it in Canada  The problem with Gold Canyon s asset is that a lake overlaps part of the resource  It may delay permitting  but shouldn t choke or kill the project  Similarly  there are metallurgical issues that Gold Canyon is working through  management has alluded that there might be controlled lithological issues  but we re still waiting for confirmation  TGR  Less than a year ago  this stock was trading at around  4 share  Now it s trading at about  0 33 share  Is it strictly the lake issue that s been the drag on the share price  KC  I would be surprised if it were the lake because the lake issue has been known since the late 1980s  Investors moved into the story for that high grade  When the global resource grade decreased last year  a lot of people thought that it wasn t going to be able to leverage high grade material  What happened was that Gold Canyon added new regions that were lower grade  but the original portions with high grade shoots and bulk tonnage material haven t disappeared  That s getting muddled and lost in this story  TGR  Gold Canyon recently released its PEA  What did you take away from that  KC  I was actually surprised that the capital costs were below what I had expected  especially on removing and dewatering part of this lake  I was pleased to see that  The PEA again highlights the advantage of the high grade potential over the first few years  That s how this story should be repackaged  if the grades in the higher grade portion remain constant  then it could be looking at a payback ratio that s substantially lower than its peers  TGR  The management team has a number of people who have been with companies that have been taken over  Director Richard Hall was with Grayd Resource Corp  when Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd   AEM TSX  AEM NYSE  acquired it  CEO Troy Fierro was also with Grayd and FronteerGold Inc   which was acquired by Newmont Mining Corp   NEM NYSE   Chairman Conrad Pinette was with Northgate Minerals when it was acquired by AuRico Gold Inc   AUQ TSX  AUQ NYSE   Does that increase the likelihood of it happening again  KC  It s a hard thing to predict  These executives have a good idea of what is attractive to larger gold companies out there  They definitely want to have their project acquired  However  whether they can do it is impossible to tell  TGR  What other companies have captured your attention  KC  I find Integra Gold Corp   ICG TSX V  to be pretty interesting  Integra is at an earlier stage than the other two  but it s an interesting story  Its project used to be part of the Sigma and Lamaque mines  which essentially created Val d Or  Quebec  There s never been any real work done on the Integra property  which is just to the south of Val d Or  It s one of these interesting assets where you don t actually have to demonstrate a large resource to demonstrate that it works  It s continuous and geologically well understood  Integra s situation comes back to talking about the gold breaking point  I feel an asset that s in a good location like that  with the grades that it has been putting out  would have a very low gold breaking point  Even though it wouldn t be mining 400 Koz per annum  costs would remain attractive in any gold mining scenario  TGR  SOQUEM has a drill core database that certainly would have an immense amount of information available from previous operators on the Lamaque property  Do you know if Integra has tapped into that database to learn more about the deposit  KC  Integra was able to access a wealth of information from various databases  In fact  most of the geological staff on this project has previously worked at Sigma or Lamaque  Not only does the staff have access to drill hole data  but on certain portions  there are drifts that intersect some of its targets at various depth  It s a question of going back and plugging in the holes between these drifts to demonstrate continuity  It s an easy way for the company to leverage this wealth of information and be able to pronounce rather sizeable results for a fraction of the cost of almost any other project out there  TGR  Companies are not allowed to use any old drill core in NI 43 101 resource estimates  correct  KC  They can t directly  but it gives them a lot of smoke to go chasing after  Clifton Star Resources Inc   CFO TSX V  C3T FSE  ties right back in to that  too  The company has an old asset that s been looked at a number of times  The previous management team didn t do too much  it just kept it going  At a certain point  it may have overpromised and was halted by the British Securities Exchange Commission  Now  there s a whole new team that is serious about the project  In a span of 12 18 months  the new team has been able to complete a new resource  put out a PEA and advance toward a prefeasibility study  This group can properly bring the project closer to fruition  Clifton s project is very similar to Aurizon Mines Ltd  s  ARZ TSX  AZK NYSE MKT  Joanna project  except Clifton s project benefits from having a higher grade and lower strip ratio  Clifton s project is close to a community but the current mine plan doesn t require anyone to move  TGR  Clifton will produce a gold concentrate at its Duparquet project in Qu bec  That could be a game changer for that project  But first we have to determine if there s a smelter that s willing to take the gold concentrate  Does that exist  KC  That s my No  1 question right now  It s not going to be easy  Clifton will have to market its final product around  A smelter might say   You know  The gold content is very  very high  but the arsenic content you re going to have to pay a penalty for it   Clifton Star is currently in the stages of taking a bulk sample and it s going to produce a product that it hopes to market to different smelters across the world  TGR  Do you have any parting thoughts for us today  Killian  KC  I think that investors are over worried about the gold market  Projects are still coming true and companies are still working on interesting things  There is a lot of nervousness out there  but I m still pleased to see that companies are rethinking and reimagining developing assets  It s going to make strong projects  To be sure  companies are going to die  but it s going to make a fair amount of projects and companies much more robust  If the market does turn  these projects are going to have a very good chance of being the next group of lower midtier gold producing companies  TGR  Thanks  Killian   joined Industrial Alliance Securities Inc  in February 2011 and covers small  and mid cap exploration and producing companies  He

120284,341799,AEM,Gold s Plunge Ultimately Healthy For The Sector  Michael Gray,opinion,Market volatility sets the stage for price upswings as well as dips  according to Michael Gray  equities analyst of Macquarie Capital Markets  and the recent gold price drop should be seen as a  pause  in the bull market  Management teams are pausing as well  to focus on earnings and shareholder return rather than growth  In this interview with The Gold Report  Gray says this is the time to buy the best companies you can while they are discounted to fire sale prices  and he offers several names in jurisdictions from South and North America in the junior explorer space  The Gold Report  On April 15  gold dropped to a two year low as panic selling set in across many mined commodities  Was this the larger players showing the retail market who is in control or was it inevitable  Michael Gray  Several firms have been predicting a mid cycle correction for gold  it just happened faster and with more volatility than expected  It also seems to be a very well timed short selling trade  especially on the back of the positive gold price correlation with quantitative easing  QE  breaking down and reversing post QE3  In addition  there was no response in the gold price to the debt crisis in Cyprus or political concerns with North Korea  This was an opportunistic time for the shorts to come in  and they did  forcefully  TGR  Does this indicate that investors prefer equities to gold  MG  Not necessarily  The gold equities have moved sharply down and most are now pricing gold at an implied gold price of  1 000 1 200 ounce   1 000 1 200 oz  or less  There is some fear that the gold bull run is over  which explains why many institutional investors have been abandoning their gold equity positions  TGR  Gold equities fell in lockstep with the fall in the gold price  Why  MG  Gold equities have had an inverse correlation of share price  net asset value  P NAV  versus the gold price since late 2009  Historically the senior gold equities have traded  1 2x P NAV  Now we are looking at an average of 0 65x P NAV among our senior gold producers  Essentially  investors are pricing in a much lower gold price on the forward curve  As the gold price goes down  we believe investors will expect that the future gold price will drop as well  That is why the equities are trading in lockstep with the decline and have a much weaker response on the upside  TGR  Has the drop in precious metals prices fundamentally changed the market  MG  We have not seen this magnitude of volatility in this bull market up until now  It sets the stage for other big moves and for a more volatile market  perhaps including price upswings of similar magnitude  We think this volatility is ultimately good for the bull market  TGR  Will it result in less gold being produced  MG  The deferral of major capital projects and the number of projects that will be shelved because they cannot stand up to the stress test of a  1 200 oz gold price will limit growth among the senior companies  As that happens  we expect significantly less growth in the gold sector over the next five years if prices continue to lag or go sideways  TGR  A JPMorgan Chase report dated April 16 said 10 years remain in the commodity supercycle and that the April 15 price drop was only a pause in the overall cycle  Do you agree  and what positives do you see as a result of the price drop  MG  In general  we concur that this is a pause in the supercycle for metals in general  including base and bulk metals  China s growth being lower than expected shocked the market  at least in the short term  The positives are that management teams are now less focused on growth and more focused on earnings and returns to shareholders this could instill more investor confidence  It will take a few years  but having CEOs whose interests are more aligned with shareholders will impose more discipline among the producers  TGR  In early April  Barrick Gold Corp   ABX TSX  ABX NYSE  once again delayed development of its Pascua Lama gold project in Chile  What are the likely ripple effects for Barrick and the sector  MG  This is one of those situations where a company believed it had earned its social license after a long dialogue with the government and various nongovernmental organizations  NGOs   Barrick likely felt it was crossing the finish line  Barrick is not alone in this situation  For the gold sector it means management teams will have to look at large capital expense  capex  projects through a lens that captures extreme capex creep risk  in the case of Pascua Lama from less than  3 billion   3B  to north of  8B  Going forward  project scale and social license risk will be key issues only the best projects will be built  TGR  Is Chile still on your list of preferred mining jurisdictions  MG  It was until recently  Canada  Mexico and the U S  are at the top  Recent developments in Chile and elsewhere in South America with community relations and NGO protests are cause for concern  TGR  If Mexico  Canada and the U S  are your top jurisdictions  what is the next tier  MG  The next tier would include Chile  Peru and Turkey  In particular  Turkey is embracing foreign investment  has attracted a significant amount of capital and has a successful track record of mines being permitted and put into production  In South America  Brazil can be also be an attractive jurisdiction  depending on the state  In Central America  we like Nicaragua  where we cover B2Gold Corp   BTO TSX  BGLPF OTCQX   Nicaragua has been very politically stable in the past decade and is one of the few countries in Central America that has a stable mining policy and royalty regime  In Africa  Namibia  Tanzania and Botswana would lead our list  TGR  Let s look at management teams  Cash is king for junior mining equities right now  yet some junior mining executives are collecting big cash salaries  Some shareholders think the C suite is overcompensated  What do you consider a reasonable salary for a junior mining CEO  MG  Management compensation has been a blind spot for investors in the exploration sector during this bull market  given that many management teams have created tremendous value for shareholders  The compensation matrices among peer groups have been driven by market capitalization  The more you could grow your company  the more you could convince your compensation committee to pay you  The problem is that juniors with undeveloped resources trading at  1B market caps in 2011 paid dearly to attract talent or retain talent  Their base salaries in some cases exceeded  400 000   400K  plus similar size annual cash bonuses  Now those same companies have market caps of  200 300 million   200 300M   yet the compensation levels have not changed  The G A burn rate related to these salaries is significant  To evaluate compensation  we look at where the company is in the exploration cycle and how much skin management has in the game  The  80 150K year salary range has the right ring for a very early stage explorer with no assets of retained value  Companies that have more advanced assets probably need to pay in the  200 250K range  plus bonus  TGR  How do people find out that information  MG  It is all disclosed in the annual financial statements and in the Management Information Circular on   System for Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval   TGR  A story in Canada s National Post reported that CEOs and company presidents are more often fired in good times than in tough times because expectations are higher  Does that apply in mining  MG  That comes back to investors focusing on returns and punishing the senior mining companies for poor leadership  including overpaying to acquire assets and the inability to control operating and capital costs  In the gold space  three CEOs have been fired in relatively good times for focusing too much on growth  The trend is now toward CEOs trying to focus on earnings  provide realistic guidance and  if possible  pay a dividend  Those are the leaders who will keep their jobs  TGR  A recent Macquarie research report said   The producers will rapidly pursue M A of new  grade A discoveries  if they emerge but are unlikely to pursue the large  capex intensive B  and C quality discoveries  In the meantime  the price will get lower and favor the producers that are patient and seeking smaller  strategic tuck in acquisitions   What is a tuck in acquisition  MG  I would like to start by making it clear that  rapidly pursuing  grade A discoveries   means that if a junior has found another Kupol or Eleonore deposit  the type of precious metal high grade high margin deposits coveted by the seniors  it will garner a tremendous amount of attention and probably attract a takeover bid before a resource is defined  This is what happened with Virginia Gold Mines  Eleonore discovery  which is being developed by Goldcorp Inc   G TSX  GG NYSE  in Qu bec and for which Virginia Mines Inc   VGQ TSX  holds a royalty  That is what I mean by a rapid move on what are clearly high grade high margin assets because they are so rare right now  TGR  And now  what is a tuck in acquisition  MG  A tuck in acquisition is one that the market views as a relatively small deal  say  under  500M  It either fills a gap in the producer s pipeline down the line  or is strategic in consolidating a district in which the producer is already active  TGR  If Kupol and Eleonore were grade A discoveries  what are examples of tuck in acquisitions  Would it be something like Grayd Resource Corp   GYD TSX V  and Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd   AEM TSX  AEM NYSE   MG  Yes  Grayd with Agnico in Mexico would qualify as a tuck in acquisition  We would consider Goldcorp s purchase of Gold Eagle Mines Ltd  in the Red Lake Camp a tuck in or bolt on  albeit with a larger market cap  Extorre Gold Mines Ltd  s acquisition by Yamana Gold Inc   YRI TSX  AUY NYSE  YAU LSE  was a relatively small acquisition but meaningful to Yamana s growth pipeline  TGR  Are other juniors developing candidates for tuck in acquisitions  MG  In our coverage list  we have published our views on MAG Silver Corp   MAG TSX  MVG NYSE  as a prime example for potential of consolidation of the 44  joint venture interest it has with Fresnillo Plc  FRES LSE  in the world class Fresnillo Silver Trend  It is a high grade  high margin asset that we think Fresnillo would like to control  It would also help meet Fresnillo s goal for production of at least 65 million ounces  65 Moz  by 2018  TGR  How close is MAG Silver s Juanicipio to Fresnillo s operations  MG  It is within 1 kilometer of the mill and infrastructure  right in the heart of the Fresnillo district  In our view  as published in our research  it has great synergies with Fresnillo s existing operations   TGR  Would Fresnillo buy just Juanicipio or buy MAG Silver outright  MG  Fresnillo owns a 17  interest in MAG Silver  Given the fairly significant discovery MAG Silver has made on an asset called Cinco de Mayo  we would expect that Fresnillo would want that as well  TGR  Regardless of a takeover bid  is MAG Silver poised to perform in 2013 even with lower silver prices  MG  The company will break ground in the next month or two for the decline at Juanicipio  But the real sizzle for MAG Silver is getting back to exploration drilling at Cinco de Mayo  probably in H2 13  Cinco de Mayo is a huge carbonate replacement deposit  CRD   a silver zinc lead deposit with an early resource estimate just over 50 Moz silver  It has a large footprint and an outstanding intersection at depth outside of the resource of 61 6 meters at 89 grams tonne  89 g t  silver  7 4  zinc  2 1  lead and 0 78 g t gold  This is one of the best discoveries in Mexico in the cycle  Although early stage and the exploration to depth needs a lot of infill drilling  the anatomy of the system discovered so far suggests it could be very large  TGR  Does MAG Silver have the disciplined management team you like to see  MG  Yes  the team performs its discovery role exceptionally well  To make two major discoveries over the past decade is impressive in itself  but it is also very disciplined  It maintained a very efficient capital structure  with fewer than 60M shares issued and outstanding  It has discovered best of breed assets with what we would consider best of breed talent  TGR  Which other juniors are developing possible tuck in acquisitions  MG  In that category  we like Midas Gold Corp   MAX TSX   The company s Golden Meadows project in Idaho has more than 7 Moz gold in resources and a significant antimony credit  The company has issued a preliminary economic assessment  PEA  on the project  It is only trading with a market capitalization of  100M or so  This would be an excellent tuck in acquisition for producers looking for a  400 000 oz year production profile  starting in 2018 or 2019  We see Midas  Golden Meadows project as a Donlin Creek type of setting  and published our belief that the potential endowment could ultimately exceed 20 Moz gold  Thus  in our view it is potentially a Tier 1 asset that already has 7 Moz documented  in a historic mining district  making it a brownfield site  The company is heavily discounted in value right now  TGR  What progress has Midas made since you started covering it 18 months ago  MG  The company has executed well the mandate to infill and expand the near pit resources and establish resources that could be put into a PEA and eventually into a preliminary feasibility study  It has also conducted a lot of pragmatic consulting with the community and the NGOs  Stephen Quin  Midas  CEO  has the perfect skill set for permitting and advancing the economics of this project given his past experience with similar projects  The overhang is the perception that it will be tough to permit in Idaho and that production is a long way out in 2018  As a result  the stock has lagged over the last 12 months  TGR  How much does the antimony credit play in the project economics  MG  At the front end  the antimony credit is fairly important  I believe about 80  of the antimony currently documented will be produced in the first four years  This allows Midas to achieve gold equivalent grades that exceed 2 4 g t  whereas the average grade in the first pit to be mined is closer to 2 0 g t for the gold only  Therefore  the antimony credit is fairly important  During World War II  Golden Meadows was mined for antimony needed to harden shell casings  Now antimony is used mainly as a fire retardant  About a year ago  antimony led the British Geological Survey list as the  1 commodity at risk  That is a compelling twist to the Midas story  TGR  Where does permitting stand  MG  The formal permitting process is called the Joint Review Process  JRP   which harmonizes the review activities of the state and federal governments  This process has not started yet  however  because Midas has completed a PEA study  it is able to start the informal process right now and consult with various stakeholders  We expect Midas may be in a position toward the end of 2013 to formally enter the JRP  On a separate front  it is unfortunate that the U S  Forest Service pulled back some of its drill permits on non patented lands  Having to re apply for those will delay exploration on the outer reaches of the property  There is no question that permitting in Idaho can take time  but in our view it is a question of when  not if  providing responsible plans are put forward and the process is closely adhered to  We believe management has the right skill set to persist and earn the social license to permit Golden Meadows  This is a state with high unemployment and mining the brownfield site would actually clean it up  It is a good news story  TGR  To value companies  you use a sum of parts NAV valuation system based on a 5  discounted cash flow model  Using this system  what companies are among your top picks  MG  We also use the forward curve and long term commodity prices to value the companies where we are able to establish a discounted cash flow model  When we see this much market volatility in the commodity prices  we tend to make more frequent adjustments to the forward curve we are using and to reset target prices accordingly  MAG Silver  Mirasol Resources Ltd   MRZ TSX V   B2Gold and Tahoe Resources Inc   THO TSX  TAHO NYSE  are our top picks among the companies we cover  Mirasol Resources is a cash rich junior that has emerged in a very strong position through discovery and monetizing its assets  We estimate it has approximately  50M in cash and investments  We like Mirasol because it has shifted its exploration focus to Chile and has identified what appears to be a large  high sulphidation system  If Mirasol succeeds  this potentially large gold system will attract the seniors  interest  The project is very early and only trenched so far we expect drilling in May and June but the markers suggest that Mirasol could be onto a fairly significant new belt in Chile  The company also has significant assets in Argentina  although they do not yet have resources  TGR  Is there less pressure in Chile on smaller companies  MG  As long as their programs are not huge  smaller companies are likely better able to fly under the radar  In the early stages  they do not have to negotiate for water rights or consult with the communities on a formal basis  That makes it easier  At the same time  they have to pave the way for the ultimate developers to earn their social licenses  It is important that they execute on the ground at an extremely early stage by developing good relationships and respecting the community  TGR  Access to water is one of the biggest issues in Chile  Does Mirasol have a clear path to water  MG  The company has been somewhat cryptic as to the exact project location and has yet to conduct an analyst site visit  Our understanding is that Mirasol is still acquiring strategic land positions within this new belt  TGR  When will that information be available  MG  We are confident in the management team s ability to conduct generative research using satellite and Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer  ASTER  imagery to identify large alteration signatures  The company has homed in on a specific area with nine targets  As it goes forward to drill the initial targets in the next few months  I expect more visibility on the actual location and setting  TGR  What other companies are on your top pick list  MG  B2Gold is one  For an intermediate producer  B2Gold has a top management team  The company is a hybrid producer explorer  and it does both well  It operates gold mines in Nicaragua  a new acquisition in the Philippines called the Masbate mine and a development project in Namibia  The company has a tremendous growth profile  from 150 000 oz  150 Koz  last year to what we estimate could exceed 500 Koz by 2015  It all comes at a fairly low capital expense  B2Gold also comes with tremendous exploration upside  In Nicaragua  it is executing a feed the mill strategy to extend mine life  By exploring the La Libertad gold belt and finding satellite deposits at twice the grade  it is able to feed its mill and grow organically  For example  we estimate that the Jabali satellite deposit will generate a 95  internal rate of return  B2Gold acquired Auryx Gold Corp  in December 2011  It did not overpay for an asset that will deliver 140 Koz year by 2015  along with a tremendous exploration belt  This is the former Bema Gold team that discovered Refugio  Cerro Casale and created tremendous value at Kupol  Kinross Gold Corp   K TSX  KGC NYSE  subsequently bought Bema for  3 6B  TGR  One of the more interesting projects in B2Gold s portfolio is the Gramalote joint venture in Colombia  What can you tell us about that project  MG  Gramalote is a strategic gold porphyry development project in Colombia and is operated by AngloGold Ashanti Ltd   AU NYSE  ANG JSE  AGG ASX  AGD LSE   It is a 51 49 joint venture  51 for AngloGold Ashanti  Gramalote is somewhat low grade 0 65 g t average grade and would be a milling operation  It has good infrastructure and very good recoveries  The project is in the midst of a preliminary feasibility study  and we expect better visibility on the economics in the next few months  In our view  it is probably of less strategic interest to B2Gold  given the location and the probable high cost to build the project  However  in our view  Gramalote is very strategic to AngloGold Ashanti as development of this asset to production could pave the way for a separate 100  owned project called La Colosa in a different part of Colombia that is reportedly in the 25  Moz gold resource size  La Colosa is the ultimate prize in Colombia for AngloGold Ashanti  TGR  Can B2Gold achieve significant production increases at La Libertad and Masbate  MG  Yes  Masbate brings in the range of 180 200 Koz to B2Gold  It has not decided on an expansion  but we model a  50 Koz year expansion in 2015  This becomes the flagship asset for B2Gold with its contribution to production and growth  At La Libertad  we see incremental production growth through 2013 2014  topping out near 150 Koz  TGR  Do you have another top pick that you would like to talk about  MG  Tahoe Resources has a best of breed silver asset in Guatemala and is run by Kevin McArthur  former CEO of Goldcorp and Glamis Gold Ltd   along with his very strong team  Tahoe has built an underground mine for less than  400M  on time and on budget  It should be completed by July 2013  What stands out about Tahoe s Escobal mine development project is its high grade and large size  It has more than 400 Moz in silver resources and will mine average grades of 400 g t  with some gold  zinc and lead credits  Another key is that the veins are very thick  averaging 10 15m in one zone  and over 15m in another  The company can  therefore  mine very efficiently and run the plant initially at 3 500 tons per day  3 500 tpd   moving up to 5 000 tpd and potentially to 7 000 tpd  You are looking at 20 Moz year silver for at least the first eight years  TGR  That is an interesting point about scalability in projects  something offered by very few projects  MG  This is an asset built by a veteran team that contemplates that upside  The incremental expansion is more or less designed and factored in to get to 5 000 tpd  TGR  Kevin McArthur was on Canada s BNN  and he was grilled about some problems with the locals near its project after an incident  Is that a problem  MG  It is an ongoing issue  The company received its permit a real endorsement from the government and a government presence on site helps with security  This is a change to the local economy  It is an industrial site near the town of San Rafael  a community that we estimate will benefit from the new royalty regime to the tune of about  10M year  Communities farther away also will feel the impact  Guatemala does not have a mining culture with a long history  There will be community relations and security issues to manage in the near and medium term  TGR  According to your models  what sort of cash flow will Tahoe generate by Q4 13  MG  We show Tahoe being cash flow positive in Q4 13 and overall guidance of 5 Moz silver being produced into 2013  Looking out to 2014  and using a forward curve from Feb  6  2013  and a higher silver price   32 oz silver   we are looking at  353M cash flow from operations in 2014 for  2 33 share  Another attraction with Tahoe is that management suggested last summer that it would pay a significant dividend  TGR  If you were a grief counselor for retail investors with positions in gold  how would you assuage them after the recent dramatic market events  MG  Being one of those investors who feel the pain  I can empathize  It comes back to volatility  If you are convinced that the best companies will come out of this  when they are deeply discounted and you can buy them at what seem to be fire sale prices  you will be rewarded down the line  It also comes back to the potential swings in volatility we could see to the upside  That is why you want exposure to the gold sector  especially in equities  despite its downtrodden reputation  TGR  Thank you for your insights   is a mining

120286,341801,AEM,Ryan Walker  Tweet Retreat Hasn t Changed Gold s Story,opinion,Investors were shaken by the market s death defying drop and recovery in a matter of minutes recently  But the  tweet retreat  hasn t changed the reasons why investors need gold companies in their portfolio  Ryan Walker  a mining analyst with Casimir Capital in Toronto  tells investors to look past the headlines to what underpins the market  In this interview with The Gold Report  Walker says all the cash pumped into the economy has to start driving inflation at some point   The Gold Report  Casimir Capital adjusted its metal price forecasts after the recent drop in metals prices  What are your near term numbers for gold and silver   Ryan Walker  For the remainder of this year  we re forecasting  1 600 ounce   1 600 oz  gold  then  1 700 oz next year and  1 800 oz for the subsequent two years  Long term  our price assumption is  1 400 oz   For silver  we forecast  28 oz for this year   30 oz next year and  33 oz for the subsequent two years  Our long term price is  26 oz  Unfortunately  we put these out before the big crash in gold and silver  We missed that event in our forecast   TGR  What s underpinning that bullishness   RW  According to some reports  there s been some  6 trillion in quantitative easing over the past few years  At some point  inflation is in a real way going to kick in  It s been kept at bay so far  but inflation has got to send gold higher  While mechanisms exist to fight that  it is hard to see inflation not happening at some point  The big question is when  not if  We re bullish on gold  but we ve tempered our expectations to reflect the current market   TGR  Many precious metals investors are still reeling after that dramatic drop in the price of gold in mid April  What happened there   RW  It was a confluence of events  There were reports Cyprus would be required to sell gold as part of its bailout package  Some members of the Federal Reserve were hinting that it might be time to end or slow down the pace of quantitative easing  A couple of the major banks in the U S  recommended going short gold  It all came together to spook an already jittery market  Exchange traded funds are so easily traded that things start to trade through stop losses and cascade and feed on themselves and become a self fulfilling prophecy   As an example of how quickly things can move nowadays  the Dow Jones Industrial Average recently dropped 130 points in the span of about a minute on a false Twitter headline from the Associated Press that there were explosions at the White House  Then it popped right back up to where it was all in less than five minutes  That s the kind of world we re in   TGR  Should investors expect similar price shocks in the near and medium term   RW  The potential is out there for it  Can you call the kind of thing that happened to the Dow recently  I don t think so  Have the fundamentals for gold changed  I don t think so   TGR  Did what happened make you more of a conspiracy theorist about gold price manipulation   RW  No  but you can definitely see where conspiracy theorists are coming from  Maybe it does make you wonder a little bit longer about some of those theories  But I think it was just the confluence of a number of factors that got things rolling  and then electronic trading just created a cascade effect   TGR  Your coverage involves small cap precious metals  mostly in the developer space  What s the essential investment thesis for those types of names   RW  For the most part  I m dealing with the explorers  emerging producers and developers  I look for something that s got potential to get big  an asset that would be attractive as a merger and acquisition  M A  target  But if that doesn t happen  I look for something that could feasibly be put into production by a smaller company  With producers you look for the low cost companies with solid balance sheets  but also companies that have some real legs to them  preferably somewhere in a safe jurisdiction   TGR  What s your preferred valuation metric for junior explorers   RW  A lot of people use Enterprise Value per ounce as an initial filter  which is fine for that purpose  Not all ounces are created equal  however  Generally  an ounce of sulphide gold requires more work to recover compared with oxide ounces  where recoveries can be easier and sometimes you don t need to go and build a big mill  Do you really value both those types of ounces the same way  You have to look at the whole picture jurisdiction  management deposit type  metallurgy  etc  there is no one magic bullet   TGR  Has the recent dive in precious metals prices put further financing pressures on the explorers   RW  Sure  but it is always an issue for them  I like to look for big deposits that can help self finance  that might have by product credits that could be sold forward  If a gold deposit has some silver  a company can sell forward the silver to fund the gold part of the deposit   TGR  What are three strong narratives in the developer space   RW  I like to look for projects that can get big and that have legs  scalability  development options and by product credits  if possible  A good example and the one I am most excited about right now is Probe Mines Limited  PRB TSX V   The company s Borden Gold deposit in Ontario has had success pretty quickly  It was discovered in late 2010 and it is already up to 4 6 million ounces  4 6 Moz  gold  depending on the cutoff grade you apply   Some say these big  low grade deposits are out of favor right now that s quite true but Probe has a couple of characteristics that help it stand out  The deposit has a higher grade core that runs right down the middle  The bulk of the deposit is running at around 1 gram per tonne gold  1 g t   The higher grade core is up around 1 6 g t  That gives Probe a bit of flexibility to go after the higher grade core first and then stockpile the lower grade material for processing toward the end of the mine life   The really exciting thing is that late last year  drilling to extend the deposit toward the southeast returned the type of hole I can t say I ve seen in some time 51 meters  51m  of 10 3 g t  And  that was NOT influenced by  say  a 1m section of 800 g t it wasn t a case of grade smearing  Probe more recently did some follow up drilling and the first two holes and mind you this is a 500m stepout from that initial hole boom  Drill results came back just shy of 13m at 7 4 g t and another at 10 2m of 12 5 g t  Those are fantastic results   The market shrugged it off on the back of the declining gold price and some warrant overhang holding the stock back  It was ignored wholeheartedly   TGR  Explain grade smearing and how investors can identify it   RW  I would encourage investors to not just read the headline numbers  but go down and read through press releases and the actual table of drill results  That headline might say 150m at some flashy high grade number  but more often than not there are smaller subintervals included containing much higher grades  disproportionately influencing the overall average  When they re averaged  it makes the whole story sound good   When I first saw that Probe hole I mentioned earlier  I thought   That s crazy  That can t be   But the drill result table showed it WASN T being influenced by a single narrow  very high grade interval   TGR  Those stepout drill results would seem to indicate further exploration potential  How important is that to a potential suitor   RW  The deposit has 4 6 Moz  so you know it s a big plumbing system to be able to pile up that much gold  The bulk tonnage target and high grade core have shown good continuity  We re waiting on results from additional ice based holes sunk this winter further southeast and they could be the game changers  It looks as if Probe has tapped into a high grade feeder system toward the southeast  That changes the complexion of the story from bulk tonnage and low grade to high grade  and  importantly  so far over some nice wide intervals  All that  and the company still has a large little explored land package   Probe is worth a look  With  30 million   30M  on the balance sheet  the company should at least be funded through the end of this year  No jeopardy of running dry on funds   TGR  What s another story you are following   RW  Atacama Pacific Gold Corp   ATM TSX V  has a nice large oxide gold deposit in Chile  The processing is much easier  It is an open pit  heap leach opportunity with 3 5 Moz in pit  It is low grade at about 0 5 g t  but the key is its oxide gold   Atacama came out with a preliminary economic assessment earlier this year with robust numbers  In the first five years  the company will produce about 300 000 oz gold year  Its after tax net asset value is  531M at a 5  discount rate  It has a 26  internal rate of return  which is above the benchmark of around 20  that most companies are looking for in a M A scenario   The key issue for this one is water  because it s situated in Chile s Atacama desert  Atacama has drilled some aquifers and hit some water  The initial flow rates look good  Once that gets settled  it should help the story   TGR  There are a few majors in the area  Kinross Gold Corp   K TSX  KGC NYSE  has projects nearby  but things aren t going so well for it right now  Do you see Atacama as a takeover target   RW  It s certainly on the radar screen  but the big hitch is the water  I don t think it will be touched until that is sorted out   TGR  Are the locals on board at its Cerro Maricunga project in Chile   RW  There really aren t any locals to speak of  It s a pretty remote region that is not agricultural by any means   TGR  How much cash does Atacama have   RW  At the beginning of the year  the company had  20M  It s nicely situated to keep going for quite a while  It s doing in fill drilling  some engineering studies and metallurgical work   TGR  Are any other companies interesting right now   RW  Treasury Metals Inc   TML TSX  outside of Dryden  Ontario  is one I initiated coverage on recently  I ve been to a lot of sites over the last 15 years and the infrastructure here couldn t be better  It s literally a stone s throw off the Trans Canada Highway  a former government tree nursery left several useable buildings on site  and there s high capacity hydro wires crossing near the planned pit area  Also  a natural gas pipeline cuts across the property  You couldn t ask for a better set up   A lot of people up there looking for jobs would love to see this mine up and running   This project doesn t yet have the size that some deposits have it is about 1 7 Moz gold equivalent but it does have some silver  Treasury can t totally fund the project on the back of the silver  but it could sell the silver stream and reduce the equity portion of the capital expenditure  capex   It is a nice story with very good exploration potential   Treasury recently enlarged the land package  It s done some regional drilling that generated some whiffs of smoke  but no real barn burner of a hole yet   The pushback on this one would be the strip ratio  the ratio of waste to ore taken during open pit mining  which is pretty high  Drilling has been hitting a second  parallel zone  The more it hits that and can flesh that out  it will help reduce the overall strip ratio   The deposit has a manageable capex for the open pit at just more than  92M   TGR  Is that realistic  I mean  92M sounds really low   RW  It s not a huge operation and it s got a head start with the infrastructure  so I think it s a reasonable number  The plan is to get the open pit running and cash flow going  and then fund the underground development out of cash flow  You can make good money off of this and use it as a springboard   TGR  We ve seen some of the bigger players make strategic investments in a number of these smaller companies  Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd   AEM TSX  AEM NYSE  and Sulliden Gold Corp   SUE TSX   Does Treasury have any major investors with a significant slice   RW  No  it doesn t  It s really interesting how Agnico is taking these toe holds at bargain basement prices  It is locking in a 10  stake now maybe it will miss a little bit on the downside if the gold price goes any lower  but it is locking in these interests and can either consolidate ownership later on or make a nice little profit down the road   One that I don t officially cover but have been keeping an eye on is WCB Resources Ltd   WCB TSX V   This one goes back to looking for something that can get really big  The company has the old Placer Dome Misima mine in Papua New Guinea  which produced about 4 Moz  It is working on putting out a resource estimate by the end of next month  I think we ll see the 1 Moz mark to start with  but it looks as if that could just be the tip of the iceberg  The deposit has leftover gold that wasn t produced because gold was at  300 oz back then  so the company just shut it down   The real blue sky here is what s the underlying heat engine for the gold deposit  The project has some nice large scale coincident geochemical and geophysical anomalies  It looks as if there s a big gold copper porphyry below and some magnetite is associated with it  The magnetite is important because gold rich porphyry copper deposits can be linked to elevated magnetite content   I m definitely keeping an eye out for the resource estimate it may catch some people by surprise   TGR  Not a bad place to do a site visit either   RW  You are in the land of the giants there  Not to sound clich   but that is elephant country  You ve got Grasberg  Porgera  Ok Tedi  Lihir and several others and WBC is right in the trend with those   TGR  How does a little company get an asset like this   RW  The chief executive officer  Cameron Switzer  has been involved in the project for quite some time  brought it to Pan Pacific Copper Co  Ltd  and they partnered up after Placer Dome left it in the early 2000s   TGR  How are the locals with regard to development  The Grasberg district certainly had some problems in the last few years   RW  There are no immediate local villages  but the company is still trying to do the right thing by employing locals   TGR  The precious metals space is generally quieter in the summer  What should investors expect this year   RW  I wish I knew  The plunge heading into summer is an interesting set up  I don t expect a massive rebound over the summer  the plunge happened in the blink of an eye  but I don t expect the recovery to do the same thing  It will be a slow and steady rise back up  Ultimately  I have to believe this massive money printing campaign that s been going on has got to come home to roost in the form of inflation  That s got to send gold higher   Ryan Walker joined Casimir Capital as a mining equity analyst in

120290,341805,AEM,The Real Reason Gold Fell   And Why It Has Already Stabilized,opinion,Things are upside down in the gold market  Valuations are irrationally low  while global consumerism fuels demand and supply comes up short  Lawrence Roulston  editor and publisher of Resource Opportunities  advises people to trust their guts as well as the numbers when weeding through prospective investments  In this interview with The Gold Report  he skirts around conspiracy theories regarding the recent gold sell off and keeps his advice simple  lower expectations  get rid of poorly performing investments and load up on the companies going cheap  If you push against the trend  you might come out with your feet on the ground   The Gold Report  In a recent edition of Resource Opportunities  you wrote   This time is different from every previous bust   How so   Lawrence Roulston  Some people described the late 1990s as a nuclear winter of the mining industry  Demand for metals was low  and a lot of new production had come onstream  Copper was trading at the lowest price ever in real terms  Today  we don t have that surplus  We have serious constraints on supply at a time when demand for metals is increasing  Half the planet s population is undergoing a process of modernization and industrialization  Billions of people are becoming consumers  buying cellphones and looking at refrigerators  cars and every other consumer product   TGR  Does that include gold  It doesn t have an industrial purpose per se  and we saw a massive sell off in gold mid April   LR  Yes  The selling came largely from the exchange traded funds  ETFs  and was triggered by the short signals from a couple of the big New York brokerage firms  The ETFs were being sold on a panic level  but buyers around the world were literally lining up to buy physical gold  The price has already stabilized   TGR  Are you saying you don t expect further weakness in the gold price between now and fall 2013   LR  There will be a lot of short term volatility  But people s desire to own gold on the physical level is not going away  whether people are buying gold jewelry in China or India or Europe or buying bars and coins gold will act as a safe haven  as a currency hedge   There will probably be further events such as what recently happened  I don t want to get into the whole conspiracy theory  but it seems clear that the brokerage firms involved in this had a phenomenal short position before making the calls to short gold  It was extremely profitable for them  If they ve done it once  they re likely to do it again   TGR  Anybody who s still in this space has lost money  Investors in the junior mining space want to know what the path is to making money again   LR  The shortest path is to own a company just before it announces a big new discovery  We saw that with GoldQuest Mining Corp   GQC TSX V   which went from  0 05 share to  1 50 share in a couple of months  We saw it again recently when Colorado Resources Ltd   CXO TSX V  announced a drill hole on a copper intersection in British Columbia that took the share price from  0 15 to  0 50 overnight   My approach is to look at companies that have a real asset and are advancing it toward production  They ll either take it into production or will be taken over by a company that will  Maybe you won t get 10  20 or 30 times returns  but there is a much higher probability of achieving a double  a triple or even a tenfold return than if you bet on an exploration discovery  I admit my approach hasn t worked so well over the past year  but I m still totally committed to it   TGR  Should investors lower their expectations   LR  You always have to ask  Is it just a greater fool theory  Who s going to buy these off you at two or three times  You can seek out a 30 to 50 times return  and if you re successful  it s pretty exciting  But lots of opportunities exist in this market if you re OK with two  three  four or ten times return over two  three or four years  There s a huge level of interest from the sophisticated money managers  Sovereign wealth funds  mining companies in every part of the world and private equity are all looking at the prices in the market right now and salivating   TGR  Many people reading this might think   Lawrence Roulston has been in this space for a long time and knows it better than most people do  Jeepers  if he s losing money  then there s no point   What would you say to them   LR  Let me put the current valuations into perspective  I ve never seen anything like this in the over 30 years I ve been in the business  The valuations are irrational  Companies are trading at discounts to cash  some at one third of the value of cash in the bank  There are companies with multimillion ounce gold deposits trading at just slightly over the value of cash in the bank and  in some cases  even less than the value of cash in the bank  You could buy cash at a discount and get a gold deposit or a copper deposit thrown in for free  The profit potential is enormous for anybody who has cash and is coming into the market now   TGR  How can investors figure out which companies have high investment potential and which are more likely to fail   LR  One simple test is whether the company has any cash  If it doesn t  the company is forced to raise cash in this market to survive  Many companies with no cash and mediocre projects effectively have no value  in my opinion  For some  fundraising will be so dilutive  it s hard to imagine a path back   TGR  Cash is a vague term  What does it mean to you   LR  A number of companies have a few hundred thousand dollars in the bank and are conserving cash paying rent and salaries and not doing much else  But if that s all they re doing  they re going to burn through that money  If a company is going to add shareholder value  it needs to do something on the ground  physical work that will build value  It s hard to imagine a meaningful exploration program unless it has more than  1 million in the bank   I think investors who want to get involved in exploration should look at companies like Riverside Resources Inc   RRI TSX   Riverside has cash but is using other people s money  primarily major mining companies  money  and just announced another strategic alliance   TGR  Do you think the prospect generator model is even more valuable now than it has traditionally been   LR  Absolutely  Virginia Mines Inc   VGQ TSX  is an excellent prospect generator  It s not cheap but is backed by the royalty interests it holds and its cash  The same is true of Altius Minerals Corp   ALS TSX V   Millrock Resources Inc   MRO TSX V  is much less expensive  and companies are spending a lot of money on its projects   TGR  In early April  Kinross Gold Corp   K TSX  KGC NYSE  took a position in Revolution Resources Corp   RV TSX  to own almost 12  on a fully diluted basis  In the past few weeks  Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd   AEM  has purchased significant stakes in Sulliden Gold Corp   SUE TSX   Kootenay Silver Inc   KTN TSX V  and ATAC Resources Ltd   ATC TSX V   Press releases followed all of these moves  but these types of transactions used to be done more quietly  What are the majors trying to achieve with this strategy   LR  It s great that the majors are bringing attention to these alliances  More and more  the majors are relying on the juniors as their exploration departments  When the juniors convince the majors to put in hard cash like that  they pass a number of due diligence steps to display competence to spend the money wisely   TGR  Have the majors done the due diligence for the average investor by investing in these companies  Would investors be wise to follow   LR  It implies that the major believes that the exploration team in the junior will spend its money wisely  but it s not to say that it is more likely to come up with success   TGR  In a recent edition of Resource Opportunities  you wrote   The good companies have been sold off along with the lesser quality companies  creating unprecedented opportunities for investors who can differentiate the worthwhile companies from the rest of the pack   What sets these companies apart in this market environment   LR  The most important differentiator is the management team  A lot of people focus on management or exploration teams that have been successful in the past  and that s valid  But I focus on finding the young people who are just coming up and who will be seen next year as the great success stories   TGR  That s tougher  isn t it  That s similar to betting on the junior companies without any information   LR  In my position  I m living and breathing this stuff  I spend a lot of time interacting with many of these management groups  and I can get a sense of which are likely to be the next successful ones   TGR  Any up and comers   LR  Revolution has strong geological talent and has had some successes in the past   TGR  On an entry point  is it best to invest just before a resource estimate  a preliminary economic assessment  a prefeasibility study or a feasibility study comes out  Which one offers the most potential   LR  In a normal market  all of them would have an impact  Over the past year and perhaps going forward  I m not sure any would have a big effect  It depends on when the report comes out and if it exceeds or falls short of the expectations  Over the past few years  they have generally fallen short on the size of resource and capital expenditures have been far higher than expectations   TGR  Which analysts covering this sector do you follow   LR  The Haywood Securities team is really good  Many analysts tend to be numbers focused  and their work largely involves computer modeling and pricing projections  Few get really involved in the more subjective side of the evaluations  That s an area where I m different from a lot of the analysts  The early stages of my career were doing detailed financial modeling  and I ve since developed a more subjective approach   TGR  You need objective numbers but also some room to factor in subjective criteria  like management and jurisdiction  right   LR  That s exactly the path to success  You want a number set as a starting point that you can layer on  A lot of analysts miss out in that they re not willing to stick out their necks on more subjective appraisals   TGR  About 70  of the junior mining space is gold mining  but which commodities do you remain bullish on   LR  I m almost agnostic with respect to the commodity  When I do analysis  I don t factor in higher prices on anything  It has to make sense at or below the current levels with a rise representing a windfall gain  Investor sentiment is important  A lot of times I look at a project  like a tin project  and see something interesting from a technical perspective  Then I think  who the hell is ever going to pay attention to a tin project   Another example is zinc  Looking out two to four years into the future  the fundamentals for the zinc market are very strong  yet investors won t touch zinc with a 10 foot pole  Many of the silver deposits are really zinc deposits with a silver byproduct  Bear Creek Mining Corp   BCM TSX V  has billions of pounds of zinc that most investors are not giving value to  they re just looking at the silver component   TGR  What will be your fundamental message to people at the upcoming conferences where you re speaking   LR  My fundamental message will be that there are some extraordinary bargains to be had in this market when share prices have been beaten up as badly as they have been  but it s more important than ever before to be selective  A large number of companies are still grossly overvalued  but other companies are trading at irrationally low levels  So take the time  do the due diligence  Find the companies that are trading at very low prices relative to the asset values and load up on them   TGR  Why else should investors stay positive   LR  Some companies are going to double  triple or more in value over the next 12 months  If you can go counter to the popular thinking and come into the market at the bottom and ride it up  then your potential gains are enormous   TGR  But what should people do if they have a portfolio of underperformers   LR  They need to bite the bullet and sell many of the companies they hold  They need to take a good  hard look at everything they own and make a decision on whether that company has near term growth potential  I know it s painful to sell something at a loss  But if the price is down  you have lost money  You need to get whatever cash back you can and deploy it into things that have better  near term growth

120293,341808,AEM,Ian Gordon  Who Killed the Gold Price ,opinion,The gold price may have taken a tumble  but Ian Gordon  chairman and founder of the Longwave Group in British Columbia  is watching for a recovery  As bullishness in gold reaches some of its lowest levels  Gordon  in this interview with The Gold Report  says he believes that is indicative of a turn and he discusses where he has invested his money to ride the upswing  The Gold Report  On April 15  the gold price plunged about 9  the biggest one day loss ever for the yellow metal  Many gold investors got  murdered  that day  Has your personal investigation revealed any suspects  Ian Gordon  I suspect it was akin to what happened in 1999  The then governor of the Bank of England  Edward George  supposedly said that  any further rise in the gold price would take down one or more trading houses   He said the rising price of gold was curtailed through the work of the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England  It appears that a bullion bank was caught offside on the short side and they had to take the price of gold down quite dramatically to allow it to cover  I think something similar happened in April  I think it was manipulated to the downside  Goldman  Sachs   Co  encouraged its clients to short sell gold two days before this occurred  TGR  Could it have just been an error  IG  I always suspect the worst  There s so much manipulation in all the markets as I see it  TGR  That one day drop caught even long time gold investors off guard and shook their confidence  Is being a precious metals investor at this point simply about having the resolve to stay the course  or should even the ardent investors make adjustments to their gold portfolios  IG  I m extremely bullish on gold  Bullishness in gold  according to the website Market Vane  is at 40   the lowest it has been since 2001  Bullishness in the stock market is at 70   which is almost the highest it has been since Market Vane began tracking it  I see a reversal occurring here  for the gold price to the upside and the stock market to the downside  TGR  There s no way to sugar coat the disappointing performance of gold and silver in 2013  But has the current global economic backdrop provided some new and compelling reasons to own gold and precious metal equities  IG  There are compelling reasons to be bullish on gold particularly  simply because there is a real worldwide crisis in fiat money  The unfolding crisis is similar to the 1930s  when the whole monetary system collapsed  We re envisioning something quite similar to that collapse is now occurring  We can see that there s this huge move to gold  not only by countries like China and Russia and even the small   stan  countries  but major investors are also taking up the physical metal because they can see this crisis unfolding  TGR  Most of what I m reading says that there just aren t a lot of bids in the market right now for precious metals  Investment demand has waned  with gold falling consistently lower since its high in 2011  IG  Investment demand is huge  The output of American Eagle gold bullion coins by the U S  Mint is at record highs  Demand by the small investors for gold and silver is at unprecedented levels  The amount of gold that s being imported through Hong Kong into China is at a record level  TGR  Yet  at the same time  India  which is the world s biggest gold consumer  increased the royalty from 6  to 8  on gold imports  IG  It has  but India is notorious for gold smuggling  Most people are going to look for a way to go around those taxes  I suspect that there will be the same amount of gold imported into India through Dubai  but most of it won t be declared  TGR  You say you re seeing strong demand for the physical metal  but investors have been getting out of exchange traded funds  ETFs  and equities in mass numbers  IG  With regards to the gold ETFs  I suspect that many investors are cashing in their paper claims to take possession of the physical  Yes  gold stocks  particularly the juniors  have been slaughtered  But once bullishness returns to gold  bullishness will return to gold equities  When you get this overly bearishness in markets  it s usually indicative of a turn  I m confident that we re going to see a turn to the upside  I also believe that the turn in the stock market to the downside is about to begin  TGR  I get the sense that there s a prevailing sentiment that we haven t hit a bottom yet in the mining equity space and that there s another leg down before we see a move to the upside  Do you see that as well  IG  That is always a possibility and it can t be ruled out  but the precious metals  fundamentals are as compelling today as they have ever been  TGR  Could it be seasonality due to the summer  IG  I don t think so and anyway I am a long term investor and I am essentially not concerned by short term price machinations  As I have said  the most compelling reason to own gold is the crippling debt crisis  which has brought about the probability of a catastrophic end to fiat currencies  TGR  Sean Boyd  the chief executive of Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd   AEM TSX  AEM NYSE   recently told Bloomberg that gold could reach about  1 800 ounce   1 800 oz  within a year  What s your medium term outlook for gold and silver  IG  The market is going to have to go through a consolidation that could last for weeks  However  I m much more bullish on gold than I am on silver because gold has traditionally been recognized as money sine qua non  Industrial demand is going to drop quite precipitously as the world goes into the depression stage of the cycle  Nevertheless  it is likely that silver will take on the role of poor man s gold  My belief is we re going to see a decoupling between the paper markets and the physical markets  The demand for physical is going to grow dramatically  It s going to make the paper markets irrelevant  I m not sure if it s going to be a year as Sean says  but it s going to be extremely strong and the move will be very dramatic once it starts  The old highs of  1 900 oz will be surpassed by a long shot over the medium to long term  TGR  Do you think silver will fall below the  20 oz level in the next six months to a year  IG  We re as oversold as we were in 2008  although the price isn t as low as it was then  I see a consolidation in the price  but I don t forecast much lower prices occurring in either of the precious metals  Once this consolidation is over  I see a resumption of the bull market  TGR  Amid the moribund news cycle for gold and silver  there have been some feel good stories in the equities space  IG  True  A company like Newmont Mining Corp   NEM NYSE  is a really good story because it has a 4  dividend  It s trading at a low book value  Agnico Eagle is well managed  It s been moving into the junior space in anticipation of a move up in the market  Agnico Eagle has recently acquired interests in five junior mining companies because management is bullish on gold and the company can invest in promising junior companies at very cheap prices that have good potential to grow their assets  TGR  Does Newmont have the cash flow to maintain a 4  dividend  IG  Yes  I think it does  Investors are buying these companies at or close to a price low  When the gold price increases  Newmont s profitability will increase and it should be able to raise the dividend quite dramatically  The same thing happened in the 1930s  Even though the gold price was fixed at  20 67 oz  the dividends that companies like Homestake and Dome Mines were paying out were enormous 10  dividends were being paid out  particularly after Roosevelt raised the price from  20 67 to  35 oz  TGR  Is there any good news among the juniors  IG  In the junior sphere  you can buy some companies for nearly  10 oz of gold in the ground  One of the juniors that I ve consistently talked about is Temex Resources Corp   TME TSX V  TQ1 FSE   which has about 4 million ounces  4 Moz  of gold in the ground in Ontario  Canada  TGR  What is Temex s cash position  IG  The company has about  7 million   7M  in cash  It did a financing prior to this horror story that we ve gone through in the past year  I talked to the CEO  Ian Campbell  who said that Temex has sufficient cash to last another two years  even with the drilling that is ongoing  TGR  Are you more bullish on the Whitney or the Juby project  IG  I guess I m more bullish on Juby  even though it s a lower grade project  Temex only owns 60  of the Whitney property  Goldcorp Inc   G TSX  GG NYSE  owns 40   The chances are that there s about 3 Moz at Juby  The gold definitely runs beyond where the company has drilled and I believe that overall Juby could turn into a major deposit  I am not belittling the Whitney property because that too could be a very large deposit  but Temex only owns 60  of Whitney  Another old favorite is Barkerville Gold Mines Ltd   BGM TSX V   The company s trading has been halted by the British Columbia Securities Commission  BCSC  as it answers some questions about its NI 43 101    It has just published a new NI 43 101 resource of 4 98 Moz and a potential resource of 9 27 Moz  These are very good numbers  It will be interesting to see what value investors put to these numbers  I believe that there is significant potential for the company to grow this discovery quite substantially  TGR  Are there any other gold equities that you re fond of at these low prices  IG  I own about 10  of Alliance Mining Corp   ALM TSX V   The company has a little bit of a cash problem  but it has some fantastic projects in the largest gold silver producing area in Arizona  It also purchased some properties in Mexico that are almost contiguous to the Orisyvo mine  The company is well managed and has good relationships with the mining fraternity in Arizona  It s a good story with some very prospective properties  TGR  What about some other companies  IG  I own Freegold Ventures Ltd   FVL TSX  in Alaska  which has about 5 Moz and growing  It s close to the Kinross Gold Corp   K TSX  KGC NYSE  Fort Knox mine  I like the management of Freegold  Investors should be looking at it simply because of the growth in the ground gold assets that the company owns  its proximity to the Fort Knox mine and a dedicated management team  I m extremely bullish on   The company is one of the best managed juniors out there  Todd Hilditch  the CEO  does a fantastic job in acquiring royalties on the Barrick Gold Corp   ABX NYSE  Midway Gold Corp   MDW TSX V  MDW NYSE MKT  Spring Valley property in Nevada  These royalties have been estimated to have a value of about  70M  Barrick doesn t have to tell us how much gold is being discovered there  but people are quoting it at 6 Moz and I think that it is based on that number that the value of the Terraco royalty has been estimated  TGR  What about Terraco s Moonlight project  IG  It s contiguous to the Barrick Midway project  There s a good chance that the gold being discovered on the Barrick Midway project is going to run onto the Terraco property  TGR  Terraco is worth about  18M right now  Why wouldn t Barrick just buy Terraco versus obtaining the royalty  IG  Some of these companies  like Agnico  are prepared to do that  but a lot of these seniors have made so many blunders that they re too frightened to do anything  Take  for example  Pascua Lama  the Barrick property on the border of Argentina and Chile  See how mismanaged that appears to have been  the capital expenditure that has already gone into it  and the bickering between the Chilean government and the company and great properties  But you re right  Why wouldn t someone go after a company like Terraco  which has a nice royalty  TGR  What about companies outside the Americas  IG  I like Orex Minerals Inc   REX TSX V   which has about 1 Moz gold in Sweden  However  it has mainly silver properties in Mexico  Orex was planning to spin out the silver properties into a separate company  but it hasn t done that yet because of the market  TGR  Detour Gold Corp   DGC TSX  is not too far from Temex  It poured gold this year  but hasn t reached commercial production yet  It secured a credit facility and financing  Is it on track to go commercial in the second half of this year  IG  I love the Abitibi greenstone belt and I love Detour s project  It s huge 25 Moz  I m sure it will get into production this year  but I don t own Detour  I did own the company that basically found Detour  Pelangio Exploration Inc   PX TSX V   Pelangio was an exceptionally good investment for my investors when I was a broker at Canaccord  I did a financing in Pelangio around 2001 at  0 11 share  When Detour took Pelangio over  it was valued at about  5 share  TGR  Pelangio plans to produce 650 000 oz annually  Is that realistic  IG  It never happens as smoothly as anticipated  I m sure there will be hiccups  but eventually that kind of production rate can be achieved  TGR  The silver producers continue to perform regardless of the commodity price performance or investor sentiment for the most part  What names are you following in that segment of the precious metals market  IG  I m more bullish on gold  Brian  However  I do follow a few companies that I don t have a stake in  I keep an eye on Fortuna Silver Mines Inc   FSM NYSE  FVI TSX  FVI BVL  F4S FSE  because it took over an asset of a company that I financed called Continuum Resources Ltd  I like the management of Fortuna  I watch Endeavour Silver Corp   EDR TSX  EXK NYSE  EJD FSE  because I helped finance the company in its preproduction days when I was at Canaccord  The company is also extremely well managed  I love the growth profile that the company has achieved  It s really interesting and cheap  If you re looking for a silver play  it might be the one simply because it s so cheap  Its high is  13 share and it s at around  3 85 share  yet it s increasing production all the time  TGR  You are often investing in financings  Do you ever buy equities in the open market  IG  I do  For example  I bought Barkerville in the market  When it came out with its numbers last June  they were received with massive disbelief  The price of the stock didn t reflect the numbers  I went in the market and bought substantially to build my position because the price wasn t reflecting the asset  I also bought Alliance Mining and Temex when the shares have been cheap  TGR  How do you determine cheap  IG  Relative to where it was formerly priced and the value I place on the company s assets  I started to buy gold and silver stocks in 2000 because they were cheap and no one wanted them  We are in the same position in the market today  We know the bullish consensus numbers for gold are at the same levels that they were in 2001  You can buy these things really cheap  The only reason anybody wouldn t be buying them is because they don t believe that the price of gold is going to rise  I believe that the price is going to rise substantially because the chaos in the financial markets is going to be horrendous  TGR  Thanks  Ian  A globally renowned economic forecaster  author and speaker   is founder and chairman of the Longwave Group  which comprises two

120296,341811,AEM,John Kaiser  Strategies For Success In A Bloody Market,opinion,With so many junior mining companies going into hibernation  John Kaiser of Kaiser Research Online fears that the entire mining sector could fall dormant  In this interview with The Gold Report  he outlines approaches to discovery and development that smart  nimble companies are deploying to stay alive  Whether precious  base or critical metals  or in jurisdictions as exotic as Morocco and as familiar as Nevada  these are the basics required for survival in today s brutal market  The Gold Report  John  early this year you predicted that as many as 500 companies listed on the TSX Venture Exchange would go under by the end of 2013  Do you stand by that  John Kaiser  I think at least 500 companies are endangered  I doubt they will disappear by the end of the year  The critical time will be next summer  when their audited financials are due and their annual meetings will be held  If we have not had a turnaround by then  many management teams will hand the keys over to the stock exchange and abandon their companies  Of the 1 800 companies we follow  761 as of June 28 have less than  200 000   200K  in working capital left  That is the bare minimum needed to merely exist as a publicly listed company  TGR  Is capital on hand one of the first things that you look at when deciding whether to invest JK  Yes  If a company has no working capital  we look at whether management owns sufficient shares to make it worth its while to salvage the company and whatever resource assets it still owns  Our ideal company has working capital of at least  3 million   3M  and a management team that holds a reasonable equity stake and has well rounded exploration and development expertise  We want a company that is working its property  Too many companies  despite being well endowed with cash  are hunkering down  waiting for metal prices to turn around  That is the deadly danger we face  companies with cash going into hibernation  No money gets spent on exploration  No new discoveries emerge  Existing deposits are mothballed because they require heavy capital spending to advance them  The entire sector goes dormant  TGR  In your chart of 1 788 resource sector companies  73  are trading below  0 20 share  The percentage trading below  0 10 share jumped to a seven year high of 53  in late 2008  dipped to 12 6  in February 2011 and is back up above 58  this year  What is causing those swings  JK  While equities in general are near record highs  the resource sector has been targeted for a massive selloff  We are now more than two years into a serious bear market  Two things are driving this  One is the perception that the supercycle has run its course and that the global economy will  at best  grow at a very modest rate  At worst  we may end up in a global recession or depression  The other perception is that the main narrative for gold has not really delivered what was promised  a substantially higher gold price  The mining sector has also seen substantial cost escalation over the last five years  Now we get the extra whammy of declining metal prices  Investors see the mining sector as just one big way to lose money  TGR  In April  you attributed blame for falling gold prices to the goldbug narrative that took pleasure in bad news  Is a good economy good for gold  JK  The apocalyptic goldbug narrative posits that if fiat currencies are debased  the gold price will rise  However  that is just a mathematical adjustment to inflation  it does not create a profit margin for existing gold mines  An alternative argument is that much of the demand for gold in the last decade has been purchases made possible by the prosperity created through the emergence of China as a major economic engine  The private sector now owns 82  of all the gold that exists  central banks own about 18   the lowest since 1910  If the global economy were to keep growing  emerging market economies would grow at a greater rate than mature Western economies  eventually eclipsing them  The resulting shift in the balance of economic power to these new kids on the block would introduce anxiety over what the world might look like 10 15 years from now  when the U S  economy no longer dominates  It would be prudent for the private sector to park some of its growing wealth in physical gold and for central banks  particularly in countries with emerging economies  to accumulate gold in preparation for a period of instability when the U S  dollar no longer serves as the single reserve currency  A reviving American economy would benefit the global economy  which should boost demand for gold  I disagree with the conventional goldbug view that a strong American economy is bad for gold  The market  however  has for now taken their view  which creates a bottom fishing opportunity  TGR  June was tough for gold and mining stocks  Physical gold dropped through the  1 200 ounce   1 200 oz  barrier  and the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners  GDXJ  basket of miners sank to new lows  Let s talk about some of the companies that could survive in this new reality and their strategies  JK  A number of strategies can help a company survive and investors can do well if they ride out this downturn  Probe Mines Limited  PRB TSX V  is a junior with a new  low grade gold system discovery in an Ontario greenstone belt where no significant gold had ever been discovered and mined  The company did not publish an expected preliminary economic assessment  PEA  in Q1 13 based on its 4 million ounces  4 Moz  1 gram tonne gold  Instead  its drilling last December discovered a new aspect to the existing gold zone  This opened up the potential for underground gold mining at a higher grade and may indicate that the low grade gold system is part of something much bigger and richer  Probe gives you a dual hedge  If gold turns around  the low grade  open pittable resource becomes very valuable again  Or if we have a brand new discovery play on our hands  nobody will care about the gold price because the grade will work at even lower gold prices  TGR  When do you expect a PEA  JK  At the end of 2013  with a resource estimate issued in September 2013  Probe Mines is closing some property agreements to consolidate ownership of the land position  The stock is in a holding pattern  Once these loose ends are tied up  the stock will stand out  TGR  Could Probe be a takeover target for Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd   AEM   JK  Agnico Eagle has bought just below 10  already  Probe still owns its Borden project 100   but Agnico Eagle has an equity foothold and is in a position to provide technical advice  When a takeover bid becomes justifiable  Agnico Eagle would have a head start on any competitors  but it would still be an auction among any interested producers  Incidentally  Probe Mines has  39M in working capital  TGR  What is another strategy and company  JK   has the Golden Meadow project in Idaho  a gold and antimony story for which a PEA was published in September 2012 that envisions an open pit mine producing 5 million ounces gold and 90 million pounds antimony  It recently sold a royalty on the gold to  for  15M  giving Midas  25M in cash  On July 2 Teck Resources Ltd   TCK TSX  TCK  bought a 9 9  equity stake for  9 8M  boosting working capital to about  35M  That puts Midas Gold in a strong position to complete a prefeasibility study during the first half of 2014  Last year Midas Gold was a  4 5 share stock  now  it is trading  0 70 0 80 share  The company has good management  Significant exploration potential exists beyond the zones it wants to put into production as an open pit mine  Idaho is perceived as a difficult place to permit a mine  but this is a former mining district  where tungsten was produced during World War II  That left behind a mess  which developing Golden Meadows as an open pit would clean up  Still  management estimates permitting will take three to five years  The antimony component presents a security of supply aspect  given that 85  of global antimony supply comes from China  While antimony s main use is as a fire retardant  it has potential new applications in battery storage devices  This could become a strategic reason to accelerate development at Golden Meadows  TGR  Do you look for a variety of metals to balance and diversify the risk  JK  When the metals are very different it can be helpful  especially when the demand cycles are not correlated  It used to be good to have gold and copper in a system because copper is traditionally strong during an economic boom when gold is weak  But today  the destinies of gold and base metals are pretty much twinned  If there is a major global downturn  gold and copper prices will be weak  In an upturn  both will be stronger  Byproduct credits go up and down roughly in tandem these days  However  during the past decade we have seen supply volatility from regions such as China that are well endowed with certain metals such as zinc  molybdenum  rare earths  tungsten and antimony  In the case of rare earth  supply was curtailed  resulting in a price bubble during 2011  But in the other cases China has ramped up supply  the sustainability of which is in question  South Africa with regard to platinum is another example  Byproduct metals whose primary supply has a geographical skew  such as is the case with antimony  do interest me  TGR  How about another strategy and another company  JK   has the Duparquet project in Qu bec  This was a high flying stock promotion several years ago  which was mismanaged  The regulators halted the stock until the company brought on new management  Clifton Star is an example of a junior looking to change its mining model to mitigate heavy upfront costs  The market perceives it as a relatively high cost open pit gold mine that would produce 1 5 Moz over a 10 year period  Based on the PEA published in December 2012  the project as envisioned is marginal at the current gold price  Management is rethinking its mining model  moving from a pressure oxidation unit to simply producing a concentrate for shipment to China for smelting  That could eliminate substantial capital costs and reduce operating costs  The company still has  9M  which it deems sufficient capital to deliver a prefeasibility study in Q1 14 that incorporates these changes  Clifton Star will not have title until it has made a series of balloon property payments totaling  52M that come due between December 2014 and the end of 2017  The market is pricing companies like Clifton Star on the premise that current or weaker gold prices will prevail in the foreseeable future  Such companies need to find an audience willing to take the view that within a year gold will be back in an uptrend underpinned by a sustainable narrative that promises higher real gold prices  Once gold has stabilized  these stocks with an overhang should be accumulated at incrementally higher prices that cleans out the hostile  angry shareholder base without attracting algo traders  This is why another year of bear market could be healthy for the sector  It would allow rotation of the audiences for these stocks  so when the uptrend starts  they will accelerate quickly  TGR  Under that scenario  what other name could do well JK  Shifting to silver  a junior called  is returning the Zgounder mine in Morocco to production on a fairly small operating scale of 200 tons per day  200 tpd   producing 1 Moz year  In itself this mining plan is not very interesting  especially with silver now below  20 per oz  but it is part of a substantial company building exercise  Noureddine Mokaddem  who was a heavyweight in the Moroccan mining industry  has put together a group of projects for this Canadian junior  Several are owned by the Moroccan government s mining entity  which is privatizing them  Part of the deal in earning an 85  interest in this project is that the company must put Zgrounder back into production  The cost is relatively modest  It only needs to spend another  3 5M to commission by the end of the year  The real game here is that this system could be similar to Morocco s Imiter silver mine  which also started as a small  underground  1 Moz year operation  Then management realized that the material between the high grade lenses was also mineralized and went into production as an open pit mine  Imiter now produces 10 Moz year  has already produced 100 Moz and has 100 Moz to go  As part of restarting the underground mine Maya must conduct exploration drilling  which will be done at an angle that will make or break the hypothesis that it is vesting for 85  of another potential Imiter  TGR  How about another name  JK  Diamonds are a commodity whose price is not only difficult to track  but whose price comes in hundreds of variations based on the crystal shape  color  clarity and carat weight of individual diamonds   is in a holding pattern while it waits for De Beers to make a decision by the end of 2013  Thirty five percent of the stock is owned by Robert and Eric Friedland  Its 100  owned Chidliak project has a significant diamond resource on Baffin Island  In the last four years  with the help of BHP Billiton Ltd   BHP  BHPLF OTCPK   Peregrine has found six high grade pipes within a field of many more diamondiferous pipes  In April  rather than just wait for De Beers to make up its mind  Peregrine took a 500 ton surface sample at its own expense from the CH 6 pipe  where it estimates the presence of 20M carats  If the 3 carats ton global grade holds up in this sample  the resulting 1 500 carat parcel would be large enough to allow valuation  TGR  Do you look for different fundamentals in a diamond company than a gold company  JK  Yes  The fundamentals for diamonds are trickier  With gold  as soon as you have an intersection  you know the value per ton of the material  With diamonds  you need to spend many millions to get a large enough parcel to assess the value  Diamonds are a statistical game  There is a big spectrum of quality related to size  crystal shape and color  If the diamonds turn out to be valued at more than  100 carat on average  that would set in motion a prefeasibility study on CH 6  The hang up is the deal Peregrine did last year that allows De Beers to acquire 50 1  by spending  52M  of which  38M would be a firm commitment  DeBeers has until the end of this year to make this election  Anglo American Plc  AAUK NASDAQ   which owns 85  of De Beers  has its own problems these days  Whether De Beers walks away or elects to earn 50 1   Peregrine Diamonds will process the bulk sample  and the market will finally know how to quantify the potential economic value of the diamond pipes on Baffin Island  It will not do so until De Beers is in or out  In either case Peregrine will have saved its shareholders a year waiting for that crucial information  the value of the diamonds at Chidliak  If the quality is high  Peregrine will benefit from two Friedlands as major stakeholders  TGR  How about rare earths  JK  Rare earths are still trying to find a bottom  With Mountain Pass and Mount Weld coming onstream this year  there will be meaningful supply of light rare earths outside of China  End users are waiting to see a stable  non Chinese supply of rare earth elements before they start incorporating rare earth oxides  REOs  back into their products  Meanwhile the arrival of non Chinese supply will weigh on rare earth prices  The heavy rare earth  HRE  problem has not been solved  Some of the more advanced companies with large deposits  such as  and   are doing costly metallurgical studies  Their projects will probably not come on line until late this decade  assuming they can clear the pilot plant studies and fund what are likely to be high capital costs   is an interesting alternative  The company owns the Lofdal carbonatite complex in Namibia  It has developed a small  low grade  HRE dominated deposit that could provide a bridge supply over the next 5 10 years  This fills a space that neither Lynas Corp   LYC ASX  nor Molycorp Inc   MCP  is able to fill  Namibia Rare Earths has  20M in working capital  Its shareholder base recently changed when Endeavour Mining Corp   EDV TSX  EVR ASX TSX  sold its block to a couple of venture capitalists  Namibia Rare Earths has a solid management team and a supportive shareholder base  It is looking for rare earth elements and other specialty metals within this carbonatite complex  More metallurgical studies will tell us whether it will can process and produce HREs from the Lofdal deposit  TGR  When do you expect that  JK  We expect news on that front in Q3 13  The key will be the ability to remove the radioactive thorium from the heavy rare earth concentrate so that it can be shipped to processors in Japan or Europe  The next step would involve spending  5M on a PEA expected some time in 2014  TGR  What about another name  JK   has been working in Indonesia for the past decade and has  14M in cash  The company expects to produce an NI 43 101 resource estimate for its primary project  Once it has delivered its resource estimate  the company plans to stop working in Indonesia and to seek farm out partners for its more advanced assets  It is looking for opportunities to acquire a distressed asset  perhaps in a different jurisdiction with fewer political issues  The company has a decent management team  including John Proust and Mike Andrews  and substantial backing from the Qatar Sovereign Wealth Fund  On June 28 Southern Arc announced that it had spent half its treasury to acquire a 26  equity stake in another junior  Eagle Hill Exploration Corp  owner of the high grade Windfall gold deposit in Quebec  That is not my preferred way for a cash rich junior to deploy its capital  but it is an example of opportunism at work in a distressed gold equity market  TGR  Another company  JK   just produced a resource estimate for a silver zinc lead deposit that has more than  3B worth of metals  the Chinchillas project  Its black mark right now is that it is in Argentina  Golden Arrow s exit strategy is that its project is near and similar to  Pirquitas mine  The company will continue basic work and  hopefully  be bought out by Silver Standard  Golden Arrow also has projects in Peru   10M working capital  not a lot of shares outstanding and an experienced  well rounded management group  It is the sort of company that I would expect to survive and possibly deliver a windfall sometime in the next few years  TGR  In addition to silver  this is zinc lead play  Is that a good thing  JK  Yes  Zinc is one of the few base metals where  because mines are shutting down and new mines are slow to come onstream  zinc will be in deficit in the next three to five years  Today  there are mountains of zinc in warehouses  but zinc consumption is also much higher and increasing  Zinc is one of the few metals I expect to rise over the next couple of years regardless of the macroeconomic trends  We could see stronger zinc prices in the next year or so  That would attract capital to zinc plays  of which there are very few  TGR  Golden Arrow plans to release a PEA early next year  What do you hope to see from that  JK  We hope to see a positive net present value  NPV  and reasonable capital and operating cost estimates  The market does not trust many of the cost numbers used in PEAs  That is one reason that even though these companies show significant NPVs at trailing average metal prices lower than spot price  the market has been unwilling to assign anything near the value implied by the economic study  The recent bad press about the quality of cost assumptions in economic studies will hopefully make future economic studies more reliable  TGR  What number do you use for the gold price when you look at feasibility studies JK  I use the whole range  the trailing average  lower and higher numbers  I treat juniors as leveraged options on the future price of the metal  If you plug in  2 000 oz gold  some projects end up being 10 or 20 times more valuable than they are now  If gold continues at its current price  these companies may have an intrinsic value of zero  I like to see at what gold price the internal rate of return drops below 15   and the net present value drops to zero  I prefer using a 10  discount rate rather than the 5  rate favored by many analysts  Painful as this market has been to my picks and portfolio  it has a certain beauty  The valuations of the juniors are so cheap  that if we did get a positive outcome or if the economy started to grow again and metal prices rose for reasons that are perceived as sustainable over the longer term  these companies would see very rapid price increases  And there is an abundance of information available through the 400  economic studies we have picked apart  But you have to buy these stocks without knowing when the metal price will turn up  Once it turns  there is no stock available  If you want to bottom fish  you have to take the timing risk  TGR  What topic excites you most JK  Nevada remains my favorite topic  Nevada has produced 250 Moz gold since 1970  and 100 Moz of medium grade gold remain in the ground  largely controlled by  and   But every outcrop in Nevada has been explored  and the perception is that if there is anything more to be found  it is under cover and probably on ground controlled by Barrick and Newmont  My contrarian view is that this perception is wrong  that hundreds of million gold ounces remain to be found in shallow bedrock covered by gravel on land not controlled by the majors   has collected more than 5 000 groundwater samples  mainly from gravel covered basins in northern Nevada  The company identified at least 80 gold in groundwater anomalies along with Carlin type pathfinder elements outside the main trends controlled by Barrick and Newmont  It has at least 20 targets that it regards as high priority  This suggests dozens of gold deposits are to be found under the gravels  These targets are interesting because of the nothingness that sampling has revealed about the surrounding area  This junior has the keys to their locations  It will still take conventional exploration gravity  seismic and other geophysical surveys and stratigraphic drilling to map the bedrock geology and home in on these systems  Nevada could well experience an exploration boom  200M of grassroots exploration capital to deliver an additional 200 300 Moz in the next 5 to 10 years  driven by juniors exploring these anomalies  This could become a distributed area play attracting risk capital  Given what Carlin type deposits are like  the gold price will not matter  TGR  Has the gold in groundwater sampling method been proven  JK  The science behind it is sound  It is the basis for the Environmental Protection Agency s water quality monitoring rules  A 20 Moz deposit called Twin Creeks had a study that showed a gold in groundwater anomaly associated with that deposit s location under basin gravels  along with other Carlin type pathfinder elements deemed as poisonous to humans  Nevada Exploration sampled nearly 30 known deposits and established halos that correlate reasonably well with a deposit s location  What it has not done is deliver its own significant discovery using its methodology  The ability to measure gold at such diluted levels has only existed for 10 years  Nobody has had an opportunity to apply gold in groundwater sampling on a large scale except Nevada Exploration  TGR  Will there be a moment of truth when we will know if this approach works  JK  Nevada Exploration has one play  Grass Valley  poised for a  600K three hole stratigraphic program  If this program gets done and it intersects lower plate hosted gold mineralization within the context of the anomaly and the other data sets that have been built up  that would kick off the next great gold rush in America  TGR  Does it have enough funding to do that drill program and report on it  JK  The project is 70  owned by McEwen Mining Inc   MUX   which is responsible for all exploration costs  but which is now losing money on several smallish gold and silver projects thanks to the recent drop in gold and silver prices  Does Rob McEwen have the courage to divert some of his shrinking capital into drilling high risk  high reward discovery holes  It appears that McEwen Mining does not want to risk spending money on any exploration  It is now concerned with keeping its ship afloat  On the bright side  if we see a further deterioration in gold and silver prices  McEwen Mining may have no choice but to swing for the fences with a wildcat drill program on a company maker scale target  TGR  What did you think of the Rye Patch Gold Corp   RPM TSX V  settlement announced recently JK  The settlement disappointed the market  Rye Patch will get  10M cash  and the net smelter royalty at  20 oz silver is worth about  26 30M  It will kick in at the start of 2014  At that point  Rye Patch could probably sell it to a royalty company at a discounted price that would leave Rye Patch with  25 30M in working capital  Rye Patch  headed by Bill Howald  has a number of other exploration projects in Nevada  Its approach is old fashioned  We have a target  we re going to drill for it and make a discovery  I like the company and its situation  though I am not so keen about the Oreana Trend properties in the current gold silver price environment  Rye Patch is active in the Cortez Battle Mountain Trend  which is where I am hopeful it will start exploring aggressively rather than just sit on the cash  Rye Patch has changed from a company with  700K in working capital  a number of projects and a fair number of shares outstanding  into a cash rich junior with motivated management in a position to deliver discoveries during a bear market  TGR  Any final advice for investors trying to keep their own ships afloat  JK  In the resource sector  you need to consider whether a company can survive a potential two  to three year bear market  You want to have a mix of companies in different commodities  companies that have determined management  money or at least a story that can raise money  assets  ounces or pounds in the ground and do not have a high carrying cost for the company to keep title  Also look for stories that can stand out in a sideways metal price market  either because of a unique twist or because of a compelling exploration target  When a junior is willing to fire its bullets at a target knowing that the bullet factory is on strike  that is a reason in itself to look a little closer  TGR  John  it is always a pleasure and an education talking with you    a mining analyst with 25  years of experience  produces Kaiser Research

120316,341831,AEM,Gold Producers In The Catbird Seat  Jay Taylor,opinion,Calling gold the ultimate money  Jay Taylor  editor and publisher of Jay Taylor s Gold  Energy   Tech Stocks  watches the real price of gold with a gimlet eye  These days  he pays particular attention to producers  noting that this is not a good time to be an explorer that needs to raise capital to put holes in the ground without the certainty of finding gold  In this exclusive Gold Report interview  Taylor shares promising names in each of the four categories in his model portfolio  The Gold Report  Jay  in the June 20 issue of your newsletter  you made the case that gold has broken away from the downtrend that started in late 2011  Why is gold a better investment now  Jay Taylor  At the time  I was convinced we were looking at a breakthrough in the junior gold index on the Toronto Stock Exchange  TSX   Now  it seems it may have been a false breakthrough  The S P TSX Global Gold Index was as high as 450 back in September October 2011  dropping to 270 by May 2012  Today  it is around 282  I see the junior gold index as a barometer of the industry as a whole  Although I was getting optimistic  I remain concerned about the possibilities of much lower levels in gold shares as a whole  The companies that have to raise capital and put money in the ground are my greatest concern  I am less concerned about companies that are in production and generating cash flow from operations  many of which are doing extremely well  TGR  In that newsletter  you wrote that the value of gold   vis   vis     the Rogers Raw Materials Fund     had a rocket ship trajectory following the credit deflationary Lehman Brothers event and has remained on a gradual uptrend   JT  I was referring to the real price of gold  not its nominal price  I am absolutely bullish on gold s real price  There is a distinct uptrend since Lehman Brothers in terms of what an ounce of gold will buy  That  not the dollar price  is what matters  The recent record highs in the real gold price reflected the anxieties caused by the European crisis  To give you an idea  in July 2008 an ounce of gold would have purchased only 17  of the Rogers Raw Materials Fund  By March 2009  it had skyrocketed to 44   After quantitative easing 1 and 2  commodities  stocks and gold all rose  Then gold fell back to 30  of the Rogers Raw Materials Fund until the first Greek crisis  It rose again to 44   and then got worse as Europe seemed to be falling apart  Recently  it has come back a bit  The anxiety about the world monetary system is driving gold prices  Forget about jewelry or about gold as a commodity  Gold is money  and that is driving its real purchasing power higher and higher  I am much less confident in the dollar as gold continues to rise  Gold could actually break below the  1 550 ounce  oz  support level  TGR  Will it drop beneath the 52 week low of  1 480 oz set roughly a year ago  JT  It could in nominal terms versus the dollar  If that happens  I would expect oil  copper and other commodities to fall even more  I think the dollar could be surprisingly strong for a number of years  which would make gold weaker relative to the dollar  but not relative to other commodities  I am bullish on gold and especially gold mining in a deflationary environment because the cost of producing tends to go down more than the metal does  Contrary to most public opinion  a severe deflation is historically extremely bullish for gold mining  TGR  The biggest threat seems to be the euro  which is trading at about  1 20 to the U S  dollar  A euro in the  1 15 1 16 range could be a big hit to the gold price  JT  I agree  and I think it is a strong possibility that the dollar could get stronger relative to other currencies  But the strength of the dollar is itself driving up the real price of gold  growing numbers of people do not trust the dollar as the ultimate currency  As long as there is faith in the dollar and fiat money as a whole and by and large there is I see the system holding together for quite a while  I think it s Ian McCavity who calls the dollar the prettiest horse in the glue factory  in other words  the dollar is the least worst of all the manipulated currencies  In the long run  the dollar could be stronger because it has the most debt  When there is a credit deflation  the margin clerk calls and wants the debt paid  So people have to sell and buy dollars to pay the margin clerk  Because the dollar has the most debt  it stands to have the most short covering against it when the margin clerks call  The world is not short of liquidity  it is insolvent  Debt has grown so much more rapidly than the income to service it that there will be forced fire sales for years to come  The central banks will keep pumping in liquidity  but that money is made out of debt  not out of gold dug from the ground  I am not saying the nominal price of gold will not rise  It may ultimately reach unbelievably high levels  But for now  I watch the real price of gold  It is such a macro statistic  very important in terms of my confidence in the mining industry and the producers  TGR  Even though the real price of gold seems to be rising  will equity prices follow  Over the last year  they have trailed gold s performance significantly  JT  Equity prices have trailed the price of gold bullion and company earnings  The producers  equity prices have been compressed  We are seeing lower price earnings ratios  P E  for the producers  Increasingly  people are buying exchange traded funds  ETFs   not equities  for exposure to gold  Getting exposure through an ETF is easier than analyzing a mining company that has all kinds of inherent risks  Another bigger picture reason is the increasing insolvency and  therefore  illiquidity of the world at large  You see that in the compression of P E ratios and not only in the gold sector  When people grasp that it is gold mining companies  not the Federal Reserve  that are creating real money  the P E ratios of the gold mining companies will go to the moon  But until that confidence barrier is broken  a lot of mining companies will struggle  Adding to the problem for juniors is that money is not flowing down the food chain from the big guys to the juniors  TGR  True  The majors were the flag bearers  and they were consistent  But majors like Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd   AEM TSX  AEM NYSE   Goldcorp Inc   G TSX  GG NYSE  and Barrick Gold Corp   ABX TSX  ABX NYSE  all have issues  from Goldcorp s lower production estimates to Barrick s management turnover  Is this an issue of investor confidence  JT  Yes  Mining is an extremely difficult business  very capital intensive  The majors have to find and produce more ounces  but where  The low hanging fruit was picked decades ago  It is increasingly difficult to keep the reserves at levels that would allow continued production  Most CEOs of gold mining companies do not understand their product  Rob McEwen  founder of Goldcorp  being an exception  They do not understand that they are minting real money  They do not talk about their product that way  Granted  it probably would not be politically feasible to talk that way  but many are comfortable paying the promoters of gold jewelry to promote gold as jewelry  Gold gains its value from being a monetary asset  not from jewelry  Boom and bust periods are a problem for the industry as a whole  We had a 20 year bear market in gold  during which very little production or exploration was done  Now  when I visit gold mines  I find guys are coming out of retirement because they are the only ones who have the skills and knowledge needed  I like companies that might not be the biggest  but that can grow organically  I like the 100 000 oz  100 Koz  producers that have a chance to grow up to 3 5 Moz producers and do it organically  TGR  Yamana Gold Inc   YRI TSX  AUY NYSE  YAU LSE  recently offered  4 26 share for Extorre Gold Mines Ltd   XG TSX  XG NYSE A  E1R FSE   A year ago  Extorre traded around  14 share  Will we see more cherry picking takeovers like this  JT  Yes  indeed  This is one reason I am so much more bullish on the producers  They have the cash flow and they can buy it  The explorers are losing their share prices and are being cherry picked  I wish it were otherwise  because my focus has always been on the juniors and the explorers  This is not a good time for companies that need to raise high risk capital so they can put holes in the ground to see if they have gold or not  I am guessing there will be a lot of dead bodies littering the landscape  many more than in 2008 and 2009  TGR  In mid March  you exited 75  of your equity positions to build a cash position  How did you decide which companies to keep  and what did they have in common  JT  I have a hypothetical model portfolio  and I just reweighted it and sold a few shares  It is hard for me to sell these stocks because I think they are intrinsically good  But the market is no longer willing to pay what it used to for these companies  The price Yamana got for Extorre is a good example  TGR  How do you rank the companies in your portfolio  JT  I re weighted the portfolio toward what I call my A 1 companies  These are companies in commercial production  Almost all of them are cash flow positive and have growth prospects  We keep about 50  of the gold share portfolio in the A 1 companies  My A 2 companies have done feasibility or scoping studies  They have a deposit that appears to be economically viable and are second tier in terms of risk versus reward  My A 3 companies have delineated a deposit and have an NI 43 101 resource or a measurable  historical resource  but have not done the economics  There is no high level of confidence that the A 3 companies can produce gold profitably  The A 4 companies have not yet measured a resource  but have some geological promise and probably some drill holes or surface samples that suggest something real  We look at the liquidity of A 3 and A 4 companies every quarter  Do they have enough working capital to keep the lights on without more capital  Can they raise that capital  How close are they to outlining a viable deposit  If an A 4 can move up into A 3  it becomes less risky  There are best of examples in each category  I like Sandstorm Gold Ltd   SSL TSX V  a lot  It is a streaming company that provides startup capital for companies to get into production  It then buys a percentage of the output at the cost of production at the time the mine goes into production  factored through the life of the mine  Sandstorm Gold and its long term warrants were my No  1 pick this year  My favorite company in the A 3 or A 4 category would be Eurasian Minerals Inc   EMX TSX V   With  30 million in the bank  it has major prospects and a very strong management team  It is supposed to be closing on a royalty company acquisition on some Newmont Mining Corp   NEM NYSE  production in Nevada that would throw out  6M  That would give Eurasian cash flow  plus  one of its gold projects in Australia looks huge  TGR  What are some A 1 companies you like  JT  Petaquilla Minerals Ltd   PTQ TSX  PTQMF OTCBB  P7Z FSE  is my top pick right now  It is very undervalued  selling around  0 38 share  It expects to produce 100 Koz this year  mostly from growth in its Panamanian project  It also has high grade deposits in Spain and Portugal  Petaquilla expects to spin off an infrastructure subsidiary that will build roads and operate power plants in Panama  That is a little dividend for investors  but I just like its long term growth prospects  TGR  Management owns about 12  of the company  and Eric Sprott is an investor  Those are usually good signs  but why is a gold producer selling for  0 38 share  JT  There is some short term debt on the balance sheet  Petaquilla has produced about 50 Koz gold year  If it gets to 100 Koz  as it projects  and maintains its quarterly reports  I think Petaquilla can do extremely well  TGR  It projects 70 Koz gold in its guidance for 2012  JT  It has bigger numbers in mind for 2013  and has the projects to make it happen in Spain and Portugal  as well as expansion in Panama  TGR  Any other names  JT  I would call Sandstorm my No  1 pick among producers because of its streaming model  It has several companies going into production  and the projects it has financed are producing larger amounts of gold on a regular basis  You will see some very substantial growth in earnings without the risk  Because of its streaming model  unlike most mining companies  Sandstorm does not have to pile a certain amount of its capital back into sustaining capital  I also like OceanaGold Corp   OGC TSX  OGC ASX   a New Zealand producer  It is starting production at a gold copper project in the Philippines  using the copper to offset the cost  Right now  it is below zero in terms of production  I believe it is projected to produce 100 Koz year at less than zero costs  which will offset its cost of production in New Zealand  bringing down the overall cost to the company to much lower levels  Dynacor Gold Mines Inc   DNG TSX  is another favorite  It got hit pretty hard when it was unable to explore its Tumipampa project in Peru because of more stringent environmental controls  Its cash flow projections for 2012 are north of  0 15 and it has been selling at around  0 50  It has the cash flow to explore its skarn target at Tumipampa  which could be a very  very large gold copper deposit  TGR  Some of the people at Sandstorm Gold also started Sandstorm Metals   Energy Ltd   SND TSX V   which has performed very poorly  Why is its management team having so many problems  JT  I think it is because the macro conditions warrant extreme bullishness for gold mining producers and bearishness for base metals producers  If you believe as I do that the global economy is going into a depression or a recession  this is not the time to own base metals companies  TGR  What do you think about Allied Nevada Gold Corp   ANV TSX  ANV NYSE A   JT  I bought Allied Nevada at  5 share and sold it somewhere in the  30s  I am looking to buy it back  This company has done everything it said it would  it under promises and over delivers  If it continues to do that  especially when it gets to the sulphide part of its project  it will be an enormous success  The oxide production is already successful  Allied Nevada could produce more than 1 million ounces a year gold equivalent  Moz Au eq  from its Hycroft project at lower costs than it is producing now  TGR  Can Allied triple production at Hycroft by late 2013  JT  Judging from its recent press releases and its track record of exceeding its promises yes  The one risk is that there is very little room for error if anything is wrong with its science or its feasibility work  It is a low grade deposit  but producing the 1 Moz year Au eq  it works out to be close to 25 Moz year silver  The scale is massive  If you come in with just a fraction of a gram less than you expect  you could see a big variance in cash flow and profitability  TGR  Any A 3 and A 4 names  JT  My favorite A 3 name is Eurasian Minerals  a project generator company with projects in Haiti  Turkey  Alaska  Arizona and Nevada  It works with major mining companies  most notably Newmont  and with a number of new guys who are spending millions to earn into those projects  Paramount Gold and Silver Corp   PZG NYSE A  PZG TSX  has deep pockets and lots of money in the bank  It has AMAX Gold Inc  s old Sleeper mine in Nevada and some very promising gold and silver projects in Mexico  Aurvista Gold Corp   AVA TSX V  in Qu bec has on the order of 2 Moz in an open pit  I like the management and some deep pockets are behind the company  Esperanza Resources  EPZ TSX V  also looks really good  It is a gold silver company in Mexico  with strong management behind it  In Brazil  Magellan Minerals Ltd   MNM TSX V  looks good  Sandstorm recently came in and is providing some capital to move it forward  I like Rye Patch Gold Corp   RPM TSX V  RPMGF OTCQX  a lot  although it is in dispute with Coeur d Alene Mines Corp  CDM TSX  CDE NYSE  over claims that Coeur d Alene failed to keep up and Rye Patch grabbed  Pretium Resources Inc   PVG TSX  PVG NYSE  has strong management and a super big  world class gold deposit in northwestern British Columbia  This is an extremely good story  Victoria Gold Corp   VIT TSX V  has about 2 Moz in the Yukon  Pelangio Exploration Inc   PX TSX V  is an A 4 company in Ghana  It is outlining an open pit deposit and a promising underground target that is more elusive and difficult to prove up the ounces on  I like NioGold Mining Corp   NOX TSX V  NOXGF OTCPK  because Aurizon Mines Ltd   ARZ TSX  AZK NYSE A   one of my A 1 companies  is spending a lot of money to develop an underground deposit nearby in Qu bec  I wish I could be more bullish on the A 3s and A 4s  They are doing good work and have a lot of good prospects  But this environment of illiquidity and insolvency issues is hard on them  TGR  Clifton Star Resources Inc   CFO TSX V  C3T FSE  is on your A 3 list  Its Duparquet project has 3 38 Moz  and it recently upgraded some of the reserves from Inferred to Indicated  Is there is room for further expansion there  JT  Absolutely  In another timeframe  with its deposit and new CEO  Clifton Star would be selling at much higher levels  It has a good amount of cash on the books  It needs to develop confidence in the market by continuing to develop and move the project forward  which Michel Bouchard is very good at  There are some metallurgical complexities that make the project a little more difficult  but nothing that cannot be resolved  This is the kind of company that we will have to watch because if it can prove up  it will be a tempting takeover target  If that happens  we hope there will be some competitive cherry picking going on  TGR  Urastar Gold Corp   URS TSX V  URNRF OTCQX  is on your A 4 list  JT  While not denying this is a speculative stock  there are four factors that lead me to consider it to be a very worthy speculation for investors who can afford to tie up capital for an undetermined length of time and who understand the risk reward tradeoff for junior exploration stocks  First  key personnel form the foundation for a strong management team  Second  I believe there is a fairly high likelihood that the company s Antimonio Property in Mexico can host a near surface multimillion ounce gold deposit  Third  I believe that various people who informally stand behind this project have deep pockets and as such increase the probability that  the lights will be kept on  even if market conditions become even more strained  Last  the current market cap makes this a very low cost speculation  Yes  it could go lower  It could be cut in half with continued harsh market conditions  But the upside could be a factor of 10  20  or 30 times the downside risk with exploration success and a turn in the markets  It s difficult to find better A 4 risk reward opportunities than Urastar Gold Corp  at this point  TGR  What would you advise investors holding a portfolio full of underperforming junior mining equities  JT  You want to be able to take advantage when you see some strength as we saw starting in the middle of May  Sell a portion of your holdings and deal in cash  My thesis is that we will go lower  that we will see an insolvency that will require more debt liquidation  People will want their money back from the hedge funds to keep the roof on the house or put the kids through college  I have faith in gold as the ultimate money  The real price of gold has risen dramatically  which has led to real  strong profits for the producers  That makes me confident and is why I believe we are in the gold bull market of a lifetime even though the guys at the bottom end of the food chain are struggling  TGR  Jay  thank you for your time  A baby boomer born in Ohio   was drawn to the world s financial capital in 1973  when he

120323,341838,AEM,Make Money In Gold With Prospect Generator And Royalty Companies,opinion,Adrian Day  principal of Adrian Day Asset Management  which manages portfolios for high net worth clients  believes that it is time for the gold pendulum to swing away from the excessive pessimism in the market and finds that now is an exceptional time to buy gold equities  In this exclusive interview with The Gold Report  Day explains why gold is ready to rebound and why prospect generator and royalty companies are king  The Gold Report  Some investors think that we won t see gold stocks come back in a big way  What do you say to them  Adrian Day  With regard to the seniors  we are not going to return to the valuations that gold stocks have traditionally enjoyed  gold stocks selling for 40  50  60 times earnings  With regard to the juniors  we ve had this sentiment before  The juniors are incredibly volatile  and we go through these periods of excessive optimism and excessive pessimism  At the end of 2008  clients called me  wanting to go 100  to cash because they thought these juniors were finished  The key is to buy quality companies with quality management and strong balance sheets and then  even if it takes another year or two  you know they re going to survive  TGR  In July  Petroliam Nasional Berhad  PETRONAS  and CNOOC Ltd   CEO NYSE   large Asian oil companies  paid a combined  20 billion  B  for two Canadian oil and gas companies  Nexen Inc   NXY TSX  NXY NYSE  and Progress Energy Resources Corp   PRQ TSX   both of which were thought to be undervalued  Do you believe some of that Asian wealth could find its way into mining takeovers  AD  Not surprisingly  energy is the prime target because that s the basis for producing every other resource  But China  Korea  Japan and other Asian countries are looking also at bigger copper assets because there s a shortage of supply long term  and these countries are at that point in their economic development when copper is at its highest demand  They use copper a lot for construction  real estate and infrastructure  TGR  Lupaka Gold Corp   LPK TSX  LPKGF OTCPK  LQP FSE  and Andean American Gold Corp   AAG TSX V  ANMCF OTCPK  merged because each company has something the other needs  Do you expect to see more mergers like that  AD  One of the problems we ve seen in the past decade  not just in gold but also in a lot of resources  is big companies buying small ones for no reason other than to get bigger  and overpaying for the privilege  That is changing  But where there is a syngergy  then yes  we will see more mergers  TGR  Canada s Globe and Mail published a story July 13 that Kinross Gold Corp   K TSX  KGC NYSE  was a likely target for Barrick Gold Corp   ABX TSX  ABX NYSE   Do you believe there s any truth to that  AD  I would be surprised  Barrick has a new CEO  there is investor concern about its acquisition of Equinox Minerals Ltd   EQN TSX  EQN ASX  last year I would think that new management would want to consolidate before it starts getting aggressive buying something else  and Kinross would be considered reasonably aggressive  Barrick has quite a lot on its plate right now with Pascua Lama and Pueblo Viejo  Pueblo Viejo left a nasty legacy from its last incarnation  so it will be a slow start up  TGR  In your book Investing in Resources  How to Profit from the Outsized Potential and Avoid the Risks  Wiley  2010   you said that majors often focus on a single property when they re looking at takeovers  and you even suggested some takeover targets  Sunridge Gold Corp   SGC TSX V   Nevsun Resources Ltd   NSU TSX  NSU NYSE A   Esperanza Resources Corp   EPZ TSX V   Vista Gold Corp   VGZ NYSE A  VGZ TSX  and MAG Silver Corp   MAG TSX  MVG NYSE   None of those companies has received takeover offers yet  Do you believe those companies remain targets  AD  Many of them  But with the prices that we ve seen recently  several juniors with attractive properties have essentially taken themselves off the market for now  Exeter Resource Corp   XRC TSX  XRA NYSE A  EXB FSE  is a good example  with its big property up in the Andes  I think Sunridge is still a potential target  It s got a very attractive property  It s got low capital expenditures  capex   It s fairly advanced  It s done prefeasibility studies on all five deposits  The stock itself is extremely cheap  And it s got a lot of cash  Two potential downsides  It s in Eritrea  and that scares many companies  and it s mostly copper  not gold  Sunridge s numbers are astonishing  The one deposit  Debarwa  has a net present value of  71 million  M   so it s small  But it s got an internal rate of return of 41   a payback of 1 1 years and a 140M capex  MAG Silver is another target still  it has a joint venture  JV  with Fresnillo Plc  FRES LSE   which would be a natural buyer  No one is likely to buy the whole of Vista  but its individual projects are targets  And we ve already seen some JVs  Yellow Pine is now part of Midas Gold Inc   MAX TSX   Vista owns a significant chunk of shares in Midas  In Mexico  Vista brought in a JV partner on the Concordia project  TGR  You suggest in your book that anytime the ratio of the Philadelphia Gold and Silver Index  XAU   which is the gold and silver index traded on the Philadelphia Exchange  to the gold price is five times or higher  it s a good time to buy gold companies  As of July 23 the ratio was almost 11 1  Does that mean that rule of thumb needs an adjustment  or does it mean that it s an exceptional time to buy gold companies  AD  A little bit of both  The S P TSX Global Gold Index is now at its cheapest level relative to bullion since 1986  the beginning of the bear market  The XAU Index of senior North American gold and silver stocks is now cheaper than the S P  I can t remember a time when the gold stocks were cheaper than the broad market  Look at Barrick  for example  which is the largest gold producer  Seven times earnings multiple  2 5  yield  1 3 times book value  It s got 27  debt to assets  which is low for a capital intensive industry  Even if you didn t know what the company did and you were a value investor  you would be looking at it  We have to recognize that  for the most part  gold companies have not been well managed companies over a long period of time  They ve generated horrible returns  overpaid for acquisitions and management has issued too much dilutive equity  Ten years ago  if you were a generalist interested in gold  you looked at the big mining companies and you hoped that the gold price would bail you out and take care of all the problems  Now there s competition from the exchange traded funds  ETFs   An investor can buy an ETF and get direct exposure to gold without worrying about cost overruns  overpaying  dilution and everything else  The more the big companies fail whether it s Kinross  Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd   AEM NYSE   Newmont Mining Corp   NEM  NYSE   Barrick and the Equinox acquisition  Goldcorp Inc   G TSX  GG NYSE   the latest to announce a big reduction in its annual production and a huge increase in its costs the more big investors simply turn to gold itself  We shouldn t forget that mining is a difficult business  But mining companies have not been their own best friends  and investors are becoming more and more unforgiving of corporate errors simply because there is an alternative now  Over the last 12 months  the big companies seem to be getting the message  The move toward mining companies paying dividends  for example  is part of their response to the accusations of fiscal irresponsibility  We re not going back to the days of the XAU selling at 60 70 times earnings multiples  because now there s competition  ETFs  which there wasn t in the past  TGR  How does a 30  rise in the gold price mean a 140  increase in the margin of a major producer  AD  If the price at which you sell your product goes up at a faster rate than your costs  that s when you get the leverage  For example  when gold is selling at  800 ounce  oz  and your costs are  600 oz  you ve got a 20  margin  If gold goes to  1 200 oz and your costs go up to  800 oz  you ve now got a 50  margin  In the last five years  we ve seen costs go up dramatically  for energy  which is the major component for mining  labor  mercury  truck tires  currencies  For instance  if a Canadian company has mines in Brazil and Australia  until recently  those currencies were both going up a lot more than the Canadian dollar  The margins were pretty static from 2001 all the way through to the end of 2008 we didn t get any leverage expansion at all  TGR  What about dividend yields  Are your clients seeking yield  AD  My clients are certainly seeking yield  but I don t buy gold stocks for dividends  TGR  Even with Newmont at 4   AD  If I don t like the company  no  And in order to grow their very capital intensive business  gold companies need the cash themselves  so why are they giving dividends  But dividends can exert a certain financial discipline on companies  And to quote my friend Doug Casey  dividends are an outward sign of inward grace  So  a company that pays a dividend consistently is doing something right  TGR  What are your favorite large cap gold companies  AD  By far  Franco Nevada Corp   FNV TSX   It s not the cheapest  but I like the model  It s a royalty company  and royalties tend to be low risk  they also give you exposure to the upside through production increases and exploration success  Franco Nevada has top management   1B in cash on the balance sheet  diversified assets and a very good pipeline  Its recent revenue increases have come from the increase in the price of gold  and also from acquisitions  Interestingly  they ve also come from old legacy assets that are finally generating revenue  Some of these are new properties coming into production  on which Franco Nevada has a royalty  so it starts earning money  But they re also net profit royalties rather than net smelter  Finally  the mine becomes profitable so it starts earning some money from the royalty  Franco Nevada has about 210 220 mineral assets  not counting oil and gas  about 40 of which are currently producing  CEO David Harquail said that another 24 of them have  reasonable potential  to commence production in the next five years  The problem is  even though the dividend payment has gone up consistently over the years  the stock price has gone up more  so the yield is not particularly attractive  Of the others  I like Goldcorp  despite the lower production estimates of this year  It s got a very good balance sheet   1 2B  It s got a very strong pipeline  which includes a 30  interest in Barrick s property we were talking about earlier in the Dominican Republic  Pueblo Viejo  It includes Eleanor in Qu bec  which is a property on which Virginia Mines Inc   VGQ TSX  has a royalty  We own 5  of Virginia  Barrick is cheap right now  The management change is positive  People know Jamie Sokalsky he s been with Barrick a long time  The company needs to make the corporate strategy clear to the market  because buying  arguably overpaying for  a copper company in Africa when you re a gold company and you ve just spun out all your African assets really has people scratching their head  The gold stocks are very underowned and oversold right now  There s very negative sentiment  One of the ways you can look at that is by looking at the calls  Traditionally  if you buy a call on a gold stock  you pay an enormous premium  You re not doing that anymore you can buy calls one or two years out at very reasonable prices  So  that s an indication  When gold moves back up to  1 700 oz  toward  1 800 oz and generalists start to look at gold again  a lot of the money will go into SPDR Gold Shares  GLD   the largest gold ETF  but a lot of the money will go into the big stocks like Barrick  Newmont  which has a dividend and a huge long term pipeline  and Yamana Gold Inc   YRI TSX  AUY NYSE  YAU LSE   which has a lot of growth potential  TGR  Let s focus this on another segment of the business that you like  the prospect generator model  In your book  you illustrate your point by noting that some prospect generators actually end the exploration season with more money than when they started due to the various JV agreements that they have in place  What is this model  and how do the good prospect generator companies make it work  AD  As the name implies  these are exploration companies that generate prospects  They then tend to JV those projects with companies with money to spend  The generation of prospects  while not easy  is not high cost  When the prospect generators get to the high cost point of exploration and development  they look for a partner to spend the money  I like the model because it enables the exploration company to maintain its balance sheet  It doesn t have to keep going back to issue new dilutive equity  and it s able to build portfolios of exploration projects  Consider companies that have been around a little while  like Virginia and Almaden Minerals Ltd   AMM TSX  AAU NYSE   and have interest in not just three or four properties but 10 and 20 properties  It s a little bit like owning shares in lots of lottery tickets instead of just one whole lottery ticket  It increases your odds of discovery in what is a very long odds enterprise  looking for a gold discovery  It s said that only 1 in 5 000 anomalies ever becomes a mine  The prospect generator model doesn t guarantee success  but it means that the company can stay alive to fight another day  How do the good prospect generators make it work  They maintain discipline to the model so that they maintain their balance sheets  and they strike good JV agreements  meaning they maintain the greatest share of their property while incentivizing the other company to spend money  TGR  What prospect generators are you most fond of at the moment  AD  Midland Exploration Inc   MD TSX V  is also out of Qu bec but is much smaller than Virginia we own 5  of it  The market cap is a little under  30M  It s got five active JVs with companies like Agnico and Osisko Mining Corp   OSK TSX   It s got  4 5M in cash  which for a company of its activity is plenty it doesn t need to raise any more money  Almaden has great people  just as Virginia has Andr  Gaumond and Midland has Gino Roger  the Poliquin father and son team is widely respected in the industry  both as technically competent and as honest  Almaden also has a super strong balance sheet  It s got about  22M in cash   2 5M worth of gold bullion and about  15M in shares of exploration companies  It s got multiple projects  primarily in British Columbia and Mexico  At least two of those  Elk in B C  and Caballo Blanco in Mexico  are advancing toward production in the near term  Ixtaca  a gold silver project in eastern Mexico  is probably the most prospective property  The company has drilled 135 holes and counting  It is publishing its first resource estimate in September  That could potentially give the stock a good boost  Almaden right now is selling at  2 13 share  the market cap is  124M  I find that remarkably inexpensive  And the stock has come down a lot  Last July it was over  5 share  At  124M  with  40M in cash and near cash and being cash flow positive  I think that s a steal  Eurasian Minerals Inc   EMX TSX V  has a very strong balance sheet and a wide portfolio of properties from Russia and Australia to Arizona and Haiti  I like Evrim Resources Corp   EVM TSX V  my management clients own 5   It is only a couple of years old now  It acquired the Mexican assets of Kiska Metals Corp   KSK TSX V  when Kiska started focusing on the Whistler property in Alaska  It s got four joint ventures now  I like Miranda Gold Corp   MAD TSX V  my company owns 5  of that  Miranda is a good example of a company that can do everything right and still not yet have that big discovery  But if you buy Miranda now you re buying a relatively cheap company with a good balance sheet and exposure to a lot of highly perspective properties that other people are spending the money on  It just announced an exploration alliance in Colombia  Riverside Resources Inc   RRI TSX  is mostly in Mexico  Good management  I could say good management and good balance sheet on all of these  by the way  Reservoir Minerals Inc   RMC TSX V   which was a spinoff of Reservoir Capital Corp   REO TSX V   is another one that my company owns quite a bit of we re 5  owners  It just had a spectacular drill hole in a JV with Freeport McMoRan Copper   Gold Inc   FCX NYSE  in Serbia The stock price doubled the day that was announced  Altius Minerals Corporation  ALS TSX V  and Lara Exploration Ltd   LRA TSX V  are two non gold ones that are good  TGR  We re seeing a big selloff in Western markets as Spanish bond yields are at record euro era levels  and there are whispers that Germany could force Greece out of the Eurozone  Is now the time to head to the royalty model  which is likely the lowest risk play in the gold space  AD  I ve always liked the royalty companies because they are a low risk model  In this business  you have enough risk to begin with  whether it s misappropriation or the geology not turning out the way you thought it was going to turn out  And I ve always felt  if you buy really good quality companies  not just in resources  but in everything  where you are focused on the downside  the upside takes care of itself  When gold goes to  2 500 oz  the quality companies will move  You don t have to worry about it  That s one reason that companies like Franco Nevada and Royal Gold Inc   RGLD NASDAQ  RGL TSX  are not as cheap as some of the mining companies  They are lower risk and people are buying them right now  TGR  Do you have any other advice for investors  AD  Number one  understand what you know and what you don t know  If you re not a geologist  don t try to be one  Focus on the things you can understand  like a business model  management  balance sheets  Number two  stick with quality  I would rather pay up to quality then underpay for junk  Number three  buy when nobody else is buying  If you buy quality junior gold stocks right now  you may have to wait a painful six months  but you

120326,341841,AEM,Gold Mining Stocks Continue To Disappoint But Not For Long,opinion,It is an endless debate for investors interested in gold  Should they buy a direct play on the gold price  either gold bullion itself or even so called paper gold with an ETF such as the SPDR Gold Shares  NYSEARCA GLD   Or should they invest into gold equities  particularly the larger  higher quality gold mining companies   Recent history suggests the answer is gold itself  According to Citigroup  NYSE C   physical gold has outperformed global gold equities 120  percent of the time over the past 5 years  Stocks of the bigger gold mining firms seem to react adversely to bad news  which is normal   but the problem is they react with no more than a yawn to good news  These type of stocks are contained in the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF  NYSEARCA GDX   Evidence of this trend can been see in the latest news to hit the industry the slowdown in expansion as recently signaled by the world s largest gold producer  Barrick Gold  NYSE ABX   The company s stock has fallen by more than 30 percent over the last year due to cost overruns at major projects  The latest blowup in costs of up to  3 billion occurred in its estimate for development of its flagship Pascua Lama project on the border of Chile and Argentina  The project may now cost up to  8 billion   In addition  Barrick decided to shelve the  6 billion Cerro Casale in Chile and the  6 7 billion Donlin Gold project in Alaska  Barrick is not alone in its thinking among the major gold producers  The CEO of Agnico Eagle Mines  NYSE AEM   Sean Boyd  recently said  The era of gold mega projects may be fading  The industry is moving into an era of cash flow generation  yields and capital discipline    Fair enough  But are gold mining companies  management walking the walk about yields or just talking the talk  Last year  many of the larger miners made major announcements that they would be focusing on boosting their dividends to shareholders in an attempt to attract new stockholders away from exchange traded vehicles such as GLD  which have siphoned demand away from gold equities  Barrick  for example  did boost its dividend payout by a quarter from the previous level  Newmont Mining  NYSE NEM   which has also cut back on expansion plans  has pledged to link its dividend payout to the price of gold bullion   So in effect  the managements at the bigger gold mining companies  which are having difficulties growing  are trying to move away from attracting growth only investors to enticing investors that may be interested in high dividend yields  This is a logical move   But rising costs at mining projects may put a crimp into the plans of gold mining companies  as they may not have the cash to raise dividends much  And they have done a poor job of raising dividends for their shareholders to date  In 2011 the dividend yields for gold producers globally was less than half the average for the mining sector as a whole at a mere 1 3 percent  Their yields are below that of the base metal mining sector and the energy sector   It seems like management for these precious metal companies have the similar emotional response shareholders have when they are in a winning position  When the investor s brain has experienced a winning streak and is happy it automatically goes into preservation protection mode  What does this mean  It means management is going to tight up their spending to stay cash rich as they do not want to give back the gains during a time of increased uncertainty  Smaller bets investments are what the investor s brain is hard wired to do which is not always the right thing to do   Looks like there is still a lot work to be done by gold mining companies to improve returns to their shareholders  But with all that set aside  it is important to realize that when physical gold truly starts another major rally  These gold stocks will outperform the price of gold bullion drastically for first few months   Gold Miner Trading Conclusion  In short  last week s special report on gold about how gold has been forming a major launch pad for higher prices over the past year  Gold bullion has held up well while gold miner stocks have given up over 30  of their gains  If when gold starts another rally I do feel gold miner stocks will be the main play for quick big gains during the first month or two of a breakout  The increased price in gold could and value of the mining companies reserves could be enough to get management to start paying their investors a decent dividend which in turn would fuel gold miner shares higher   Both gold and silver bullion prices remain in a down trend on the daily chart but are trying to form a base to rally from which may start any day now  Keep your eye on precious metals going into year end ,2012-08-14,Chris Vermeulen,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gold-mining-stocks-continue-to-disappoint-but-not-for-long-132877,132877
120331,341846,AEM,How To Optimize Your Gold Portfolio  Ron Struthers,opinion,Ron Struthers has crunched the numbers and his indicators are telling him the gold markets are poised for a big jump up  The editor of Struthers  Resource Stock Report called a double bottom in July and is ready to deploy his liquid reserves so he will be ready for the next bounce  In this exclusive interview with The Gold Report  he makes recommendations for optimal portfolio diversification and names some junior companies set to take off  The Gold Report  Last November  you  about indicators you use to make investment decisions  mentioning the S P 500  the PHLX Gold Silver Sector Index  NASDAQ XAU   the AMEX Gold BUGS Index  NYSE HUI  and the TSX Venture Exchange  You recently predicted junior explorer stocks would stay low over the summer before recovering  along with the commodity price  What indicators are behind that  and do you foresee a dramatic rise or a gradual slope  Ron Struthers  We have seen a downward correction in the market space  a deflation scare because of Europe  and that has been the theme for some time a battle between deflation and inflation while central banks print money to make up for a contraction in money because of imploding debt and slowing economies  But everything has corrected substantially  the senior gold stocks bottomed in May  and since then  gold has gone sideways  Gold stocks and the S P 500 have rallied  but we ve only seen part of a potential summer rise so far  Now the S P 500 is at 1 400 and the high before the correction was 1 420  There will be substantial resistance  but the S P 500 should rise above that  On the correction  the S P held its 200 day moving average and bounced off  forming pretty close to a perfect doji star reversal pattern  That s a strong candlestick indicator of a major bottom  With gold stocks measured by the AMEX Gold BUGS Index  we ve seen the same doji star reversal pattern  that is a dark  down candle in a downtrend  followed the next day by a doji cross indicating indecision and the third day a long up or white candle   thus the predicted bottom during the early summer  A nice rally went into mid June  came back down in mid July and then bottomed close to the May bottom but above it  which makes sense  since the doji star reversal pattern indicates a bottom  The July lows were close enough for a double bottom  meaning we have a strong base to rise from  I closely watch the old Reuters Commodity Index  referred to as the Reuters Continuous Commodity Index  CCI   which has a strong correlation with the TSX Venture Exchange  It has been a constant measure of the same baskets of commodities and weighting  the only index for longer term analysis  Most of the mainstream is fooled by the new Reuters CRB Index that is widely quoted in the mainstream press  It became a black box algorithm in 2005  constantly adjusting weightings every month  giving the perception of a better performing index  But that s far from the truth it s just another modification to mask the inflation rate  In addition  the Federal Reserve will probably hold off quantitative easing  QE  until after the election  It wants to maintain the illusion of being unbiased and doesn t want to be seen as affecting the election  After its September meeting  something could change  it could argue that changes won t have an effect until after the election  but for now  it will stay the course and use the QE3 when they really have to after the election  TGR  You say it is easy to outmaneuver automatic trading systems  Does that impact the junior market  where volumes are lower and volatility can be affected  RS  It is surprising that computer trading has entered the smallest juniors  even the thinly traded nickel and dime stocks  but computer trading is taking advantage of their volatility  With these little stocks  the programs look for ways to come between the buy and the sell and skim pennies  It sounds like nothing  but it is happening with thousands of stocks daily  Computer trading is also active in the higher priced juniors with more volume  trading between  0 50 and a few dollars a share  you will also see this with the huge amount of 100 share trades  Something else happens with computers  but is attributed less often to automatic trading  that is severely shorting the junior gold stocks  In the past  we have seen short trading on the senior and midtier gold stocks  but now we see a lot of shorting on junior producers  too  For instance  New Gold Inc   NGD TSX  NGD NYSE A  has 10  of its stock shorted  and Argonaut Gold Inc   TSX AR  has 14   We never would have imagined that in the past  so I am closely watching the short positions  Strangely  most of the short positions came at the bottom of the market in May  June  so it won t take much to put them underwater  and short covering could add fuel to a rally  There has been a big increase in computer trading  there are more professional traders in the market and fewer retail investors  There are also more exchange traded funds that hedge in a lot of these stocks  With the extensive shorting  we are either seeing intervention in the gold stocks or the reflection of strong beliefs that the gold bull market is over  However  in the latter case  they will be proven wrong  and that is why short covering could be substantial  TGR  Last year you were liquidating your portfolio  based in part on the jump in the price in silver  and by extension  gold  Silver is now at  28 ounce  oz  and gold is still around  1 600 oz  How are you adjusting your portfolio to fit this new reality  RS  Gold and silver often rally together and both are in short physical supply and highly leveraged the same ounce of gold or silver has been sold 50 100 times  We are in a currency war  Countries are fighting to keep the fast moving money in their currency to prop up their huge debt loads  gold and silver are competing currencies  The U S  has intervened to keep interest rates low  trying to keep the system afloat and intervening to keep the stock market up  but commodities and gold lower  Europe is doing the same thing  Meanwhile  a lot of Eastern countries  with huge U S  dollar and euro reserves  are trying to diversify out of these debt ridden currencies into other currencies  including gold  Every month we see news of mostly Eastern central banks including India  China  Russia  and Korea  etc  buying gold Physical gold is in short supply  but they know the price is being held down with intervention in the paper commodities market  We are seeing a continuous flow of gold from the West to the East  the same thing that sparked the big rally in the late 1970s to 1980  This will happen again  it just depends on when the West does not want to give up any more physical gold to the East  at least at these prices  In that case  we will soon see gold move easily above  2 000 oz  taking silver higher with it  TGR  How high could silver go  RS  It will hit resistance at  50 oz again  but eventually it will break through  If that does not happen on this next rally  it will on the next one  We are speaking in dollar inflated terms   50 oz was the high from 1980  and we still are not above that  but gold has gone up well above the 1980 high of about  850 oz  TGR  What percentage of your portfolio do you have in cash versus stocks  and juniors versus mid and large caps  RS  It has been about the same since 2008  adjusted a bit here and there  but we keep about 20  in physical gold and silver  keep cash up around 30  because of uncertain times  and then keep about another 15 20  in good dividend stocks  With the low interest rates  some good dividend interest is great  These dividend companies have served as pillars of strength in our portfolio during this period  I devised what I call a Millennium index of dividend stocks we use to invest here  The last 30  or so we invest in gold stocks  mining and energy stocks  TGR  Are you looking mainly at gold juniors or producers  RS  I have a mixture  I have about 20  in the senior and midtier golds  There is a lot of leverage in the junior producers and advanced juniors  so I have about 25  in small and emerging producers and another 20  in advanced  We put about 15  into the small exploration plays that seem promising and 20  into some of the energy stocks I call them energy and cleantech  but they can involve some of the other areas  like graphite  TGR  You talked about the leverage available in the juniors what are some of the junior companies that could be successful in the macroeconomic environment we ve just discussed  RS  Right now I m looking at the juniors with a good share structure that can finance when the market improves  ones with good gold deposits and resources and ample cash  and there s a lot of potential takeovers as well  I m also looking at ones moving into production  Urastar Gold Corp   TSX V URS  OTCQX URNRF  is in play  The company is hitting good drill results  Urastar is surrounded by Alamos Gold Inc   TSX AGI  and Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd   TSX AEM  NYSE AEM   and both companies would like the ground to add to their deposits  TGR  So you like Urastar because it is a takeover candidate  RS  Yes  Even though it really does not have a resource yet  a lot of these large companies are loaded with cash  and the juniors are priced so cheaply that you will see mergers and buyouts just based on strategic landholdings  TGR  Urastar is trading at about  0 40 share  Do you see any takeover bids going much higher than that  RS  It wouldn t be much higher in today s market  maybe  0 45 0 50 share  And potentially you could have two companies go for that  However  I couldn t see it going much higher than  0 55 0 60 share  given where it is in exploration  TGR  What other companies do you like  RS  Canaco Resources Inc   TSX V CAN  has a million ounce gold resource and a large land position it hasn t explored yet  The company was trading under cash value at  95 million  M  at the end of May  This allows it to compete and buy out some of the other cheap juniors  too  Roxgold Inc   TSX V ROG  has a lot of cash on hand  The company is getting good drill results and is still going on what will be a good sized and high grade deposit in West Africa  TGR  Roxgold is down quite a bit from where it was even a month ago  Do you see any catalysts that would take it higher  RS  There has been a bit of a positioning battle there with current shareholders perhaps wait on it a bit longer  However  that seems to be concluding  as it sorts itself out with a good outcome  getting some new people  and then getting back to business  Roxgold has a good gold discovery  and it seems there are always battles when there s a good gold discovery  Thus  in one sense the battle is a good sign  TGR  It has a large number of drill results expected in the next couple of months  correct  RS  Yes  the company still has six drill rigs turning it is pretty actively drilling  In time  we should see a continuous flow of drill news and updated resource numbers  Levon Resources Ltd   TSX V LVN  FSE L09  OTC LVNVF  has a large polymetallic discovery in Mexico  It s up to 360 million ounces  Moz  silver and 1 Moz gold with lead and zinc  The company has lots of cash as well  with  56M  Levon is another company that fits the criteria  A new producer is Avino Silver   Gold Mines Ltd   TSX V ASM  NYSE A ASM  FSE GV6   The company is restarting silver production at its Avino mine in Mexico  It also has ample cash and soon will have the cash flow and earnings from mining  The mine was profitable in the past at low metal prices  While costs are higher now  it has electrical grid power for the first time  the grid power to the mine should help costs  A cheaper one is Majescor Resources Inc   TSX V MJX   with a substantial copper gold silver discovery in Haiti  Haiti is not well known for exploration  but it s well known enough that the company s ground is surrounded by Newmont Mining Corp   NYSE NEM  and it has a large exploration budget there as well  TGR  Could Majescor be a takeover target as well  RS  Eventually Newmont could take over  unless Majescor can make a large enough discovery to bring another major in  But Majescor is really on the same trend as Barrick Gold Corp   TSX ABX  NYSE ABX   which made a discovery across the border at Pueblo Viejo in the Dominican Republic  That is more than 25 Moz gold  so that is the potential in this mineral belt shared by the Dominican and Haiti  It is getting good results  Another cheap one is Zonte Metals Inc   TSX V ZON   It is under  0 10 share  but only 20 million shares out  so the market cap is only  1 2M  The company has strong management experience at Linear Gold Corp   TSX LRR   Paramount Gold and Silver Corp   TSX PZG  NYSE A PZG  and Evolving Gold Corp   TSX EVG  OTCQX EVOGF  FSE EV7   Interestingly  Zonte has discovered Carlin style gold mineralization in Newfoundland hosted in a porous shale type rock If future drilling proves a deposit  Zonte won t only have a deposit  its large land position means owning a whole Carlin type trend  I also expect Zonte to take advantage of this market and make some acquisitions of projects or properties  not necessarily other companies  Because of the market situation  vendors are trying to sell all kinds of properties and projects  so it is a very good time for companies to acquire these  Companies can get far better deals for their money and shares than they could six to nine months ago  TGR  They just have to have the money to buy them  RS  Prices have come down so much  companies don t need a lot of money  They can set up deals where they put a little bit down up front and much more down the road if they find something  There are plenty of good projects out there that are at bargain prices  TGR  Do you like any companies working domestically  RS  I follow a number in Nevada  definitely a well known jurisdiction  Asher Resources Corp   TSX V ACN   a junior  has a really nice exploration property there called the King project  with a well defined gold zone on surface and with old adits  Surprisingly it has never seen a drill  Meadow Bay Gold Corp   TSX V MAY  OTCQX MAYGF  has quite a good discovery at the old Atlanta mine in Nevada  with over 500 000 ounces now and that can easily be multiplied with more drilling   also follow Rye Patch Gold Corp   TSX V RPM  OTCQX RPMGF  in Nevada  now it is up to 2 3 Moz  It was able to snatch a bunch of claims from Coeur d Alene s Rochester mine last year that Coeur let lapse by mistake  so there are plenty of good domestic companies  Another one is Otis Gold Corp  s  TSX OOO  OTCBB OGLDF  Kilgore project in Idaho  I think that its stock is beaten down to a dime  and it has a good gold resource close to 1 Moz now  TGR  So what advice would you give an investor who wonders what to do going into the fall  RS  Always diversify  Returning to my portfolio weightings  keep a good cash cushion because if you don t have cash  you don t want to sell at potentially depressed prices to raise it  Keep 20  in physical gold and silver you know you have it in your possession or something like the Central Fund of Canada  NYSE CEF  TSX CEF U   which has been around a while and is audited  so you know the gold it is actually there  Many exchange traded funds and gold are so leveraged that I am worried a lot of people have ended up paying for the same gold ounce  and you don t want to be one of them if the financial system falls apart further  Dividend stocks are also a good idea  it is nice to have income coming into your portfolio  The rest should be in some gold stocks  the juniors  but again diversify  It is good to own 10 15 stocks in that sector  since it can be volatile  especially on the exploration side  You can lose money in some  but if you hit it big in just one or two others  your portfolio s still up substantially  TGR  Thanks for your insights    editor of Struthers  Resource

120335,341850,AEM,Timing The Gold Bull,opinion,The question of when gold s long awaited ascent will happen is not without precedence  A similar question is still being asked by the Jews concerning the appearance of the Messiah  Prediction has always been an inexact science  TIMING MARKETS AND TIMING GOLD In my book    I quote market timer and industry insider  Rick Ackerman   the stock market is a rigged game  It really is just a giant carny game  one in which there are only predator and prey  and precious few big winners  Wall Street s best and brightest may have more teeth and fewer tattoos than carny men  but they employ essentially the same skills in separating the gullible from their hard earned dollars  Both try to convince us that  Everybody goes home a winner   even though we know better  We always imagine ourselves winning the big stuffed panda  even though we know we ll be lucky to take home a pack of Marlboros or a Luke Skywalker keychain Ackerman s cynical comments are a result of his 12 years experience as a market maker on the floor of the Pacific Stock Exchange  That markets are rigged  however  doesn t mean that hedged  educated and often accurate predictions cannot be made  In fact  Ackerman s newsletter  Rick s Picks  purports to do just that  I first became aware of Ackerman s refreshingly cynical market commentary in the 1990s when he wrote a financial column for the San Francisco Chronicle  It was not  however  until ten years later that I became aware of Ackerman s sometimes astounding accuracy  Tope And BottomsUsing a proprietary technical methodology Ackerman calls  hidden pivots   Ackerman predicts tops and bottoms  i e  turning points  for all markets  i e  commodities  treasuries  stocks  etc  and  in 2006 we had an opportunity to see what Ackerman s hidden pivots could do  In 2006  we were holding warrants issued by Agnico Eagle Mines  Warrants on gold mining shares can often be more volatile than profitable  In March 2006  our warrants had lost 2 3 of their value before gold suddenly began moving upwards  increasing exponentially the value of our warrants in a very short period of time  Warrants  by definition  are time dependent giving buyers the option for a limited time to purchase underlying shares at a predetermined price  and as gold began rising in 2006  the question became  what would be gold s top before it turned down  Gold started its rise in mid March at  535  In April  it moved up past  600 and by the end of the month was nearing  700  The hidden pivot Ackerman predicted for gold s turning point was  715 50 and I remember watching gold s daily move towards Ackerman s hidden pivot  In early May  gold crossed  700  Then on May 11  gold exceeded Ackerman s hidden pivot during inter day trading before dropping to end exactly at  715 50  Ackerman s hidden pivot  The next day  gold rose to  725 00 before beginning a multi week decline  On May 12  we sold our warrants and that summer flew to New York to attend Ackerman s hidden pivot seminar  We wanted to know how anyone could predict with that degree of accuracy  gold s then top  and  at the seminar  Ackerman explained how he had come by his methodology and how it worked  Today  when I was referencing Ackerman s website  in his October 29 newsletter  Ackerman explained his methodology in   The method I use to forecast swing points and trends is the most accurate and powerful I ve discovered in 30 years of trading  It is also by far the simplest  requiring little more than junior high school math to do the necessary calculations  I first learned about this amazingly precise method of analysis from a floor trader on the Pacific Stock Exchange named Ira Tunik  At the time  Ira was using the cycles work of J M  Hurst  a pioneer in the field of technical analysis  to make a very good living on the options floor  When he retired as a pit trader in the late 1980s  he shifted his nest egg mostly into bonds  which at the time were providing annualized returns approaching 10 percent  However  when interest rates began to decline from those cyclical peaks  Ira realized he would need a foolproof trading strategy to live well off his savings without having to dip into principal How does the system work  To start with  I always try to visualize the price movement of stocks  commodities  options and indexes in the perspective of an ABCD pattern such as the one shown above  Unlike Elliott Wave Theory  which is rooted in trend patterns with five legs and corrections with three  my method distills all of the action down to three legs  It also sidesteps the often daunting task of distinguishing corrections from trend moves  Those who are familiar with Elliott Wave Theory know that even EWT experts sometimes bog down in the choppy seas of corrective patterns  Terms such as expanded flats  extended or truncated fifths  double and triple threes  zigzags  and contracting  ascending and descending triangles are all part of Elliott Wave terminology  and they must all be mastered by the chartist who would attempt to forecast accurately and profitably  However  Hidden Pivot strategies  on the other hand  shun such complexities  focusing instead on the most fundamental rhythms of the market  If you can distinguish good art from bad  you can learn the Hidden Pivot Method  Nothing can be predicted with 100  accuracy and Ackerman doesn t make that claim  Heisenberg s Uncertainty Principal is far too ubiquitous a truth for that to occur  Nonetheless  for those not yet committed to buy and hold gold and silver for the long term  Ackerman offers a viable alternative to investing in increasingly unpredictable markets  Caveat  Ackerman s methodology requires a sustained concentration that I don t possess  You may  The FutureBuckminster Fuller was described as a futurist  Of that future  Fuller wrote in 1981 that the world s power structures were about to collapse  but  in that collapse  humanity s vast resources would become available on a scale never before experienced  The introduction to Fuller s The Critical Path was titled Twilight of the World s Power Structures  Fuller wrote   the world s power structures have always  divided to conquer  and have always  kept divided to keep conquered     As a consequence the power structure has so divided humanity not only into special function categories but into religious and language and color categories that individual humans are now helplessly inarticulate in the face of the present crisis  They consider their political representation to be completely corrupted  therefore they feel almost utterly helpless   1981  Buckminster Fuller believed  however  that it was not political and economic systems that needed examination  It was ourselves  that as individuals we needed to examine our own integrity   When we speak of the integrity of the individual  we speak of that which life has taught the individual by direct experience  We are not talking about loyalty to your mother  your friends  your college fraternity  or your boss  who told you how to behave or think  In speaking of truth  we are not talking about the position to take that seems to put you in the most favorable light  If we want the future to be a better future we must be that better future ourselves  Expecting it to be otherwise is as
