6679,228194,ASR,6 Stocks   ETFs To Avoid On Trump s Win ,opinion,"Now that the U S  citizens have elected Republican Donald Trump as their president  the whole world is busy speculating and analyzing the impact of his economic plans on several asset classes  The initial shock resulted in a crash in market futures  though investors nerves soothed in the key trading session following Trump s  acceptance speech 
In fact  several corners of the ETF world saw bountiful gains and hit 52 week highs  But some corners of the investing world are likely to be hit hard  Below we highlight 5 ETFs and stocks that are in a high risk zone now 
Technology
Trump is expected to take stricter steps on immigration and outsourcing   the both pillars that the tech sector stands on  Several technology companies like Apple   NASDAQ AAPL   outsource their manufacturing activities to low cost countries like China and Taiwan  Speculation is rife that  tax will be levied on products manufactured outside the U S  Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF  NYSE XLK   will thus likely come under pressure and lost over 0 1  on November 9  read    
Auto 
The same logic is applicable for the automotive sector too  Companies like Ford Motors   NYSE F   and General Motors   NYSE GM   get their  outsourced from Mexico  So  these companies may also bear the brunt of outsourcing  Moreover  Ford and General Motors normally enjoy huge U S  government  which they might lose in the outsourcing practice  In any case  U S  auto sales declined for the third consecutive month in October  So  the underlying trend for the sector is definitely not upbeat  First Trust NASDAQ Global Auto ETF   NASDAQ Z   was down about 1 9  on November 9  read    
Mexico
Trump s win has by now become synonymous with Mexico s loss  Mexico is a Trump unfriendly investment due to his plans of building a wall along the border as part of his immigration strategy and making Mexico pay for it  read    
Mexico peso slumped over  to a record low on cues of Trump s victory and Mexico ETF iShares MSCI Mexico Capped  was down over 8 5  on November 9  Several Mexican stocks like Grupo Aeroportuario del Sureste  SAB de CV   NYSE ASR   and CEMEX  S A B  de C V    NYSE CX   are now in danger  ASR and CX were down 6 8  and 7 1  respectively on November 9 
Emerging Market
Yet again  the overall emerging market bloc may fall prey to Trump s international policies and trade plans  Already Trump has raised questions over the longevity of trade agreements with Mexico and Canada and has opposed the  trade deal  And since several emerging markets including China are low cost producers and known for outsourcing  migration of services and production back to America may weigh on emerging market growth 
Emerging market ETFs like iShares MSCI Emerging Markets   down over 3 2  on November 9   Asia ETFs like iShares Asia 50   down about 2 8   or stocks like Kandi Technologies Group Inc    NASDAQ KNDI    down 12 4    ZTO EXPRESS  CAYMAN  INC    NASDAQ Z    down about 7 3   and AU Optronics Corp    NYSE AUO    down over 6 1  maythus feel the pinch 
Alternative Energy
With Trump pledging to boost fossil fuel  alternative energy ETFs like PowerShares WilderHill Clean Energy Portfolio ETF   First Trust NASDAQ Clean Edge Green Energy Index Fund  and Guggenheim Solar ETF   LON TAN   will likely be hit hard  PBW  QCLN and TAN lost about 2 1   1 1  and 5 6   respectively  read    
Solar stocks like Vivint Solar  Inc    NYSE VSLR    down 6 3  on November 9   Yingli Green Energy Holding Co  Ltd    NYSE YGE    down 5 3   and JinkoSolar Holding Co  Ltd    NYSE JKS    down over 8 4   are at knifepoint now 
Hospital
As Trump has already vowed to repeal  Obamacare  and launch  Trumpcare    beneficiaries of the Affordable Care Act like Hospital stocks may be under the gun  Hospital stock HCA Holdings  Inc    NYSE HCA   plunged about 10 8  on November 9 On the ETF front healthcare providers fund iShares US Healthcare Providers   NYSE F   ormedical devices fundiShares US Medical Devices  lost about 1 5  and over 1 1   respectively on November 9

6690,228205,ASR,Will Hertz  HTZ  Lose More Ground Post The Q1 Debacle ,opinion,Shares of Hertz Global Holdings Inc    NYSE HTZ   plunged 17 8  in the after hours trading session yesterday  following the company s dismal first quarter 2017 performance  In fact  this Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  stock has crashed 47 6  in the last six months  underperforming the Zacks categorized  industry s growth of 7  Hertz  bearish run is mainly attributable to its disappointing past performance  as the company has lagged bottom line estimates for three consecutive quarters now  thus instilling fears among investors about its future prospects  So  is Hertz  stock in for further trouble Q1 HighlightsThe company posted a quarterly adjusted loss of  1 61 per share  which was wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of  1 00 and also the year ago loss of 79 cents  Results were hurt by weak sales  increased fleet investments and higher spending on tech and brand development On a reported basis  Hertz Global posted a loss per share of  2 69 compared with a loss of 61 cents earned in the prior year quarter Total revenue slipped 3  year over year to  1 916 million  mainly due to soft revenues at the domestic and international segments  However  the company s top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 889 million  thus marking its first beat after two consecutive misses The company posted adjusted EBITDA loss of of  110 million  against profit of  27 million in the year ago period  This reflected weakness at both the segments  attributable to additional expenditure on IT systems  brand development and system enhancements  Also  fleet investments and efforts to realign vehicles dented EBITDA Segment PerformanceHertz reports under U S  Rental Car  U S  RAC   International Rental Car  International RAC  and All Other Operations segments   Revenues for the U S  RAC segment dropped 4  year over year at  1 353 million in the first quarter  owing to a 1  dip in transaction days and 3  decrease in pricing   as measured by Total Revenue per Transaction Day  RPD   While 2016 s Leap day largely accounted for the loss in transaction days  pricing bore the brunt of adverse consumer mix  Also  revenues were hurt by Easter holiday shifting into the second quarter this year Quarterly revenues for the International RAC segment came in at  411 million  down about 5  year over year  including negative foreign currency impact  Excluding currency impact  revenues dropped 4   owing to a 4  reduction in Total RPD  somewhat compensated by a 1  improvement in transaction days  However  revenues at this segment were hampered by the absence of last year s Leap day and 2017 s unfavorable Easter shift  alongside being weighed upon by the termination of various deals in third quarter 2016 Revenues for the All Other Operations segment rose 6  to  152 million  This segment mainly houses Hertz s Donlen leasing operations Financial UpdateHertz  which shares space with Avis Budget Group  Inc    NASDAQ CAR    ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of  785 million  total debt of  14 088 million and shareholders  equity of  918 million Further  the company generated  498 million as cash from operating activities  while delivering negative free cash flow of  31 million in the quarter under review OutlookWhile Hertz performance remained disappointing  the company remains focused on its turnaround plan  which keeps customers at centre stage  Further  the company remains keen on solving issues related to fleet and services  which were the main deterrents this quarter  In this regard  management remains on track to make investments in fleet  services  brand development and technology in 2017  which should help it regain its solid market position Stocks to ConsiderSome better ranked stocks worth considering in the same industry include Grupo Aeroportuario del Sureste  S  A  B  de C  V    NYSE ASR   and Grupo Aeroportuario del Pac fico  S A B  de C V    NYSE PAC    each with a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see Grupo Aeroportuario del Sureste has an average positive earnings surprise of 5 7  in the trailing four quarters

6710,228225,ASR,Still weak Mexican peso prompts bets on tourism,news,"By Dion Rabouin
 Reuters    Mexican airports and tourism operators are fast becoming a hotspot for investors betting they will escape the trade related worries that have squeezed some other assets there  with lingering weakness in the peso seen providing further upside 
While the Mexican currency has gained some 17 percent against the dollar since the inauguration of Donald Trump as U S  president in January  fund managers say the currency is still undervalued even as it moves below 19 pesos per dollar 
That means that Mexico   long a reasonably priced destination for Americans   remains cheap  potentially further boosting a strong inflow of tourists 
The number of international tourists in Mexico climbed 9 percent to 35 million in 2016  a year in which the dollar gained around 20 percent against the peso  according to Mexican Tourism Ministry figures 
A January OECD report linked the growth to  sharp depreciation of the Mexican peso   which had  improved the price competitiveness of tourism exports in Mexico s main source markets  particularly in the important U S  market  
Moody s Investors Service said in a report late last year that it expected further growth in 2017  thanks to a reduction in fuel prices  a strong dollar and increased competition among airlines 
A continued tourism upswing could benefit Grupo Posadas  a Mexican hotel operator  as well as Grupo Aeroportuario del Pacifico  S A B  de C V   MX GAPB   a holding company that operates international airports in the Pacific and Central regions of Mexico and in Jamaica  both of whose bonds Aberdeen Asset Management s emerging market debt fund owns 
 For American tourists     it s cheaper for them to go on holiday now and we don t think Trump s policies are going to prevent the marginal person in the U S  from going on holiday in Cancun   said Kathy Collins  Aberdeen s emerging market debt investment manager 
TOURISM SHINES
Loomis Sayles  emerging markets co portfolio manager Eddy Sternberg is also betting on Grupo Posadas  part of the firm s overweight position in Mexican corporate debt  noting that  with all the Mexican peso depreciation  tourism is doing fabulously  
Grupo Posadas  dollar denominated bonds maturing in 2022 have seen their yields drop 111 basis points since the U S  inauguration and their spread over comparable U S  Treasuries compress 85 basis points during that time 
Aberdeen s Collins favored the tourism sector over others like industrial real estate that she believes could be more affected by Mexican and U S  political developments 
Similarly  Loomis Sayles  Sternberg recently reduced his holdings of Mexican banks because of how exposed they were to Mexico s domestic economy 
Of course  foreign demand is not the only factor contributing to strength in Mexican travel and tourism 
Aaron Visse  who co manages asset management firm Salient s Dividend Signal Strategy portfolios  which focus on emerging market infrastructure investments  said population growth and the emergence of a middle class in Mexico had encouraged him to buy stock in airports  including Grupo Aeroportuario del Sureste SAB CV  MX ASURB  and Grupo Aeroportuario del Pacifico 
Both companies were privatized in the late 1990s and early 2000s as part of a plan to put the airport industry  which operates based on long term concessions handed out by the government  in the hands of private enterprise 
ASR s American depositary receipts have surged 150 percent over the past 5 years compared with 67 percent for the benchmark S P 500 equity index  SPX   Meanwhile  Grupo Aeroportuario del Pacifico has more than quadrupled over the same period  far outpacing the 22 percent gain in Mexico s benchmark IPC index  MXX  during the same period 
 These things have been really compelling long term  total return stories and I think they re really exciting assets in markets like Mexico and others where you re going to continue to see population growth and more emergence of a middle class   Visse said ",2017-04-03,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/still-weak-mexican-peso-prompts-bets-on-tourism-470746,470746

6729,228244,ASR,Is there profit in Mexico s Trump slump  Funds divided,news,"By Dion Rabouin and Sujata Rao  Reuters    The bloodbath in Mexican assets following Donald Trump s unexpected rise to the U S  presidency has some seeing a buying opportunity  Others fear the worst is yet to come  The peso suffered a historic sell off this week on fears Trump s anti free trade rhetoric could turn into policies that would hit Mexico s exports  Mexican stocks suffered their steepest fall in five years and peso bond yields spiked to five year highs  During his campaign  Trump vowed to rewrite or scrap the North American Free Trade Agreement  NAFTA   which has helped Mexico increase its factory exports to the United States eight fold since 1993 to  316 billion a year  Mexico s IPC stock index  MXX  has shed more than 7 percent in the last three days  its worst three day drop since September 2011   Credit Suisse   SIX CSGN  said that after the sell off this week  it was buying Mexican equities  switching back from an underweight position   The Mexican peso is now discounting a correction in the country s global export market share to pre NAFTA levels   Credit Suisse said in a note to clients   The peso has already weakened to reflect U S  related external risks   Templeton emerging market manager Mark Mobius seconded that view in an interview with CNBC   In the case of Mexico  it looks like a great opportunity to buy stocks and the currency is down dramatically   he said  Ricardo Adrogue  head of emerging market debt for Barings  said Mexico was being unfairly punished given that a move toward protectionism by the United States would hit many economies around the world   Even if they specifically target NAFTA  the implications for the Mexican economy would be relatively mild   said Adrogue  adding that Mexican domestic consumption would support growth   IMPOSSIBLE  TO CALL The peso sank to a new record low on Friday of 21 37 per dollar before paring losses to trade at 20 72  By one measure  the peso is about 25 percent cheaper than its 10 year average  nL1N1DC0N3  See graphic  Many strategists think the peso could tumble further given the uncertainty that will weigh over Mexico until Trump takes office and makes clear what his plans are  Nomura forecast the currency could end the year at 25 per dollar   We need to be intellectually honest with ourselves and our clients and accept that calling for any nominal level of interest rates and FX rates in the coming quarters is quite impossible    BNP Paribas   PA BNPP  said in a note  The yield on the country s benchmark 10 year peso bond  MX10YT RR  has shot up more than 1 percentage point in the last three days to bid at 7 23 percent on Friday  its highest since 2011 and its biggest jump since 2008   If foreign investors begin to buy into Mexican debt  it could help limit the peso s slide  But if investors who already hold Mexican peso bonds throw in the towel and sell  it could accelerate the peso s losses as they buy dollars instead  Casey Preyss  a fund manager at William Blair  said he was waiting to see what policies Trump would actually commit to and implement before agreeing if it was a clear buying opportunity  He shed much of his Mexico position earlier this year  but held on to airport operators   The companies that could benefit are Mexican airport operators as Mexico is a popular tourist destination and it became 20 percent cheaper this week   Preyss said  
Mexican airport operators Grupo Aeroportuario Centro Norte  MX OMAB  and Grupo Aeroportuario del Pacifico  MX GAPB  are both down about 10 percent in the last three days  while Grupo Aeroportuario del Sureste  MX ASURB  has shed more than 5 percent ",2016-11-11,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/is-there-profit-in-mexico's-trump-slump -funds-divided-440104,440104
