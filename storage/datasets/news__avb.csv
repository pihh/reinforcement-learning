The region is witnessing favorable demographics trends  solid job growth  higher wages  increased percentage of renters than owners  and favorable migration trends with the influx of workers to its markets  mainly from major East Coast markets  Moreover  due to high cost of homeownership  transition from renter to homeowner is difficult in its markets  In fact  as a result of for sale housing

8135,229650,AVB,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  AvalonBay  Essex Property And Equity Lifestyle,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   August 7  2019   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses Residential REITs  including AvalonBay Communities  Inc    NYSE AVB    Essex Property Trust  Inc    NYSE ESS   and Equity Lifestyle Properties  Inc    NYSE ELS   Industry  Residential REITsLink  Residential real estate investment trusts  REITs  are engaged in owning  developing and managing a variety of residences  These include apartment buildings  student housing  manufactured homes and single family homes  Residential REITs rent space in these properties to tenants and earn a rental income in return The latest  from real estate technology and analytics firm RealPage  Inc   RP  suggest that during the current year s prime leasing period  the U S  apartment rental market was able to capitalize on stellar demand for rental units  Leasing activity accelerated as demand was strong during the second quarter and per the RealPage report  from April through June  net move ins aggregated 155 515 units  which came in 11  higher than the second quarter 2018 product absorption  as well as touched a five year high With an impressive leasing activity  occupancy reached 95 8  during the June end quarter  up from the prior year quarter s 95 4   This upswing in occupancy level amid steady delivery of new units looks encouraging  With occupancy pushing up  rent growth also seems to be steady  In fact  the market achieved a 3  increase in rents from the prior year level  attaining an average of  1 390 per month Here are the three major themes in the industry Stable Economy and Capital Availability  The strength of the economy as well as job market health play key roles in determining residential REITs  performance  Both these factors determine the capacity of rent that renters can shell out  Though economic growth is likely to be less robust this year  the level will remain stable  supporting the industry  And with a healthy job market  household formation and high home ownership costs in several markets hindering transition from renter to homeowner  demand for rental housing units is likely to be decent  Moreover  easy availability of capital and comparatively lower levels of interest rates keep the momentum upbeat  In fact  with REITs relying substantially on debt for business  as well as being considered as a bond substitute for their high dividend paying nature  the central bank s latest move to cut rate gives a reason to rejoice Favorable Demographic Growth  Demographic growth continues to be strong in the young adult age cohort  which has a higher propensity to rent  In fact  a significant change in lifestyle has taken place and life cycle events are getting delayed  This  again  is leading to an extension of the average age of first time homeownership  This age cohort has also witnessed considerable part of net job growth which is helping spur primary renter demand  Additionally  the cohort of ageing millennials is growing at a rapid pace and because of lifestyle choices  this age group currently has lower homeownership rates than the prior generations  Also  there are many in this age group who cannot afford homeownership  As such  demand for rented apartments might remain elevated in the near term  These apart  the student housing sector  which is part of the residential REIT industry  has been witnessing decent demand and pre leasing velocity despite more new student beds Elevated Deliveries of New Units  The struggle to lure renters is feared to continue into the near term as supply volumes might remain aggressive  Currently  construction in the U S  apartment sector remains high and per a  from RealPage  across the U S  more than 526 000 units are under construction and more than 359 000 of those units will be delivered within the next 12 months  Although rental housing demand has been robust in recent times  this high supply volume is a concern because it generally curbs residential landlords  ability to command more rents  and affect occupancy and concession levels  This becomes all the more challenging when demand weakens amid slowdown in economic growth Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Better ProspectsThe Zacks  industry is housed within the broader Zacks  sector  It carries a Zacks Industry Rank  74  which places it at the top 29  of more than 250 Zacks industries The group s   which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks  indicates bright near term prospects  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 The industry s positioning in the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries is a result of positive funds from operations  FFO  per share outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate  Looking at the aggregate FFO per share estimate revisions  it

announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  Unitil Corporation   NYSE UTL    Alliant Energy Corporation   NASDAQ LNT    MGM Growth Properties LLC   NYSE MGP    Mid America Apartment Communities  Inc    NYSE MAA    Brixmor Property Group Inc    NYSE BRX   and AvalonBay Communities  Inc    NYSE AVB   Here are highlights from Tuesday s Analyst Blog 6 Stocks to Buy in an Easy Rate EnvironmentOn Jul 31  Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell announced a 25 basis point rate cut  setting a new target band between 2  and 2 25   The reduction was in keeping with the expectations of market pundits  but failed to live up to investor expectations  Major indexes closed in the red after the Powell made it clear that this was not the beginning of a rate cut cycle However  central bank policymakers kept the door open for future rate cuts  including at least one later this year  This is likely to benefit rate sensitive stocks such as real estate investment trusts  REITs  and utilities  since debt servicing will become much easier for them  Adding these stocks to your portfolio makes for a smart choice Fed Keeps Door Open for Future CutsFollowing the Fed s decision  Powell stated that the decision to reduce rates was attributable to  implications of global developments for the economic outlook as well as muted inflation pressures   At the same time  he stressed that the reduction was only a  midcycle adjustment   Any further decision would depend on the  nature of economic data flowing in  However  Fed policymakers also specified that they will  act as appropriate to sustain the expansion   leaving the door open for future rate cuts Rate Sensitive StocksInterest sensitive stocks are influenced by changes in interest rates  They consist of financial institutions and businesses that pay out high dividends  As we know  stocks in general are sensitive to interest rate changes   lower interest rates mean lower interest rate expenses on borrowed capital  Low interest rate also affects the valuation of businesses Some sectors are particularly benefited by a reduction in interest rates  When interest rates fall  these sectors can provide higher returns to investors as they increase dividends  They are able to do this since they now find it easier to service their debt Utility companies are characterized by long gestation periods and a heavy debt component as far as capital allocation is concerned  What they often lack in share price appreciation is made up by stable dividend flows  A reduction in rates makes debt servicing much easier for such stocks  enabling them to pay out higher dividends REITs also depend heavily on debt fueled financing to drive their businesses  This is why a reduction in rates is equally helpful for them  Such players are also appealing to investors owing to their attractive dividends and strong earnings growth 6 Winning StocksThe Fed has disappointed investors by announcing only a quarter point rate cut  Comments from the Fed chair have also led to concerns about future monetary easing  However  the Federal Reserve has kept the door open for future rate cuts This is why it makes sense to invest in rate sensitive stocks  REITs and utilities not only offer dividends but also are useful during such conditions  We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and other relevant metrics Unitil Corporation is a publicly traded utility company that serves New Hampshire  Massachusetts and Maine with electricity and natural gas Unitil s expected earnings growth for the current year is 4   The

Further  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share is currently pinned at  2 31  indicating 4 5  year on year growth However  the company s activities during the quarter were inadequate to gain analysts  confidence  Consequently  the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the past 30 days Notably  new apartment deliveries are anticipated to have remained elevated in the company s markets during the April June quarter  The high supply is likely to put pressure on rental rates  This apart  high concession activity amid elevated supply is a concern Here is what our quantitative

percentage of renters than owners  and favorable migration trends Nevertheless  apartment deliveries are expected to remain elevated in a number of its markets in the near future  Aggressive rental concessions and moderate pricing power amid high supply are concerns Essex Property currently carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  Essex Property Trust  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

8167,229682,AVB,AvalonBay Communities  AVB  Lags Q2 FFO Estimates,opinion,"AvalonBay Communities  NYSE AVB  came out with quarterly funds from operations  FFO  of  2 27 per share  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 31 per share  This compares to FFO of  2 21 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an FFO surprise of  1 73   A quarter ago  it was expected that this apartment building owner would post FFO of  2 28 per share when it actually produced FFO of  2 30  delivering a surprise of 0 88  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus FFO estimates two times 
AvalonBay  which belongs to the Zacks REIT and Equity Trust   Residential industry  posted revenues of  577 26 million for the quarter ended June 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 80   This compares to year ago revenues of  569 24 million  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future FFO expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
AvalonBay shares have added about 21 2  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 20 2  
What s Next for AvalonBay 
While AvalonBay has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s FFO outlook  Not only does this include current consensus FFO expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for AvalonBay was favorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus FFO estimate is  2 34 on  580 19 million in revenues for the coming quarter and  9 34 on  2 30 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year

8171,229686,AVB,Near Term Outlook For Residential REIT Stocks Looks Upbeat,opinion,"Residential real estate investment trusts  REITs  are engaged in owning  developing and managing a variety of residences  These include apartment buildings  student housing  manufactured homes and single family homes  Residential REITs rent space in these properties to tenants and earn a rental income in return The latest  from real estate technology and analytics firm RealPage  Inc   RP  suggest that during the current year s prime leasing period  the U S  apartment rental market was able to capitalize on stellar demand for rental units  Leasing activity accelerated as demand was strong during the second quarter and per the RealPage report  from April through June  net move ins aggregated 155 515 units  which came in 11  higher than the second quarter 2018 product absorption  as well as touched a five year high With an impressive leasing activity  occupancy reached 95 8  during the June end quarter  up from the prior year quarter s 95 4   This upswing in occupancy level amid steady delivery of new units looks encouraging  With occupancy pushing up  rent growth also seems to be steady  In fact  the market achieved a 3  increase in rents from the prior year level  attaining an average of  1 390 per month Here are the three major themes in the industry Stable Economy and Capital Availability  The strength of the economy as well as job market health play key roles in determining residential REITs  performance  Both these factors determine the capacity of rent that renters can shell out  Though economic growth is likely to be less robust this year  the level will remain stable  supporting the industry  And with a healthy job market  household formation and high home ownership costs in several markets hindering transition from renter to homeowner  demand for rental housing units is likely to be decent  Moreover  easy availability of capital and comparatively lower levels of interest rates keep the momentum upbeat  In fact  with REITs relying substantially on debt for business  as well as being considered as a bond substitute for their high dividend paying nature  the central bank s latest move to cut rate gives a reason to rejoice Favorable Demographic Growth  Demographic growth continues to be strong in the young adult age cohort  which has a higher propensity to rent  In fact  a significant change in lifestyle has taken place and life cycle events are getting delayed  This  again  is leading to an extension of the average age of first time homeownership  This age cohort has also witnessed considerable part of net job growth which is helping spur primary renter demand  Additionally  the cohort of ageing millennials is growing at a rapid pace and because of lifestyle choices  this age group currently has lower homeownership rates than the prior generations  Also  there are many in this age group who cannot afford homeownership  As such  demand for rented apartments might remain elevated in the near term  These apart  the student housing sector  which is part of the residential REIT industry  has been witnessing decent demand and pre leasing velocity despite more new student beds Elevated Deliveries of New Units  The struggle to lure renters is feared to continue into the near term as supply volumes might remain aggressive  Currently  construction in the U S  apartment sector remains high and per a  from RealPage  across the U S  more than 526 000 units are under construction and more than 359 000 of those units will be delivered within the next 12 months  Although rental housing demand has been robust in recent times  this high supply volume is a concern because it generally curbs residential landlords  ability to command more rents  and affect occupancy and concession levels  This becomes all the more challenging when demand weakens amid slowdown in economic growth Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Better

8172,229687,AVB,6 Stocks To Buy In An Easy Rate Environment,opinion,On Jul 31  Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell announced a 25 basis point rate cut  setting a new target band between 2  and 2 25   The reduction was in keeping with the expectations of market pundits  but failed to live up to investor expectations  Major indexes closed in the red after the Powell made it clear that this was not the beginning of a rate cut cycle However  central bank policymakers kept the door open for future rate cuts  including at least one later this year  This is likely to benefit rate sensitive stocks such as real estate investment trusts  REITs  and utilities  since debt servicing will become much easier for them  Adding these stocks to your portfolio makes for a smart choice Fed Keeps Door Open for Future CutsFollowing the Fed s decision  Powell stated that the decision to reduce rates was attributable to  implications of global developments for the economic outlook as well as muted inflation pressures   At the same time  he stressed that the reduction was only a  midcycle adjustment   Any further decision would depend on the  nature of economic data flowing in  However  Fed policymakers also specified that they will  act as appropriate to sustain the expansion   leaving the door open for future rate cuts Rate Sensitive StocksInterest sensitive stocks are influenced by changes in interest rates  They consist of financial institutions and businesses that pay out high dividends  As we know  stocks in general are sensitive to interest rate changes   lower interest rates mean lower interest rate expenses on borrowed capital  Low interest rate also affects the valuation of businesses Some sectors are particularly benefited by a reduction in interest rates  When interest rates fall  these sectors can provide higher returns to investors as they increase dividends  They are able to do this since they now find it easier to service their debt Utility companies are characterized by long gestation periods and a heavy debt component as far as capital allocation is concerned  What they often lack in share price appreciation is made up by stable dividend flows  A reduction in rates makes debt servicing much easier for such stocks  enabling them to pay out higher dividends REITs also depend heavily on debt fueled financing to drive their businesses  This is why a reduction in rates is equally helpful for them  Such players are also appealing to investors owing to their attractive dividends and strong earnings growth 6 Winning Stocks The Fed has disappointed investors by announcing only a quarter point rate cut  Comments from the Fed chair have also led to concerns about future monetary easing  However  the Federal Reserve has kept the door

8180,229695,AVB,No Immediate Respite For Residential REITs From High Supply,opinion,"Real estate investment trusts  REITs  invest in all types of properties   from offices to malls to hospitals and hotels  The Residential REIT category is the one which is engaged in owning  developing and managing a variety of residences  The types of residences include apartment buildings  student housing  manufactured homes and single family homes  Residential REITs rent space in these properties to tenants and earn a rental income in return According to a recent  by the real estate technology and analytics firm   RealPage  Inc    although new supply volumes remained elevated in the Jan Mar quarter  the U S  apartment market managed to continue the rent momentum which was achieved in the later part of 2018  Apartment rents were up 3 2  on an annual basis as of the first quarter of 2019  In fact  for six straight months  annual rent growth exceeded the 3  mark  In addition  occupancy came in at 95 2  in the recently concluded quarter  expanding 10 basis points from the year ago period Here are the three major themes in the industry Favorable Demographic Growth  Demographic growth continues to be strong in the young adult age cohort  which has a higher propensity to rent  In fact  a significant change in lifestyle has taken place and life cycle events are getting delayed  This  again  is leading to an extension of the average age of first time homeownership  This age cohort has also witnessed considerable part of net job growth which is helping spur primary renter demand  Moreover  the cohort of ageing millennials is growing at a rapid pace and because of lifestyle choices  this age group currently has lower homeownership rates than prior generations  Also  there are many in this age group who cannot afford homeownership  As such  demand for rented apartments might remain elevated in the near term U S  Economy Losing Steam  The strength of the economy as well as the health of the job market plays key roles in determining the performance of residential REITs  Both these factors determine the capacity of rent that renters can shell out  However  of late  the economy is losing steam and concerns are brewing up regarding the fate of the U S  economy amid prevalent trade war tensions  the economic slowdown in Europe and China  as well as the declining stimulus from the lower tax rates  However  the same situation has led to a dovish stance by the Fed  which hinted at no rate hike at all this year in the latest FOMC meeting  And with REITs relying substantially on debt for business  as well as being considered as a bond substitute for their high dividend paying nature  the central bank s refrainment from raising rates gives a reason to rejoice  Particularly  the rate environment is likely to fuel the number of acquisitions in this industry Elevated Deliveries of New Units  The struggle to lure renters is feared to continue into the near term as supply volumes are likely to remain aggressive  In fact  per the above mentioned study by RealPage  in the past six months  demand could not keep up with new product deliveries that aggregated 127 121 market rate units in fourth quarter 2018 and first quarter 2019  Also  the study pointed out that market rate apartment properties which are under construction have more than 403 000 units which will be completed over the next 18 months  Specifically  supply of luxury high end properties is anticipated to be high in some markets during the prime leasing period  propelling competition in turn  Elevated supply volumes generally curb residential landlords  ability to command more rents  and affect occupancy and concession levels  These apart  the student housing sector  which is part of the residential REIT industry  has been witnessing a slowdown in leasing velocity and compression in rent growth  amid demand supply imbalances and intensifying competition  Specifically  properties away from campus are feeling the brunt  Amid these  student REITs are compelled to improve operational efficiencies and refine strategies to gain competitive edge sZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bleak

is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks  indicates bleak near term prospects  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 The industry s positioning in the bottom 50  of the Zacks ranked industries is a result of negative funds from operations  FFO  per share outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate  Looking at the aggregate FFO per share estimate revisions  it appears that analysts are losing confidence in this group s growth potential  Over the past year  the industry s FFO per share estimate for 2019 and 2020 moved down by 3 0  and 17 3   respectively Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio  let s take a look at the industry s recent stock market performance and valuation picture Industry Leads on Stock Market PerformanceThe REIT And Equity Trust   Residential Industry has outperformed the broader Zacks Finance sector  as well as the Zacks S P 500 composite in a year s time The industry has rallied 19 2  during this period compared to the S P 500 s rise of 7 8   During the same time frame  the broader Finance sector has declined 3 2  One Year Price PerformanceIndustry s Current ValuationOn the basis of forward 12 month price to FFO  funds from operations  ratio  which is a commonly used multiple for valuing Residential REITs  we see that the industry is currently trading at 20 10X compared to the S P 500 s forward 12 month price to earnings  P E  of 16 96X  The industry is trading above the Finance

14X  with a median of 18 01X Bottom LineIn a nutshell  although the residential REIT industry is poised to benefit from favorable demographics  lifestyle transformation  and creation of households  elevated supply in a number of markets in the near  to mid term might hinder growth tempo  straining rental rates  and resulting in high concessions Currently  there is no stock in the industry sporting a Zacks Rank   1  Strong Buy   However  there is one stock with a Zacks Rank of 2  Buy  which investors may consider adding to their portfolios  Also  investors can keep some stocks carrying

8182,229697,AVB,4 Top REITs Buoying Investors  Optimism This Earnings Season,opinion,With the Fed s recent dovish stance  REITs are now back in limelight  Encouragingly  the occupancy levels of a number of asset types hovering near the record high marks indicate strong demand and scope for generating steady revenues  Particularly  after a soft performance in 2018  the sector emerged as a solid winner in the first quarter  with total returns of the FTSE Nareit All REITs Index growing 16 7   outperforming the S P 500 s rally of 13 65   per  from REIT com Notably  the latest jump in the retail sales figure  job market gains and still high consumer confidence indicate a pick up in economic growth  which had been sluggish  of late  This is again translating into greater demand for real estate and resulting in higher occupancy levels for a number of asset categories Take for example the industrial real estate category which is exhibiting solid strength amid e commerce boom and supply chain strategy transformations  In fact  per a  by the commercial real estate services firm   CBRE Group  NYSE CBRE    availability fell for 35 straight quarters to 7  for the U S  industrial market in the first quarter  denoting the lowest point since 2000  Net asking rents increased 2 2  in the quarter to  7 51 per square feet   marking the highest level since 1989  per a CBRE  In addition  the recent  by the real estate technology and analytics firm   RealPage  Inc    shows that the U S  apartment market managed to retain the rent momentum which was achieved in the later part of 2018  although new supply volumes remained elevated in the Jan Mar quarter  Apartment rents were up 3 2  on an annual basis as of the first quarter  In fact  for six straight months  annual rent growth exceeded the 3  mark  Moreover  occupancy came in at 95 2  in the quarter  expanding 10 basis points  bps  year on year Further  data center REITs are experiencing a boom  with growing popularity of cloud computing  Internet of Things and big data  as well as the use of third party IT infrastructure by several companies  E commerce is also propelling demand for data center REITs as it offers critical infrastructure for the e retail value chain  Thus  demand has been outgrowing supply in top tier data center markets  These markets are absorbing new construction at an accelerated pace despite enjoying high occupancy Also  according to a  by the Newmark Knight Frank  the first quarter office vacancy rate shrunk 30 bps  year over year  to 13   Furthermore  job creation in office using

8184,229699,AVB,3 Deadly Dividends To Sell Yesterday  And 3 BIG Dividends You Need Now ,opinion,"ETFs  or exchange traded funds  are for suckers  There is no reason for any savvy income investor to get wrapped up in this   3 4 trillion obsession  
Why do I say  3 4 trillion  Because that s how much Americans have tied up in them  But there are better ways to buy the same types of stocks  and shortly we ll highlight three ETF replacements you can buy just as easily for yields up to 7 5  
Wall Street is  of course  happy to play along with the ETF craze  cranking out fund after fund to give folks their fix some so  out there  they track wheat futures  casino stocks  even companies that aim to curb obesity 
It s true  That last one s called the Obesity ETF  with the catchy ticker SLIM 
If you want a true sign ETFs are overdone  consider this  back in 2007 just 12 years ago there were 290 ETFs out there 
Today  More than 5 000 17 times more 
Of course  many of these ETFs were slapped together to let the fund companies cash in on the fad of the day 
The result  Way too many endanger your dividends with collapsible payouts  stomach churning volatility and portfolios so frothy they re  hardwired  for deep plunges when markets pull back 
Let s dive into the three high risk ETFs you must dodge now  After each one  I ll show you a high yield closed end fund  CEF   with dividends ranging from 5  all the way up to 7 5  
Deadly ETF No  1   A Perfect Setup for Massive Losses 
Let s start with one of today s hottest trends  the rise of automation and artificial intelligence  It ll likely come as no surprise that there s an ETF for that  the iShares Robotics and Artificial Intelligence ETF  NYSE IRBO  
Too bad the negatives start piling up right away  especially if you need income  IRBO yields a pathetic 0 7   so dropping  100 000 into will only get you  700 a year  That s so sad it isn t worth spending another second on 
IRBO has beaten the SPDR S P 500 ETF  NYSE SPY  since inception  but that outperformance is marginal  and that s being generous    And check out the wild volatility you would ve had to stomach 
IRBO Crashes  Then Reboots
As you can see above  IRBO is new it s only been around 10 months and it s already weighed down by stocks with zero profits  like Snap  NYSE SNAP   Cloudera  NYSE CLDR  and Lattice Semiconductor  NASDAQ LSCC   Throw in a portfolio with a P E ratio near 21  and you ve got a perfect setup for massive losses in the next correction 
So let s sidestep IRBO and go with a tech focused CEF that crushes it on every point that matters  
High Yield CEF Pick No  1  A Monthly 5  Dividend From Tech
That would be the BlackRock Science and Technology Trust  NYSE BST   with a gaudy 5 3  dividend paid monthly 
Instead of gambling on which small cap may catch the next wave  BST holds giants that will simply buy out these innovators  or wipe them out with their own tech 
A Who s Who of Tech Dominators
Source  Blackrock  NYSE BLK  com
Now let s talk outperformance I think you ll agree that this gap is anything but marginal 
BST 1  S P 500  0
BST may look expensive  trading at a 5 5  premium to net asset value  NAV  or the value of its stock holdings   But get this  investors have happily shelled out a 14  premium  1 14 for every  1 of assets for this fund in just the past year 
A return to that level  a certainty  in my view  would give us 8  price upside  not including any gains BST s portfolio throws our way 
Deadly ETF No  2   A Grab Bag of Low Yielding Stocks 
Whenever I see an investment trying to profit from Millennials  I roll my eyes  for one  the oldest Millennials are 37 years old  Not exactly young hotshots anymore 
What s more  this generation has a wide backstory  some are urban  some are rural  some are desperate to buy a house  others are happy to rent  I could go on 
Even so  the Global X Millennials Thematic ETF  NASDAQ MILN  gives it the old  er  college try with this grab bag of low yielding stocks 
Is This Where the Millennials Are 
Source  globalxfunds com
As you can see  this is just a list of retail stocks  except for Intuit  NASDAQ INTU   a maker of tax planning software  if you can see how that ties to Millennials  you re doing better than me  and two real estate investment trusts  REITs  with apartments in big cities  AvalonBay Communities  NYSE AVB  and Equity Residential  NYSE EQR  
By far the worst part is the 0 5  dividend  And you don t even get to keep it  It s cancelled out when management takes its fee  also 0 5   out of the fund 
Here s the bottom line  if you re going to invest in large cap stocks  skip the shopworn themes and buy a well run  diversified equity CEF  You ll get a higher yield and a pro who charges a lot less than your dividend working for you 
Which brings me to  
High Yield CEF Pick No  2  A  Superstar  6  Dividend on the Cheap
One of your best stock CEF bets now is the Gabelli Dividend   Income Trust  NYSE GDV   run by famed value investor Mario Gabelli  who charges us a 1 35  fee 
That may sound high  but I ll happily pay it for a rock star like Gabelli  who s snapped up bargain after bargain since the Great Recession  driving GDV to a massive return net of fees 
Gabelli Earns His Keep
One thing I love about Gabelli is that he doesn t front run the latest fad  Instead  he quietly runs plain vanilla income go tos like GDV  the Gabelli Equity Trust  GAB  and the Gabelli Utility Trust  NYSE GUT  
As I write  GDV trades at an 8 4  discount to NAV  below its 7 2  average in the last year and miles below the 2 4  it topped out at in that time  So you ve got lots of upside potential and downside protection here 
Finally  the dividend  an outsized 6 1  payout you ll also pick up every month 
Gabelli s Armor Plated Cash Stream

I think the next move here is obvious 
Now let s move on to our last ETF laggard and a CEF with a hefty  and safe  7 5  cash payout 
Deadly ETF No  3  Real Estate  the Wrong Way
With the Federal Reserve set for zero rate hikes in 2019  look for REITs to gain as the year rolls on 
Why  Because 10 year Treasuries still yield a lame 2 6   Why settle for that when you can pull in 4  with the ultra popular Vanguard Real Estate ETF  NYSE VNQ  
Trouble is  not all REITs will benefit equally  which is why buying an ETF is a mistake  When it comes to REITs  there are really only two ways to go 
Manage your REIT portfolio yourself  or  
Hire a pro who can steer you toward the fastest growing REITs  while sidestepping the dogs  
VNQ is the worst of all worlds  it blindly tracks the MSCI US Investable Market Real Estate 25 50 Index  with no active manager around to make a quick change if things sour for one or more REIT sectors 
Consider retail REITs  which sit square in the path of Amazon com  NASDAQ AMZN   VNQ has 14  of its portfolio mired in this sector  Look at how the fund s third biggest holding  mall owner Simon Property Group  NYSE SPG   has yanked down its return 
An Anchor VNQ Can t Cut Loose
I think the downside here is pretty clear  And it gives us a perfect segue to our third CEF 
High Yield CEF Pick No  3  1 500  Gains  7 5  Dividend
I don t know why anyone would touch VNQ when they could buy the Cohen   Steers Quality Income Realty Fund  NYSE RQI   which has crushed its ETF cousin since the Great Recession 
The Power of Savvy Management
RQI is run by a trio of managers with 72 years of REIT expertise between them  and that shows up in the fund s portfolio  which is tilted toward fast growing areas like apartments  health care and data centers  which are my favorite  pick and shovel  play on artificial intelligence  by the way  
Shopping malls  They re way down the list 
RQI s Flexible Portfolio
Source  cohenandsteers com
The kicker  You can grab RQI at a 9  discount to NAV a steal for a fund whose discount has almost completely slammed shut  to as little as 2   in the past year

8203,229718,AVB,What s In Store For Aimco s  AIV  Earnings This Season ,opinion,Apartment Investment   Management Co    NYSE AIV     commonly known as Aimco   is slated to report fourth quarter 2018 results on Feb 4  after the market closes  Its funds from operations  FFO  per share will likely reflect growth  while revenues might witness a year over year decline In the last reported quarter  this Denver  CO based residential real estate investment trust  REIT  surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate posting pro forma FFO of 63 cents per share  Results displayed growth in same store property net operating income  NOI  and same store average daily occupancy Aimco has a mixed earnings surprise history  Over the trailing four quarters  the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in one occasion  reported in line numbers in the other two and missed in another  This resulted in average surprise of 0 42   This is depicted in the chart below Apartment Investment and Management Company Price and EPS Surprise    Factors at PlayThe U S  apartment market witnessed an encouraging fourth quarter in 2018  with accelerated rent growth and elevated occupancy level amid robust demand for rental units  Per a  by the real estate technology and analytics firm   RealPage  Inc    the annual pace of apartment rent growth in the United States picked up and reached 3 3  in the quarter  ahead of the 2 5  recorded in 2017 Also  occupancy came in at 95 4   up from 95  reported at year end 2017  Reflecting the strongest demand realized since 2010  occupied apartment tally moved up by 323 290 units in 2018  and demand surpassed annual completions that aggregated 287 007 units Amid these encouraging numbers  Aimco too is anticipated to benefit from its portfolio situated in key U S  markets  In fact  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter rental and other property revenues attributable to real estate is pegged at  235 million  indicating a marginal increase sequentially Further  the company has made immense efforts to enhance its portfolio and generate higher revenues  In line with this  Aimco has been selling low return properties and investing these proceeds in strategic apartment communities that offer high projected free cash flow internal rates of return  We expect the company to reap benefits of these efforts in the fourth quarter as well However  apartment deliveries are expected to have remained elevated in a number of Aimco s markets in the fourth quarter  This high supply is a concern because it curtails landlords  ability to command more rent and result in lesser absorption  Such an environment is predicted to have resulted in aggressive rental concessions and moderate pricing power of landlords  thereby impacting its top line growth The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter revenues is pinned at  237 2 million  indicating a year over year decline of 7  Further  we anticipate its results to bear the brunt of earnings dilution on account of asset dispositions Additionally  rate hikes are a concern as amid rising rates  financing costs will flare up  As such we anticipate the company s interest expenses to escalate in the quarter under review Lastly  over the past month  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share for the soon to be reported quarter has been revised marginally upward to 64 cents  indicating bullish sentiments of analysts  This also indicates a 1 6  year over year increase  For the Dec end quarter  management projects pro forma FFO per share of 61 65 cents Earnings WhispersOur

assets in premium locations  favorable demographics  household formation  recovering economy and job market growth  The company is also expected to have maintained its balance sheet strength Notably  per a quarterly update  residential REIT AvalonBay expects rental revenues for established communities in Q4 to climb 2 5 2 6  from the prior year quarter  The mid point of the fourth quarter outlook denotes a 15 basis point expansion from what was expected for the quarter when it provided the 2018 established communities rental revenue growth outlook in October This apart  the company provided established communities  like term effective rent change for October and November  includes data through Nov 27  2018   Specifically  like term effective rent change for both months was 3  in Northern

million  denoting an expected 3 6  year over year increase  Also  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share is currently pegged at  2 32  indicating 3 1  growth from the prior year period In addition  during the fourth quarter  AvalonBay completed the sale of 80  interest in five Manhattan apartment communities  The move came as part of the company s effort to monetize a considerable portion of investments in these properties  In fact  the transaction  which was based on a total asset valuation of around  760 million  helped AvalonBay improve financial flexibility  The company reaped net proceeds of around  470 million from the move Additionally  the company s activities during the quarter gained analysts  confidence to some extent  Consequently  the Zacks Consensus Estimate moved up a cent to  2 32 over the past 90 days However  new apartment deliveries are anticipated to have remained elevated in the company s markets in the Oct Dec quarter  Furthermore  high concession activity amid elevated supply remains a concern Here is what our quantitative model predicts AvalonBay has the right combination of two key ingredients   a positive  and Zacks Rank  3  Hold

gathering steam on the back of a healthy economy and has witnessed growth in demand for office spaces  This has enabled office landlords to enjoy higher capability to raise rents for properties Per a study by the commercial real estate services firm   CBRE Group   NYSE CBRE     the fourth quarter office vacancy rate declined to its lowest level in 11 years  by 10 basis points  bps  to 12 6   Furthermore  job growth boosted annual net absorption to 58 3 million square feet of space   the highest since 2015 Also  the U S  apartment market witnessed an encouraging fourth quarter in 2018

investing these proceeds in strategic apartment communities that offer high projected free cash flow internal rates of return  We expect the company to reap benefits of these efforts in the fourth quarter as well In fact  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter rental and other property revenues attributable to real estate is pegged at  235 million  indicating a marginal increase sequentially However  apartment deliveries are expected to have remained elevated in a number of Aimco s markets in the quarter  This high supply is a concern because it curtails landlords  ability to

fundamentals Hence  we anticipate the company to have witnessed solid demand from life science and tech tenants during the fourth quarter  on the back of these efforts  Moreover  we expect the company to have witnessed healthy rent escalations and leasing activity at positive rent spreads  given the strategic location of its clusters  This will likely have boosted Alexandria s fourth quarter revenues  In fact  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at  344 5 million and reflects a year over year jump of 15 3  The company has initiated a number of development projects in a bid to strengthen its life science portfolio  However  amid rising construction cost scenario  we anticipate Alexandria to have witnessed cost overruns  This will likely decrease development returns for the company s development projects and in turn  adversely impact its fourth quarter bottom line performance Further  the rising interest rate scenario is expected to have escalated cost of financing

office REITs Kilroy Realty Corp  and Alexandria Real Estate Equities  along with residential REITs AvalonBay Communities  Inc  and Apartment Investment   Management Co   are slated to report their quarterly numbers on Feb 4   Economic improvement and recovery in the job market have spurred demand for various real estate categories  The U S  office real estate market has been gathering steam on the back of a healthy economy and has witnessed growth in demand for office spaces  This has enabled office landlords to enjoy higher capability to raise rents for properties Per a study by the commercial real estate services firm   CBRE Group   the fourth quarter office vacancy rate declined to its lowest level in 11 years  by 10 basis points  bps  to 12 6   Furthermore  job growth boosted annual net absorption to 58 3 million square feet of space   the highest since 2015 Also  the U S  apartment market witnessed an encouraging fourth quarter in 2018  with accelerated rent growth and elevated occupancy level amid robust demand for rental units  Per a  by the real estate technology and analytics firm   RealPage  Inc    the annual pace of apartment rent growth in the United States picked up and reached 3 3  in the quarter  ahead of the 2 5  recorded in 2017  In addition  occupancy came in at 95 4   up from the 95  reported at year end 2017 Per the quantitative Zacks model  stocks with the perfect combination of a favorable Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   and a positive  have substantially higher chances of beating estimates  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  You can see Let s delve deeper into what can be expected from the above mentioned REITs  fourth quarter and 2018 earnings performance AvalonBay Communities is expected to benefit from high quality assets in premium locations  favorable demographics and household formation trends in fourth quarter 2018  Notably  per a quarterly update  the company expects rental revenues for established communities in the quarter to be up 2 5 2 6  from the prior year quarter The company s performance in the to be reported quarter is likely to display continued high occupancy  Also  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for average rental rates at established communities is pegged at  2 642  indicating a 0 3  sequential rise Moreover  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter revenues is  575 1 million  denoting an expected 3 6  year over year increase  Further  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for funds from operation  FFO  per share is currently pinned at  2 32  indicating 3 1  growth from the prior year period   Read more   AvalonBay Communities  Earnings ESP is  0 22  and currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3  making us reasonably confident of a positive surprise Apartment Investment   Management Co   commonly known as Aimco  has made immense efforts to enhance its portfolio and generate higher revenues  In line with this  the company has been selling low return properties and investing these proceeds in strategic apartment communities that offer high projected free cash flow internal rates of return  We expect the company to reap benefits of these efforts in the fourth quarter as well In fact  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter rental and other property revenues attributable to real estate is pegged at  235 million  indicating a marginal increase sequentially However  apartment deliveries are expected to have remained elevated in a number of Aimco s markets in the quarter  This high supply is a concern because it curtails landlords  ability to command more rent and result in lesser absorption  Such an environment is predicted to have resulted in aggressive rental concessions and moderate pricing power of landlords  thereby impacting its top line growth The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter total revenues is pinned at  237 2 million  indicating a year over year decline of 7  Further  we anticipate its results to bear the brunt of earnings dilution on account of asset dispositions   Read more   Currently  Aimco has an Earnings ESP of  1 58  and a Zacks Rank of 2  So  we can t conclusively predict an earnings beat Alexandria s fourth quarter results will likely reflect year over year growth in its FFO per share and revenues In the Oct Dec quarter  the company made strategic efforts to enhance its life science and technology campus portfolio in a bid to gain from the strengthening industry fundamentals Hence  we anticipate the company to have witnessed solid demand from life science and tech tenants during the fourth quarter  on the back of these efforts  Moreover  we expect the company to have witnessed healthy rent escalations and leasing activity at positive rent spreads  given the strategic location of its clusters  This will likely have boosted Alexandria s fourth quarter revenues  In fact  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at  344 5 million and reflects a year over year jump of 15 3  The company has initiated a number of development projects in a bid to strengthen its life science portfolio  However  amid rising construction cost scenario  we anticipate Alexandria to have witnessed cost overruns  This will likely decrease development returns for the company s development projects and in turn  adversely impact its fourth quarter bottom line performance Further  the rising interest rate scenario is expected to have escalated cost of financing the company s development pipeline   Read more   Currently  Alexandria has an Earnings ESP of 0 00  and a Zacks Rank of 2  So  we can t conclusively predict an earnings beat Kilroy Realty s fourth quarter results will likely reflect year over year growth in its FFO per share

8209,229724,AVB,Alexandria  ARE  To Post Q4 Earnings  What s In The Cards ,opinion,Alexandria Real Estate Equities   NYSE ARE   is scheduled to report fourth quarter results on Feb 4  after the market closes  The company s results will likely reflect year over year growth in its funds from operations  FFO  per share and revenues In the last reported quarter  this Pasadena  CA based urban office real estate investment trust  REIT   which primarily focuses on collaborative life science and technology campuses  posted adjusted FFO of  1 66 per share  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny  Results reflected decent internal and external growth  The company witnessed increase in rental rate and net operating income  NOI  Over the trailing four quarters  the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in one occasion  missed in another two and met in the other  It delivered average positive surprise of 0 16  during this period  The graph below depicts this surprise history Alexandria Real Estate Equities  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise    For 2018  Alexandria anticipates adjusted FFO per share of  6 59  6 61  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at  6 62  representing year over year growth of approximately 10  Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement Factors to ConsiderIn the Oct Dec quarter  Alexandria made strategic efforts to enhance its life science and technology campus portfolio in a bid to gain from the strengthening industry fundamentals In October  the company started development of the North Tower at the Alexandria Centerfor Life Science   New York City  thereby  banking on the city s emerging life science cluster space Further  the company expanded its ownership in New York City to more than two million rentable square feet  RSF  of space  including a development redevelopment pipeline of 1 3 million RSF In addition  in December  it announced the expansion of the company s full service life science start up platform  Alexandria LaunchLabs  opening at the Alexandria Center in One Kendall Square  NYSE SQ   The platform intends to provide a solid start up platform for life science companies  This  in turn  will spur demand for life science space Hence  we anticipate the company to have witnessed solid demand from life science and tech tenants during the fourth quarter  on the back of these efforts  Moreover  we expect the company to have witnessed healthy rent escalations and leasing activity at positive rent spreads  given the strategic location of its clusters  This will likely have boosted Alexandria s fourth quarter revenues  In fact  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at  344 5 million and reflects a year over year jump of 15 3  Although the company initiated development projects in a bid to strengthen its life science portfolio  amid rising construction cost scenario  we anticipate Alexandria to have witnessed cost overruns  This will likely decrease development returns for its development projects and in turn  adversely impact its fourth quarter bottom line performance  Lastly  the rising interest rate environment remains a challenge  since the company has exposure to long term leased assets  Furthermore  it is expected to have escalated cost of financing the company s development pipeline Hence  there is lack of any solid catalyst prior to the fourth quarter earnings release  As such  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share for the to be reported quarter remained unchanged at  1 69 over the past month  Nonetheless  it represents year over year growth of 10 5  Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Alexandria is likely to beat estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or at least 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here  as you will see below You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Earnings ESP  Alexandria s Earnings ESP is 0 00  Zacks Rank  The company currently carries a Zacks Rank of 2  which increases the predictive power of ESP  However  we also need a positive ESP to be confident of the earnings beat Stocks That Warrant a LookWhile the other players in this space are lined up to report their financial results  below are three stocks  poised to beat on earnings per the proven Zacks model  You can see AvalonBay Communities   NYSE AVB    slated to report fourth quarter results on Feb 4  has an Earnings ESP of  0 22  and holds a Zacks Rank of 3

AvalonBay  which belongs to the Zacks REIT and Equity Trust   Residential industry  posted revenues of  578 52 million for the quarter ended December 2018  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 59   This compares to year ago revenues of  555 29 million  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future FFO expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
AvalonBay shares have added about 9 3  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 8  
What s Next for AvalonBay 
While AvalonBay has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s FFO outlook  Not only does this include current consensus FFO expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for AvalonBay was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus FFO estimate is  2 27 on  576 29 million in revenues for the coming quarter and  9 31 on  2 34 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year

8234,229749,AVB,What s In The Cards For Kimco  KIM  This Earnings Season ,opinion,Kimco Realty Corporation   NYSE KIM   is slated to report fourth quarter and full year 2018 results on Jan 31  before the market opens In the last reported quarter  this New Hyde Park  NY based retail real estate investment trust  REIT  delivered an in line performance in terms of funds from operations  FFO  per share  The company registered new leasing spreads of 12 1   This marked the 19th straight quarter of increase in rental rate for new leases by more than 10  over the previous rent for the comparable space  Its small shop occupancy reached an all time high in the quarter Over the trailing four quarters  Kimco beat estimates in two occasions and posted in line results in the other two  recording average beat of 1 39   The graph below depicts this surprise history Kimco Realty Corporation Price and EPS Surprise    For full year  the company projects FFO as adjusted of  1 44  1 46 per share  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter and full year 2018 FFO per share is currently pegged at 35 cents and  1 46  respectively Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement Factors at PlayKimco is on track with its 2020 Vision that envisages the ownership of high quality assets  concentrated in major metro markets which offer several growth levers  Particularly  amid transformation in the retail landscape  the company remains well poised to navigate through mall traffic blues  with development and redevelopment efforts  and focus on service and experiential tenants and omni channel players Moreover  Kimco is aimed at expanding its small shops  portfolio  These shops basically comprise service based industries  such as restaurants  salons and spas  personal fitness and medical practices  The shops enjoy frequent customer traffic and are Internet resistant  Amid limited new supply and favorable demographics  this diversification is likely to help Kimco limit its operating and leasing risks  As such  amid upbeat consumer confidence backed by improving economy and job market gains  the company may experience high occupancy and healthy leasing spreads in the to be reported quarter Furthermore  Kimco is engaged in the execution of strategic measures to boost its capital structure  and enhance the company s growth profile and tax efficiency as well  In the Dec end quarter  the company is expected to have maintained a strong balance sheet  Moreover  the company remains focused on growing its unencumbered asset pool  which is encouraging Nevertheless  in connection to its strategic efforts  Kimco has been making significant disposition of the company s assets  In fact  accelerating its portfolio transformation initiatives  the company reported fourth quarter 2018 and full year 2018 disposition deals worth  357 1 million and  1 1 billion  respectively  Through these transactions  the company surpassed the high end of its full year property sales goal of  900 million Particularly  during the Oct Dec quarter  Kimco disposed 16 properties and two land parcels spanning 1 9 million square feet of space  with the company s share of sale proceeds being  228 4 million  Accelerated disposition activity in the fourth quarter aided Kimco to earn  913 9 million in sale proceeds from 68 properties and eight land parcels for the full year  While such efforts are encouraging for the long term  the dilutive effect on earnings from high disposition activities cannot be averted in the near term In addition  the recent  from Reis shows that the neighborhood and community shopping center vacancy rate remained flat in the fourth quarter at 10 2   However  it marginally inched up from 10  at year end 2017  Mall vacancy rate slightly edged down to 9  in the quarter from 9 1  in the third quarter  At year end 2017  the company s vacancy was 8 3   Despite the store closure issue plaguing the market  the little stability indicates slowdown in new development Amid these  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter revenues of Kimco is currently pinned at  278 3 million   reflecting a 10 4  estimated decline from the prior year period  The Zacks Consensus Estimate of FFO per share of 35 cents for the quarter also indicates a year over year drop of 7 9  In addition to the above  Kimco s activities during the Oct Dec quarter were inadequate to gain analyst confidence  Consequently  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share of 35 cents for the to be reported quarter remained unchanged over the past month Here is what our quantitative model predicts Kimco does not have the right combination of two key ingredients   a positive  and Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or higher   for increasing the odds of an earnings beat

8235,229750,AVB,3 Best REITs For The Next 55 Years,opinion,"I ve said for years that dividend happy real estate investment trusts  REITs  are the superior play for long term wealth generation  And yet another set of data   this one spanning more than half a century   proves just how powerful the REIT space really is 
Let me show you the latest findings   and introduce you to a handful of stocks that should deliver market beating returns for the next several decades 
A couple months ago  I highlighted a CEM Benchmarking study of asset class returns going back to 1998 that showed publicly listed REITs trounced everything in retirement focused accounts  large cap stocks  small cap stocks  bonds  private equity  hedge funds   you name it 
Here s another piece of research that goes much further back   55 years  to be precise   and tells an even more convincing story of REIT dominance   Historical Returns of the Market Portfolio   released by a trio of researchers in November 2017  studied asset classes worldwide from all the way back to 1960 through 2015 and found that REITs delivered nearly a full percentage point more in returns annually than global stocks 
Specifically  REITs delivers a compound annual return of 6 43  per year  adjusted for inflation   beating stocks  5 45    non government bonds  3 5   and government bonds  3 06    That outperformance occurred across various economic situations   inflation  recessions  bull and bear markets 
REITs  The Best Market Bet for 55 YearsSource   Historical Returns of the Market Portfolio 
There s no secret  Real estate delivers steady growth over time  not to mention the compounding power of stable and typically growing dividends 
But who will carry the torch for REITs over the next 55 years  It takes a special level of company to fit the bill 
These three REITs have what it takes 
American Tower  NYSE AMT Dividend Yield  2 0 
One key to finding a stock that will survive   and better still  thrive   over the long term is buying into a business that likely won t get disrupted overnight 
Enter American Tower  AMT  
American Tower is a telecommunications infrastructure REIT that boasts a global portfolio of 170 000 cellular towers   that it leases out to the likes of AT T  NYSE T  and Verizon  NYSE VZ    as well as outdoor antenna systems  managed rooftops and other solutions across 17 countries on five continents 
In short  then  American Tower is involved in what s essentially a utility at this point  mobile communication   via a delivery method that s showing no signs of evolving from the current tower structure  Indeed  the  next generation    5G  which will only begin to roll out in 2019   will be distributed in much the same way as its predecessors 
Mobile communications are becoming the lifeblood of the world s citizens  Not only is this now the primary way humans communicate  but it s becoming the way we all learn  research  ingest news   and even shop  In fact  I recently extolled American Tower s virtues as a  hidden  way to dredge dividends out of Amazon com  NASDAQ AMZN  
Those dividends aren t exactly robust at current prices  mind you  but for all the right reasons  That is  American Tower has grown its dividend like a weed  at 172  over the past five years alone  but its soaring stock price weighs on the current listed yield  Longtime holders will continue to enjoy much better percentages as the years roll on 
Better still  AMT s share price hasn t yet come close to  growing into the dividend  
AMT  A Five Year Doubler That s STILL Catching Up to the Dividend
AvalonBay Communities  NYSE AVB Dividend Yield  3 2 
Another market that isn t going away is housing  Oh  housing will ebb and flow   2007 08 was a stark reminder of that   but as long as there are humans  they ll always need a roof over their head  And especially as space becomes increasingly limited  apartments will reign supreme 
That s good news for the likes of AvalonBay Communities  AVB  
AvalonBay is one of the largest publicly traded residential REITs  representing 84 490 homes in 290 communities across 11 outstanding housing markets that span much the East Coast  Pacific Northwest and California  It does so via the Avalon  AVA and  eaves by Avalon  brands 
This isn t a turbulence free market by any means  Rent growth has been dipping from 5  plus year over year in recent years to roughly 2   though that number is finally stabilizing  AvalonBay has actually reduced its development starts volume from a  1 4 billion annual average from 2013 16 to a projected  900 million average across 2017 18 
Still  Avalon s future looks bright  even in this uneasy short term  The company revised its full year 2018 outlook a few months ago  including 4 1  growth in funds from operations  FFO  an important metric of REIT profitability   up from 3 6  initially projected  2 4  same store rental revenue growth  up from 2 1   and 2 3  net operating income growth  up from 2   
This will never be a monster growth business  But it should head broadly higher over time  helping keep up a dividend payout streak that dates back to 1995 
AVB s Still in a Long Term Growth Trend
First Industrial Realty Trust Inc  NYSE FR Dividend Yield  2 7 
Something else that isn t going away tomorrow  next year or decades from now  Industry 
It is going to change  Industry has been in a long term trend of automation for literally decades now  moving from man to man assisted machine to fully self reliant robots  If you want an example of what the future might look like  consider this CNBC profile of the world s first humanless warehouse 
But one thing that hasn t changed about the warehouse is that it takes up space  Thus  barring some bizarre change in the rules of physics  industrial landlords such as First Industrial Realty Trust  FR  will always be in demand 
First Industrial is a wide ranging industrial REIT that leases out properties such as national and regional distribution centers  read  warehouses   light industrial buildings  for product assembly  and R D facilities  and also deals in developable land  Also  like other industrial REITs  FR does more than just lease out   it offers property management services  and can even build to suit or redevelop existing properties to better serve an individual customer s needs 
FR is a steady Eddie that keeps growing over time  Its most recent quarterly report was a gem  with cash rental rates up 9  year over year  fueling 6 8  growth in cash same store NOI  Occupancy was 97 6   up from 96 8  just a quarter ago   and up from 92 9  in 2013

I recently pointed out that REITs such as Prologis  PLD  are a play on the growth of e commerce  and First Industrial is in the same ilk  Retailers are shifting away from brick and mortar space in malls and instead are selling more wares online  All of those goods have to come from somewhere  and that somewhere distribution centers   currently 84  of FR s square footage

My two favorite REITs today are comfortably positioned in the exact same kinds of recession proof industries that should breed success not for years  but decades  They ll have no problem continuing to raise their rents   and reward their shareholders   no matter what the Fed decides at its next meeting  what President Trump tweets or when the stock market finally takes a breather 
My favorite commercial real estate lender lets us play Monopoly from the convenience of our brokerage accounts  They do all the legwork  building a secure  diversified loan portfolio featuring offices  retail space  hotels and multifamily units 
Management then collects the monthly payments  deposits the checks  and then it sends most of the profits our way as dividends  a legal requirement to have REIT status  
The stock s current dividend  a 7 5  yield today  is covered by earnings per share  EPS  today  And don t be fooled by the stagnant dividend  not that stability is bad   The firm continues to originate an increasing number of loans 
Quarterly Origination Volume    in Billions 
This firm is a conservative lender with perfect loan performance  100    Its growing portfolio will drive higher profits  which in turn will inspire the next dividend hike  The best time to buy the stock is right now  while it makes the investments which will drive its payout and share price higher from here 
Plus  this firm has also smartly eliminated interest rate risk because it uses floating rates  In fact  it s actually set up to make more money as interest rates move higher 
More Income as Interest Rates Rise
Same for another REIT favorite of mine  a 6 9  payer backed by an unstoppable demographic trend that will deliver growing dividends for the next 30 years  Interest rates are no problem for this landlord because it will simply continue raising the rents on its  must have  facilities 
Its founder Ed admitted that  fourteen years ago  he had  zero assets  a dream  and a business plan  
Well  his dream and plan were plenty   the visionary entrepreneur parlayed them into  7  billion in assets 
And right now is the best time yet to  bet on Ed  because his growing base of assets is generating higher and higher cash flows  powering an accelerating dividend 

I love dividend increases because they are proof that management is actually making more money  so it can afford to pay us shareholders more  And an accelerating payout is a flat out cry for help 
Any management team that raises its dividend faster and faster is clearly making more money than it knows what to do with  This usually happens when it achieves a tipping point where its machine no longer requires as much reinvestment to continue growing  So  leadership says   Please  take a bigger raise  shareholders  
Meanwhile  investors and money managers who spot dividend accelerators lose their minds because  in theory  there is no valuation too high for a company that is increasing its dividend at an accelerating rate  Their spreadsheets literally break  and they buy the stock in a frenzy  after we already own it  of course  
Ed s stock should be owned by any serious dividend investor for three simple reasons 
It s recession proof 
It yields a fat  and secure  6 9  
Its dividend increases are actually accelerating 
These two REITs are both  best buys  in my 8  No Withdrawal Portfolio   an 8  dividend paying portfolio that lets retirees live on secure payouts alone  Now  as active recommendations for my premium subscribers  it wouldn t be fair to reveal their names here

8236,229751,AVB,Mid America Apartment  MAA  Q4 Earnings  What s In The Offing ,opinion,"Mid America Apartment Communities  Inc    NYSE MAA     commonly known as MAA   is slated to report fourth quarter 2018 results on Jan 30  after the market closes  The company s results will likely reflect year over year growth in revenues and funds from operations  FFO  per share 
In the last reported quarter  this Memphis  TN based residential real estate investment trust  REIT  reported FFO per share of  1 50  in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Quarterly results reflected growth in same store net operating income  NOI  and rise in average effective rent per unit for the same store portfolio 
Over the trailing four quarters  the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two occasions  met in another and missed in the other  It delivered average positive surprise of 1 18  during this period  The graph below depicts this surprise history Mid America Apartment Communities  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise   Factors at Play 
The U S  apartment market witnessed an encouraging fourth quarter in 2018  with accelerated rent growth and elevated occupancy level amid robust demand for rental units  Going by a  by the real estate technology and analytics firm   RealPage  Inc    the annual pace of apartment rent growth in the United States accelerated and reached 3 3  in the quarter  ahead of the 2 5  recorded in 2017 
Also  occupancy came in at 95 4   up from 95  reported at year end 2017  Reflecting the strongest demand realized since 2010  occupied apartment tally moved up by 323 290 units in 2018  and demand surpassed annual completions that aggregated 287 007 units 
Notably  economic recovery and job market gains have primarily driven demand for residential space  Specifically  favorable demographics  lifestyle transformation  and household creation trends amid improving economy are likely to have spurred demand for MAA s properties in the quarter and helped in absorption of new supply across its markets 
This is expected to have fueled growth in the company s top line as well  In fact  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter 2018 revenues is pinned at  400 2 million and reflects a year over year improvement of 4 6  
However  MAA has been experiencing substantial new supply across a number of markets  like Dallas and Washington  DC  Elevated delivery level curtailsa landlords  ability to demand higher rents and results in lesser absorption  which is a concern for the company  Consequently  concession levels are likely to remain at the higher end  while the leasing environment is anticipated to have remained competitive during the Dec end quarter  curbing MAA s pricing power 
Additionally  hike in interest rate during the fourth quarter might have unfavorably impacted the company s bottom line performance  Higher interest rate is expected to have increased borrowing cost for the company and affected its ability to purchase or develop real estate 
In fact  MAA follows a redevelopment program at selected residential communities throughout the portfolio and also has an active development pipeline that is largely unfunded  Amid rising interest rate environment  we expect its development and financing activities to have slowed down 
Furthermore  MAA s activities during the quarter under review were inadequate to gain analysts  confidence  Consequently  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter 2018 FFO per share remained unchanged at  1 55  over the last 30 days  indicating year over year growth of 3 3  
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that MAA is likely to beat estimates this season  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a favorable Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  But that is not the case here  as you will see below

8237,229752,AVB,Duke Realty  DRE  Gears Up For Q4 Earnings  What To Expect ,opinion,Duke Realty Corp    NYSE DRE   is scheduled to report fourth quarter 2018 results on Jan 30  after the market closes  The company s results will likely reflect year over year growth in its funds from operations  FFO  per share and revenues In the last reported quarter  this industrial real estate investment trust s  REIT  core FFO per share of 35 cents surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny  Results were backed by growth in rental and related revenues  overall improved operations and higher investments in new industrial properties  However  the company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two out of the trailing four quarters and met estimates in the other two occasions  with average beat being 1 6   The graph below depicts this surprise history Duke Realty Corporation Price and EPS Surprise   Let s see how things are shaping up Factors at PlayThe industrial real estate market has been gathering steam amid solid U S  economy  job market gains  thriving e commerce market  high consumption levels and robust consumer confidence  Demand for warehouses  distribution centers and other industrial property remains strong amid paradigm shift of consumers opting for online shopping  In fourth quarter 2018 too  we expect these industry tailwinds to have fortified the industrial real estate market In fact  going by a  issued by commercial real estate services firm   CBRE Group   NYSE CBRE     availability rate shrunk 10 basis points  bps  to 7  for the U S  industrial market in fourth quarter 2018  denoting the lowest point since 2000  Moreover  the quarter witnessed positive net absorption for the 35th consecutive quarter As for Duke Realty  its solid capacity to bank on this favorable trend will likely have helped the company witness high occupancy  active leasing and healthy rent levels across a number of properties  In fact  during the Oct Dec quarter  the company executed a number of leases  including a deal with SOFAMANIA to rent out space at 175 Portside Court in Savannah  In addition  its Savannah port area portfolio is fully occupied  reflecting robust demand for the company s properties Furthermore  it entered into a pre leasing agreement at 5 Ethel Boulevard in the Meadowlands  that enabled the company to achieve 64  preleasing of its new warehouse Amid these  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter revenues is currently pinned at  202 8 million  indicating an increase of 13  from the prior year quarter However  the company has been disposing non strategic assets in a bid to focus on industrial properties  While such efforts are a strategic fit for the long term  these will likely dampen the company s fourth quarter results and dampen its profitability  In fact  for 2018  the company anticipates dispositions of  500  600 million Also  since the company has a number of ongoing development projects  amid rising interest rate environment  we expect its development and financing activities to have slowed down Additionally  Duke Realty s activities during the quarter under review were inadequate to gain analysts  confidence  Consequently  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter 2018 FFO per share remained unchanged at 35 cents  over the last 30 days  Further  estimates remained unrevised for 2018 FFO per share as well  at  1 34  Management s 2018 guidance for core FFO per share is  1 31  1 35  Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Duke Realty is likely to beat estimates this season  This is

8241,229756,AVB,AvalonBay Communities  AVB  Q3 FFO Lag Estimates,opinion,"AvalonBay Communities  NYSE AVB  came out with quarterly funds from operations  FFO  of  2 34 per share  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 35 per share  This compares to FFO of  2 28 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an FFO surprise of  0 43   A quarter ago  it was expected that this apartment building owner would post FFO of  2 31 per share when it actually produced FFO of  2 27  delivering a surprise of  1 73  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus FFO estimates just once 
AvalonBay  which belongs to the Zacks REIT and Equity Trust   Residential industry  posted revenues of  587 61 million for the quarter ended September 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 30   This compares to year ago revenues of  575 98 million  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future FFO expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
AvalonBay shares have added about 26 1  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 20 6  
What s Next for AvalonBay 
While AvalonBay has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s FFO outlook  Not only does this include current consensus FFO expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for AvalonBay was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus FFO estimate is  2 40 on  591 64 million in revenues for the coming quarter and  9 31 on  2 32 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year 
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  REIT and Equity Trust   Residential is currently in the top 16  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2019-10-28,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/avalonbay-communities-avb-q3-ffo-lag-estimates-200479237,200479237

8250,229765,AVB,4 Under The Radar Yields Of Up To 8   2 Losers  2 Lunkers,opinion,"Have real estate investment trusts  REITs  finally  decoupled  from rising interest rates  In other words  has the popular  but untrue   rates up  REITs down  reasoning been busted  again  
For those of us who have been waiting for the stock market s landlords to carve out a bottom before buying anything new  we may be back in business 
REITs Finally Rising with Rates  
Regular readers know that the best REITs do just fine as rates rise  That s been the case historically  and they ll rally again this time around 
Why  Because elite landlords simply keep raising their rents  These higher cash flows translate to higher dividends  and higher stock prices  regardless of what the Fed is up to 
Let s consider the case of Ventas  VTR   which kept on hiking its payout as Uncle Sam s 10 year IOU rallied from 2003 to 2006  Its investors were rewarded with total returns  including dividends  of 174  as the 10 year rate rose above 5  
Ventas Outran the Long Bond 
Also as you can see above  it didn t take Ventas much time to start scaling the rate induced wall of worry  We re starting to see the same scenario unfold with the top REITs today 
But what exactly are  the best  REITs  Certainly not retail  where even reliable anchor tenants like grocers are seeing their business models threatened 
Heck  even Ventas is having a rough go of things today  Its dividend growth has slowed considerably in recent years 
We re better off looking elsewhere  So let s consider the early leaders   the sectors sparking this budding REIT rally  If it proves to have legs  these are the stocks likely to continue paving the way 
Let s highlight four REITs most investors   even serious income hounds   have never heard of  Here s where we ll find a couple of hidden high yield gems to consider 
CatchMark Timber Trust  CTT  Dividend Yield  4 3 
This first REIT can be found in the great outdoors  CatchMark Timber Trust  CTT   at about  615 million in market capitalization  is one of the smallest players in the timberland real estate space  But there s nothing small about its properties  some 514 100 acres of commercial timberland across eight states  split between 75  pine and 25  hardwood   destined to eventually become wood products  pulp and paper 
It s not a scintillating business  but it does create steady  predictable cash flows  As for growth  CatchMark is trying to achieve that through acquisitions  The company has made 24 M A transactions totaling  509 million since its 2013 initial public offering  accounting for about half its acreage 
But the deal I m most excited about is a May announcement that a joint venture including CTT would spend a total of  1 39 billion to gobble up 1 1 million acres of timberland in east Texas  That timberland currently supplies International Paper  IP  and Koch Industries owned Georgia Pacific 
This is a game changing move that is ballooning CatchMark s acreage  It s also expected to immediately be 2  to 3  accretive to cash available for distribution  CAD   which could nudge CatchMark into a  long overdue  dividend increase  This is an encouraging setup in a little traveled industry 
American Homes 4 Rent  AMH  Dividend Yield  0 9 
You can tell by the yield alone that American Homes 4 Rent  AMH  is not ready to deliver retirement income yet  But I think in decades  not months  and I think AMH should be on your long term watch list as a  future star of tomorrow  
REIT investors are familiar with residential plays such as AvalonBay Communities  NYSE AVB  and Preferred Apartment Communities  APTS   and I ve even introduced investors the more niche play of  manufactured home  REITs such as Sun Communities  SUI  
But American Homes 4 Rent is a little different  AH4R is one of the top names in single family home rental  boasting 51 840 single family homes in 22 states  Its target home typically is built after 1990  is at least 3BR 3BB and is located in areas with above average median household incomes and near attractive school systems 
Business has been humming since the company s 2013 IPO  with revenues and funds from operation  FFO  climbing each and every year  Also  AH4R said in June that building rental properties is generating an extra 50 basis points by building single family homes rather than purchasing existing inventory  Higher occupancy  and the ability to consistently raise rents  makes for an attractive business case 
I say that American Homes 4 Rent is a  future star of tomorrow  because from a dividend perspective  it s certainly not ready today  The company yields less than 1   and that s not because share price gains are outpacing its rate of dividend growth   there is no dividend growth  The payout has been stuck at its same level since the REIT came public 
For now  AMH is a hard pass  If it changes its stance on dividends  let s reconsider 
AH4R Is Growing Its Wealth  But It s Not Sharing It 
Vici Properties  VICI  Dividend Yield  5 1 
Casino REITs aren t exactly an unknown  I ve covered plays such as Gaming and Leisure Properties  GLPI    a high yield regional casino operator   before 
But Vici Properties  VICI  adds a small twist to the entertainment theme 
Vici  which was spun off from Caesars Entertainment Operating Company in 2017  owns 20  market leading  gaming properties  leased out to Caesars Entertainment Corporation  CZR   The properties operate under the Caesars  Horseshoe  Harrah s and Bally s brands   including the famous Caesars Palace   and includes 14 500 rooms and more than 150 restaurants  bars and nightclubs 
The kicker is diversification  For one  some of the properties are so called  racinos  that include horse racing in addition to traditional gambling  Also  the company has a good geographical spread that includes not just Las Vegas  35  of portfolio revenues   but New Jersey  Indiana  Louisiana and Missouri  among other states  On top of all that  Vici isn t just gaming  It has a little revenue diversification in the form of four championship golf courses  including top 100 ranked Cascata in Boulder City  Nevada 
The company has scant financial history to go off of   it s simply too young  But it has an attractive portfolio that may enjoy not just a strong current environment for casino operators  but also a potential boom in regional interest as states begin to approve sports betting 
Farmland Partners  FPI  Dividend Yield  7 8 
One of Wall Street s most exciting stories right now is taking place down on the farm 
Farmland Partners  FPI  owns or has under contract more than 166 000 acres of farmland across 17 states  farmed by more than 125 tenants and yielding more than 30 types of major commercial crops  Management is made up of several officers with actual farm operations knowhow 
The business has enjoyed rising rents  and a boom in food commodity prices should only help FPI s case 
But Farmland Partners also is the subject of a massive scandal that isn t getting much press   which could spell opportunity  Specifically  a Seeking Alpha contributor that goes by the name of Rota Fortunae wrote a wildly bearish article about FPI claiming that the REIT was  uninvestible  because it was  artificially increasing revenues by making loans to related party tenants who round trip the cash back to FPI as rent  310  of 2017 earnings could be made up  
Is Farmland Partners  Success Too Good to Be True  
The result was a drop of as much as 40   sending FPI s yield through the roof 
A High Risk  High Reward Opportunity  
Rota Fortunae s article wasn t the final word on FPI   not by a long shot  Days later  Farmland Partners released a laundry list of defenses against several points made by Rota  and said the article was  false and materially misleading in numerous respects   A week after that  FPI filed a lawsuit against Rota  seeking damages for what it calls a  short and distort  scheme 
Shares have rebounded somewhat since then  but there s still a massive discount in FPI   and a historically high yield to boot  However  investors face a pivotal question of how much  if any  truth was in Rota s commentary 
7 Rate Proof  Recession Proof REITs for 8 5  Yields  And Upside  
It s possible that Farmland Partners is a once in a lifetime discount   a solid company with a now enormous yield that has been slandered and will rebound with a vengeance 
Are you willing to bet your retirement on it  I m not 
You can t rely on solid but so so yields and a couple of high yield gambles to fund your retirement  You need to average 8  across the board with bulletproof holdings 
That s no problem for my 8  No Withdrawal Portfolio  All seven REITs in the portfolio check both boxes for  dividend growth  and  high current yield    a must have for rising rate environments 
As a group  they pay an impressive 8 5  average yield today  That s outstanding in a 3  world 
Combine 5  to 10   dividend growth with these high single digit current yields  and we have a formula for safe 15  to 20   annual gains from REITs  With a significant portion of that coming as cash dividends 
And thanks to the new tax plan  there s never been a better time to buy REITs and live off their dividends 
 REIT investors will benefit from the tax breaks that  pass through  businesses will receive in the new code  Investors will be allowed deduct 20  of their REIT dividend income  which means the 37  tax bill will drop to 29 6   
But it s important to choose your REITs wisely 
Don t buy low yielding static payer  Don t buy a retail REIT  either  with that entire industry is in a death spiral  future rent checks will be dicey for years to come  
Instead  focus on recession proof firms  such as those that rent hospitals  business lodging and warehouses filled with Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  packages  Landlords that own properties that will be in high demand no matter what happens to interest rates or the economy from here  in other words 
I d love to share my seven favorite recession and rate proof REITs with you   including specific stock names  tickers and buy prices  Click here and I ll send my full 8  No Withdrawal Portfolio research you to right now

8256,229771,AVB,3 Stocks To Dump As Apartment Market Moderates In Q1,opinion,If solid job growth in recent months indicates more household formations and raises expectations for a robust revival of the apartment market fundamentals  then we should perhaps think twice This is because the latest  from the real estate technology and analytics firm   RealPage  Inc    NASDAQ RP     states that the national apartment market indeed moderated in first quarter 2018  with occupancy shrinking and rent growth slowing down  And there seems to be no respite from this choppy environment any time soon  with aggressive deliveries anticipated to continue through early next year too Of course  the first quarter marks a slow leasing period  thanks to the cold weather that inhibits shift of households and limits growth in demand  However  a whole lot of new supply is the ultimate culprit  fueling competition and curbing landlords  pricing power Going by statistics  the annual rent growth pace shrunk to 2 3  in Q1  This not only marked moderation from the 2 6 2 9  growth rate experienced throughout 2017 but  in fact  denoted the slowest growth since third quarter 2010  Notably  the market had achieved an annual price increase of 5 3  in the third quarter of 2015  which represented this economic cycle s highest rent growth Also  occupancy level of 94 5  this March edged down from the prior year tally of 95   with metros having subdued construction activity faring well and recording the strongest occupancy  Although the overall occupancy level is still healthy  the deceleration suggests that a competitive leasing environment is fast building up  and any robust upturn in occupancy seems elusive in the near term This is quite obvious when so much of new supply is likely to come on course  According to the RealPage report  during the last half of 2017  across the nation s 150 largest metros  annual pace of completions  climbed above the 300 000 unit level  Further  through early 2019   scheduled new supply  will keep adding on to the flow at about the same annual pace Admittedly  the performance of residential REITs in recent quarters has been affected by elevated supply of new units in the market  The anticipation of continued stress in the environment might impact landlords  ability to command higher rents and fill up vacant spaces  So  pressure on new lease rates  occupancy as well as retention would persist  while concession activity to lure renters is expected to remain high Now it s time for investors to consider portfolio reshuffling and discard some stocks from the said sector  which are unlikely to bounce back in the near term  Among these are AvalonBay Communities Inc    NYSE AVB    a residential REIT  which owned or held direct or indirect ownership stake in 288 apartment communities as of Dec 31  2017  The company s shares have underperformed its   in the past three months  During this time period  shares of the company have lost 4 8   whereas the industry incurred a 2 8  loss  Additionally  the stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 and 2019 funds from operations  FFO  per share being revised 1 3  and 1 6  downward in two months  time  reflecting bearish analyst sentiment Apartment Investment   Management Co    NYSE AIV    better known as Aimco  has ownership stakes in 182 communities across 22 states and the District of Columbia  The company s shares have declined 3 8  and underperformed the industry it belongs to  in three months  time  Further  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 and 2019 FFO per share have both been revised 0 8  downward in a month s time Mid America Apartment Communities  Inc    NYSE MAA     commonly referred as MAA   enjoyed ownership stake in 100 489 apartment units as of Dec 31  2017  The company s shares have underperformed the industry it belongs to over the past three months  with a 4 1  decline  Moreover  the stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both 2018 and 2019 FFO per share being revised 0 8  downward in the last month Note  Anything related to earnings presented in this write up represents funds from operations  FFO    a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest StrategiesIt s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But while the market gained  21 9  in 2017  our top stock picking screens have returned  115 0    109 3    104 9    98 6   and  67 1  And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon  Over the years it has been remarkably consistent  From 2000   2017  the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over  Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we re willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation ,2018-04-04,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-stocks-to-dump-as-apartment-market-moderates-in-q1-200303353,200303353
8257,229772,AVB,Vident Financial Launches Real Estate ETF ,opinion,"Vident Financial launched a new fund on Mar 27  focused on providing exposure to the real estate space of the United States equity market 
U S  Diversified Real Estate ETF  seeks to track  before fees and expenses  the performance of the U S  Diversified Real Estate Index 
Fund Characteristics
The fund s index seeks to employ a rules based approach to offer investors a multi factor alternative to traditional market cap weighted real estate funds   If you ask for the three most important factors when investing in real estate  you ll probably hear  location  location  location   To this we d add property type and leverage   per a Business Wire  citing Fred Stoops  head of real estate investments at Vident 
The fund amassed  9 million in AUM within a few days of trading  It charges a fee of 53 basis points a year   The fund s top three holdings include Equity Residential   NYSE EQR    Avalonbay Communities Inc   NYSE AVB   and Terreno Realty Corp   NYSE TRNO    with 3 8   3 4  and 3 0  exposure  respectively 
How Does it Fit in a Portfolio 
The Real Estate segment of the U S  market has played an integral role in the expansion of the U S  economy  Although it requires immense knowledge about the sector and bears significant risks  equity funds providing exposure to the sector are a great way to diversify traditional portfolios   
Owing to its low correlation with other asset classes  the real estate sector is a great diversifier  Moreover  real estate investments are a great way to gain inflation protection  as rising prices increase the resale value of the property and it can also be used to generate rental income

8260,229775,AVB,REITs To Watch For Earnings On Apr 25  AVB  DRE  PSA And UDR,opinion,We are in the heart of the Q1 reporting cycle and the real estate investment trust  REIT  space is buzzing with activity  In fact  there is a deluge of Q1 earnings releases lined up for this week  of which AvalonBay Communities  Inc    NYSE AVB    Duke Realty Corporation   NYSE DRE    Public Storage   NYSE PSA   and UDR Inc    NYSE UDR   will release quarterly numbers on Apr 25 Rate hike and cautious approach of investors have affected returns from this industry  so far  this year  However  with underlying asset categories and the location of properties playing a crucial role in determining REITs  performance  not all players in the space are equally poised to excel or fall behind this season Per a  by the commercial real estate services firm   CBRE Group Inc    NYSE CBRE     availability fell for 31 straight quarters to 7 3  for the U S  industrial market in first quarter 2018  The figure not only marked a contraction of 6 basis points  bps  sequentially  but also shrunk 20 bps  year over year  on average  across 50 markets that are followed by CBRE  Moreover  net asking rents inched up 1 9  in Q1 to  7 01 per square foot  denoting the highest mark since CBRE started following the metric in 1989  High consumption levels  strengthening e commerce market  and a healthy manufacturing environment amid recovering economy and job market are fueling demand However  the latest  from the real estate technology and analytics firm   RealPage  Inc    NASDAQ RP     states that the national apartment market moderated in the Jan Mar quarter  Nevertheless  the first quarter marks a slow leasing period  thanks to the cold weather that inhibits shift of households and limits growth in demand Going by statistics  annual rent growth shrunk to 2 3  in Q1  This marked moderation from the 2 6 2 9  growth rate experienced throughout 2017  Occupancy level of 94 5  this March edged down from the prior year tally of 95   with metros having subdued construction activity faring well and recording the strongest occupancy  Nevertheless  the overall occupancy level is still healthy Furthermore  the self storage industry is anticipated to experience solid demand backed by favorable demographic changes  improving job market and rising incomes  as well as events like marriages  shifting  death  and even divorce  Also  due to shorter leasing periods  this REIT has the power to adjust its rents quickly to any rate hike Therefore  let s have a close look at the factors that will impact the above mentioned REITs  first quarter results AvalonBay Communities Inc Residential REIT AvalonBay is well poised to grow on the back of rising demand from household formation and favorable demographics  Additionally  increasing consumer confidence driven by job growth  higher wages and a healthier balance sheet promises brighter prospects for this Arlington  VA based REIT  Amid these  the company is likely to continue experiencing high occupancy However  there is an increasing apartment supply in a number of markets of the company  This high supply is expected to have put pressure on rental rates in the to be reported quarter  In addition  there is high concession activity amid elevated supply  which remains a concern    Read more   In a March issued operating update for the first quarter  AvalonBay stated that it expects total rental revenues for established communities to be up 2 3 2 4  year over year  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first quarter revenues is  558 5 million  denoting an expected increase of 6 9  year over year  Further  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for funds from operations  FFO  per share is pegged at  2 18  indicating projected increase of 4 3  year over year Moreover  our proven model does not conclusively show that AvalonBay is likely to beat estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a bullish Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or at least 3  Hold  for this to happen  But that is not the case here  as you will see below You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  In fact  though AvalonBay has a favorable Zacks Rank of 3  its Earnings ESP of  0 28  makes surprise prediction difficult Moreover  AvalonBay has a mixed surprise history  as evident from the chart below AvalonBay Communities  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise    Duke Realty CorporationIn recent years  Duke Realty has made concerted efforts to enhance its industrial portfolio  Admittedly  this asset class has been witnessing improving fundamentals amid economic recovery and growth of e commerce business  This is spurring demand for warehouse space as companies are compelled to enhance and renovate their distribution and production platforms  helping the industrial real estate market to record growth Nonetheless  Duke Realty is enhancing its portfolio mix through continued divestitures  which includes the significant disposition of sub urban office assets and medical office buildings  While such efforts are a strategic fit for the long term  the near term dilutive effect on earnings cannot be bypassed  Furthermore  the company faces significant competition from developers  owners and operators of the commercial real estate  This influences its ability to attract and retain tenants at relatively higher rents than its competitors   Read more   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first quarter revenues is currently pegged at  183 8 million  indicating a decline of 15 7  year over year  Also  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share is 30 cents  pointing to an estimated year over year decline of 6 3  Although Duke Realty has a favorable Zacks Rank of 3  its Earnings ESP of  1 70  lowers chances of any positive surprise this season The story about Duke Realty s decent surprise history is better told by the chart below Duke Realty Corporation Price and EPS Surprise    Public StoragePublic Storage is one of the largest owners and operators of storage facilities in the United States  High brand value  strategic acquisitions  robust presence in key cities and healthy balance sheet serve as major growth drivers for the company  The company is likely to be able to achieve reasonable rate hike for its existing customers  In addition  acquisition and expansion initiatives are anticipated to stoke growth Amid these  the company remains well poised to record growth in revenues  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at  668 9 million  depicting projected rise of 3 6   Further  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share is currently pegged at  2 46  indicating an expected rise of 5 1  year over year Nevertheless  supply has been rising in a number of markets and this adversely affects the company s pricing power  In fact  it operates in a highly fragmented market in the nation  with intense competition from numerous private  regional and local operators  This  in turn  limits the company s power to raise rents and turn on more discounting   Read more   Moreover  with an Earnings ESP of 0 00  and a Zacks Rank of 3  our proven model does not conclusively show that Public Storage will likely beat estimates this season  You can see  The company has a mixed surprise history that is depicted by the graph below Public Storage Price and EPS Surprise     UDR Inc UDR boasts a vast experience in the residential real estate market  Additionally  it has a superior portfolio in targeted U S  markets and adheres to disciplined capital allocation  These are likely to drive results in the to be reported quarter  Specifically  the company is predicted to benefit from favorable demographic trends  There is a steady demand for rental apartments from both new millennial households and empty nesters  Along with this  the healthy job market is estimated to drive demand for apartments However  the company has been dealing with escalating deliveries in a number of its markets  This remains a concern as elevated levels of supply curtail landlords  ability to demand higher rents and result in lesser absorption  Consequently  concession levels are estimated to have remained at the higher end  while UDR s pricing power might have been limited in the quarter   Read more   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share for the soon to be reported quarter is pegged at 47 cents  This indicates a 4 4  increase year over year  For the first quarter  management projects FFO per share of 46 48 cents  Moreover  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first quarter revenues is pegged at  253 million  indicating year over year improvement of 3 8  Although UDR has a favorable Zacks Rank of 3  its Earnings ESP of  0 30  lowers

8262,229777,AVB,AvalonBay Sees Higher than Expected Q2 Rental Revenue Growth,opinion,In the recently announced quarterly update  residential REIT AvalonBay Communities Inc    NYSE AVB   noted that it expects total rental revenues for established communities in Q2 to climb 2 4 2 5  from the prior year period The midpoint of the latest outlook denotes a 15 basis point expansion from what the company had previously projected for the second quarter when it provided the 2018 established communities total rental revenue growth outlook this January  The company reported a 2 4  increase in rental revenues for established communities in the first quarter Established communities refer to those consolidated communities which have stabilized occupancy as of Jan 1  2017  and are neither executing nor planning any significant redevelopment work  and are not held for sale or planned for disposition in the current year Moreover  the company mentioned that it has begun construction on two new communities for an estimated total capital cost of around  205 million in the second quarter  On the other hand  the company sold two wholly owned operating communities for approximately  195 million  Two other wholly owned communities are under contract or in advanced marketing stages for a projected price of around  280 million Notably  in the peak leasing session  AvalonBay is expected to benefit from its high quality assets in premium locations  favorable demographics  household formation  recovering economy and job market growth However  new apartment deliveries are anticipated to remain elevated in the company s markets in 2018 and modestly descend in 2019  Specifically  the Metro New York  New Jersey and Mid Atlantic regions are likely to remain turbulent amid rising supply of residential units in the upcoming quarters  In fact  in the Mid Atlantic region  supply is expected to continue through 2019  while in New York  New Jersey market  supply might attain peak level this year  before declining in 2019  Additionally  supply continues to be the most noticeable in the urban sub markets This high supply in a number of the company s markets is likely to put pressure on rental rates  Hence  growth in AvalonBay s stabilized portfolio is expected to remain modest in the near future  Furthermore  there is high concession activity amid higher supply  which remains a concern Nonetheless  this elevated supply has not only affected AvalonBay  but other residential REITs as well  including Equity Residential   NYSE EQR   and Essex Property Trust Inc    NYSE ESS    curbing their near term growth momentum to some extent  And there seems to be no respite from this   dreary environment any time soon  with aggressive deliveries anticipated to continue through early next year too In fact  according to a  from real estate technology and analytics firm   RealPage  Inc    NASDAQ RP     during the last half of 2017  across the nation s 150 largest metros  annual pace of completions  climbed above the 300 000 unit level  Further  through early 2019   scheduled new supply  will keep adding on to the flow at about the same annual pace AvalonBay currently has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  The company s shares have appreciated 2 3  in the past month compared with its  s growth of 1 1  The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of AllLast year  it generated  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  47 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce  the world s first trillionaires   but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early ,2018-06-04,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/avalonbay-sees-higherthanexpected-q2-rental-revenue-growth-200322343,200322343

8265,229780,AVB,Encouraging Near Term Outlook For Residential REIT Stocks,opinion,"Real estate investment trusts  REITs  invest in all types of properties   from offices to malls to hospitals and hotels  The Zacks  category is the one which is engaged in owning  developing and managing a variety of residences  The types of residences include apartment buildings  student housing  manufactured homes and single family homes  Residential REITs rent space in these properties to tenants and earn a rental income in return Some of the prominent players in this industry are AvalonBay Communities  NYSE AVB   Inc   AVB   Apartment Investment and Management Company  AIV   Mid America Apartment Communities  Inc   MAA  and UDR Inc   UDR  The latest  from real estate technology and analytics firm RealPage  Inc   RP  suggest that following a robust prime leasing season in 2019  the U S  apartment rental market put up a decent show in October and November  despite demand for apartments generally slowing down during colder months as renters usually prefer less to move in the winter  Occupancy remained as high as 95 7  in November  reflecting 40 basis points  bps  higher than one year ago and only 20 bps lower than a month before  This also marks the highest rate in any November on record  Moreover  annual U S  rent growth remained strong in the month at 2 9   same as in October Here are the three major themes in the industry Resilient Economy and Capital Availability  The latest numbers from the Labor Department indicate an upbeat job market picture  with increase in non farm payrolls and fall in unemployment rate in November  Also  consumer sentiment remains high and spending continues to be resilient  Household formation remains good  which will likely support the industry s growth   Moreover  easy availability of capital and comparatively lowers levels of interest rates keep the momentum upbeat Favorable Demographic Growth and Technology Embrace  Demographic growth continues to be strong in the young adult age cohort  which has a higher propensity to rent  In fact  a significant change in lifestyle has taken place and life cycle events are getting delayed  This  again  is leading to an extension of the average age of first time homeownership  While millennials will continue to move into homeownership  affordability issues are likely to temper the pace  In fact  with high home ownership costs in several markets hindering transition from renter to homeowner  demand for rental housing units is likely to be decent  Further  residential REITs are embracing new technology  aimed at improving operating margins and customer experiences  which is encouraging  These apart  the student housing sector  which is part of the residential REIT industry  has been witnessing decent demand and pre leasing velocity despite more newer student beds Elevated Deliveries of New Units and Rent Control  However  the struggle to lure renters is feared to continue into the near term  as supply volumes might remain aggressive  According to a CBRE Group  NYSE CBRE   CBRE   discussing 2020 multi family outlook  permits and starts will likely drop in 2020  but not deliveries  CBRE Group projects multi family completions to aggregate 280 000 units  nearly same as 2019 s estimated 281 000 units  Although rental housing demand has been robust in recent times  this high supply volume is a concern because it generally curbs residential landlords  ability to command more rents  and affect occupancy and concession levels  Moreover  new rent control regulations have been introduced in some of the major markets this year  while a number of other markets are being considered for establishing such regulations in future  This is likely to curb any significant growth in the top line Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Better ProspectsThe Zacks REIT And Equity Trust   Residential industry is housed within the broader Zacks  sector  It carries a Zacks Industry Rank  83  which places it at the top 33  of more than 250 Zacks industries The group s   which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks  indicates bright near term prospects  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 The industry s positioning in the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries is a result of positive funds from operations  FFO  per share outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate  Looking at the aggregate FFO per share estimate revisions  it appears that analysts are gaining confidence in this group s growth potential  Over the past eight months  the industry s FFO per share estimate for the current year moved 1 3  north Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio  let s take a look at the industry s recent stock market performance and valuation picture Industry Leads on Stock Market PerformanceThe REIT And Equity Trust   Residential Industry has outperformed the broader Zacks Finance sector  as well as the Zacks S P 500 composite so far in the year The industry has rallied 27  during this period compared with the S P 500 s rise of 24 4   During the same time frame  the broader Finance sector has gained 15 9  Year to Date Performance 
Industry s Current ValuationOn the basis of forward 12 month price to FFO  funds from operations  ratio  which is a commonly used multiple for valuing Residential REITs  we see that the industry is currently trading at 20 95X compared to the S P 500 s forward 12 month price to earnings  P E  of 18 16X  The industry is trading above the Finance sector s forward 12 month P E of 14 61X  This is shown in the chart below Forward 12 Month Price to FFO  P FFO  Ratio 
Over the last five years  the industry has traded as high as 21 89X  as low as 16 20X  with a median of 18 42X Bottom LineIn a nutshell  despite elevated supply in a number of markets and rent regulations  the apartment rental market s fundamentals are likely to remain buoyed by a stable economy  a healthy job market with low unemployment level  and job gains and household formations Currently  there is no stock in the industry sporting a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   However  there is a stock carrying a Zacks Rank of 2  Buy   which seems a strategic one for addition to the portfolio as well as two other picks for considerations  You can see   Sun Communities  Inc   SUI   This Southfield  MI based REIT is engaged in ownership  operation or enjoys stake in manufactured housing and recreational vehicle communities located in 32 states throughout the United States and Ontario  Canada  The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of 2  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 FFO per share has been marginally revised upward in two months  time to  4 89  It also indicates a projected year over year increase of 6 8  
Equity Residential  NYSE EQR   EQR   The Chicago  IL based residential REIT is engaged in the acquisition  development and management of rental apartment properties in urban and high density suburban communities where renters want to live  work and play  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current year FFO per share has moved 0 6  north over the past 60 days to  3 47  It also indicates a year over year increase of 6 8   Equity Residential currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and its long term projected growth rate is 6 2

Note  Funds from operations  FFO  is a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs rather than net income as it indicates cash flow from their operations  FFO is obtained after adding depreciation and amortization to earnings and subtracting the gains on sales  Breakout Biotech Stocks with Triple Digit Profit Potential  The biotech sector is projected to surge beyond  775 billion by 2024 as scientists develop treatments for thousands of diseases  They re also finding ways to edit the human genome to literally erase our vulnerability to these diseases   Zacks has just released Century of Biology  7 Biotech Stocks to Buy Right Now to help investors profit from 7 stocks poised for outperformance  Our recent biotech recommendations have produced gains of  98    119  and  164  in as little as 1 month  The stocks in this report could perform even better ",2019-12-12,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/encouraging-nearterm-outlook-for-residential-reit-stocks-200492523,200492523
8266,229781,AVB,What s In Store For Equity Residential s  EQR  Q4 Earnings ,opinion,Equity Residential   NYSE EQR   is slated to report fourth quarter and full year 2019 results on Jan 28  after market close  The company s quarterly performance is likely to reflect growth in both revenues and funds from operations  FFO  per share In the last reported quarter  this Chicago  IL based residential real estate investment trust  REIT  posted a positive surprise of 3 41  in terms of FFO per share  Results reflected higher same store net operating income  NOI  and lease up NOI  and other non same store NOI Over the trailing four quarters  the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice and missed in the other occasion  the average positive surprise being 1 16   The graph below depicts this surprise history Equity Residential Price and EPS Surprise    Let s see how things are shaping up for Equity Residential prior to this announcement Factors at PlayThe latest  from real estate technology and analytics firm RealPage  Inc    NASDAQ RP   suggest that following a robust prime leasing season in 2019  the U S  apartment rental market put up a decent show in the December end quarter  amid demand for apartments generally slowing down during the colder months as renters usually prefer less to move in winters Occupancy at the end of fourth quarter 2019 remained as high as 95 8   reflecting a 40 basis point expansion  year on year  Moreover  rents for new resident leases were up 2 8  in 2019  hovering around the 3  level that the apartment market has been witnessing since late 2016 Equity Residential is likely to have benefited from its initiatives to reposition the company s portfolio in high barrier to entry core markets  The company is expected to have witnessed healthy demand for its properties amid solid job market and household formation  It is also likely to have gained from high home ownership costs in several markets  which hinder transition from renter to homeowner Moreover  in November  Equity Residential fortified its financial position by entering into a  2 5 billion multi currency revolving credit facility  replacing the prior  2 billion credit agreement  The company has also raised the maximum size for its unsecured commercial paper note program from  500 million to  1 billion  Such strategic measures provide enhanced financial flexibility However  Equity Residential has been witnessing high new supply across a number of its markets  This elevated supply level will likely keep straining lease rates  occupancy as well as retention  and impede revenue growth  Furthermore  occupancy and same store revenues are likely to moderate in sync with the usual seasonal activity This apart  as Equity Residential is repositioning its portfolio to focus on key markets  the company continues to acquire as well as dispose assets  At times  such transactions lead to dilutive impact in the near term  which cannot be bypassed   For the fourth quarter  Equity Residential projects normalized FFO per share at 87 89 cents  For full year 2019  the company expects normalized FFO per share of  3 46  3 48  backed by same store portfolio revenue growth of 3 3   physical occupancy of 96 4   and NOI change of 3 1   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter FFO per share is currently pegged at 89 cents  indicating a 6  year over year improvement  backed by solid revenues  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company s quarterly revenues is pinned at  685 million  suggesting anticipated growth of around 5  year on year However  Equity Residential s activities during the October December quarter were inadequate to gain analyst confidence  Consequently  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter s FFO per share remained unchanged over the past 30 days Also  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the 2019 FFO per share is currently pinned at  3 47  unaltered for the past 60 days  Full year revenues are projected at  2 7 billion Here is what our quantitative model predicts Equity Residential does not have the right combination of two key ingredients   a positive  and Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or higher   for increasing the odds of an earnings beat You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our   Earnings ESP  The Earnings ESP for Equity Residential is 0 00  Zacks Rank  Equity Residential currently carries a Zacks Rank of 2  Buy   which increases the predictive power of ESP  However  we also need a positive ESP to be confident of a positive surprise Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few stocks in the REIT sector that you may want to consider  as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to report a positive surprise

performance for fourth quarter 2017  The company reported core funds from operations  FFO  per share of  3 01 for the quarter  meeting the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Core FFO per share improved 7 1  from the year ago quarter figure of  2 81 Results reflect solid growth in net operating income  NOI  and high occupancy level Total revenues of  345 1 million in the quarter grew 4 9  year over year  However  the figure narrowly missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  346 5 million In 2018  management expects housing demand to surpass supply in coastal markets of California and Washington  This is likely to result in growth in market rent close to long term averages  Specifically  West Coast is anticipated to outdo the nation both in terms of rent growth as well as job growth in the year For full year 2017  core FFO per share came in at  11 91  7 9  ahead of the prior year tally of  11 04  This was backed by 5 4  year over year growth in total revenues to  1 4 billion Following the earnings release on Feb 7  shares of Essex Property rallied 4 7  and closed at  227 94 on Feb 9 Quarter in DetailDuring the reported quarter  Essex Property s same property gross revenues grew 3 0  from the prior year quarter  while same property net operating income  NOI  improved 3 4  year over year  Financial occupancies of 96 8  expanded 20 basis points  bps  year over year Further  the company sold two communities for a total contract price of  160 3 million during the quarter  On the other hand  the company acquired one community for a total contract price of  59 0 million LiquidityEssex Property exited year end 2017 with cash and cash equivalents  including restricted cash  of  61 1 million  down from  170 3 million at the end of 2016 Notably  in January 2018  the company made an amendment to its unsecured line of credit facility  thereby enhancing the maximum amount available for borrowing from  1 0 billion to  1 2 billion as well as lengthening the maturity to December 2021  As of Feb 2  2018  the company had around  891 0 million in undrawn capacity on its unsecured credit facilities During the fourth quarter  the company issued 33 571 shares of common stock at an average price of  261 19 through its equity distribution program for net proceeds of  8 7 million  For full year 2017  the company issued 345 444 shares of common stock at an average price of  260 38  This helped generate net proceeds of  89 1 million OutlookEssex Property provided its guidance for first quarter and full year 2018  For the full year  the company projects core FFO per share in the range of  12 24   12 64  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at  12 42 The full year 2018 projection is backed by expectations for same property revenue growth in the band of 2 0 3 0  and same property NOI increase in the range of 1 6 3 4  For first quarter 2018  the company projects core FFO per share in the  2 99  3 09 band  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at  3 05 ConclusionWe are encouraged with the better than expected performance in terms of FFO per share of Essex Property in the reported quarter but slightly disappointed with the revenue miss  With a strong property base and solid balance sheet  Essex Property is likely to leverage on favorable demographic trends in its markets  The company s substantial exposure to the West Coast market  which is home to several innovation and technology companies  offers ample scope to boost its top line over the long term  However  elevated apartment deliveries

8294,229809,AVB,Stocks   S P Knocked Down by Boeing  JNJ  China,news,"Investing com   Stocks finished the week on a down note on slumps in Boeing and Johnson   Johnson  plus new worries about Chinese economic growth 
The S P 500 was off 0 39   But the Dow Jones industrials slumped 0 95   or more than 255 points  and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0 83  
Just about all of the Dow s decline was due to Boeing s  NYSE BA  6 8  loss and a 6 2  decline for Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ   The two subtracted more than 227 points from the price weighted blue chip index 
The higher a stock s price  the more impact it has on the index  And gains for other stocks can be overshadowed by a big more from a stock with a big price 
In fact  14 of the 30 stocks were higher  with Coca Cola  NYSE KO   up 1 8  on the better than expected third quarter results  and   Verizon Communications    NYSE VZ   up 1 06   
 
Boeing s slump came after Reuters reported that text messages between two employees suggested the planemaker misled the Federal Aviation Administration about the safety of the grounded 737 MAX aircraft 
Johnson   Johnson fell after announcing it would recall baby powder in the United States after regulators found trace amounts of asbestos in a sample
The S P 500  meanwhile  finished under 3 000 for the 21st straight session 
The Nasdaq was weighed down by weakness in tech stocks  especially chip stocks  The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index dropped 1 06   in large part due to worries about China  which reported its GDP growth rate dropped to 6  year over year  its weakest pace in nearly 30 years  The slide is largely the effect of the U S  China trade fight 
Thanks to the Dow s drubbing on Friday  the index ended the week down 0 17   its fourth weekly loss in five weeks  The S P 500  far more diverse  was up 0 54  for the week  its second straight gain  The Nasdaq added 0 4   its third weekly gain  in row 
For the year  the Dow is up nearly 14 8   The S P 500 is up 19 1   with the Nasdaq up 21 9  
The necessary caveat is that the gains came mostly in the first quarter as the market recovered from last fall s big dive 
The Dow is off 0 67  from its 2018 peak  along with a 0 54  decline from the same peak for the Nasdaq  The S P 500 is up 1 54  
But the worries weighed on the Dow and the S P 500 as well because so many U S  companies have looked to China as a major source of new sales 
Seven of the 11 S P sectors were lower  but there was considerable strength in real estate  financial and utility stocks as interest rates were flat to lower  
The 10 Year Treasury yield fell to 1 75  from Thursday s 1 755   It could go lower if the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates at its Oct  29 30 meeting  The odds of that happening stood at nearly 90  late Friday 
Apartment companies  including AvalonBay Communities  NYSE AVB  and Apartment Investment and Management  NYSE AIV   hit new highs  along with   Home Depot    NYSE HD  and Whirlpool Corporation  NYSE WHR   hit new highs

8313,229828,AVB,Factors To Impact Mid America Apartment  MAA  Q4 Earnings,opinion,Mid America Apartment Communities  Inc    NYSE MAA     commonly known as MAA   is slated to report fourth quarter and full year 2019 results on Jan 29  after the market closes  The company s results will likely reflect year over year growth in both revenues as well as funds from operations  FFO  per share In the last reported quarter  this Germantown  TN based residential real estate investment trust  REIT  reported a negative surprise of 1 29  in terms of FFO per share  Nonetheless  same store net operating income  NOI  growth and rise in average effective rent per unit for the same store portfolio supported year over year improvement in rental and other property revenues Over the trailing four quarters  the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on two occasions  missed in one and met in the other  the average positive surprise being 1 66   This is depicted in the chart below Mid America Apartment Communities  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise    MAA has provided its guidance for fourth quarter 2019 FFO per share  projected at  1 59  1 67  For 2019  the company estimates FFO per share in the range of  6 46  6 54  Further  the outlook for adjusted FFO per share is  5 82  5 90 Let s see how things are shaping up for MAA prior to this announcement Factors at PlayFollowing a robust prime leasing season in 2019  the U S  apartment rental market put up a decent show in the December end quarter  despite demand for apartments generally slowing down during the colder months as renters usually prefer less to move in winters Per the latest  from real estate technology and analytics firm RealPage  Inc    NASDAQ RP    occupancy at the end of fourth quarter 2019 remained as high as 95 8   reflecting an expansion of 40 basis points  bps   year on year  Moreover  rents for new resident leases were up 2 8  in 2019  hovering around the 3  level that the apartment market has been witnessing since late 2016 Demand for MAA s portfolio is likely to remain higher in the quarter under review as well  with strong job growth across the company s Sunbelt markets  Also  positive demographic trend  supported by growth of prime age groups for rentals  and migration of population to the Sunbelt  are expected to have fueled household formation and apartment rental demand in its markets  leading to healthy trends in rent growth Also  a significant change in lifestyle has taken place and life cycle events are getting delayed  This is leading to an extension of the average age of first time homeownership  The young adult age cohort has also experienced a considerable part of the net job growth and is helping boost primary renter demand  Also  amid stellar demand for rental units  move outs for the same store portfolio are expected to have remained at a low level in the period under consideration Therefore  with a diversified portfolio across the region  both in terms of sub markets and price point  MAA is anticipated to have benefited from upbeat trends in the December end quarter  Moreover  MAA s redevelopment program that entails interior upgrades is anticipated to have attracted renters  These upgrades provide the residential REIT with higher pricing power  thereby driving top line growth  In fact  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter 2019 revenues is pinned at  416 million  calling for a year over year improvement of 4 5  However  the struggle to lure renters is likely to have continued in the October December quarter  as supply volumes were high in a number of the company s markets  Elevated supply curtails landlords  ability to command more rent and result in lesser absorption  Such an environment is estimated to have resulted in aggressive rental concessions and moderate pricing power of landlords  thereby curbing any robust growth momentum of the company MAA s activities during the to be reported quarter were inadequate to gain analysts  confidence  Consequently  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter 2019 FFO per share has been marginally revised downward to  1 63  over the last seven days  Nevertheless  the figure indicates a year over year increase of 5 2   For 2019  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share has been revised marginally south to  6 50  though it still indicates projected growth of 7 6  year on year on revenues of  1 64 billion Here is what our quantitative model predicts MAA does not have the right combination of two key ingredients   a positive  and Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or higher   for increasing the odds of an earnings beat You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our   Earnings ESP  The Earnings ESP for MAA is  0 53  Zacks Rank  MAA currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3  which increases the predictive power of ESP  However  we also need a positive ESP to be confident of a positive surprise Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few stocks in the REIT sector that you may want to consider  as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to report a positive surprise this quarter Apartment Investment and

8316,229831,AVB,Why Building A Position In REIT Stocks Makes Sense,opinion,"The REIT industry s performance has long being ruled by movements in interest rates  particularly treasury yields  But with fundamentals of the underlying assets playing as important a role in determining REITs  price performance  demand supply dynamics and tenant performance are commanding attention 
In fact  a number of asset categories are displaying strength with the economy and the job market showing signs of recovery  The REITs catering to these are generating solid returns  at times even above the broader market 
Moreover  the growing importance of the REIT industry over the years is quite evident and the creation of the exclusive headline sector for real estate under the Global Industry Classification Standard  GICS  last year raised expectations of  and pushing up valuations over time 
Also  the U S  REIT market has continued to expand with the FTSE NAREIT All REITs Index  comprising 227 REITs with a combined equity market capitalization of  1 126 trillion   This is ahead of 219 REITs and  972 billion in equity market capitalization  
Further  investors  faith in this sector and their willingness to pour money into it is increasing  This is apparent when we look at the industry s capacity to raise capital from the market  In fact  in the first eight months of 2017  REITs raised  62 8 billion of  that was well ahead of the  52 3 billion generated in the comparable period prior year 
Therefore  the time is now apt to explore the industry in depth and scoop up big gains 
Data Center REITsGrowth in cloud computing  Internet of Things and big data  and an increasing number of companies opting for third party IT infrastructure are driving demand for data center REITs  In fact  demand is outpacing supply in top tier data center markets and despite enjoying high occupancy  these markets are absorbing new construction at a faster pace 
Additionally  according to a Cisco   global  data center to data center  IP traffic is expected to witness a compound annual growth rate of 32  over the 2015 2020 period  Further  per Gartner reports  worldwide IT spending growth is  to increase 3 3   while worldwide server shipments are expected to rise 4 0  in 2017  This  along with improved outlook for economic growth  is anticipated to drive demand for data centers  In fact  this REIT segment pulled in capital and scored well on the return book through August 2017  registering  of 31 8  
Industrial REIT
In the industrial real estate market  demand for space has been high for several quarters  Going by numbers  per a  by the commercial real estate services  firm   CBRE Group Inc  NYSE CBG    CBG    the overall U S  industrial real estate market remained upbeat in the second quarter  with the industrial availability rate declining 10 basis points to 7 8  
This marked not only the market s 27th decline in the past 28 quarters  but also the lowest level since first quarter 2001  Obviously  a recovering economy and job market gains aided this improvement  but the e commerce boom and a healthy manufacturing environment were the chief drivers  Also  lower than expected completion of construction kept supply numbers at check 
Particularly  amid economic expansion  e commerce development and heightened urbanization  companies are shifting their strategy toward services like same day delivery and other options  propelling demand for warehouse distribution facilities  Also  according to a  from Prologis Inc   PLD   for a given level of revenues  online retailers require three times the distribution center space compared with traditional retailers  This is creating scope for industrial REITs like Prologis  DCT Industrial Trust Inc   DCT  and Liberty Property Trust  LPT  to prosper

In addition  the U S  office vacancy rate  at 13  in the second quarter amid balanced demand supply  according to a report from CBRE Group  In around half of the U S  office markets  vacancy recorded a decline and the national office vacancy rate is hovering close to its post recession low 
Additionally  corporate profits are up and business confidence has recovered  Going forward  with economic improvement and recovery in the job market  demand for office space is expected to shoot up 
Residential REITs
Further  defying concerns about supply in the market  the residential real estate market is back with a bang driven by robust demand  Per a  by the real estate technology and analytics firm  RealPage  Inc   RP   the second quarter demand level of 175 645 apartments across the nation marked one third increase from the level witnessed a year ago  This helped occupancy to remain high at 95 0  as of mid year and led to stabilization in the annual pace of rent growth  which came in at 3 6   close to 3 7  growth experienced in the first quarter 
Notably  job formation and checked move outs for buying homes acted as catalysts  Also  construction labor shortages have somewhat helped the industry to witness comparatively lesser supply through the first eight months of the year than anticipated earlier 
Moreover  with a higher education earnings gap    are earning just 62  of what college graduates are making   college enrollment is set to increase and this would drive demand for residential units that student housing REITs lease  Also  there is pent up demand for new  purpose built student housing properties that have better amenities than old  outdated housing 
Further  student housing REITs have decent opportunities to excel in the coming years as demand is emanating for on campus developments from universities that are facing state budget cuts and low funds  and are incapable of developing or renovating their aging housing properties  And on campus housing usually enjoys full occupancy 
Healthcare REITs
In the healthcare asset category too  with the aging population and healthcare providers opting for cost containment  less expensive delivery settings and new technologies  demand for medical office buildings as well as urgent care facilities is on the rise 
Per a CBRE Group   for the past seven years absorption of medical office space has surpassed new supply  This helped the segment s national vacancy rate to fall to 8  as of first quarter 2017  Also  high demand for this asset category has led to an increase in transaction volume in the segment that touched around  10 billion for the year ending first quarter 2017  per the report 
In addition  university based life science real estate is a new zone of investment  which has grabbed attention and health care REITs are making decent investments in this segment  Such investments help to capitalize on growing health care driven research and development  supported by top tier research universities 
Increasing longevity of the aging U S  population  along with biopharma drug development growth opportunities  have promoted institutional life science and medical market fundamentals  Further  long lease terms and top rated  institutional quality tenants assure steady growth in cash flows for health care landlords 
Retail REIT
Admittedly  shrinking mall traffic and store closures amid aggressive growth in online sales have kept retail REITs on tenterhooks  In addition  tenants are demanding substantial lease concessions owing to a choppy retail market scenario  Nonetheless  retail REITs are countering this dreary situation and putting in every effort to boost productivity of malls  by trying to grab attention from new and productive tenants and disposing the non productive ones 
Amid the ongoing changes in consumer behavior  retail REITs are avoiding heavy dependence on apparel and accessories and transforming their boring shopping hubs into swanky entertainment zones  They are expanding dining options  opening up movie theaters and offering recreational facilities  Eventually  such measures are likely to push up traffic 
Retail REITs also prefer expansion of shops  which comprise service based industries such as saloons and spas  personal fitness  and medical practices  Such properties enjoy frequent customer traffic  are Internet resistant  and therefore drive dependable traffic 
Mixed Use Developments
Mixed use developments too have gained popularity for their solid neighborhood character  greater housing variety and density  Such developments lower the distance between housing  workplaces  retail businesses  and other amenities and destinations  Hence  such developments enable companies to grab the attention of people who prefer to live  work and play in the same area   a trend that drove development in several other cities in the U S 
To explore these positives of mixed use developments  both residential REITs like AvalonBay Communities Inc  NYSE AVB    AVB  and retail REITs like Regency Centers Corp   REG  and Federal Realty Investment Trust  FRT  have directed their investments toward such projects in recent years

8665,230180,AVB,4 REIT Plays With Beat Potential In Q2 Earnings ,opinion,"Huge profits and earnings surprises can lure you this earnings season  But rather than accumulating stocks later  investing in those that are yet to release their numbers and poised to beat expectations can fetch you more gains  This is because an earnings beat essentially serves as a catalyst and raises investors  confidence in a stock  This leads to rapid price appreciation  ensuring more gains from one s investments Furthermore  buying an undervalued earnings play should translate into great returns when the stock eventually trades at a higher price  This brings us to the REIT industry  which has gained just 2 2  year to date compared with the S P 500 s return of 10  Admittedly  rate hike and cautious approach of investors have deterred gains from this industry so far this year  However  rather than entirely focusing on the rate factor  investors need to keep in mind that the operating performance of this special hybrid asset is highly determined by the dynamics of the individual asset categories  And a number of asset categories displayed strength in second quarter 2017  with the economy and the job market showing signs of recovery Take for example the industrial and office asset categories which hogged the limelight for experiencing high demand  Going by numbers  per a  by the commercial real estate services  firm   CBRE Group Inc   NYSE CBG    the overall U S  industrial real estate market remained upbeat in the second quarter  with the industrial availability rate declining 10 basis points to 7 8  This not only marked the market s 27th decline in the past 28 quarters  but also the lowest level since first quarter 2001  Obviously  recovering economy and job market gains aided this improvement  but specifically  e commerce boom and a healthy manufacturing environment were the chief drivers  Also  lower than expected completions of construction kept a check on the supply numbers In addition  the U S  office vacancy rate  at 13  in the second quarter amid a balanced demand supply environment  In around half of the U S  office markets  vacancy recorded a decline and the national office vacancy rate is hovering close to its post recession low Moreover  with growth in cloud computing  Internet of Things and big data  and an increasing number of companies opting for third party IT infrastructure  data center REITs are experiencing a boom market  In fact  demand has been outpacing supply in top tier data center markets  Despite enjoying high occupancy  these markets are absorbing new construction at a faster pace Additionally  defying concerns about supply in the market  the residential real estate market is back with a bang driven by robust demand levels  Per a  by the real estate technology and analytics firm  RealPage  Inc   RP   the second quarter demand level of 175 645 apartments across the nation marked one third increase from the level witnessed a year ago  This helped occupancy to remain high at 95 0  as of mid year and led to stabilization in the annual pace of rent growth  which came in at 3 6   close to 3 7  growth experienced in the first quarter  Notably  job formation and checked move outs for buying homes acted as the catalyst    The Zacks MethodologyHowever  not all REITs are equally poised to excel  In fact  despite the drivers  choosing the right stock could be quite difficult unless one knows the proper method  To make the task simple  we rely on the Zacks methodology  which takes into account a favorable Zacks Rank   Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  or 3  Hold    and a positive

8672,230187,AVB,Can AvalonBay  AVB  Pull Off A Surprise In Q1 Earnings ,opinion,AvalonBay Communities  Inc    NYSE AVB   is slated to report first quarter 2017 results after the market closes on Apr 26 Last quarter  this Arlington  VA based  residential real estate investment trust   REIT   delivered a positive surprise of 0 95   Growth in net operating income  NOI  from newly developed and existing operating communities attributed to this increase  However  this benefit was partly offset by a rise in interest expense Over the trailing four quarters  the company surpassed estimates in two quarters  however missed in the other two occasions  This resulted in an average negative surprise of 0 35   The graph below depicts the surprise history of the company  AvalonBay Communities  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise    Let s see how things have shaped up for this announcement Why a Likely Positive Surprise Our proven model shows that AvalonBay is likely to beat on estimates because it has the right combination of two key ingredients  A stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or at least 3  Hold  to beat estimates  and AvalonBay has the right mix You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our   Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP  which represents the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate of  2 12 and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 11  is  0 47   This is a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive surprise Zacks Rank  AvalonBay s Zacks Rank  3  when combined with a positive ESP  makes us reasonably confident of a positive surprise this season Conversely  we caution against stocks with Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions What s Driving the Better than Expected Earnings AvalonBay is well poised to grow on the back of a rising demand from household formation and favorable demographics  Moreover  increasing consumer confidence  on the back of job growth  rising wages and a healthier balance sheet  promise strong prospects for the company Notably  in Mar 2017  AvalonBay declared an uptick in its rental revenue outlook for first quarter 2017  Specifically  the company had estimated first quarter 2017 total rental revenue for established communities to grow 3 1 3 2  over the prior year period  At the midpoint  this denoted an expansion of around 25 basis points from the figure projected earlier when the company issued the full year rental revenue growth outlook for established communities on Feb 1 Admittedly  completion of a number of projects in its markets  leading to higher supply  is a concern as elevated supply usually leads to lesser absorption  curtails the landlord s capability to demand more rents and results in a rise in concession activity  However  amid this  increase in rental revenue outlook is encouraging  and reaffirms the company s fundamental strength and stability During the fourth quarter 2016 earnings release  the company revealed its funds from operations  FFO  per share guidance for first quarter 2017  AvalonBay estimated FFO per share in the range of  2 09  2 15 and core FFO per share in the band of  2 06  2 12 In addition  over the past three months  shares of AvalonBay outperformed the Zacks categorized  industry  While AvalonBay logged in a gain of 7 7   the industry climbed 3 9  over this period However  over the past seven days  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first quarter FFO per share fell 0 5  to 2 11

General Mills shares have not been doing too well lately  likely reflecting weakness in the company s U S  Retail segment as a result of lower demand amid changing consumer food preferences  But the analyst likes its robust restructuring savings  which are making up for the slower revenue growth  Though consumer focused innovation and marketing drive as well as greater distribution of natural and organic portfolio helped improve the top line on many businesses in segments like cereals and snacks in fiscal 2016  a material improvement may take time   You can  
Pfizer shares have lagged the market this year  in line with the broader the pharmaceutical space  on concerns about the group s pricing power in the current political environment  These issues notwithstanding  the analyst likes Pfizer s strategy of strengthening its product portfolio and pipeline through acquisitions and licensing deals  The 2015 Hospira acquisition has significantly expanded Pfizer s sterile injectable and biosimilar capabilities  However  headwinds remain in the form of genericization and the expiration of a few co promotion agreements which will continue to hamper top line growth  Estimate movement has been mixed lately ahead of the company s Q3 earnings release   You can

Properties Trust   NYSE OFC    Host Hotels   Resorts  Inc    NYSE HST   and Ventas  Inc    NYSE VTR   So far  the earnings season has delivered a mixed performancefrom the REITs  point of view  While top notch companies like Prologis  Inc    NYSE PLD    SL Green Realty Corp    NYSE SLG   and Boston Properties Inc    NYSE BXP   came up with better than expected performances  results in the residential sector have not been much impressive Nevertheless  REITs broadly benefit from the low rate environment for their high debt dependence nature  Hence  the Federal Reserve s decision to keep the rate hike on hold in July s meeting comes as a boon  But with REITs catering to different asset classes  individual market dynamics of the underlying asset category play a pivotal role in defining their performance While CBRE Group s   NYSE CBG   study of retail  industrial and office market fundamentals in Q2 have revealed stability and strength  not all REITs are equally poised to surpass this season  Therefore  we relied on the Zacks methodology  combining a favorable Zacks Rank   Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  or 3  Hold    and a positive   to predict the chances of a beat this quarter Our proprietary methodology  Earnings ESP  shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Research shows that with this combination

The company has an Earnings ESP of  2 04   This is a major indicator of a likely positive surprise  Moreover  it has a Zacks Rank  3  This combination of Host Hotels  Zacks Rank  3 and positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of a positive surprise this season Host Hotels is anticipated to grow its revenue per available room  RevPAR  in 2016 from that of 2015 through value enhancement and rebranding initiatives  Further  the company stands to gain from the strength in employment   business investments as well as its strategic capital recycling program  The company is likely to perform

8723,230238,AVB,REITs Gain As Fed Keeps Rates Same  But No Stellar Rally,opinion,Investors in the REIT industry breathed a sigh of relief as the Federal Reserve has again decided not to hike rates this time around  Reflecting this positive sentiment  the  increased 1 27  on Wednesday and majority of the REIT stocks ascended No doubt  the debt dependent REITs have long benefited from the low rate environment as low rate kept their borrowing costs down  On top of this  their dividend payout  which has been the major reason for their attraction  ended up being more attractive than the yields on fixed income and money market accounts in such an environment However  with speculations brewing in the market over a lift off this month  REIT stocks have been battered off late   Read   Calming their nerves came the  and  of economic projections at the end of the two day FOMC meeting  revealing a steady rate stance by the Fed this month and most notably  a pull down in expectations of rate increases in the years ahead  per the median projection of forecasts  Fed officials now project an increase of federal fund rates to 0 6  this year  instead of 0 9  predicted in June  For 2017  rate expectations are down to 1 1   against the previous estimate of 1 6   The same rate projection for 2018 is pegged at 1 9   down from 2 4  expected earlier Performance Remains ElusiveYet  a close look at the gains in REIT stocks yesterday reveals that the optimism has not been robust  Among the S P 500 constituents  REITs like AvalonBay Communities  Inc    NYSE AVB    Boston Properties Inc    NYSE BXP    Prologis  Inc    NYSE PLD   and Simon Property Group Inc    NYSE SPG   managed to rise just 1 5   1 4   2  and 1   respectively  This is because the chance of a rate hike this year has been kept alive by the Fed The statement revealed that the central bank has confidence in the economic growth and recognized its progress from the  modest pace seen in the first half of this year   but refrained from making the call  for the time being  for gathering  further evidence of continued progress toward its objectives  Also  the divergence between the opinions and projections of the Fed officials became much apparent this time with three voting members   Esther L  George  Loretta J  Mester  and Eric Rosengren   advocating a hawkish stance Essentially  this reflects a growing consensus among the Fed officials in favor of a rate hike in the upcoming meetings  We believe that the officials now doubt that unless rates start to go up  even at a modest pace  the economy might face overheating Bottom LineThe REITs are anticipated to bear the brunt when a rate hike will eventually occur  However  a gradual rate hike will give them sufficient time to adjust their funding needs  So if investors can gulp those hiccups  then there are high chances of solid gains over the long term Currently  AvalonBay Communities  Boston Properties  Prologis and Simon Property have a Zacks Rank   3  Hold   You can see  Now See Our Private Investment IdeasWhile the above ideas are being shared with the public  other trades are hidden from everyone but selected members  Would you like to peek behind the curtain and view them  Starting today  for the next month  you can follow all Zacks  private buys and sells in real time from value to momentum       from stocks under  10 to ETF and option moves       from insider trades to companies that are about to report positive earnings surprises  we ve called them with 80   accuracy   You can even look inside portfolios so exclusive that they are normally closed to new investors ,2016-09-22,Zacks Investment Research,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/reits-gain-as-fed-keeps-rates-same,-but-no-stellar-rally-200155075",200155075

8765,230280,AVB,A Cheap  High Yielding Apartment REIT,opinion,"I recently discussed one of the most significant problems facing our economy   a massive debt load  The aggregate debt level  relative to economic output  has not materially declined since the apex of the credit expansion in 2008 
To be sure  the situation has improved somewhat  Pockets of deleveraging have occurred 
However  there s one crucial area that s accumulating debt at a frightening pace  Outstanding student loan debt has surged to an astounding  1 26 trillion from  637 billion at the end of 2007 
The   with an average of  33 000 in student loan debt per graduate  This is particularly troublesome because these young adults are the next generation of consumers and homeowners  College graduates are becoming increasingly burdened with student loan payments well into their adult lives 
According to the National Association of Realtors  student loan debt is hampering the household formation process  In a recent survey  among first time buyers who said it was difficult to save for a down payment  54  said student loans made it tough to save money 
The Federal Reserve is even noticing the impact of these trends on the housing market  Below is an excerpt from the latest Federal Open Market Committee meeting minutes  emphasis added  
 Despite attractive mortgage rates  housing demand was seen as being damped by such factors as restrictive credit conditions  particularly for households with low credit scores  high down payments  or low demand among younger homebuyers  due in part to the burden of student loan debt  
Whether it s due to student loan debt  stagnant wages  economic hardship  or even personal preferences  homeownership among young adults is in a startling decline 
The homeownership rate in the first quarter of 2014 for Americans 35 and under fell to 36 2   the lowest level since the U S  Census Bureau started tracking home ownership by age in 1982 
But the Millennials have to live somewhere  If they don t own a house   and they aren t living with Mom and Dad   then they re probably renting 
Ultimately  those who own and manage apartment complexes and multifamily communities stand to benefit from a nation of renters 
Cashing in on a Nation of Renters
There s reason to believe that residential real estate investment trusts  REITs  are going to be the beneficiaries of these secular  macro tailwinds 
But as we ve been saying all year  the larger REITs tend to be expensive 
But a small cap REIT  Independence Realty Trust  AMEX IRT   has caught my attention this week 
Independence Realty Trust owns and operates garden style and mid rise apartment properties in Arizona  Colorado  Georgia  Indiana  Texas  and Virginia  The company just priced a secondary offering  or additional issuance of shares   and it intends to use the net proceeds from the offering primarily to acquire additional apartment properties 
In the past week  IRT s stock price has declined from over  10 50 down to around the offering price of  9 50  Secondaries are often good buying opportunities for astute investors  and from an investment standpoint  its valuation is very attractive 
The table below compares IRT with a few of the big boys  Equity Residential  NYSE EQR   AvalonBay Communities  NYSE AVB   and Essex Property Trust  NYSE ESS  

As you can see  IRT is far cheaper than these larger REITs based on its price to 2014 estimated funds from operations  FFO  
The new price to FFO ratio for IRT may change  depending on how much cash flow per dollar the new assets produce relative to the company s existing apartment portfolio 
However  I don t think the firm would be raising funds unless it and the external manager  a wholly owned subsidiary of RAIT Financial Trust  NYSE RAS   are confident that there are attractive acquisition opportunities out there 
Yield starved investors will also love IRT s 7 6  annualized dividend yield  as well as its monthly dividend payout 
Bottom line  Independence Realty Trust is a cheap  high yielding REIT that s positioned to benefit from our nation s shift towards renting

8766,230281,AVB,DC Market Still Choppy  Should You Buy AvalonBay ,opinion,"AvalonBay Communities Inc   AVB   the residential real estate investment trust  REIT   has been focusing on making investments in the high barrier to entry regions of the U S  Moreover  its development deliveries are expected to aid top line growth in the quarters ahead  Notably  a majority of its development pipeline includes properties on the West Coast that is witnessing improved fundamentals and healthier growth  This ensures steady rental revenue generation in the future 
In October  AvalonBay reported encouraging third quarter 2014 results  The company reported third quarter 2014 funds from operations  FFO  of  2 14 per share that came 6 5  ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate and jumped 81 4  from the prior year quarter figure  The impressive results were driven by improved performance of its newly developed and acquired communities 
Going forward  increasing consumer confidence backed by job growth  rising wage and healthier balance sheet keep us optimistic about the company s growth prospects  Apart from this  demographic growth continues to be strong in the young adult age cohort  which has a higher propensity to rent and provides a significant source of pent up demand 
Nevertheless  though these positives bode well for the company s future  yet  completion of a number of projects in the Metro DC area and modest job growth keeps the fundamentals of this market challenged 
Over the last 30 days  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2014 and 2015 FFO per share upped by 15 cents and a penny to  7 28 and  7 41  respectively  The company currently has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold

The Markets 
An unexpected rate cut out of China and hints of stimulus out of Europe were enough to fuel a rally in equity markets around the globe on Friday  The S P 500 Index and Dow Jones Industrial Average both gained just over half of one percent  charting a fifth straight weekly gain and maintaining an unprecedented climb from the lows charted in October  The S P 500 Index has now traded above its 5 day moving average for 26 sessions  tied for the longest run above this short term average in over 60 years   This 5 day moving average  at 2051 62 as of Friday s close  remains the line of support below this market  clearly  a catalyst is required to initiate a retracement  alleviating the overbought conditions that have become ubiquitous 



With central banks outside of the US maintaining accommodative policies  the US Dollar Index traded to the highest level in over four years  testing the June high of 88 71  This high marks a level of horizontal resistance that has kept a lid on the US currency since 2006  ahead of the accommodative policies implemented by the US Fed during the recent recession  With the US Fed on a path towards tightening  a breakout in the US Dollar through resistance appears inevitable  A move above resistance would complete a long term basing pattern  suggesting that the strength in the currency index realized since the summer is just the start of a more substantial move in the benchmark that could last for some years  The US Dollar seasonally gains through the first few months of the new year  but  before it enters this period of seasonal strength  it has to get through the weakest month of the year  based on the frequency of losses  Over the past 20 years  the US Dollar Index has declined 70  of the time in the month of December  recording an average loss of 0 80   Given the significant resistance that remains intact around 89  this may be the opportune time for the benchmark to retrace some of its recent gains  testing levels of support below before continuing higher along its long term path 



Of course  a stronger dollar is typically a negative for commodities priced in the domestic currency  From November of 1996 through to July of 1999  the approximately 20  rise in the US Dollar index resulted in a loss for the CRB commodity index of approximately 25   charting the lowest levels in the past 25 years  Just as The US Dollar Index is testing long term resistance  the CRB commodity index is testing long term support around 266  a break of which could set the benchmark up to test the 2010 low at around 250  and then the 2009 low around 200   The CRB Commodity Index remains seasonally negative through to mid December  weighed down by seasonal weakness in energy commodity prices 



Reverting back to the equity market  the strength in benchmarks around the globe on Friday has pushed the German Dax to a pivotal point within its intermediate trend  The benchmark  which is arguably a critical component to the success of the euro zone  is bumping up against declining trendline resistance within an ongoing megaphone pattern  A breakout from present levels would suggest a conclusion to the downward path that has pressured the benchmark since the start of summer  Much of the same can be said of the MSCI EAFE Index  which has been bound by the same pattern over the past four and a half months  Seasonally  the German Dax is entering into the strongest month of the year  gaining in 85  of Decembers over the past 20 years  resulting in an average gain of 2 7   The German Dax has started to show signs of outperformance versus the S P 500 Index  suggesting renewed investor interest

Copper is entering its period of seasonal strength  running through to May  gaining 10   on average  over the period  Although the metal shows mixed tendencies of gains in the last two months of the year  significant lows during this timeframe can often provide appealing entry points for the dominant period of strength through the first few months of the new year  The commodity benefits from a pick up in manufacturing and industrial production leading into the spring months  Looking at a long term chart  copper is presently trading within a massive descending triangle pattern  a bearish setup that would become fulfilled upon a break below support  presently at  3 00  Resistance is currently trending lower around  3 15  As the pattern narrows and price action reaches a peak  a break will become evident  providing confirmation of a bullish or bearish move ahead  Shorter term  the price of Copper is bumping up against resistance at the 50 day moving average  a break of which would conclude an intermediate negative trend that has remained apparent since the summer  Momentum indicators have been trending higher since the start of October  suggesting downside exhaustion  The metal is at a pivotal point  which has just become more interesting with the period of seasonal strength ahead of us

8769,230284,AVB,Are REITs Threatened By Treasury Yields  Rate Hikes ,opinion,The spotlight is once again on bond market behavior  and stocks are scrambling for an indication which way to turn  REITs  which are often treated as bonds because of their high dividend paying nature  are naturally in focus  As such  treasury yields end up playing a significant role in the price movement of REIT stocks    yields of which become less attractive when treasury yields rise  The global bond market has been bustling lately  Last Wednesday  yields on Germany s 10 Year Bunds  German government bonds  crossed the 1  threshold for the first time since September  with deflationary concerns being receded by the recent economic data and anticipations of stabilization in the Euro zone economy  The ripple effect of the European sell off could be felt in the U S  Treasury market where 10 Year yields remained high amid substantial government auctions  Despite anticipations of minor corrections  the yields are further expected to move up with the Fed gearing up for a rate hike in the upcoming months according to the consensus view Impact on Segments Essentially  rising interest rates lead to an increase in interest costs as REITs usually look for both fixed and variable rate debt financing to pay back maturing debt  and fund their acquisitions  development and redevelopment activities  Therefore  REITs cannot practically run away from the impact of rate hikes  But the extent of such an impact would depend on the nature of their leases and funding activities  Take for example the Healthcare REITs that usually have significant exposure to long term leased assets  The long term leases carry fixed rental rates that are subject to annual bumps  But their debt obligations bear floating rates with interest and related payments rates varying with the movement of LIBOR  Bankers  Acceptance or other indexes  Therefore  as the rates rise  the cost of borrowing increases but their revenue flows do not get adjusted quickly for their fixed rate nature  leading to an adverse impact on profitability  Consider Mortgage REITs that offer real estate financing through purchase or origination of mortgages and mortgage backed securities  MBS   These REITs fund their investments with equity and debt capital and earn profits from the spread between interest income on their mortgage assets and their funding costs  Though these types of REITs have started adjusting their strategies and business models  these companies bear long term risk as interest rates will eventually rise  In fact  for the equity REITs that acquire properties such as apartments  shopping malls  office buildings and several other kinds of assets and generate income from renting them out  there are risks besides the interest rate issue  Specific market weakness can also dampen their growth momentum  Among the equity REITs are the Apartment REITs for which elevation in the supply level in certain markets raises an alarm  This is because higher supply usually curtails the landlord s capability to demand more rents and leads to lesser absorption  In fact  the increase in deliveries of new units has already kept industry behemoths like AvalonBay Communities Inc  NYSE AVB  and Equity Residential  NYSE EQR  on their toes  AvalonBay is expected to experience an increase in supply in Seattle and Northern California  Moreover  the D C  region remains a weak market with a reasonable amount of supply coming online  For Equity Residential  new leasing is expected to face tremendous pressure and pricing might be adversely impacted in regions with elevated supply  Markets such as Washington D C   Boston  Brooklyn and Jersey City and South Florida are specific areas of concern  Even for the Hotel Lodging REITs  though supply in the West Coast is low and overall whole fundamentals remain strong  higher supply on the East Coast and overall pricing weakness continue to restrict RevPAR  Revenue Per Available Room  growth in the region  Specific REITs that we don t like with a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  include American Capital Mortgage Investment Corp   NASDAQ MTGE  and Redwood Trust  Inc   NYSE RWT  as well as Zacks Rank  4  Sell  stocks such as Ellington Residential Mortgage REIT  NYSE EARN   DDR Corp   NYSE DDR   Retail Properties of America  Inc   NYSE RPAI   American Homes 4 Rent  ASX AMH   Independence Realty Trust  Inc   NYSE IRT   Gladstone Commercial Corp   NASDAQ GOOD   Terreno Realty Corp   NYSE TRNO  and New York REIT  Inc   NYSE NYRT  Bottom Line Though uncertain markets and a low interest rate environment made defensive and high yielding industries like REITs more attractive in the past  the situation has changed now  REITs are in fact underperforming the broader equity market in recent months amid anticipations of a rate hike and treasury yield issues  While any precise prediction for a rate hike can prove wrong  this does not mean that rates will always remain low  In fact  whenever they do rise  rate sensitive REITs will bear the brunt if the hike is not accompanied by solid economic growth  Despite having many positives  there is no shortage of negative factors  Therefore  investors should satisfy themselves by dispassionately absorbing both sides of the argument and then call the shots ,2015-06-17,Zacks Investment

8811,230326,AVB,Key Reasons For Optimism On REITs,opinion,"Rising interest rates  treasury yields and supply increases in certain asset categories made investors jittery in recent months  But these were not enough to overshadow the REIT industry s growing importance over the years 
In fact  the U S  REIT market has  with the FTSE NAREIT All REITs Index  comprising 224 REITs with a combined equity market capitalization of  1 073 trillion  ahead of 219 REITs and  972 billion in equity market capitalization at the end of April 2016  Further  the creation of the exclusive headline sector for real estate under the GICS last year raised expectations of  and pushing up valuations over time 
Further   23 11 billion in capital raised in equity and debt during first quarter 2017 by publicly listed REITs set a 3 year record per the recent reit com   This indicates investors  faith in this sector and their willingness to pour money into it 
Also  with a number of asset categories revealing strength and the REITs catering to those with solid returns  at times above broader market  the time is now apt to explore the industry in depth and scoop up big gains 
Data Center REITsWith growth in cloud computing  Internet of Things and Big Data  and an increasing number of companies opting for third party IT infrastructure  data center REITs are experiencing a boom market  In fact  demand is outpacing supply in top tier data center markets  and despite enjoying high occupancy  these are absorbing new construction at a faster pace 
Additionally  according to a Cisco   global  data center to data center  IP traffic is expected to witness a compound annual growth rate of 32  over the 2015 2020 period  Further  per Gartner reports  worldwide IT spending growth is  to increase 3 3   while worldwide server shipments are expected to rise 4 6  in 2017  This  along with an improved outlook for economic growth  is anticipated to drive demand for data centers  In fact  data center REITs pulled in their capital and scored well on the return book through April 2017  registering  of 18 03  
Industrial REIT
In the industrial real estate market  demand for space has been high for several quarters  In fact  the overall U S  industrial real estate market also remained upbeat in first quarter 2017 despite increased supply  Per a NAREIT   Industrial REITs delivered solid same store NOI growth of 5 9  in the first quarter of 2017 
As a matter of fact  amid economic expansion  an e commerce boom and heightened urbanization  companies are shifting their strategy toward services like same day delivery  propelling demand for warehouse distribution facilities  In fact  per a  from Prologis Inc   PLD   for a given level of revenue  online retailers require three times the distribution center space compared with traditional retailers  This is creating scope for industrial REITs like Prologis  DCT Industrial Trust Inc   DCT  and Liberty Property Trust  LPT  to flourish  
Further  the construction of mega industrial houses  spanning 1 million square feet or more  is rampant in large industrial markets  according to another  from CBRE Group  NYSE CBG   Around 90 million square feet of these mega facilities  which benefit from growing e commerce business  have been accomplished since 2010 in the top 10 markets  while an additional 31 6 million square feet is under construction  with 60  pre commitments  displaying solid demand for such facilities 
Office REIT
Office REITs are experiencing decent demand in recent times  In fact  though the overall office vacancy rate moved up a modest 10 basis points to 13 0  in first quarter 2017 amid increased supply  according to a  from CBRE  in almost half of the office markets  vacancy level continued to fall and the national office vacancy rate stayed close to its post recession low  Going forward  with economic improvement and recovery in the job market  demand for office space is expected to shoot up 
Residential REIT
Admittedly  rising supply is a growing concern in the apartment market  particularly in the high end and luxury apartment categories  But increasing consumer confidence on the back of job growth  rising wages and a healthier balance sheet promise a bright future for this asset category  Additionally  corporate profits are up and business confidence has recovered  Also  construction labor shortages have somewhat helped the industry witness comparatively lesser supply than anticipated in the first few months of 2017 
Further  demographic growth continues to be strong in the young adult age cohort  which has a higher propensity to rent  In fact  a significant change in lifestyle has taken place and life cycle events are getting delayed  This is leading to an increase of the average age of first time homeownership  This age cohort has also experienced a considerable part of net job growth  and is helping to increase primary renter demand 
Moreover  student housing REITs are expected to enjoy growth ahead  This is because  with a higher education earnings gap    are earning just 62  of what college graduates are making   college enrollment is set to increase and this would drive up demand of residential units that student REITs lease  Also  there is pent up demand for new  purpose built student housing properties that have better amenities than old  outdated housing 
Further  student housing REITs have decent opportunities to excel in the coming years as demand is emanating for on campus developments from universities that are facing state budget cuts and low funds  and are incapable of developing or renovating their aging housing properties  And on campus housing usually enjoys full occupancy 
Retail REIT
Obviously  dwindling mall traffic and store closures amid the online sales boom as well as bankruptcy filing of retailers have kept retail REITs on tenterhooks  Amid the ongoing changes in consumer behavior  retail REITs are avoiding heavy dependence on apparel and accessories and are transforming their boring shopping hubs into swanky entertainment zones  They are expanding dining options  opening up movie theaters and offering recreational facilities  Eventually  such measures are likely to help in increasing traffic 
Retail REITs also prefer expansion of shops  which comprise service based industries such as saloons and spas  personal fitness  and medical practices  Such properties enjoy frequent customer traffic and are Internet resistant  and therefore drive a dependable traffic 
Also  mixed use developments have gained popularity for their solid neighborhood character  greater housing variety and density  Such developments lower the distance between housing  workplaces  retail businesses  and other amenities and destinations  Hence  such development enable companies to grab the attention of people who prefer to live  work and play in the same area   a trend that drove development in several other cities in the U S 
Therefore to explore these positives of mixed use developments  REITs like AvalonBay Communities Inc  NYSE AVB    AVB  and Regency Centers Corp   REG  went for the Market Common Clarendon  Also  Mack Cali Realty Corp   CLI  is focused on transforming itself through waterfront and transit based office holdings  and on luxury multi family portfolio growth  which is encouraging

	Further  the construction of mega industrial houses  spanning 1 million square feet or more  is rampant in large industrial markets  according to another  from CBRE Group  NYSE CBG   Around 90 million square feet of these mega facilities  which benefit from growing e commerce business  have been accomplished since 2010 in the top 10 markets  while an additional 31 6 million square feet is under construction  with 60  pre commitments  displaying solid demand for such facilities 

Office REIT

	Office REITs are experiencing decent demand in recent times  In fact  though the overall office vacancy rate moved up a modest 10 basis points to 13 0  in first quarter 2017 amid increased supply  according to a  from CBRE  in almost half of the office markets  vacancy level continued to fall and the national office vacancy rate stayed close to its post recession low  Going forward  with economic improvement and recovery in the job market  demand for office space is expected to shoot up 

Residential REIT

	Admittedly  rising supply is a growing concern in the apartment market  particularly in the high end and luxury apartment categories  But increasing consumer confidence on the back of job growth  rising wages and a healthier balance sheet promise a bright future for this asset category  Additionally  corporate profits are up and business confidence has recovered  Also  construction labor shortages have somewhat helped the industry witness comparatively lesser supply than anticipated in the first few months of 2017 

	Further  demographic growth continues to be strong in the young adult age cohort  which has a higher propensity to rent  In fact  a significant change in lifestyle has taken place and life cycle events are getting delayed  This is leading to an increase of the average age of first time homeownership  This age cohort has also experienced a considerable part of net job growth  and is helping to increase primary renter demand 

	Moreover  student housing REITs are expected to enjoy growth ahead  This is because  with a higher education earnings gap    are earning just 62  of what college graduates are making   college enrollment is set to increase and this would drive up demand of residential units that student REITs lease  Also  there is pent up demand for new  purpose built student housing properties that have better amenities than old  outdated housing 

	Further  student housing REITs have decent opportunities to excel in the coming years as demand is emanating for on campus developments from universities that are facing state budget cuts and low funds  and are incapable of developing or renovating their aging housing properties  And on campus housing usually enjoys full occupancy 

Retail REIT

	Obviously  dwindling mall traffic and store closures amid the online sales boom as well as bankruptcy filing of retailers have kept retail REITs on tenterhooks  Amid the ongoing changes in consumer behavior  retail REITs are avoiding heavy dependence on apparel and accessories and are transforming their boring shopping hubs into swanky entertainment zones  They are expanding dining options  opening up movie theaters and offering recreational facilities  Eventually  such measures are likely to help in increasing traffic 

	Retail REITs also prefer expansion of shops  which comprise service based industries such as saloons and spas  personal fitness  and medical practices  Such properties enjoy frequent customer traffic and are Internet resistant  and therefore drive a dependable traffic 

	Also  mixed use developments have gained popularity for their solid neighborhood character  greater housing variety and density  Such developments lower the distance between housing  workplaces  retail businesses  and other amenities and destinations  Hence  such development enable companies to grab the attention of people who prefer to live  work and play in the same area   a trend that drove development in several other cities in the U S 

	Therefore to explore these positives of mixed use developments  REITs like AvalonBay Communities Inc   NYSE        and Regency Centers Corp   NYSE        went for the Market Common Clarendon

Dollar value of purchases across all boroughs fell 40  to  6 91B vs  2018  the lowest amount since 2011  according to Ariel Property Advisors

The new rent law  which applies to  1M apartments in the city  makes it near impossible to raise rents  remove units from state regulation  or even recoup the costs of capital improvements 
As a result  non regulated units commanded a higher price last year  while the prices of units subject to rent regulation fell 
More than 60  of apartment building that were purchased in Manhattan south of East 96th Street and West 110th were market rate  buyers paid an average of  758K per apartment  up 14  vs  2018

115614,337129,AVB,Know These 3 Facts To Avoid Paying Half Your Retirement Income To The IRS   January 27  2020,opinion,"Failing to withdraw a required minimum distribution  RMD  from your own or an inherited IRA by the deadline results in a big tax code penalty  50   That s right  If you were supposed to take out a minimum of  4 000 and  oops   did not do so  you have the privilege of writing the IRS a check for  2 000  It s important to remember that the rules related to RMDs changed on January 1  2020
In case you re like most investors  you re probably trying to build a financial portfolio that is solid enough to guarantee a comfortable retirement  Among retirement financial planners  this is known as the  accumulation phase   In this stage  your objective is to carefully invest by selecting stocks with long term potential for your retirement nest egg  For example  you might choose AvalonBay Communities  NYSE AVB   which is a current top ranked dividend stock 
But that s just half of retirement planning  The second part  the  distribution phase   sometimes gets overlooked even though it can be more fun to think about  That s because the distribution phase is where you determine how to spend your hard earned assets 
Planning for the distribution phase is the time where you may make decisions about where you ll want to live in retirement  whether you ll want to travel  hobbies you may pursue  and other decisions that will affect your retirement spending 
Along with those choices  you need to be mindful of the RMD  because it applies to the majority of retirement accounts  This IRS rule requires you to withdraw a specific minimum amount from any qualified accounts you have when you reach a certain age  previously it was 70 1 2  but beginning in 2020  it is 72 
What is the point of this mandatory withdrawal by the IRS  Not surprisingly  it s to be sure that the government gets their tax money  Without the RMD requirement  individuals could live off other income and never pay tax on retirement account gains  That cash could be left to family or friends as an inheritance and the IRS would not receive taxes from it 
Key Facts to Know About RMDs
Which types of retirement accounts have RMDs  Qualified retirement accounts like IRA accounts  401 k s  457 plans and other tax deferred retirement savings plans like a TSP  403 b   TSA  SEP  or SIMPLE IRA plan require withdrawals in retirement 
When does it become necessary to begin taking distributions  Your first distribution must be taken by April 1 of the year following the calendar year that you turn 72  for most accounts   Also  if you retire after that age  you must take your first RMD from your 401 k   profit sharing  403 b   or other defined contribution plan by April 1 of the year after the calendar year in which you retire 
Every year after your start date  you are required to take your RMD by December 31  Remember  for Roth IRAs you do not have to take an RMD because you paid taxes before contributing  However  other types of Roth accounts do require RMDs  but you may be able to avoid them  for instance  by rolling your Roth 401 k  into your Roth IRA  
What happens if I don t take my RMD  The penalty for not taking a required minimum distribution  or not taking a large enough distribution  is a 50  tax on the amount not withdrawn in time 
How much money do I have to withdraw  To calculate a specific RMD  you must divide your prior year s December 31st retirement account balance by a  distribution period  factor based on your age 
Here s an example to give you an idea of the math  Ann is 71 and will take her first RMD in the year following the year she turns 72  Her IRA balance toward the end of the preceding year was  100 000  Her  distribution period  factor is 27 4  Dividing  100 000 by 27 4 equals  3 649 63  This is the amount Ann is required to withdraw for her first RMD

115615,337130,AVB,AvalonBay  AVB  Upgraded To Buy  What Does It Mean For The Stock ,opinion,"Investors might want to bet on AvalonBay Communities  NYSE AVB   as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates  which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices 
The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company s changing earnings picture  The Zacks Consensus Estimate    the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell side analysts covering the stock    for the current and following years is tracked by the system 
Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time  In these situations  the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements 
As such  the Zacks rating upgrade for AvalonBay is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  and the near term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated  The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship  as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock 
For AvalonBay  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company s underlying business  And investors  appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for AvalonBay
For the fiscal year ending December  2019  this apartment building owner is expected to earn  9 31 per share  which is a change of 3 4  from the year ago reported number 
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for AvalonBay  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 0 3  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term 
You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here    
The upgrade of AvalonBay to a Zacks Rank  2 positions it in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions  implying that the stock might move higher in the near term ",2020-01-27,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/avalonbay-avb-upgraded-to-buy-what-does-it-mean-for-the-stock-200501907,200501907

venture partner s 45  stake in a land parcel and six communities representing 2 020 apartment homes  Together these are valued at around  1 billion on a gross basis However  apartment deliveries are

AvalonBay Communities  Inc    NYSE AVB    healthcare REIT Omega Healthcare Investors  Inc    NYSE OHI    office REIT Cousins Properties   NYSE CUZ   and mREIT Two Harbors Investment Corp    NYSE TWO    All four companies areslated to report their quarterly numbers on Feb 5 The U S  apartment rental market put up a decent show in the December end quarter  despite demand for apartments generally slowing down during the colder months  as renters usually prefer less to move in winters  Per the latest  from real estate technology and analytics firm RealPage  Inc   occupancy at the end of the quarter remained as high as 95 8   reflecting an expansion of 40 basis points  bps   year on year  Moreover  rents for new resident leases were up 2 8  in 2019  hovering around the 3  level that the apartment market has been witnessing since late 2016 Further  going be a  from Newmark Knight Frank  the U S  office market remained stable during fourth quarter 2019  In fact  vacancy rates shrunk 20 bps  year over year  to 12 9   Further  average asking rate across the nation for the quarter improved 1 3  year over year to  29 per square foot gross full service  However  absorption in the October December quarter contracted 4 3 million square feet of space compared with the prior year quarter As for mREITs  positive economic growth  strong demand for housing and mortgage rates being relatively stable are expected to have supported mortgage originations during the period in discussion  In October  The Federal Open Market Committee  FOMC  slashed the federal fund rate by 0 25   This is expected to have resulted in higher mortgage prepayments and refinancing Let s take a glance at how these four REITs are placed ahead of fourth quarter results   AvalonBay is expected to have registered steady rental revenues  given its ownership of high quality assets located in some of the premium markets of the United States  As such  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter rental and other income is pegged at  592 million  indicating 1  sequential growth Also  high home ownership costs in several markets are affecting transitions from renters to homeowners  This  along with favorable demographics and household formation as well as job market gains  is likely to have contributed to high occupancy at the company s residential properties Further  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues of  594 million suggests a 2 7  year over year increase  Also  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter 2019 funds from operations  FFO  per share is pinned at  2 40   indicating 3 9  year on year growth    Read more   Our proven model predicts a beat in terms of FFO per share for AvalonBay this season  The combination of a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1

an Earnings ESP of  0 46  You can see  AvalonBay Communities  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise    Omega Healthcare which invests in the long term healthcare industry  mainly in skilled nursing  SNF  and assisted living facilities  has emerged as a leading SNF focused REIT  and achieved diversification in terms of geography and operator in the United States and the U K  In the to be reported quarter  this diversification is anticipated to have boosted the company s top line growth  Portfolio occupancy is expected to have benefited from upbeat demographic trends The Zacks Consensus Estimate for

activities during the quarter were adequate to gain analyst confidence  Consequently  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarterly FFO per share climbed a cent upward to 77 cents over the past month

predicts a beat in terms of FFO per share for Omega this time around   Cousins Properties  unmatched portfolio of Class A office assets concentrated in the high growth Sun Belt markets is expected to have witnessed decent demand for office space  In fact  hiring levels in the labor market remained sturdy during the fourth quarter  Further  on an average  184 000 new jobs were added to the market during the October December period  This comes at a time when the U S economy is at its now record long  economic expansion cycle Such an encouraging environment is expected to have propelled healthy leasing activity and rental rate growth for Cousins Properties  This is anticipated to have supported net operating income  NOI  growth However  higher construction activity is expected to have boosted new supply of Class A office space in the company s market  leading to lesser scope for rent and occupancy growth The company s results will likely reflect year over year growth in FFO per share and revenues  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share of 74 cents indicates 8 8  growth  while revenues of  183 6 million indicate a 53 8  surge Although Cousins Properties currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3  its Earnings ESP of  0 94  makes surprise prediction difficult Cousins Properties Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise    Two Harbors  portfolio consists of a rates strategy and a credit strategy  The former includes Agency residential mortgage backed securities  MBS   Agency derivatives  mortgage servicing rights  MSR   to be announced securities and associated notional hedges  The credit strategy consisted of legacy non Agency securities and associated notional hedges With a surge in issuance of agency MBS  we anticipate the company to have increased investments in its Agency portfolio during the quarter to be reported However  given the speedy prepayment scenario we anticipate higher MSR amortization expense for the company in the final quarter of 2019  Additionally  the credit markets witnessed volatility during the period under consideration  This resulted in tighter spreads and is expected to have adversely impacted the company s non agency portfolio Amid these  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter earnings per share of 40 cents and net interest income of  64 2 million calls for 18 4  and 28 4  year over year decline
