197516,419032,JNJ,Better Coronavirus Play  Johnson   Johnson vs  Novavax,news,"Fears about the coronavirus outbreak that first hit China are increasing  There have been more than 20 000 confirmed cases of the virus and 425 deaths in just over one month 
But several drugmakers are racing to develop vaccines and antiviral drugs to fight the outbreak  Two companies at the forefront of these efforts are Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  and Novavax  NASDAQ NVAX   Which of these stocks is the better choice for investors 

The case for Johnson   Johnson
Johnson   Johnson announced on Jan  29 that it s launching what the company calls  a multipronged response  to the threat presented by the 2019 nCoV coronavirus that s been making headlines  J J s primary focus is to use its AdVac viral vector and PER C6 cell line technology to develop a vaccine for 2019 nCoV 
This appears to be a smart step  Both AdVac and PER C6 were used to create J J s experimental Ebola vaccine  Even though the vaccine isn t approved yet  it s already being used in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in Rwanda as part of those countries  campaigns to prevent the spread of Ebola  In addition  J J used these two technologies to develop its experimental vaccines targeting HIV  respiratory syncytial virus  RSV   and Zika 
While J J works as quickly as possible to develop a coronavirus vaccine  the company has donated bottles of its HIV drug darunavir cobicistat  which is marketed under the brand name Prezcobix  to Chinese researchers investigating potential ways to treat the virus  Some anecdotal findings have suggested that HIV drugs could help patients with another coronavirus    severe acute respiratory syndrome  SARS  
As a huge drugmaker  Johnson   Johnson also has a lot of drugs that are already on the market or in its pipeline  including quite a few antiviral drugs  The company plans to conduct research to see if previously tested drugs could potentially help patients fight the latest coronavirus strain 
Even if J J s efforts are successful in addressing the coronavirus scare  though  sales of any one drug or vaccine would likely only amount to a drop in the bucket for the healthcare giant  But that underscores the appeal of buying J J stock  The company offers a way to obtain diversification across the healthcare spectrum because of its multibillion dollar business segments in consumer health  medical devices  and pharmaceuticals 
The case for Novavax
Novavax  on the other hand  would almost certainly see its shares skyrocket if it successfully develops a coronavirus vaccine  The biotech stock has already been one of the biggest winners among coronavirus focused drugmakers  with its shares up over 60  year to date 
Developing vaccines is Novavax s specialty  The company s lead product is a nanoparticle based vaccine for the flu  Novavax should report results from a late stage study of this vaccine later in the first quarter of 2020  Its pipeline also includes three other experimental vaccines in clinical testing 
Novavax has already developed vaccines targeting other types of coronavirus    SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome  However  neither vaccine has won regulatory approval 
Gregory Glenn  Novavax s head of research and development  told Bloomberg that the company is  working very hard  on a coronavirus vaccine  However  he also acknowledged in another interview that it s not a quick process to develop a vaccine  win regulatory approval  and get to market 
Novavax has experienced some setbacks with its vaccine programs  The biotech s RSV vaccine ResVax failed in two different late stage clinical studies  But past failures don t mean that future successes aren t possible  Novavax could emerge as a big winner with its experimental coronavirus vaccine or with its NanoFlu flu vaccine 
Better pick
If you re looking for the stock that would deliver the biggest returns if it s successful in developing a coronavirus vaccine or treatment  the answer is easy  Novavax  But that doesn t necessarily make Novavax the better pick over Johnson   Johnson  Why  There s no guarantee that Novavax will be successful with its coronavirus program 
For that matter  there s no guarantee that J J will be successful with its coronavirus efforts  either  However  failure on this front simply won t matter that much to the investing case for J J 
It s entirely possible that the current coronavirus worries will fade away  just as worries about the avian flu  Ebola  SARS  and other viruses aren t as great as they once were  Instead of buying a stock based only on the prospects for developing a coronavirus vaccine or therapy  the smarter approach is to buy a stock based on the prospects that it will deliver solid long term gains 
Novavax might be able to generate tremendous gains in the future  However  the biotech s fortunes hinge largely on how NanoFlu performs in clinical testing  J J s gains probably won t be jaw dropping  but they should be more reliable  My view is that the stability and financial strength that J J provides makes it the better choice for long term investors ",2020-02-05,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/prcz0,2076560
197517,419033,JNJ,Drugmakers see long road ahead in coronavirus vaccine race,news,"By Carl O Donnell and Michael Erman
 Reuters    Drugmakers racing to find a vaccine or effective treatment for the deadly new coronavirus in China cautioned that they have a long way to go 
That runs counter to reports of a supposed  breakthrough  that on Wednesday boosted financial markets and spurred optimism not necessarily backed by reality 
At least a dozen drugmakers are working on vaccines or antivirals and other treatments to help those infected with the fast spreading contagion 
Investment costs for vaccines could run as high as  800 million in a process that  even if accelerated  will likely take more than a year until approval  according to executives from companies involved in the effort 
 It will take at least 12 to 18 months  which means in the acute situation we are in now   at least in China   that will not create a benefit   said Thomas Breuer  chief medical officer of GlaxoSmithKline s  L GSK  vaccine unit  GSK is working with developers by providing a technology that could make their vaccines more potent 
The virus  which emerged in December in China  has killed nearly 500 people and shows no sign of abating  with thousands of new cases reported each day  mostly in central China s Hubei province  But its spread to some 27 countries and regions has caused global alarm 
To be sure  companies developing treatments for patients who are already sick may be able to get a drug approved faster than a vaccine that would be given to healthy people  Even so  logistical and regulatory challenges remain  according to two executives at  Gilead Sciences Inc   O GILD   which is working on an experimental antiviral treatment 
 There is a distinction there between a therapeutic and a vaccine  Having said that  I think it is true that this won t be super fast and it will involve us investing at risk right now   said Gilead Chief Medical Officer Merdad Parsey 
Clinical trials for treatments can be smaller and of shorter duration than for vaccines  Parsey acknowledged 
Challenges in making sure therapies are effective and then scaling up production still remain  Gilead has only a limited supply of its remdesivir  which will be tested against the coronavirus after previously failing in trials as a treatment for Ebola 
 LOOKING FOR A MAGIC BULLET 
Dr  Thomas Frieden  who was director of the U S  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention during the also deadly MERS outbreak  said the benefit of antiviral treatments for such emergencies in the past has been modest 
What worked with MERS and SARS  for example  was better infection control in healthcare facilities  he said of two other types of coronaviruses that also caused global alarm 
 It doesn t mean we shouldn t try  but we re often looking for a magic bullet and the bright shiny object  Sometimes we need to just have the basics   Frieden said 
A Chinese TV report on Wednesday said that a research team at Zhejiang University had found an effective drug for the virus  while researchers in the UK told Sky News separately they had made a  significant breakthrough  in finding a vaccine 
Reuters could not independently verify the reports  but several traders cited them for sharp upticks in global stock markets 
 There are no known effective therapeutics against this 2019 nCoV   said World Health Organization spokesman Tarik Jasarevic  using the current designation for the new coronavirus  when asked about reports of  drug breakthroughs  
Health officials in the United States and China have set ambitious goals for getting a vaccine to initial human testing within the next few months 
Newer vaccine platforms  such as one developed by  Moderna  Inc  O MRNA   allow scientists to create a potential vaccine in record time just based on knowing the genetic code of the novel coronavirus  With the genetic code in hand  scientists can start vaccine development without needing a sample of the virus 
Anthony Fauci  director of the U S  National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases  which is using Moderna s platform  said the agency is on the fastest pace ever to develop a vaccine candidate 
He hopes to have a vaccine available for initial safety testing within two and a half to three months from the time scientists determined the genetic sequence of the virus 
 Novavax  Inc  O NVAX  research chief Gregory Glenn told Reuters his company has taken vaccines from discovery to clinical testing in 90 days and believes it could do something similar for the new coronavirus 
But to move vaccine candidates from the lab to widespread use in patients involves a number of hurdles  according to health experts and executives for drugmakers working on coronavirus vaccines and treatments 
In addition to scaling up manufacturing capacity and building distribution networks  there are regulatory hurdles such as conducting large clinical trials to make sure a vaccine not only confers immunity to the virus but is safe for use in the general population 
 The earliest you could even know if it s going to work is a year   Fauci said 
Whether even a highly effective vaccine will prove profitable for companies is another big question 
 The outbreak could be abating by the time a vaccine is deemed safe   Karen Andersen  who follows biotech companies for Morningstar  said in a research note 
The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations  CEPI  has raised around  800 million from donors to aid in preventing pandemic diseases and has allocated some of those funds to biotechs  including  Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc   O INO   Moderna Inc  O MRNA  and CureVac  which are working on coronavirus vaccines 
 We stepped into this with no economic expectation   said Paul Stoffels  Johnson   Johnson s  N JNJ  chief scientific officer   We ll see whether in the end it gives a reward  ",2020-02-05,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/drugmakers-see-long-road-ahead-in-coronavirus-vaccine-race-2077438,2077438

197523,419039,JNJ,Johnson   Johnson Is Racing Against Time to Develop the First Coronavirus Vaccine,news,"Over the past several weeks  there s nothing that has monopolized the news quite so much as the terrifying and deadly coronavirus  The illness has claimed over 1 000 lives at the time of this writing and has infected just over 43 000 individuals worldwide  
At the end of January  the World Health Organization  WHO  declared the virus a global emergency  On February 2  the U S  Department of State raised its travel advisory for China to a Level Four  A Level Four advisory is the highest warning issued and indicates that Americans should not under any circumstances travel to a country due to the extreme peril involved  

In the wake of the coronavirus pandemic that has already swept across Asia  Europe  North America  and the Middle East  big pharma companies including Gilead Sciences  NASDAQ GILD   Novavax  NASDAQ NVAX   and Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  have been scrambling to respond  
Johnson   Johnson is going head to head with these companies and others to be the first to develop the coronavirus vaccine and it looks like the company is well on its way to achieving its goal  If Johnson   Johnson succeeds in creating the coronavirus vaccine  this may not only save countless lives but also mean billions of dollars of revenue for the company that would see investor holdings soar  
Here s the latest investor update to start off the new week 
Combining forces with subsidiary Janssen Pharmaceuticals 
Johnson   Johnson has declared that it is combining forces with its Belgium based subsidiary Janssen Pharmaceuticals to create a preventative coronavirus vaccine  The companies will also be teaming up with outside laboratories to assess prospective antiviral drug solutions  
Johnson   Johnson s Chief Scientific Officer and Vice Chairman of the Executive Committee  Dr  Paul Stoffels stated   We are collaborating with regulators  healthcare organizations  institutions and communities worldwide to help ensure our research platforms  existing science and outbreak expertise can be maximized to stem this public health threat  
The collaboration of Johnson   Johnson with Janssen could speed up the vaccine development timeline by leaps and bounds and on a far larger scale  Janssen s AdVac platform will play a key role in this new development phase  The platform has already proven successful in the company s formulation of clinical candidates to treat HIV as well as an experimental Ebola drug that has been implemented in parts of Africa  including Rwanda  
The competition is steep  but Johnson   Johnson is coming from a position of strength
Investors have been more than a little concerned since the outbreak of the coronavirus  as indicated by the increased volatility in the stock market of late  With so many contenders rushing to break out the coronavirus vaccine  many investors are wondering just where they should be putting their cash  
It s no secret that Johnson   Johnson isn t alone in the race to get the first coronavirus vaccine from the lab to the consumer populace  Novavax previously developed vaccines for a few variations of the coronavirus  including SARS  While none of these vaccines have been approved by the FDA  this definitely puts Novavax ahead of the curve  and the company s shares have been soaring accordingly 
Gilead Sciences is another major player going neck in neck with Johnson   Johnson  The company s Ebola drug  Remdesivir  which has yet to receive regulatory approval  is now officially being tested by China to treat coronavirus patients  But only time will tell whether the drug has any efficacy to treat the coronavirus  
Johnson   Johnson has also gifted a drug for China to use in its research efforts  the company s HIV medication Prezcobix  A recent statement released by Johnson   Johnson stated the following   The company has a long standing commitment to fight emerging epidemics  We stand ready to support global efforts where it may make a difference   We have established technologies and facilities that enable us to create  test and scale up production for potentially transformational vaccines  Our experience in helping to address epidemics  coupled with our expertise in respiratory illnesses  uniquely positions us to address the latest coronavirus outbreak  
Johnson   Johnson s new collaboration with Janssen Pharmaceuticals is an unprecedented move to push the coronavirus vaccine development timeline forward  It s clear that the competition is steep  but there s no reason to think that Johnson   Johnson isn t up to the task to lead the pack in rolling out the coronavirus vaccine 
Johnson   Johnson is unequivocally coming from a position of strength  The company had a fantastic year earnings wise  with sales totaling roughly  20 billion per quarter over the trailing twelve months  Its profit margin exceeded 18  in 2019  and sales are projected to grow by as much as 5  in 2020  
Johnson   Johnson s diversified business model continues to make it a profitable buy for long term investors regardless of whether it wins the coronavirus vaccine race or not  However  if the company does become one of the first to release a coronavirus vaccine  as it very likely may  Johnson   Johson s financial future may look very bright indeed ",2020-02-11,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/ptxe2,2082222

Given its recent troubles  the company had a chance to ease investors  fears when it released its earnings report on Jan  22  And although Johnson   Johnson failed to knock it out of the park  the company performed well enough to prevent a sell off  In particular  it showed off its greatest strength  diversification  

Johnson   Johnson s fourth quarter results
During the fourth quarter  net sales were  20 8 billion  an unimpressive 1 7  increase year over year and below the consensus analyst estimate  But the company s  4 billion net earnings grew by 31 8  versus the year ago period  and its  1 88 adjusted earnings per share came in slightly ahead of the consensus analyst estimates 
Johnson   Johnson s medical devices segment posted revenue of  6 63 billion  a 0 5  year over year decrease  Meanwhile  the company s consumer segment  which sells over the counter medical products  posted revenue of  3 57 billion  0 9  higher than the prior year quarter  
The pharmaceuticals segment generated  10 5 billion in sales  3 5  higher than the year ago period  Johnson   Johnson has been dealing with declining sales of several of its key pharmaceutical products  The rheumatoid arthritis drug Remicade reported  1 billion in sales  down from  1 2 billion in the prior year quarter  Also  the prostate cancer medicine Zytiga  which has been facing competition from biosimilars  generated  677 million in sales  a 13 8  year over year decline  
Fortunately  Johnson   Johnson s portfolio of pharmaceutical drugs is rich and diverse  and other products performed well enough to offset the declining sales of some of its top products  Sales of the cancer drug Imbruvica increased by 24 5  to  875 million  and revenue from Darzalex  for blood cancer multiple myeloma  increased by 42 1  to  830 million  Sales of immunology drugs Stelara and Tremfya grew by 17 7  and 53 9   respectively  
There was more good news for some of Johnson   Johnson s top pharmaceutical products  During the fourth quarter  Darzalex was approved in Europe for the treatment of multiple myeloma for certain patients  And the Food and Drug Administration recently approved Stelara for the treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis  a chronic inflammatory disease that affects about 910 000 patients in the U S  With these two approvals  sales of Darzalex and Stelara will likely keep growing  
More approvals on the way 
In addition to its rich portfolio of products  Johnson   Johnson boasts a rich pipeline  and the company likely has more approvals on the way  During the fourth quarter  it submitted a marketing authorization application to the European Medicines Agency  EMA  for a vaccine regimen for the prevention of ebola virus disease  The company also submitted an application to the EMA for Tremfya as a treatment for active psoriatic arthritis  
Johnson   Johnson s other regulatory submissions during the fourth quarter included Spravato as a treatment for major depressive disorder in Europe  and Imbruvica as a treatment for active chronic lymphocytic leukemia  in combination with another drug called rituximab that treats certain cancers   
The company s late stage pipeline also includes more than a dozen new products  or existing products seeking new indications  
Should you buy  
Johnson   Johnson is an excellent option for investors looking for companies with the versatility to handle a market downturn  It has a hand in three different segments within the healthcare industry  and the pharmaceutical segment is diversified as well  On the other hand  Johnson   Johnson probably won t outperform the market  
Over the past five years  the company s shares climbed by 46 15   whereas the S P 500 is up by 61 43  over the same period  In other words  whether you should buy shares of Johnson   Johnson depends on your priorities and investing style  Conservative investors will likely love it  whereas growth oriented investors might have to look elsewhere ",2020-01-31,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/ppgrc,2073018

It s an impressive performance given the adversity the company has faced in recent years relating to its products  Thousands of people have sued the company over claims J J s baby powder products caused them to develop cancer  In 2018  a jury ordered J J to pay  4 7 billion to 22 women who developed ovarian cancer from the products  Then in 2019  a judge in Oklahoma ordered the healthcare giant to pay  572 million as a result of its role in the state s opioid crisis  Later that year  the company incurred a hefty fine of  8 billion in punitive damages for side effects related to its Risperdal drug which is used to treat mood disorders  including schizophrenia due to claims it caused patients to develop gynecomastia  or the growth of breasts in males   J J appealed the fine and a judge reduced it to  6 8 million  but it s yet another product that has put a black mark on the company s image  
Thanks to its diversification  J J has plenty of products that are doing well for the company  Stelara  in particular  continues to be a great performer  The drug  which treats Crohn s disease  generated  6 3 billion in sales in fiscal 2019 at a growth rate of 23 4   Darzalex  which treats myeloma  a form of blood cancer  also saw tremendous growth of nearly 50   With sales of  3 billion worldwide  it has the potential to be a key contributor to the company s pharmaceutical sales if it keeps growing at this clip  

And even though the company s medical device revenue was down 3 8  overall  that was mainly due to U S  sales  which were down 3 5   International medical device sales declined by 4 1   but without the impact of foreign exchange  that revenue would have been just 0 1  lower than in the prior year 
What was surprising is that in the consumer segment J J s sales were up 1 4  in the U S  in 2019  However  revenue from its baby care products declined by 14 2  year over year in the U S  and by 8 6  in international markets   Overall  the company s consumer segment did well internationally where sales were down 0 4   but had it not been for foreign exchange  revenue would have increased by 4 2  
J J expects its growth to continue in 2020 with guidance indicating adjusted diluted earnings per share growth between 3 1  and 4 8   The company also forecasts reported sales to rise between 4  and 5  this year  
18  profit margin intact despite litigation expenses
J J s earnings of  15 1 billion for the year were down 1 2  from 2018  but they were still more than 18  of the company s top line  An 18  profit margin is very strong  especially given that the company incurred more than  5 billion in litigation expenses during the year by fighting and settling lawsuits  
The strong bottom line is a testament to the company s resilient and diverse product base  which allows it to produce healthy profits in the face of adversity 
Why J J is still a good long term investment
What the company s year end results showed is just how well diversified J J is and how powerful a brand it still is  Although the company is struggling in the U S  market  that isn t the case internationally  where it continues to grow and perform well  
J J still faces many challenges relating to baby products and there s a lot of uncertainty about its role in the opioid epidemic  In January  Washington announced it was the latest state to sue J J in relation to the opioid crisis and more states could decide to do the same  However  despite the risks involved  the company still has many good products valued by consumers  And as long as it continues innovating and developing quality products  it ll remain a solid healthcare stock to buy and hold for many years 
Over the past five years  J J s stock has risen 47   Although it underperformed the S P s returns of 57  during that time  it s still a good investment once you factor in its dividend  A Dividend Aristocrat  J J has rewarded long term investors  increasing its payouts for more than 50 years in a row  Currently  the stock pays a dividend yield of 2 5   which is well above the S P 500 average of 1 85  
There s undoubtedly some risk involved in holding shares of J J  but with the company generating more than  80 billion in sales and an impressive bottom line  it s a calculated one that can more than pay off in the long run  Trading at a forward price to earnings ratio of 15  J J s stock is a good option for value investors as well as dividend investors who are looking for a steady stream of dividend income ",2020-02-01,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pprpy,2073685

to Gerry Shreiber  you may begin Gerald B  Shreiber    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Paulette  Good morning everybody  and welcome to our conference call for our first quarter  Let me begin by introducing who is in the room with me Dennis Moore  our Chief Financial Officer  Bob Radano  our Chief Operations Officer  Bob Pape  our Vice President of Sales  Jerry Law  Senior Vice President of Operations  Marjorie Shreiber Roshkoff  our legal representative  and Bo Powell  Sales Manager for our Food Service  Did I get everybody Let me begin  The forward looking statements contained herein are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from those projected in the forward looking statements  You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which reflect management s analysis only as of the date hereof  We undertake no obligation to publicly revise or update these forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that arise after the date hereof Results of operations  Net sales increased 4  for the quarter  which include sales from the acquisition of a ICEE Distributor in October 2019  without that sales increased 3   Food Service  sales to Food Service customers increased 2  for the quarter  Our sales increase was due to increased sales of soft pretzels  up 2   churros up 8   funnel cake products up 25  and bakery sales up 2  Frozen juice bars and ices sales were down 6  and handheld sales were down 18   Sales to restaurant chains were up this quarter  while sales to schools were down  Operating income in our Food Service segment increased to  18 034 000 from  17 697 000 last year  primarily because of higher volume and improved operations at our Hill   Valley plant in the Midwest Retail Supermarkets  Sales of products to retail supermarkets were down 6  for the quarter  Soft pretzel sales were down 4  for the quarter  Sales of frozen juice bars and Italian ices were down 8   Handheld sales were down 15  and bakery sales including biscuits were down 11  Operating income in our retail supermarkets segment was essentially the same as last year  as the benefit of price increase implemented a year ago offset the impact of slightly lower volume  We expect to see volumes at least stabilizing and improving in the second quarter Frozen Beverages  which include ICEE  SLUSH PUPPIE  ARCTIC BLAST brands  Frozen beverage and related product sales were up 16  in the quarter  and beverage related sales were up 13   Without the sale of ICEE Distributors  an acquisition in the first quarter from the  Indecipherable  Van Group  overall sales were up 12  and beverage related sales were up 4   Service revenue for others was up 13   Machine revenue was  12 million  up from  8 9 million last year Operating income in our Frozen Beverage Group decreased  I m sorry to  1 452 000 from  2 174 000 in the quarter  primarily because of relocation costs and    cost and expenses related to the ICEE headquarters move to Tennessee  Approximately  1 million this quarter and estimated to be about  800 000 in our second quarter in connection with the relocation of ICEE headquarters In October  we purchased the asset of ICEE Distributors  the  Indecipherable  Van Group  which does business in Arkansas  Louisiana and Texas with annual sales of approximately  13 million  Consolidated  Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 27 52  in the three month period this year  down from 28 30     28 3  last year  Gross profit percentage decreased because of lower unit volume in the snack side of our business  generally higher costs and unfavorable product mix changes Total operating expense as a percentage of sales was 19 9  in the quarter  down from last year s 20 2   The decrease was due primarily to lower distribution costs in connection with freight Capital spending and cash flow  Our cash and investment securities balance of  306 million was down  37 million from our September year end  primarily because of the purchase of the ICEE Distributor  We continue to look for acquisitions  as a use of our cash   116 million of our investments are in corporate bonds with a purchase price yield to maturity of 2 8  Our capital spending was  18 million in the quarter  as we continue to invest in plant efficiencies and growing our businesses  We estimate our spending for the year to be about  60 million  as we continue to invest in our manufacturing plants and the ICEE business  Cash dividend of  0 575 a share was declared by our Board of Directors and paid on January 7th  This was a 15  increase from the previous dividend We did not buy back any shares of our stock during the quarter  Our investment income this year was  746 000 more than last year  because we recognized  1 027 000 of unrealized investment losses in last year s quarter  Last year we had a tax benefit of  900 000 related to the Tax Cuts and Job Act  which benefited last year s EPS by  0 05 a share Thank you for your continued interest  and we look forward to continuing our growth and success  Well  that concludes my upfront comments Questions and Answers OperatorThank you  We will now begin the question and answer session   Operating Instructions  And our first question comes from Rob Dickerson  Please go ahead Rob Dickerson    Jefferies    AnalystGreat  Super  Thank you so much Gerald B  Shreiber    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  Rob Rob Dickerson    Jefferies    AnalystGood morning  How are you Gerald B  Shreiber    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerI m good  I think you just did a recent report on us or   Rob Dickerson    Jefferies    AnalystI did  We    Jefferies is a firm and my team just recently initiated on a number of food companies and you happen to be in that group  So look forward to working with you going forward Gerald B  Shreiber    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerWe appreciate your research  and we re going to make you a hero Rob Dickerson    Jefferies    AnalystI always love hearing that  Not everyone thinks  I am  So I guess look    couple of questions I have all I think fairly basic hopefully  I guess the first one is just on the Supermarket division  you stated there was a little lost distribution there driven maybe by some of the higher prices  and then you re stating hopefully things stabilize in Q2  If you could just provide a little color as to kind of how that happens and I guess one  do you always like lose distribution when you take prices up  right because that doesn t always happen  It sounds like that was happened a little bit here   Gerald B  Shreiber    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerThat will stabilize  We haven t lost any    we certainly haven t lost any share  And we still dominate that with our products in that category Rob Dickerson    Jefferies    AnalystOkay  So but    and when you think Q2 going forward  it sounds like maybe there was a little bit of distribution loss  but things seem to be OK  And as long as the kind of velocities are OK that you don t expect more distribution loss  it sounds like things should get better Gerald B  Shreiber    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerI mean  we don t expect any more distribution loss  and we expect that recovery to start as we have our new products going in for the summer selling season  This is generally the time when we see the quarter resets  We ve been selling our Pretzel Bites and Auntie Anne s  We ve seen good placements for  So we expect the    that we ve bottomed out Rob Dickerson    Jefferies    AnalystOkay  All right  That s great  And then in terms of the Frozen Beverage segment just maybe a couple of questions  One  I guess just on the top line  Did great in the quarter  decent growth even on organic basis  which is always nice to see  As we think forward though for the rest of the year  we all know the compares get a little bit more difficult  machine sales seemed to be advantaged  let s call it in the back half of last year  Is there    when you look forward for the rest of the year  could there be some deceleration in that business not because the overall base is doing terribly  but just more so because you had a great back half of  19  That s the first question Gerald B  Shreiber    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerWell  we had another good quarter in our Frozen Beverage Group  which is led by our ICEE brand  but that was complemented to some degree by the acquisition  one of the last remaining independent ICEE Distributors  We don t expect that to have a major impact on the year  but it s significant to note that  that added some  35 million or so for the quarter  ICEE Group  which include SLUSH PUPPIE and ARCTIC BLAST continues to perform or outperform And Dan Fachner is on the call  I am going to let him comment on the rest of the year  And Dan  rest assured  I ll kill you if we don t have a great year Dan Fachner    President of the ICEE Company SubsidiaryThank you  Gerry  Yes  Rob  it was really a good quarter for us for sure  Top line was great  I don t know that I would anticipate the top line being at that rate through the rest of the year  We are up against some good equipment sales  as we get deeper into the year  and I think those will taper down some and our increases will be more normalized in that probably 4  range or so  And then we will  as I said  we ll be fighting some really good equipment sales  as we get later into the year Rob Dickerson    Jefferies    AnalystOkay  fair  Good answer Gerald B  Shreiber    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerDan is President of our ICEE Group and I didn t introduce him at the beginning of the meeting  but he s in California  no I am sorry  he is in Tennessee now participating in the call Rob Dickerson    Jefferies    AnalystOkay  That s great  It s a very unique business  which is    continues to perform well  So good job  And   Gerald B  Shreiber    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerMore you  Speech Overlap Rob Dickerson    Jefferies    AnalystYes  It s a uniquely positive  In terms of the    just kind of the margin progression  where delta we saw in Q1 both gross and operating  the gross margin was down a little bit more than operating margin  but then you call out some of the incremental expenses for the Frozen Beverage headquarter move  I was just trying to kind of understand  it seems like from my kind of either distant perspective that maybe the gross margin was a little pressured more because of that kind of near term distribution pressure in retail along with maybe some product mix shift  not necessarily expenses flowing through from the headquarter move  which I would think would be   Dennis G  Moore    Chief Financial OfficerHi  and it s Dennis  Rob I think essentially  you are correct  I think the lower volume at our manufacturing plants  which is the snack food side of the business being down will always    almost always have a negative impact on your margins simply because you ve less volume flowing through  And costs for the most part go up from year to year  payroll costs go up  insurance costs go up that you ve higher costs and lower volumes  So that was the biggest component of why the margin    the gross margin dropped Rob Dickerson    Jefferies    AnalystOkay  But like    so if    but then it s    if there is a little Q1 pressure given  you have retail distribution  but then that picks up back in Q2  and hopefully that gross margin decline is not    it does not continue to decline at an increasing rate going forward  it would seem if volumes stabilize Dennis G  Moore    Chief Financial OfficerWe d expect this to improve  as volume improves Rob Dickerson    Jefferies    AnalystOkay  perfect  And then lastly for me  Keep it quick  Just balance sheet capital structure  you don t have any debt when I started looking at your company  it s always fastening when you see a company with zero debt   Speech Overlap  Yes  right  You ve cash  you ve free cash flow generation and cash flow balance sheet  dividend growth is obviously helped    is healthy what you stated on the call upfront Just in terms of kind of the go forward think internally strategically is this a    continue to look for great companies that can complement our business to acquire or is it more hey  if our cash builds and yes  we might think about continuing to increase the dividend at a high rate  I m just basically trying to figure out where your head is right now in terms of cash allocation if that cash continues to build Gerald B  Shreiber    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerWell  I think we increased the dividend by 15  in the last quarter  which is a healthy  healthy increase Rob Dickerson    Jefferies    AnalystYes Gerald B  Shreiber    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerWe will continue to operate our business in a strong dynamic manner  and we expect to  perhaps  we re still looking for acquisitions  They have to be right  They have to be a right fit  Notwithstanding our balance sheet of cash and liquidity  we re not going to let it burn a hole in our pocket  We will   Rob Dickerson    Jefferies    AnalystOkay  fair Gerald B  Shreiber    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerOkay Rob Dickerson    Jefferies    AnalystYes  Makes complete sense  I will    thank you so much  I really appreciate your time  and I m happy to pass it on Gerald B  Shreiber    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerWhere are you located at  Are you in New York  Connecticut Rob Dickerson    Jefferies    AnalystI m in New York City  Big Apple Gerald B  Shreiber    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerOkay  Well  you re close enough that someday  you can come down and visit us Rob Dickerson    Jefferies    AnalystYes  that s the plan  That is the definite plan  I look forward to seeing you Gerald B  Shreiber    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerMake your plans through Dennis  and when you re here  I m looking forward to meeting you Rob Dickerson    Jefferies    AnalystSounds great  I ve    likewise  Thank you Operator Operator Instructions  And our next question comes from Jon Andersen  Please go ahead Gerald B  Shreiber    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  Jon  How are you Jon Andersen    William Blair    AnalystGood morning  everybody  I m doing well  Hope you re all well Gerald B  Shreiber    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerWe are Jon Andersen    William Blair    AnalystTerrific  Well  maybe I ll start with a question on the top line on sales  I m thinking more as we look to the second quarter  I m trying to understand if there are any    anything we should pay particular attention to  I think last year  there were some new items that you may have shipped  I think maybe in Q2 that might have    there might have been some pipeline benefit and there may have been some movement of some of your business with some co packers that we haven t lapped yet  So if you could talk a little bit  I don t know Dennis  maybe you have some more of the detail around that just so that we can think through how the top line might progress  as we move through the year  Thanks Dennis G  Moore    Chief Financial OfficerYes  I think in the second quarter  you re right  we did last year  we had the Burger King limited time offer program  which generated roughly  3 million of sales in the quarter  which we don t have this year  And then throughout last year  as Dan had mentioned  our machine sales were relatively    yes  relatively high  compared to what they normally are  and we would probably expect a drop off in those sales  the balance of the year  maybe in    as much as say  10 million  So that is going the other way  But on the other hand  there are some positives that perhaps Gerry walk and talk about Gerald B  Shreiber    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerYes  We have a group of new items rolling in the Food Service  We have our new fries rolling out  We have a new funnel cake product rolling out  We have a group of savory crackers  We feel good about schools rolling forward  which has been a headwind for us in the first quarter  Retail  the resets are going to be great for us we think  We ve refreshed our LUIGI S packaging  which we feel like we re going to get a bump out of  We have a more robust  We have  I guess more comprehensive marketing program going forward in the next couple of quarters  So we re doing a lot around the business to get at the top line to move Jon Andersen    William Blair    AnalystAnd on the retail side  did you mentioned Gerry earlier something around Auntie Anne s that you re doing that s been well received  ahead of the resets Gerald B  Shreiber    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerWe acquired Auntie Anne s about the    almost two years ago and it s been a good acquisition for us  although was a competitor to us in the soft pretzel category and supermarkets  now it s complementary product to our SUPERPRETZEL  So we expect to benefit from that this year and beyond Dennis G  Moore    Chief Financial OfficerYes  It continues to grow  There s a lot of white space for Auntie Anne s  and we continue to push that out there  And we have a new Minute Maid novelty rolling out or Minute Maid sticks this year  which we expect benefit from Jon Andersen    William Blair    AnalystSo those    net net couple of headwinds  but you ve got a good    it sounds like a strong pipeline that s going to start working its way into the business over the course of the next quarter or two Dennis G  Moore    Chief Financial OfficerYes  and  Speech Overlap  And other thing I didn t mentioned with regards to Frozen Beverages is that there will be an offset  a positive offset  which comes from the acquisition that would be  11 million of sales or so of the balance of the year Jon Andersen    William Blair    AnalystIs that from the ICEE    the acquisition of the   Gerald B  Shreiber    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerWe acquired the    one of the very  very last independent ICEE Distributors this past quarter  Their sales were in the  35 million to  40 million range Dennis G  Moore    Chief Financial OfficerNo  no  Their sales were roughly  30 million Gerald B  Shreiber    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerI m sorry  right Dennis G  Moore    Chief Financial Officer 11 million  Indecipherable Gerald B  Shreiber    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerBut we expect that will continue and that will be a positive overall halo for the business  not only in the areas that we acquired it  but elsewhere Jon Andersen    William Blair    AnalystOkay  Are there    you said it s one of the last  how many are left and do you plan to pursue that  Is there something important about having all of them Gerald B  Shreiber    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerWe re in almost regular communication with them  They kind of look to us as the leader to set the profile and whatnot  So there is no doubt that one day  they will be included in our Group  It s only a matter of when Jon Andersen    William Blair    AnalystOkay  And then the other question I had was on the relo costs in the quarter  So there were  1 million of relocation costs in the quarter  another  800 000 in the second quarter  Where do those show up in Q1 in the P L  and where would we expect them to show up in Q2  Will they split across cost of goods and operating expense  Or they are heavily    more heavily weighted in one or the other Dennis G  Moore    Chief Financial OfficerMore heavily weighted in operating expenses Jon Andersen    William Blair    AnalystOkay  Great  Thanks  Thanks very much guys  And look forward to seeing the new products on the shelf going forward Gerald B  Shreiber    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerOkay  And incidentally  you covered the relocation  but we thought long and hard about the exodus from California for all the right reasons and we think it s going to work out very well for us in the long run Jon Andersen    William Blair    AnalystWell  maybe I should ask about that  And then  so presumably there is some kind of return on this    the cost or investment that you re making  right now  What are the benefits from making that move  because you re not moving manufacturing  right  you re just moving the kind of the administrative headquarters Gerald B  Shreiber    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerAdministrative Dennis G  Moore    Chief Financial OfficerYes  This is Dennis again  Most of the benefit comes from    the hard dollar benefits comes from what our lease costs would have increased in California  if we had stayed there  So even our costs are going to be  we may save a  1 million a year going forward compared to what our costs  where are you  you really don t see most of that  because our costs would have gone up in California close to that number maybe  700 000 or so because we would be having higher lease costs  once the lease we re in now or had been in expires Jon Andersen    William Blair    AnalystOkay  I see cost avoidance then  Okay  Okay  Thanks  everybody  Thanks for the help and the color  Talk soon OperatorOur next question comes from Ryan Bell  Please go ahead Gerald B  Shreiber    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  Ryan  This is Gerry Shreiber Ryan Bell    Consumer Edge    AnalystHey  Gerry  Would you be able to walk through the performance of some of your recent innovations   Gerald B  Shreiber    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerRyan  are you there Ryan Bell    Consumer Edge    AnalystYeah  I m here  Can you hear me now Gerald B  Shreiber    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerYes  it s better  but it s not real clear yet Ryan Bell    Consumer Edge    AnalystOkay  Could you walk us through    of some of your recent innovations from your press release  it looks like the Food Service innovation is coming along well  And can you talk about the recent progress you ve been making into c stores Gerald B  Shreiber    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerSure  A couple of years ago  we ve laid out a determined effort and plans to increase our sales in c stores  and there are roughly    there is tens of thousands of c stores  We have gotten both our pretzel products and some of our ICEE products and our juice bar products and good distribution and now that we re in there  we re going to be methodically  Technical Issues   So that is part of the consumer  Technical Issues   Many years ago  if you walked into a convenience store  you might get a hot dog  you might get a drink  now there are soft pretzels there  there is the ICEE Group  Technical Issues  Ryan Bell    Consumer Edge    AnalystGreat  And if I m looking at IRI traction or trends through your December quarter  it looks like they were a little bit healthier than what you reported in the quarter  Is there anything that you could talk about that would help to explain that dislocation Robert J  Pape    Senior Vice President of SalesHi  this is Bob Pape  Mostly  Technical Issues  consumers to the new retail pricing  and we feel that  that is starting to recover  And as a result  the takeaway numbers continue to improve Ryan Bell    Consumer Edge    AnalystOkay  great  Thank you  That s it from me OperatorAnd we are showing no further questions Gerald B  Shreiber    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerAll right  I want to thank everybody for their participation in this call  and we look forward to all of you in our next quarter s call  which will be approximately three months or so from now  Have a good day  Thank you Operator Operator Closing Remarks Duration  27 minutesCall participants Gerald B  Shreiber    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerDan Fachner    President of the

197556,419072,JNJ,Johnson   Johnson s Nasal Spray Rejected in England Over Cost Effectiveness,news,"One of Britain s top healthcare agencies  the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence  NICE   announced on Tuesday that the group had decided to reject Johnson   Johnson s  NYSE JNJ  depression nasal spray Spravato due to questions regarding its efficacy as well as cost effectiveness  
NICE is responsible for determining whether a drug gets included in Britain s National Healthcare System  NHS   and for the past while has come down hard on drug candidates over the question of cost effectiveness  Although this is a blow to Johnson   Johnson  the decision isn t necessarily final as of this moment  NICE s initial conclusion is open to comment from Johnson   Johnson until Feb  18  and an appraisal committee meeting is expected to take place soon 

 Estimates of the costs of providing the clinical service for esketamine were highly uncertain  as are the costs of repeated courses of the drug   said Meindert Boysen  director of NICE s center for health technology evaluation  
Spravato s cost effectiveness and efficacy
This isn t the first time that JNJ s Spravato was criticized for its cost  Back in May 2019  the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review  a healthcare cost watchdog  criticized the company for supposedly overpricing the nasal spray  Spravato can cost up to  6 785 for the first month of a patient s dosing schedule 
Although Spravato has done well in five separate phase 3 trials  NICE argued that the nasal spray doesn t have enough data when pitted against  all relevant comparators   This includes treatments such as electroconvulsive therapy as well as various antidepressant antipsychotic medications  The agency also mentioned that they were unsure about whether any improvements in symptoms would remain even after patients stopped taking Spravato ",2020-01-28,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/po2af,2069853

U S   sales increased 1 4   In regions outside the U S   our reported growth was 2 1   Operational sales growth outside the U S  was 4  with currency negatively impacting our reported OUS results by 1 9 points Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures  adjusted operational sales growth was 3 4  worldwide  2 7  in the U S  and 4 1  outside the U S For the full year 2019  consolidated sales were  82 1 billion  an increase of 0 6  compared to the full year of 2018  Operationally  full year sales grew 2 8  with currency having a negative impact of 2 2 points Sales growth in the U S  was 0 5   In regions outside the U S   our reported growth was 0 7   Operational sales growth outside the U S  increased by 5 3  with currency negatively impacting our reported OUS results by 4 6 points  Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures  adjusted operational sales growth was 4 5  worldwide  2 3  in the U S  and 6 7  outside the U S Turning now to earnings  For the

you  Unless otherwise stated  percentages quoted represent the operational sales change in comparison to the fourth quarter of 2018 and therefore exclude the impact of currency translation While not part of the prepared remarks for today s call  we have provided additional commentary on our website for the full year 2019 sales by segment to assist you in updating your models Worldwide Consumer segment sales totaled  3 6 billion  growing 2 1   Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures  adjusted operational sales growth was 1 4  with growth in the U S  of 1 6  due primarily to strong performance in our OTC franchise  Growth outside of the U S  was 1 3  Over the counter medicines grew globally almost 5  operationally and on an adjusted basis  In the U S   OTC growth was around 10  and is growing share in multiple products such as Adult TYLENOL driven by rapid release gels  PEPCID and ZARBEE s  However U S  growth was aided by about 200 basis points of stocking due to incremental distribution and trade promotion programs The Beauty franchise grew 4 3  or just under 1  when adjusted to exclude the impact of the acquisition of DR  CI LABO and the ROC divestiture  NEUTROGENA delivered strong performance globally with growth of 4  outside the U S   driven by anti aging and cleansing innovation in EMEA as well as hand and body moisture category strength in the Asia Pacific region  In the U S   share and market growth were largely offset by lapping of prior year new product pipeline builds and higher 2019 trade investment in NEUTROGENA Concluding the Consumer segment  Baby Care declined 9 3  globally or negative 7  when adjusted to exclude the impact of the Baby Center divestiture  This decline was primarily due to continued competitive pressures as well as comparisons to prior year relaunch activities  most notably in the United States Moving on to our Pharmaceutical segment  worldwide Pharmaceutical sales of  10 5 billion grew 4 4   enabled by double digit growth in nine key products  The segment delivered a seventh consecutive quarter above  10 billion in revenue  Sales grew in the U S  about 4  and increased outside the U S  by almost 5   Generic competition for ZYTIGA negatively impacted our worldwide and U S  growth by about 180 basis points and 310 basis points respectively Our strong portfolio of products and commercial capabilities has enabled us to deliver global growth at above market levels  despite significant biosimilar and generic headwinds  Our oncology portfolio delivered another strong quarter with worldwide growth of over 10   DARZALEX continued its strong performance growing about  Phonetic  45  globally  The U S  grew almost 38  with strong growth across all lines of therapy  driven by the new frontline indication for the multiple myeloma transplant Ineligible population The continued strong growth outside the U S  is driven by increased penetration and share gains  IMBRUVICA grew over 26  globally  driven largely by market share gains and strong market growth  primarily in the chronic lymphocytic leukemia indication in the U S   along with strong uptake outside the U S In the U S   based on third quarter data  IMBRUVICA gained above 7 points of market share in CLL Line 1 therapy  Worldwide ZYTIGA growth declined by about 13  with declines of almost 45  in the U S  due to generic competition  which was partially offset by continued strong growth of almost 13  outside the U S We continue to be pleased with the launch progress of ERLEADA  which generated global sales of  116 million in Q4 and  332 million for the full year  primarily in the United States  We continue to grow market share in non metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer  gaining over two points in the U S  this quarter Sales in the U S  reflects the first full quarter for the approved indication for patients with metastatic castration sensitive prostate cancer  We are also pleased with the launch progress in EMEA where ERLEADA is now available in 12 countries  Our immunology therapeutic area delivered global sales growth of just over 6   driven by strong double digit performance of STELARA and TREMFYA Sales growth was partially offset by continued erosion of REMICADE of about 16  due to increased discounts and modest share loss in the U S  to alternative mechanisms of action and biosimilars  STELARA growth of almost 19  was primarily driven by the Crohn s disease indication where market share has increased by 6 points in the U S  versus the fourth quarter of 2018  In October  we received U S  FDA approval of STELARA for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis SIMPONI    SIMPONI ARIA delivered sales growth of 7 6   driven by strong market growth and SIMPONI ARIA share gains in the U S  TREMFYA grew over 55  and achieved an 8 3  share of the psoriasis market in the U S   which is up about 2 points from the fourth quarter of 2018 In neuroscience  our Paliperidone long acting portfolio performed well growing 15  with higher market share driven by increased new patient starts and strong persistency  In addition  we continue to progress the launch of SPRAVATO  Patient demand continues to build and the unmet need remains very high  New patient starts continue to steadily increase each month  with over 3 500 patients being treated to date Further  we are pleased to report that in December SPRAVATO was approved in Europe for adults with treatment resistant major depressive disorder In infectious diseases  our portfolio grew 9 6  led by strong growth of SYMTUZA and JULUCA for HIV  partially offset by cannibalization and increased generic competition in other products  In our cardiovascular metabolism and other product portfolio  we did experience declining sales of 9 5   primarily driven by declines in INVOKANA and biosimilar competition for PROCRIT XARELTO was flat with volume increases offset by rebates  primarily due to an increase in the legislative rate for the donut hole from 50  to 70  along with higher Medicare and donut hole utilization  In our total pulmonary hypertension portfolio  sales declined 6 2  as a result of a distributor model change in the U S  to realize efficiencies by leveraging our distribution capabilities  This change negatively impacted sales growth by about 800 basis points with sales growth of 2   when adjusting for this one time impact We continue to see strong share growth for OPSUMIT and UPTRAVI and when adjusting for the one time distributor model impact  their worldwide sales were about 10  and 30  respectively  Portfolio growth was also impacted by declining sales in TRACLEER as a result of continued generic competition I ll now turn your attention to the Medical Devices segment  Worldwide Medical Devices sales were  6 6 billion growing 0 2   Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures  primarily the divestiture of ASP  adjusted operational sales growth was 2 7  worldwide One time items negatively impacted growth in the quarter by about 70 basis points  largely related to a bleed down of the forward buying in Q3  in Japan  ahead of the consumption tax change  which primarily impacted our Vision business  The majority of this has sold through in Q4 with the remainder expected to occur in Q1  2020 Additionally  on a year on year basis  we are pleased to report the Medical Devices has accelerated underlying sales growth worldwide by 130 basis points with the second half of 2019 delivering 4  growth  Interventional solutions grew over 13  globally  led by continued strength in our electrophysiology business achieving about 14  growth worldwide and almost 16  for the year  continuing its trend of double digit growth for the 11th consecutive year Growth was strong in all regions driven by our newer product offerings in ablation and advanced catheters contributing to atrial fibrillation procedural market growth  Additionally  our Cerenovus business delivered its sixth straight quarter of double digit growth  driven by strong market growth and new product innovation  including EMBOTRAP for the treatment of ischemic stroke Vision grew 0 9  or 3  when adjusting for the negative impact of the Japan consumption tax forward buy I mentioned earlier  Growth was primarily driven by contact lenses which grew 2 6  globally or 5  adjusted for the bleed of the Japan consumption tax forward buy  led by double digit growth of daily disposables in the OASYS family For the year  contact lens grew almost 5  which we expect to be in line with the overall market  representing the fourth consecutive year the contact lens has grown at or above the market  In surgical vision  we saw continued strong OUS growth in the cataract business due to above market performance in IOLs  primarily in Asia Pacific This was offset by weak U S  performance due to competitive pressures and lower market growth in refractive surgery  We continue to see positive momentum in orthopaedics  delivering growth for the quarter of 1 2   On an annual basis  each major platform accelerated versus the prior year and adjusted growth for this franchise improved by 180 basis points This progress reflects the continued execution of our innovation and commercial strategies aimed to improve performance  Hips grew 4 2  driven by our leadership position in the anterior approach  continued strong demand of our primary stem ACTIS and enabling technologies such as the KINCISE surgical automated system and JointPoint navigation system Knees growth was 1 4  in the quarter  driven by strong performance of new innovation such as ATTUNE Revision  ATTUNE S plus I mean the ATTUNE Cementless rotating platform which launched at the end of Q3  OUS growth of 3 2  was led by Asia Pacific  Additionally  the United States returned to growth this quarter Trauma growth of 2 5  globally was driven by market growth supported by strong adoption of newer innovation  such as our Femoral Neck System  Spine declined 5 8  with the U S  being the primary driver  partially due to not repeating a time Q4 2018 favorable pricing related true up  which negatively impacted global growth by 250 basis points Excluding this impact  performance for the quarter was in line with the full year  While we lost share in the quarter  we continue to see positive uptake of newer products and are pleased with the strong start of our newly launched SYMPHONY surgical system for use in posterior cervical spine procedures Pricing pressure continue to impact all categories in orthopedics  U S  pure price in spine declined about 3  after adjusting for last year s pricing related true up  Trauma price was consistent with the Q3 decline of 2   Price in hips and knees both improved compared to Q3 at negative 1  and flat respectively Moving to the results for the surgery business  advanced surgery delivered global growth of over 3  led by bio surgery growth of about 4  with growth in all regions led by Asia Pacific share gains and market growth  However  growth in the quarter was tempered as SURGIFLO continued to ramp back up in the United States Energy and Endocutters grew approximately 3  and 2  respectively with OUS growth driven by share gains and new products in the Asia Pacific region  partially offset by competitive pressure in the United States Wound closure grew over 2  driven by continued strong market growth in China as well as share gains in conventional and barbed sutures  As expected  selling days had an immaterial impact on our global growth rates in the fourth quarter  In 2020  selling days will negatively impact Q1 Medical Devices growth by over 50 basis points  with the majority being offset in Q2 I will now provide some commentary on our earnings for the year  Please direct your attention to the box section at the bottom of the schedule  You will see we have provided our earnings adjusted to exclude intangible amortization expense and special items As reported this morning  our adjusted EPS of  8 68 reflects reported growth of 6 1  and operational growth of 8 8   exceeding the high end of both our reported an operational adjusted EPS guidance range from October  driven by our strong performance Consistent with our guidance  we did see a slight decline in adjusted pre tax operating margins of 30 basis points  driven by investment in digital surgery and medical devices Moving to the next slide  our full year 2019 adjusted income before tax for the Enterprise improved 170 basis points versus 2018  Looking at the adjusted pre tax income by segment  Medical Devices at 35 4  is higher than the previous year  primarily due to increased divestiture gains in 2019  partially offset by an increase in investments in digital surgery Pharmaceutical margins declined by 200 basis points to 40   driven by reduced divestiture gains and higher cost of products sold due to the negative impact of currency  Consumer margins improved by 90 basis points to 21 4   driven by planned prioritization and spending reductions  partially offset by reduced divestiture gains in 2018 Now  regarding our consolidated statement of earnings for the fourth quarter of 2019  please direct your attention to the boxed section of the schedule  As referenced in the table of non GAAP measures  the 2019 fourth quarter net earnings are adjusted to exclude intangible asset amortization expense and special items of  1 billion on an after tax basis  primarily driven by intangible amortization of  1 billion  Excluding the impact of those items  our adjusted earnings per share is  1 88  a decrease of 4 6  versus the fourth quarter 2018  Adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis was  1 91  down 3  versus fourth quarter 2018 I like to now highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed on the statement of earnings compared to the same quarter last year  Cost of products sold delevered slightly primarily driven by an increase in amortization expense  partially offset by favorable segment mix Selling  marketing and administrative margins for the quarter improved as a result of planned prioritization in the Consumer business and favorable segment mix  partially offset by increased investment in the Medical Devices business  R D investment was consistent year over year with slightly lower milestone payments in the Pharmaceutical business  offset by increased investment in digital solutions in the Medical Device business Net interest expense was lower by  50 million  primarily driven by the positive effect of net investment hedging arrangements  partially offset by reduced interest income resulting from lower rates of interest earned on cash balances  The change in the other income and expense line was primarily driven by lower litigation expense  higher unrealized gains on securities  partially offset by lower gains from divestitures Regarding taxes in the quarter  our effective tax rate was 4 9  compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 tax rate of 2 6   The current quarter includes an estimated tax expense for the transition provisions of Swiss tax reform  partially offset by reorganization of certain foreign subsidiaries and additional impacts of recently issued regulations associated with U S  tax reform  We encourage you to reference our 10 K for further details on this and other specific tax matters  Excluding special items  the effective tax rate was 10 7   relatively consistent with the same period last year  which was 11 1  Now looking at adjusted income before tax  In the fourth quarter of 2019  our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise as a percentage of sales decreased from 29 6  to 27 1  in the fourth quarter of 2019  primarily driven by the impact of divestiture gains in Q4 of last year The following are the main drivers of adjusted income before tax by segment  Medical Devices declined by 830 basis points  driven by the LifeScan divestiture gain reported in Q4 2018  as well as an increased investment in robotics and digital solutions in 2019  Consumer margins declined by 280 basis points  primarily driven by the divestiture of ROC in Q4 2018  The slight increase in Pharmaceutical margins of 30 basis points was primarily driven by reduced milestone payments  That concludes the sales and P L highlights for Johnson   Johnson s fourth quarter 2019 For your reference  here is a slide summarizing notable developments occurring in the fourth quarter  some of which were mentioned in my comments  I m now pleased to turn the call over to Alex Gorsky Alex Gorsky    Chairman  Board of Directors and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Chris  And thanks to all of you for joining us today  We re very pleased to be highlighting our fourth quarter and full year performance  We delivered strong revenue and earnings growth in 2019  exceeding the financial performance metrics that we set at the beginning of the year  Now we accomplished this while also making strategic investments that advance the pipeline of opportunities and innovation across all three of our business segments  and as we faced a variety of challenges from debates about the healthcare system in our country to uncertainty with global trade to today s litigious environment to name a few  Now I m very proud that despite the challenges  we still remain focused and delivered on Our Credo commitments and responsibilities to our patients  employees  communities and shareholders  ultimately driving our purpose to advance health for humanity  And I m confident that we are well positioned to build on this momentum and solid foundation as we move into 2020 and beyond We remain focused on the long term  a mindset we ve maintained for more than a century  a mindset that is directly linked to our focused execution  our relentless pursuit of innovation  our talented and passionate people  our culture of caring for the world and unwavering focus on value creation for all our stakeholders In fact  I m proud to highlight that 2019 marked our 36th consecutive year of adjusted operational earnings growth for Johnson   Johnson  Now this performance is indicative of the strength of our broad based business and we remain focused on driving the next generation of innovation across our entire portfolio in new markets  in markets where we have greater opportunity to compete and in the markets where we lead  which include our 26 platforms that each deliver  1 billion or more in sales annually In Pharmaceuticals  our strong track record of success continued again in 2019 as our Pharma segment outpaced the market  growing operationally 5 8   which more than offset the loss of exclusivity due to biosimilar competition and generic erosion as well as new competitive entrants and other market pressures Now  it s important to note that our robust growth can be attributed to volume not price  And our sales growth is a reflection of the increased number of patients we re reaching with our transformational medicines for unmet needs  This strong growth  not only enabled us to deliver life saving and life changing medicines to people around the globe  but it also enabled us to become the third largest pharmaceutical company in the world  retain our Number 1 leadership position in the U S  and be recognized as the Number 1 pharmaceutical company on Fortune magazine s annual Most Admired Companies list  Our pharma investments in R D continue to fuel exceptional growth as well  We achieved double digit growth for 10 key products and delivered strong performance across all regions  including in both developed and emerging markets We re very proud and excited that we gained approval and launched two new transformational medicines  SPRAVATO for treatment resistant depression and BALVERSA for metastatic urothelial cancer  We also continue to maximize the value in our market brands  submitting numerous filings and receiving approvals for line extensions for key brands  including STELARA  DARZALEX and ERLEADA  many with peak sales potential that is greater than  500 million  And we continue to expand our portfolio of strategic licensing and acquisition of new assets and platforms  including cusatuzumab from Argenx  an investigational antibody for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia and high risk myelodysplastic syndromes  a gene regulation platform from MeiraGTx and bermekimab from XBiotech Inc   an anti IL 1 alpha in Phase II development to treat atopic dermatitis and hidradenitis suppurativa With this industry leading pipeline  our commercial capabilities and robust R D productivity  I m confident that we are well positioned to continue delivering sustained long term above market growth in 2020 and beyond  Now  2019 marked a year of significant transformation for the Consumer Health business  We reestablished our brand and purpose and made strategic decisions that over time will accelerate growth  reduce complexity and improve operating margins  Fueled by science based professionally endorsed brands and strong consumer insights  we placed a concerted focus throughout 2019 on establishing a clear plan and path to achieve benchmark profitability in 2020  And this segment is already well on its way  delivering 90 basis points of adjusted pre tax margin improvement for the year Additionally  we successfully integrated the acquisitions of Zarbee s  Inc   a leader in naturally based over the counter remedies and the Dr Ci Labo line of dermocosmetic skin care products  strengthening our position in these higher growth categories  Our U S  Consumer business continues to grow above the market and our priority areas of beauty and OTC delivered solid operational growth for the year I m also pleased to share that Medical Devices accelerated growth again in 2019  As a result of our relentless focus on execution  innovation and portfolio management  our underlying growth was just under 4   Now improved performance was driven by electrophysiology  achieving its 11th consecutive year of double digit growth  contact lens  which delivered growth at or above the market for the fourth straight year  energy and endocutters businesses growing mid single digits and improved performance in orthopedics with each major platform accelerating compared to 2018 During the year  we also fortified our commitment and accelerated our entry into one of the fastest growing healthcare categories and exciting transformative fields of medicine  digital surgery  Consistent with our historical pioneering spirit in medical devices  we are focused on the next frontier of surgery  The acquisition of Auris Health  Inc   a developer of robotic technologies currently in lung cancer accelerated our entry into robotics as part of a digital surgery ecosystem designed to make medical intervention smarter  less invasive and more personalized to elevate the standard of care Additionally  just last month  we announced an agreement to acquire the remaining stake in Verb Surgical to further strengthen our ecosystem  And we also successfully launched critical products across each franchise throughout 2019  including  the ATTUNE Cementless knee system  our first of its kind ACUVUE OASYS contact lens with TRANSITIONS LIGHT INTELLIGENT TECHNOLOGY  The industry s first powered circular stapler ECHELON and the VIZIGO steerable sheath in our market leading electrophysiology business Our team continues to focus on improving our cadence of innovation as well as our portfolio optimization  which included the completion of the Advanced Sterilization products divestiture and the execution of more than 50 acquisitions or strategic partnerships that we expect will further augment our future growth We are committed to building upon this momentum in 2020 and I m pleased to share that we will be hosting our Medical Device Business Review Day on May 13th to highlight the strategies that we believe will drive further growth and provide additional insights into the team s plans in digital surgery Looking ahead  across all three business segments  we know we ve got more work to do  but we are committed to continuing to deliver above market growth in our Pharmaceutical business  broadening the reach of our Consumer business and meeting the full potential of our Medical Devices business And one of the most critical factors in achieving the goals of all of our business strategies is sustaining our investment in innovation  Once again in 2019  we achieved record levels of investment  investing more than  11 billion in research and development  And across all industries  we remain one of the top 10 global companies that invest at the highest levels in R D and innovation Across Johnson   Johnson  we recognize the powerful impact that technology  innovation and health breakthroughs have in creating meaningful change in people s lives and establishing a competitive differentiation within the industry Now  I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge that all of these many accomplishments would not have been possible without the efforts  passion and engagement of our approximately 132 000 global Johnson   Johnson colleagues who continue to demonstrate a commitment to delivering healthcare solutions that benefit patients  consumers and communities around the world Our purpose driven  Credo based culture puts patients and people first  and this is certainly true in the way we think about our employees and work to consistently cultivate the world s best  healthiest and most engaged workforce  The fact that our Johnson   Johnson colleagues are truly the driving force behind our successful performance and in fulfilling our purpose is something that we never  never take for granted and always celebrate We share the common objective of always making the health and well being of the patients and consumers who use our products every day our number one priority and it has been this way for the last 134 years  We are on the front lines of developing medicines and revolutionary products that are literally saving people s lives  and we re working to prevent cancer  offer less invasive surgeries and to end Ebola and HIV  This is what the world expects of us and this is what our global workforce is united around  committed to and prepared to do  Now  putting the needs of those we serve first also means protecting our shared environment in natural resources  We know that human health is directly linked to the health of the planet  Healthy people and communities go hand in hand with a healthy environment  This is why we are committed to reducing the environmental footprint of our operations  products and supply chain with 2020 targets to reduce carbon emissions by 20  and procure 35  of electricity from renewable resources Looking over the long term  we are optimizing our operations to improve water and energy efficiency while focusing on sustainable design and reduction in product packaging as well  all with the goal of delivering better health for people everywhere So now I d like to close where I began  In spite of the numerous industry challenges we faced throughout 2019  I m very pleased that we remain focused on meeting the needs of patients and consumers globally  delivering value to all of our stakeholders  innovating  driving growth  and achieving solid performance  Our sustainable business model is built for the long term and provides us with increased confidence about our business  our strategic direction and the healthcare industry in what may sometimes feel like uncertain times  You have our unwavering commitment that we will hold ourselves accountable to fulfill all of Our Credo responsibilities  where we always keep the patient at the center of everything we do and also ensure the continued long term success of Johnson   Johnson We have an incredible opportunity to play a leading role in defining and driving the future of healthcare and putting it within the reach of everyone everywhere  This is why we are so very excited and confident about 2020 and beyond  I look forward to addressing your questions during the upcoming Q A  but I ll now turn it over to Joe  who will provide additional details about our results and guidance for 2020 Thank you  Joe Joseph J  Wolk    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial OfficerThank you  Alex  Hello  everyone  We appreciate you joining today s call  I will be providing additional context around our 2019 performance  including our year end cash position and the capital allocation actions that we executed throughout the year  and then conclude with our guidance for 2020  As Alex and Chris mentioned  we delivered solid fourth quarter results  which capped a strong year of performance for Johnson   Johnson  Our full year results reflect a continued commitment to our long term strategic objectives  Throughout the quarter and the year  we maintained our focus on delivering life saving and life changing products to patients and consumers across the globe  Heading into 2020  we are confident in our overall strategy and ability to drive results across the enterprise that will yield strong shareholder returns  Our solid results during the year generated strong cash flow  our highest level ever of free cash flow of nearly  20 billion With respect to our cash position  at the end of 2019  we had approximately  8 4 billion of net debt  consisting of approximately  19 3 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately  27 7 billion of debt  Although we don t provide cash flow guidance  for transparency as we come off a record year of free cash flow generation  we do expect a decline in 2020 of approximately 10  as we are planning for a payment related to the agreement in principle to settle opioid litigation  as previously disclosed In 2019  we executed on all four elements of our capital allocation strategy  Our first objective within that framework is to invest in growth opportunities to solidify and advance our current business  Delivering transformative healthcare solutions and creating access is the top priority for Johnson   Johnson  And  as Alex mentioned  we invested more than  11 billion in R D during 2019 As investors in Johnson   Johnson know  delivering a competitive and increasing dividend is a capital allocation priority for us  In 2019  we returned almost  10 billion to investors  which is approximately 50  of our free cash flow  increasing the quarterly dividend by 5 6   Once we ve satisfied our dividend objectives  we seek M A opportunities where our capabilities can create compelling value During the year  we completed a number of strategic acquisitions totaling almost  6 billion to further strengthen our portfolio which Alex outlined earlier in the call  Finally  after executing on these three important capital allocation priorities  we consider other prudent ways to return value to shareholders  such as the  5 billion share repurchase program we began in December of 2018 and concluded in the third quarter of 2019 Let s move the discussion to guidance and information to assist your financial modeling for the year ahead  I ll begin with some qualitative comments that we considered in our outlook  First  our projected sales growth includes the benefit of an additional two to three shipping days associated with a 53rd week in our 2020 fiscal calendar  This will be partially offset by a SKU rationalization program in our Consumer segment As part of our efforts to further improve profitability in 2020  the consumer segment will continue to invest in platforms where we have differentiated brands with the greatest potential  Therefore  we plan to rationalize approximately 10  of the SKUs across the global portfolio  translating to a negative impact on 2020 topline growth of slightly over 100 basis points for the segment  This program will be primarily focused outside the U S  with a larger impact coming in the second half of the year in the baby and beauty franchises  considering both the additional shipping days associated with a 53rd fiscal week and the consumer SKU rationalization program  The net impact is approximately 50 basis points to 100 basis points of benefit to the company s sales growth outlook  Specific to each segment  our adjusted sales guidance also assumes continued above market performance in our Pharmaceutical segment  driven by continued strong growth from key products such as DARZALEX  IMBRUVICA  TREMFYA  STELARA and ERLEADA due to increased penetration and new indications Continued acceleration of sales growth in Medical Devices generated by recent launches and improved execution  And in the Consumer Health business  we will continue to grow above the market in the U S  while executing the SKU rationalization program to position the segment for benchmark profitability  Given these factors  we expect adjusted operational sales growth for the full year of between 5  and 6  or 5 5  at the midpoint  The adjusted operational sales growth of 5  to 6  is on a constant currency basis  reflecting how we manage our business performance  Considering a negative impact from net acquisitions and divestitures  which we estimate at 50 basis points  we are comfortable with your models reflecting operational sales growth in the range of 4 5  to 5 5  or  85 8 billion to  86 6 billion As you know  we do not predict the impact of currency movements  but utilizing the euro spot rate relative to the U S  dollar as of last week at 1 11  there is an estimated negative impact of foreign currency translation of approximately 50 basis points  resulting in an estimated reported sales growth between 4  and 5  compared to 2019 or  85 4 billion to  86 2 billion Let s now discuss earnings per share  As you can see on your screen  here s a slide depicting the components and assumptions included in our 2020 EPS guidance  Using the sales growth guidance I just referenced provides approximately  0 40 growth to EPS  The next column is based on expected operating margin improvement of approximately 100 basis points  which translates to an incremental  0 25 of contribution net of continued investments across our segments  Operating margin improvement will be primarily driven by continued efforts to improve manufacturing capabilities  optimize sales marketing and administrative expenses  and the consumer SKU rationalization just discussed This results in strong adjusted operational EPS growth for the core business of  0 65 or 7 5  versus the prior year  Offsetting those two operating components is the anticipated reduced level of other income of approximately  0 30 compared to 2019  You may recall that we benefited from a large divestiture gain from the sale of our Advanced Sterilization Products business in the second quarter of 2019 The final element to this EPS waterfall chart is the 2020 benefit we will have from the share repurchase program completed in 2019 which adds  0 05 to EPS compared to 2019  resulting in an adjusted operational EPS of  9 08 at the midpoint or a growth rate of 4 6   While not predicting the impact of currency movements using recent exchange rates  our reported adjusted EPS would be negatively impacted by approximately  0 05 per share  resulting in adjusted reported earnings per share of  9 03 at the midpoint  reflecting growth of approximately 4  Continuing with EPS guidance  this slide provides a summary of additional P L items to better provide insight into our full year 2020 guidance  As referenced earlier  for 2020 we are expecting our adjusted pre tax operating margin to improve by approximately 100 basis points  while still prioritizing investment in our business that accelerates and further strengthens our pipeline of new products for the long term Although we are continuously evaluating external value creating opportunities for purposes of your models  we currently assume no major acquisitions or other major uses of cash and are therefore comfortable with your modeling net interest expense between zero and  100 million As a reminder  other income and expense is the line on the P L where we record royalty income as well as gains and losses related to the items such as litigation  investments by our Johnson   Johnson development corporation  divestitures  asset sales  and write offs We would be comfortable with your models for 2020 reflecting net other income and expense  excluding special items  as net income ranging from  1 5 billion to  1 7 billion  This is lower than 2019 as we had elevated levels of divestiture gains and we do not expect an event of that magnitude in 2020 Moving on to taxes  Our effective tax rate guidance for 2020  excluding special items  is approximately 17 5  to 18 5  were higher than where we ended 2019  driven by expected changes in the mix of global earnings and miscellaneous one time benefits not expected to reoccur in 2020 Considering all these factors  we are comfortable with adjusted EPS guidance in a range of  9 00 to  9 15 per share on a constant currency basis  reflecting operational or constant currency growth of approximately 3 7  to 5 4  Again  while not predicting the impact of currency movements  but to provide some insight on the potential impact on EPS using exchange rates from last week  our reported adjusted EPS would be negatively impacted by approximately  0 05 per share  Therefore  our estimate for 2020 reported adjusted EPS is between a range of  8 95 to  9 10 per share or  9 03 per share at the midpoint As a final comment  our guidance assumes no formal share repurchase program at this time  I wanted to provide this reminder since the last time I looked  Street estimates utilized an average share count which is significantly lower than what we are assuming for our 2020 guidance We estimate the average diluted shares outstanding to be largely in line with the fourth quarter 2019 share count or 2 67 billion shares  Although we do not provide quarterly guidance  there are a few factors for you to consider in your models beyond the selling day fluctuations Chris mentioned in his remarks for Medical Device For sales  you can expect the fourth quarter of 2020 to have the benefit of the additional shipping days  partially offset by the Consumer SKU rationalization program that we are projecting throughout the year but more pronounced in the back half  With respect to earnings  the first quarter of 2019 included an equity gain related to the consumer acquisition of DR  CI LABO  and the second quarter of 2019 included the gain associated with the ASP divestiture in medical devices We don t anticipate similar events for other income and expense in the first half of 2020  but would expect elevated levels of other income aligned to today s guidance in the second half of 2020  Lastly  based on today s spot rates  currency will have a more negative impact in the first half of 2020 That concludes prepared remarks of our financial summary of 2019 results and 2020 guidance  Our 2019 results reinforce our confidence in our broad based business as we head into 2020 and we look forward to delivering continued value on behalf of all stakeholders As Alex mentioned  we will be hosting our Medical Device Business Review Day on May 13th and I look forward to seeing all of you in person at this exciting event  which will be held in New York City this year For your planning purposes and based on investment community feedback  please note that we will be highlighting our Consumer segment at consumer focused events such as notable CPG conferences this year  A special thank you to our Johnson   Johnson associates around the world for their tireless efforts and commitment who make the results we have attained possible and the outlook so bright I will now turn the call back to Chris to begin the Q AChristopher DelOrefice    Vice President of Investor RelationsThank you  Joe  We will now move to the Q A portion of the webcast  Operator  can you please provide instructions for those on the line wishing to ask a question Questions and Answers OperatorYes  thank you   Operator Instructions  Your first question comes from Chris Schott with JPMorgan Chris Schott    JPMorgan    AnalystGreat  thanks very much for the questions  The first was just on Pharma  can you just elaborate a little bit more on your expectations for growth in 2020  I guess specifically  what are you expecting in terms of patent expirations headwinds for this year  And can you also elaborate on the competitive dynamics you re expecting for both TREMFYA and STELARA in psoriasis with the launch of Skyrizi  Thanks so much Christopher DelOrefice    Vice President of Investor RelationsHey  good morning  Chris  and thanks for the question  Thanks for joining us today  So with Pharmaceuticals  as I mentioned in some of my prepared remarks  we do expect continued growth above the market  I think as we would have sat here last year  we expected a bigger impact in 2019 from the loss of exclusivity and generic and biosimilar competition to our products and to our teams credit  based on the data  the safety  the efficacy  the familiarity of the products and comfortability for physicians and patients  those products were able to retain that business a little bit longer We would expect that to bleed into 2020 and    but we still do even with that  I ll call a neutralized headwinds  It s not a tailwind per se  but I ll call it a neutralized headwind compared to 2019  I think we do certainly expect that the portfolio of products will continue to outperform the general market of pharmaceuticals in general Alex Gorsky    Chairman  Board of Directors and Chief Executive OfficerHey Chris  this is Alex  Just to add one comment on to that  look  we re extremely proud overall of the performance of our Pharmaceutical Group  but particularly our immunology group within Pharma  If you    if you just step back a moment and look over the past several years at    first of all  the way that they were able to manage the biosimilar impact with REMICADE  while simultaneously launching multiple new indications for compounds like STELARA launching TREMFYA To note that TREMFYA 55  growth in the quarter  STELARA had 19  growth  And frankly also  it s the clinical development and the competitive differentiation with TREMFYA  for example  having comparative trials not only versus our own compounds but also against Humira and Cosentyx And I think what s really important is that in areas that these products are used  it s not only the short term results  but it s particularly important for the long term results So many patients on psoriasis will shift from product to product and are suffering from this condition for a long time  And having in excess of 48 months  worth of duration and treatment effect by a compound like TREMFYA  I think really helps explain its uptake and continued confidence and use by physicians and patients in the marketplace So and we combine that with the penetration rate of probably somewhere in the 30  to 40  rate in this overall category  we think that there is still a lot of unmet need We think that there is still a lot of opportunity with these compounds and that doesn t even include some of the additional clinical development programs that we re having in areas such as GI as well for these  where particularly for a compound like STELARA  we re seeing great impact  We think that there is a lot of opportunity ahead Chris Schott    JPMorgan    AnalystGreat  thanks for that  Maybe one other really quick one here  Other income   1 5 billion to  1 7 billion  I think that s still a bit above your historic levels of other income  I know this number can be a bit lumpy  but should we think about this type of level as a new norm or can we think about that number of declining further  as we look beyond 2020  Thanks Joseph J  Wolk    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial OfficerYeah  Chris  thanks for the question  I would say it s certainly down from what we experienced in 2019  And I would expect not to provide any insight into 2021 just yet  but I would expect that number to come further down as we look out  So as you see this year  we re improving our operating margins by nearly a 100 basis points to offset some of the effect that we had the benefit of in 2019  And I think we ll continue to do that But to be truthful  we continually look and manage our portfolio in a very rigorous fashion  making sure that we re the best owners of the assets that we have and that works both ways  So we look to complement our portfolio  but we ll also look to take underperforming businesses and create value for shareholders in other ways Chris Schott    JPMorgan    AnalystThank you Christopher DelOrefice    Vice President of Investor RelationsChris  thanks for your questions  Next question please OperatorYour next question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo Larry Biegelsen    Wells Fargo    AnalystGood morning  thanks for taking the question  Just one on the extra week and one of the litigation  Joe  can you talk about the impact of the extra week in 2020  In 2015  it was about 4  in Q4  1  for the full year and neutral to EPS  Does it impact U S  more than international  Does it impact some businesses more than other  I heard your comments on Consumer but I m thinking more about Pharma and Med Tech  And I had one follow up Joseph J  Wolk    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial OfficerYes  So Larry  with respect to the fiscal 53rd week that translates to about two to three shipping days  I would say that s pretty much the norm for the Medical Device and Pharmaceutical units that you ve asked about  It s a little bit less in Consumer in terms of impact  because it doesn t impact stocking during the holiday season  So    and you re absolutely correct  we had the same assumptions around EPS  It s pretty much neutral because you still have a full week of expenses without really the benefit of a full week of sales Larry Biegelsen    Wells Fargo    AnalystThanks for that  And Alex  just one on litigation  Just  what s the latest on the opioid litigation  the latest on the  4 billion settlement you had previously announced  Any important dates and milestones we should think about  And just lastly on talc  when do you expect the decision from the Daubert hearing  Thanks for taking the questions Joseph J  Wolk    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial OfficerHey Larry  this is Joe  I ll take that  Thanks for the questions  With respect to the opioid settlement  an agreement in principle that was announced shortly after our Q3 earnings where we set aside  4 billion  we continue to work with the Negotiating Committee of the State Attorney Generals to finalize the agreement in principle  We remain  I would say  cautiously optimistic that that s progressing very well We re highly engaged to the extent we can be to finalize that agreement in principle  and we hope to hear more over the coming months from the lead negotiators representing not just the states  but as you know the counties and municipalities With respect to talc and the Daubert litigation  we are awaiting Judge Wolfson s verdict in that  Again  as you know  that s an evidentiary standards hearing  So we ll be able to make sure that there is great clarity and certainty as to the type of scientific evidence that needs to be presented As you know and you probably saw in the Journal of American Medical Association article published just a few weeks ago  probably one of the most comprehensive reports evaluating all studies from independent sources found no link between talc and cancer  So we think that s  again  another independent source and we think those facts  those    that data  that scientific research will bear out in the end  Thank you Larry Biegelsen    Wells Fargo    AnalystGreat  thanks Christopher DelOrefice    Vice President of Investor RelationsThanks  Larry  Rob  Next question please OperatorYour next question is from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley David Lewis    Morgan Stanley    AnalystGreat  Just a couple of questions this morning  Joe  just one clarification and one qualitative on revenue  So the 5  to 6  operational guidance for 2020  the way to think about that is that includes about 50 basis points to 100 basis points of the net effect of selling days adjusted for the consumers SKUs Joseph J  Wolk    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial OfficerThat s exactly right  David David Lewis    Morgan Stanley    AnalystOkay  And just a follow up on revenue  and one more quick one after that  Just qualitatively Joe  can you sort of help us understand 2020  how you see it framing up from a Pharmaceutical  Consumer and Medical Device business  and historically  you ve given us a sense of sort of which businesses are likely to accelerate and which businesses are sort of more stable  So across Pharma  MD and Consumer  how do you see sort of the qualitative parameters driving the 2020 guide Joseph J  Wolk    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial OfficerYeah  thanks for the question  David  So we have    I think right now  it is across all three of our businesses  If you look at Pharmaceuticals  we will continue to accelerate growth  I would say we ll be above market  It s probably not as robust as we would have thought this time last year  again because we were able to retain some of the business that was subject to generic and biosimilar competition But again  very healthy growth above market and we ll be looking to complement the portfolio certainly with advancing our pipeline  We ve got a couple of things that are    hopefully will be filed this year around Ponesimod for multiple sclerosis We hope to gain approval on the DARZALEX subcutaneous formulation  which is a tremendous benefit for patients and we ll see the continued uptake of BALVERSA and SPRAVATO In medical Devices  we re very pleased and just to put it into some context for the analyst community here  In 2017  we grew 1 6   In 2017    2018  I m sorry  we grew 2 7  and now we re up to 3 9  and we re not done  So we re going to continue to accelerate growth  be toward that in the middle of the market range that we believe is on the horizon for 2020 and that s before we have the opportunity to launch what we think will be a very differentiated offering around digital robotic surgery In Consumer  again  as Alex mentioned in some of his remarks  we have focused on profitability there  We focused putting investment behind our stronghold categories of skin health and self care  so that would be TYLENOL and MOTRIN for self care  AVEENO and NEUTROGENA for skin health  Those brands continue to do extremely well  I would suspect we grow more in line with the market for that category  except for the SKU rationalization where we ll be looking to de prioritize some less productive brands  Okay David Lewis    Morgan Stanley    AnalystAnd Joe    and then just  Joe  just one quick question  follow up on margins  In some of the years you ve had sort of other income headwinds  you ve been able to offset it with more significant SG A gains driving margins  You re talking about a 100 basis points of margin expansion into 2020  Medical Devices with the JV  Phonetic  agreement continues to track well  Are there just spending dynamics or more visibility on sort of 100 basis points of underlying margin expansion in 2020 headwinds and tailwinds we should be thinking about  Thanks so much Joseph J  Wolk    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial OfficerYeah  I don t know Chris  if you want to add something Christopher DelOrefice    Vice President of Investor RelationsI just wanted to amplify in Consumer just examples of that TYLENOL and NEUTROGENA for the full year this past year  NEUTROGENA at 6  growth TYLENOL 9  growth  just to build on what you were sharing on consumer Joseph J  Wolk    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial OfficerRight  OK  Thanks  Chris  With respect to margin expansion  David  I think we would look to certainly manufacturing capabilities and improving our productivity there  I would point to the consumer SKU rationalization  the design behind that is specifically to improve profitability and then we ll continue to look at other opportunities for enabling functions across finance  HR  information technology and procurement to get savings  So we think we re in pretty good shape to deliver that for 2020 Christopher DelOrefice    Vice President of Investor RelationsGreat  Thanks  David  Appreciate the questions  Rob  Next question please OperatorYour next question comes from Kristen Stewart with Barclays Kristen Stewart    Barclays    AnalystHi  thanks for taking my question  Just one clarification  The extra week with the SKU rationalization  it s a net impact overall  it s 50 to a 100 to the top line  is that correct Joseph J  Wolk    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial OfficerThat s correct  Kristen Kristen Stewart    Barclays    AnalystOkay  perfect  Just want to clarify that  And then just a big picture  I guess  question  Just on portfolio and capital allocation  I know you had mentioned just in terms of models need to take into consideration with the share count  no further share repurchase activity  you guys are in a pretty good position  Obviously from a share    I m sorry  cash flow perspective  generating  20 billion this year  it sounds like your expectation is to pay out the opioid settlement  but I guess  why not get more aggressive from a share repurchase perspective  Just how should we think about capital allocation going forward Alex Gorsky    Chairman  Board of Directors and Chief Executive OfficerHey Kristen  this is Alex  Thank you very much for the question  And look  we re really proud of our strong performance across our businesses  and frankly  as it relates to our capital allocation model this year and we re very confident in it going forward  As we mentioned in the results earlier  if you think about the free cash flow spin off that we had in 2019  I think it s indicative of not only great discipline across our various lines and you see the P L in front of you So overall  it was quite healthy  But it s also important to note that we did that in the context of also continuing to invest in more than 11 acquisitions  about six licensing agreements where we invested almost  7 5 billion just in the course of the year  So  as we talked about in the past  we ll continue to invest in our brands and in research and development at an appropriate rate If you go back over the last four years  I think if you add the numbers up in R D  we ve invested more than  45 billion during that timeframe  and we think that based upon the number of new product launches in our Pharma Medical Device business and our Consumer business that we ve gotten a good return on that  We ve continued to keep a healthy dividend at the same time  We realize how important that is During that same timeframe  four years  it s a pretty similar number to our R D  It s about  40 billion to  45 billion  And of course  after that  we always take a look at value creating acquisitions  And again  during that same timeframe  I think the number comes to about  50 billion that we ve invested Over the past year of note was  you might say  the additional investment that we made in Auris and we think combining that with the later buyout that we did with the Verb  with Verb and Verily is the right thing  If you think ahead in Medical Devices  there are probably few things that are going to represent a more secular shift in that domain than the shift into digital and robotic surgery  And bringing those together we think creates a very exciting opportunity for us But we also continue to do value creating tuck in opportunities as well in our Pharmaceutical businesses  We just talked about the end of the year  we brought in two really exciting compounds bermekimab in particular in both AS as well as other conditions  We think it represents a great opportunity and it s certainly in an area where we ve got a lot of capability and a lot of expertise And finally  we talk about share repurchases  And I think we ve demonstrated over the last four or five years that we ll certainly employee share repurchases when we think that we re undervalued particularly in a significant way  And again  I think an outcome of the way that we manage our overall P L  it means that we can do these things simultaneously  It s not necessarily in order and we continue to    we expect to continue that strategy going forward Kristen Stewart    Barclays    AnalystOkay  great  Phonetic  Joseph J  Wolk    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial OfficerYeah  Kristen  Just a quick comment and thanks for noticing the comments around share count  I have to tip my hat and complement the investment community because when we go through the consensus P L  the income in terms of absolute dollars was almost spot on  It was the yearly close in fact  and then really the disconnect came in the form of share count where the average share count used in consensus was about 14 million shares less  which translates to about  0 05 or  0 06 So we thought we were very much in line with what consensus expectations were  and while we don t provide guidance assuming any share repurchase that s not currently authorized  It seems that a few analysts may have made that assumption Kristen Stewart    Barclays    AnalystOkay  perfect  Thank so much Christopher DelOrefice    Vice President of Investor RelationsGreat  thank you Kristen  Rob  next question please OperatorNext question is from the line of Josh Jennings with Cowen Josh Jennings    Cowen   Company    AnalystHi  good morning  Thanks for taking the questions  First is on robotics  and you clearly have put a stake in the ground and with investments pursuing leadership in digital surgery ecosystem  I just wanted to see if    and I understand we re going to get a big update at the Med Device day in May  but if you could whet our appetite at all today just give any updates on progress in the Auris launch  the timelines for Orthotaxy  and then any indications that you see where robotics is not in play today that could come into play over the next three to five years within your portfolio And then  second question is just for Joe and Alex  I guess it s just on  you know the other income line has been a focus  I think the concerns are where that could fall off next year or in the out years and you talk about your process for portfolio review and then pruning I mean the underperforming assets or assets don t fit under your roof If you could just talk about that process and how regiment it is  Is there a formula  Is there 1  of the portfolio that gets pruned every year or is it just strategic and opportunistic annually  Thanks for taking the questions and I apologize for the background noise Alex Gorsky    Chairman  Board of Directors and Chief Executive OfficerHey Josh  thank you very much for the question  And look  I am really glad that you mentioned robotics and digital in terms of an entire platform for us because of course that s exactly what it is  And let s start first with our acquisition of Auris Health  And overall what we would say  it s off to a great start where we couldn t be more thrilled to have the robotics pioneer and former CEO Fred Moll and his team at J J The Monarch Platform is off to a very good start  It s going to play a critical role in our lung cancer initiative  And when you just look at the science and the technology and what it can do with the distal parts of the lung and what it brings in terms of potentially ablation leveraging it with our NeuWave technology And even longer term  having the potential to dispense oncolytic viruses in treating cancer in very new and unique ways is exciting  Physicians can perform more than 2000 bronchoscopy procedures with the Monarch Platform and we re really pleased with what we re seeing with it Second  you saw our announcement on Verb and we think combining Auris and Verb really helps ensure that we have a very strong role in the next generation of the digital surgery platform and ongoing development  Our teams are working now together in a really comprehensive way  We do look     sorry for that feedback  But we do look at this as a platform that is something that will be in place for the next several decades  Therefore  it s really important that we step through this in the right way And what I would say is  the early results from the collaboration and the partnership that we re seeing between these teams is very encouraging and that s why we re excited to give you this preview that Joe mentioned on May 13th in New York because we think it will provide very clear  transparent kind of tangible evidence of not only the machines  but also the digital platform component of this as well Next  we re really excited about the progress that s being made with VELYS in our orthopedics robotics platform as well  It s an exciting technology  We think that it s going to offer a portable low cost system that s easy to use  will improve accuracy  It also is a nice combination to ensure if the surgeon remains intimately involved  And if we look at the training and technical support  it s something that will be easily coordinated between ORs and surgeon So we re progressing toward a mid year 2020 regulatory submission for this  So really if you just step back and you think about what we have going with Auris and Monarch  if you think about the plans now that we have in place with VELYS in orthopaedics  and then longer term  as we bring out that next generation of digital and robotics platform more broadly across surgery  we re very excited about it Joseph J  Wolk    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial OfficerAnd  Josh  to address your question regarding the management of our portfolio  so I would say it s rigorous  it s not formulaic though  So we meet as a management team and executive committee monthly on what additions or deletions from our portfolio makes sense  And that    and makes sense probably should be defined in terms of we have aspirations in all the markets we play in to be either number one or number two in that space with the promise of bringing better solutions in that space to patients and consumers across the globe We have plans in place for all of our businesses to do that  But after a period of time when those plans don t come to fruition  we ll assess other alternatives  I would say under Alex s leadership  we ve gotten very disciplined in this this rigor and that s proved to be pretty productive  I think  in terms of how we ve been able to take underperforming businesses  turn that into gains and reinvest back in businesses in areas that we think we ve got a differentiated right to win Christopher DelOrefice    Vice President of Investor RelationsThanks Josh  Appreciate the questions  Rob  Next question please OperatorYour next question is from Matt Miksic with Credit Suisse Matt Miksic    Credit Suisse    AnalystHi  thanks for taking the question  So  I just had one follow up on one of your business lines in Med Devices  In orthopedics clearly  it looks like you were able to deliver a pretty solid improvement in knees in the U S  and just was wondering if you d be willing to offer any color on the spine growth within the sort spine and other category  I think which parts of that were    what are the drivers of the decline  And then I had one follow up if I could for Alex on digital health Alex Gorsky    Chairman  Board of Directors and Chief Executive OfficerSo  thanks for the question  Matt  Good to speak with you  So  we are very proud of the Knees performance  If you look  that was declining business in 2018  We ve had almost a two point improvement there  So the team has done a very nice job We have ATTUNE  both the primary as well as the Revision platform available for patients  We ve also made an entry into the Cementless side of the business  which as you know  is the fastest growing piece of that business  And  as Alex mentioned  we look forward to what VELYS could do on the horizon With respect to spine  I think you have to take into account the impact of 2018 U S  rebate adjustment which impacted comparative growth  about 250 basis points  If you look at the growth in the U S   it was probably about half of the decline of what you saw based on that comparison  We continue to see pretty good growth outside the U S   specifically in Asia Pacific  I don t know Chris  if there is any other commentary in spine other   Christopher DelOrefice    Vice President of Investor RelationsYeah  Matt  I would just say  if you adjust for that  I would say the business has stabilized at low single digit declines  Where we re seeing success is where we have new innovation in particular in degenerative spine with our 3D Cage and our VIPER PRIME systems  I think the next level of improvements will come from SYMPHONY System in posterior cervical which was launched later this year  So we really didn t get that benefit in this year at all and we ll expect to see that continued improvement through next year and beyond Matt Miksic    Credit Suisse    AnalystThat s great  And then just a follow up  Appreciate the update and overview on the robotic surgery strategy  Alex  But I guess one of the things that we ve noticed is just how quickly    and I realize it s sort of a buzzwordy term and we see it in a lot of magazines  but artificial intelligence in digital health  for whatever reason implementation and you know innovation  but it seems to be moving perhaps the fastest of the categories of digital surgery and digital health Just wondering    one of your competitors has partnered with a smaller innovator in that space around stroke  I m sure you re watching it  I m sure you re making investments and looking at it  Just curious if you could give us an update or a preview  perhaps of which you ll talk about in the spring Alex Gorsky    Chairman  Board of Directors and Chief Executive OfficerSure  Thanks again for the question  Matt  Look I    there are a few areas across our different innovation or technology platforms that are not being touched by some of this new technology  whether it s AI whether it s ML  whether it s digital  whether it s the cloud  I mean if you think about just our Pharmaceutical portfolio  for example  and you talk to Paul Stoffels or Mathai Mammen or Bill Hait  I think what they would tell you is one of the most important areas supporting that is our data sciences capabilities and the insights that we can gain from reviewing these large datasets and coming and developing much better insights frankly is helping    lead us to a much faster and more productive identification of new targets And it certainly is helping us when we apply those same skills and capabilities of the clinical development programs as you work with hospitals and large medical systems and you can review medical health records  for example  in a much more detailed way in terms of patient selection and tracking through development  So we re certainly excited about there As it relates to Medical Devices  we ve been  I think  very consistent in sharing our thinking that again this next generation is certainly about the robotics component that helps facilitate perhaps having more consistency in an exact procedure  perhaps getting into a tighter space  having better access  But we think longer term  the digital AI component of that in terms of helping preoperatively in developing a very detailed plan even being applied intraoperatively in terms of additional guidance systems And by the way  then that can be    not only to help a surgeon get to a particular area but it could also be to help him or her stay away from areas that may and could cause a problem  And so    and then of course  how that information can be utilized by large healthcare systems to really ensure that they ve got the most effective and efficient and value added healthcare delivery program is in place  we think will be more important than ever So hence our reason for partnering with Verb and Verily and Alphabet in building those capabilities and again it s something that more broadly across Johnson   Johnson we re spending a lot of time thinking about how all those capabilities are going to become more and more a part of our    of our doing business of our doing research and development across each one of our sectors Christopher DelOrefice    Vice President of Investor RelationsThanks  Matt  Appreciate the questions Matt Miksic    Credit Suisse    AnalystThank you Christopher DelOrefice    Vice President of Investor RelationsRob  Next question please OperatorYour next question is from Danielle Antalffy with SVB Leerink Danielle Antalffy    SVB Leerink    AnalystHey  good morning guys  Thanks so much for taking the question  Just wanted to talk a little bit more about Medical Devices  specifically you guys saw a pretty strong sales growth acceleration on an operational adjusted basis this year  How do we think about the next year  I know Ashley has said in the past  it s not linear quarterly  But I suspect we should be looking for another uptick  Can you help talk about that and what specifically will be the drivers in 2020 of that Alex Gorsky    Chairman  Board of Directors and Chief Executive OfficerSure Danielle  thank you very much for the question  Look we re  again  we re really proud of the progress that Ashley and her team has made over the last several years  Joe took you through the improvement from 2017 to  18 to 2019 and we certainly expect that trajectory to continue in the coming years  If I just kind of zero down for a moment though on 2019  we saw first half growth of about 3 8  and we saw growth in the second half at 4   And while there is a bit of lumpiness in the quarters  consistent with Ashley s comments and look we re still taking a look at Q4  We think that the timing of the holidays and a few other things  I think you always have to be careful what you attribute But if you just look at the number of days  between some of those we think that that could potentially have had an impact  but it really doesn t change the overall trend of accelerated growth in second half versus first half  Now if we look at our business  it s really being driven by a number of factors  In our surgery business  what you re seeing is strong performance in areas like electrophysiology  another 14  growth in this quarter with great new technology  We expect a continuous launch in the coming year as well with new products You also saw good performance in our Energy business  so just about 3  growth and biosurgery coming in at about 4  growth  We think one of the growth drivers  frankly is just overcoming our supply issue in 2020 that probably cut our biosurgery growth rate and half  especially in the latter part of the year  So we think once we work our way through that that s going to be a growth driver for us Our circular stapler launch is also going well  We re going to lap the recall as well that we had in the past year  So we think those are definitely drivers in our core surgery business  If we look at orthopaedics  here too we ve seen the steady cadence of improvement  Our knee business ATTUNE  the launch of the Cementless  the Revision is going very well  And you think about it  we ve turn that from being down almost 0 5  to 1  to growing at 1 4  in this quarter  which again shows physicians increasing confidence in that platform and we re starting to see an uptick again in ATTUNE primaries  And so we re really pleased to see that And then  of course our Hip performance coming in at over 4   Strong trauma at about 2 5   We think is pretty consistent with the market  Chris addressed some of the issues in spine and how we see that moving forward  And then of course there s Vision Care and I think what we see in Vision Care is fundamentally strong performance in contact lens  You saw about 3  growth overall in our contact lens business  But what s important to note there is we had 9  growth in the United States So the transition lens  the astig lens  daily disposables continue to go well  Frankly  we ve been disappointed in some of our surgical performance  particularly in the U S  We ve got plans in place to address that  If you look at the ongoing rollout that we re going to have with the TECNIS and the Symphony and the synergy  we re very optimistic that it s going to make us more competitive  not only in the astig area  but really across that entire platform So we re confident that that s going to lead to continued growth trends as we go through 2020 and certainly setting ourselves up for even continued growth beyond that as well Danielle Antalffy    SVB Leerink    AnalystThank you so much Christopher DelOrefice    Vice President of Investor RelationsThanks Danielle  Appreciate it  Rob  next question please OperatorThe next question is from Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs Terence Flynn    Goldman Sachs    AnalystHi  good morning  Thanks for taking the questions  Maybe just two from me  You guys presented additional data at ASH from your BCMA CAR T program in myeloma and recently got breakthrough designation  are planning to file for approval later this year  I would love your initial thoughts on overcoming some of the hurdles faced by other CAR T drugs  And longer term where you see this drug playing a role in the treatment paradigm The second question relates to the FDA announcement of a meeting next month on testing methods for asbestos and talc  I was just wondering if the company is participating and then what you think the key issues are that are going to be discussed there  Thank you Alex Gorsky    Chairman  Board of Directors and Chief Executive OfficerSure Terence  thank you very much  Let me take the first one regarding the CAR T data at ASH  As I m sure you saw when we released the data we were very excited when we saw those results  And again here too  I think it s maybe important to just step back and think about the steps that our team has taken over the last several years regarding CAR T therapy And when you look at the different development programs that are out there  how we were able to support or source this from Legend  The way that we were able to accelerate the development timelines  the ongoing great work that our supply chain is doing as well to ensure that we ve got the strong integrity of that supply chain  the dependability that s put in place  We re really proud of the progress they made I think the results that we shared at ASH demonstrate our increasing confidence  And by the way  we think this is great news for patients  particularly those who have failed multiple other treatment lines in a very difficult to treat condition like multiple myeloma  And as we think about it going forward  look we think that this is truly an opportunity to transform the way patients are treated in this space  We ve got a lot of confidence in our reimbursement teams  I think we demonstrated in other areas that we can work with payers in a very collaborative way We re also innovative  not only in the products that we re bringing  but frankly in the reimbursement programs that we introduced as well  And we intend to work just that way with payers and providers  both in the United States  but also abroad ultimately to make sure that this therapy is available for patients  they can get access to it and that it s not only as effective as the data that you    that we saw at ASH  but it s also cost effective to the overall healthcare system  Joe  did you want to   Joseph J  Wolk    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial OfficerSure  And Terence  with respect to the meeting  I believe it s next month  February 4th  regarding testing methods around talc  We certainly welcome any discussion around the safety and efficacy of the product  specifically  We will not be active participants at that meeting  However  I can say that our current internal testing methods exceed that of current FDA standards for cosmetic talc Terence Flynn    Goldman Sachs    AnalystGreatChristopher DelOrefice    Vice President of Investor RelationsThank you  Terence  Appreciate the questions  Rob  we have time for one last question OperatorYes  that last question will be coming from Louise Chen with Cantor Fitzgerald Louise Chen    Cantor Fitzgerald    AnalystHi  thanks for taking my questions here  So my first question for you is  what your view on M A is this year and what areas you re most interested in  Is it Pharma  Consumer or Devices or all the above  And then my second question is  how optimistic are you regarding a universal settlement for opioids  Thank you Joseph J  Wolk    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial OfficerOkay  Let me take the first part of that  Louise  Thank a lot for the question  Look  I think we demonstrated in 2019  as I mentioned earlier  that we remained active really across all three areas  I think we did 11 acquisitions  six licensing agreements and putting more than  7 billion worth of capital to work  We have continued  I think  our pattern of tuck in acquisitions where we get new technologies as you saw that we did with both XBiotech and other opportunities in our Pharmaceutical business We would expect to continue that  We also did a    had a fair amount of activity in our Medical Device Group led by Auris that we did earlier in the year  And then  in our consumer group of course that was led by DR  CI LABO which also gave us a great toehold  you might say  into the premium beauty segment  particularly in Asia  but with plans to expand that into the United States So we ll be looking across all three of our segments  But we would expect there to be an ongoing cadence of M A activity in those different areas Alex Gorsky    Chairman  Board of Directors and Chief Executive OfficerAnd Louise  with respect to the opioid settlement  So we continue to work with the Negotiating Committee of the State Attorney General s to finalize the agreement in principle  I would say  we remain optimistic and confident that the agreement is moving forward  but certainly can t predict when that agreement in principle will be finalized  So we ll continue to monitor that  engage as needed and hopefully come to a resolution Christopher DelOrefice    Vice President of Investor RelationsThanks Louise  appreciate it  And thanks to everyone for your questions and continued interest in our Company  Apologies to those we couldn t get to because of time but don t hesitate to reach out to the Investor Relations team as needed I ll now turn the call back to Alex just for some closing comments Alex Gorsky    Chairman  Board of Directors and Chief Executive OfficerWell  thank you everybody for your ongoing support across 2019  As we mentioned earlier  we re very proud of our strong performance  but we re even more excited and more confident about what the prospects hold for 2020 and beyond I think we had a chance to review a lot of the opportunities that lie in front of us and we look forward to continuing to keep you updated throughout the year as we progress through our plan  So thank you very much everybody and have a great day

197572,419088,JNJ,Better Buy  AbbVie vs  Johnson   Johnson,news,"AbbVie  NYSE ABBV  and Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  are two of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world  However  big doesn t mean buy  and both of these juggernauts currently face headwinds that may scare many investors away  AbbVie is dealing with Humira s declining international sales caused by competition from biosimilars in Europe 
Johnson   Johnson is facing thousands of different product liability lawsuits  New Mexico just filed a lawsuit against Johnson   Johnson alleging that the company s claims about the safety of its baby powder were misleading  In October  Johnson   Johnson settled a lawsuit for  10 million with two Ohio counties that removed the company from the first federal lawsuit against opioid manufacturers  In addition to mounting legal troubles  Johnson   Johnson s competitive advantage is under pressure 
With that said  these pharma giants are hardly dead in the water  and there are several good reasons to consider purchasing shares of each  But which of the two should you buy today  Let s dig in a little deeper and find out  
The case for AbbVie
Despite Humira s declining prospects in Europe  the drug is still racking up strong    and growing    sales in the U S  During the third quarter  U S  sales of Humira were  3 9 billion  a 9 6  increase year over year  In other words  Humira is still contributing significantly to AbbVie s top line  and according to the research firm EvaluatePharma  Humira will remain the top selling drug in the world until 2024  In the meantime  AbbVie can look for other products to replace its crown jewel 

The company boasts several drugs with fast growing sales  Most notably  cancer drugs Imbruvica and Venclexta have combined sales for the third quarter of  1 5 billion  a 38  increase compared to the prior year quarter  Further  Humira made a big move last year when it acquired Allergan  NYSE AGN  in a cash and stock deal valued at  63 billion 
This acquisition will help AbbVie become a leader in the medical aesthetic market and further diversify its product line  Finally  AbbVie is a great dividend stock  The company offers a dividend yield of 5 3   and its quarterly dividend payout has increased by 141  over the past five years  For all those reasons  AbbVie still looks like an attractive stock 
The case for Johnson   Johnson
One of the most attractive features Johnson   Johnson offers investors is its diversification across several business lines within the healthcare sector  There s the company s pharmaceutical business  which boasts several products with blistering sales growth  For instance  Johnson   Johnson s plaque psoriasis drug Stelara recorded sales of  1 7 billion during the third quarter  30  higher than the same quarter the prior year  Also  sales of Tremfya  a treatment for moderate to severe psoriasis  were  290 million  representing a 69  year over year increase  
While sales of many of the company s drugs are declining    such as Remicade  which saw its sales for the third quarter decline by 17 6  year over year to  1 1 billion    Johnson   Johnson has enough products to pick up the slack  Revenue from Johnson   Johnson s pharmaceuticals segment during the third quarter was  10 9 billion  a 5 1  year over year increase  Johnson   Johnson s pharmaceutical segment generates the bulk of its revenue  about 52  during the third quarter   but the company also has its consumer and medical devices segments to fall back on 
During the third quarter  revenue from Johnson   Johnson s consumer business  which offers over the counter medical products  was  3 5 billion and increased by 1 6   while its medical devices segment recorded a revenue figure of  6 4 billion  a 3 1  year over year decrease 
Johnson   Johnson is also a dream come true for income seeking investors  The company offers a 2 6  dividend yield and has raised its dividends every year for 57 years in a row  Johnson   Johnson will likely remain a top player in the healthcare sector for many years to come  Given its diversified business and its secure dividends  the company is worth serious consideration  
Profitability and valuation 
During the third quarter  AbbVie posted net earnings of  1 9 billion  a 31 4  decrease year over year  the company also recorded an earnings per share  EPS  of  1 26  down from  1 81 compared to the year ago period  By comparison  Johnson   Johnson s net earnings were  1 8 billion  a 55 4  decrease compared to the prior year quarter  and its EPS was  0 66  down by 54  year over year  
With both companies posting less than stellar bottom lines  let s turn to their respective price to earnings  PE  and price to earnings growth  PEG  ratios  In this department  AbbVie s 9 27 forward P E  and its 2 72 PEG compares favorably to Johnson   Johnson s 16 41 forward P E and 2 91 PEG  
The verdict 
Johnson   Johnson s shares rose by 13  last year  which isn t outstanding considering the S P 500 gained almost 30  during 2019  but it is still better than AbbVie s stock  which slid by 3 96   
I think Johnson   Johnson is a better buy today  and here s why  Johnson   Johnson isn t likely to produce double digits top line growth routinely  but the company s diversified business is a major strength that can help keep the company afloat even in times of economic downturns  Also  Johnson   Johnson s dividend is one of the most secure out there 
While the company is facing some legal issues  this is nothing new for Johnson   Johson which has faced scores of lawsuits before  and the company has always managed to come out of them in one piece  In other words  Johnson   Johnson s current wave of lawsuits is unlikely to make a serious dent in the company s long term thesis  if past history is any indication  
By contrast  AbbVie s acquisition of Allergan has yet to close  and there s still some uncertainty as to how this move will affect the company s financial performance in the future  With its top selling product gradually losing more and more steam over the next few years  AbbVie has yet to show that other products will fill Humira s shoes definitively  With its future still being a bit murky  I think AbbVie loses this matchup ",2020-01-24,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pmfom,2067209

The company announced fourth quarter adjusted earnings of  1 88 a share for the quarter  1c ahead of forecasts  but reported earnings tumbled by 54  to only 66c  Revenue also fell short of forecasts slightly at  20 75 billion 

EPS were down from  1 97 a year ago  while revenue edged up from  20 39 billion  
The company now expects underlying earnings of a range between  8 62 and  8 67 for 2019  up from a range of  8 53  8 63 previously  Chief executive Alex Gorsky pointed to  underlying growth in Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices  as well as continued optimization in our Consumer business  as the reasons 
However  J J warned that it can t give forecasts for GAAP line items such as net profit because it is  unable to predict with reasonable certainty the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings  unusual gains and losses  acquisition related expenses and purchase accounting fair value adjustments without unreasonable effort  

The outlook still threatens to be a drag on its performance in 2020  according to Investing com analyst Haris Anwar 
 It s tough for investors to focus on J J s fundamentals when the company is facing thousands of lawsuits in the U S  over product safety and marketing practices for a range of products including baby powder and opioids   Anwar said   In addition to these legal issues  there is a good amount of political uncertainty related to the U S  presidential election that makes healthcare stocks a risky trade in 2020

The original fine was awarded by a jury to a plaintiff who experienced unwanted side effects from the company s Risperdal medication  which is used to treat people with schizophrenia  bipolar disorder  and it also helps people with autism  The plaintiff in the case  Nicholas Murray  began taking the medication as a child to treat behaviors related to autism  but the drug caused the young man to grow breasts    a condition called gynecomastia 
The punitive damages were in addition to a  680 000 compensatory award the plaintiff would receive  Johnson   Johnson challenged the ruling  and today it learned of the reduction to the punitive fees 

Just one of many problems for J J
Friday s ruling offers some much needed positivity for Johnson   Johnson  as it has been under pressure for the past few years from product liability litigation

197614,419130,JNJ,Is Johnson   Johnson Stock a Buy ,news,"Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  didn t have a great year in 2019  Sure  the stock was up 13   However  that wasn t even half the gain that the S P 500 index delivered last year  J J was bogged down by opioid related litigation  more worries that its talc based products contain asbestos  and anemic growth 
But it s not a good idea to base an opinion about any stock on one problematic year  especially the stock of a company that s been in business for more than 130 years  Is Johnson   Johnson stock a buy now  The answer  It depends 

So so growth
Investors who prefer strong growth probably won t be attracted to Johnson   Johnson  Wall Street analysts project the company s earnings will grow by an average of less than 6  annually over the next five years  Growth oriented investors can certainly find quality stocks that deliver much higher growth than that 
One problem for J J is the continued decline in sales for Remicade  It wasn t too long ago that the immunology drug ranked as the company s top selling product  With biosimilar rivals on the market  though  J J can t depend on its former star  But Remicade isn t the only problem spot  Sales for cancer drug Zytiga are also sinking  Several other drugs in J J s lineup aren t performing very well  including diabetes drug Invokana 
On a positive note  the company still claims multiple big winners  Sales growth for immunology drugs Stelara  Simponi  and Tremfya are offsetting the tanking sales for Remicade  J J s cancer drugs Imbruvica  which it comarkets with AbbVie  and Darzalex continue to enjoy strong momentum  The company also has another potential blockbuster of the future that s just getting started with depression drug Spravato 
Johnson   Johnson s pharmaceutical segment remains its biggest source of growth  but what about its other segments  The company s consumer unit is at best treading water  However  net of the negative impact of divestitures  J J s medical device segment is delivering modest revenue growth  Still  the overall story for the company is likely to be only so so growth over the next several years 
A reasonable valuation
Bargain hunters probably won t jump up and down over Johnson   Johnson s valuation  but some might think that the stock is priced at a relatively attractive level  Shares currently trade at 16 times expected earnings  That s well below J J s historical price to earnings  P E  level 
On the other hand  Johnson   Johnson s valuation doesn t look as attractive when compared to some of its peers  Merck  for example  has considerably better growth prospects than J J does but its forward earnings multiple is only a little higher 
My view is that Johnson   Johnson claims a reasonable valuation at current levels  But without the promise of great growth  a reasonable valuation might not be enough to justify the stock as a buy 
The main reason to buy J J
However  there is one reason that I think does make Johnson   Johnson stock a buy  its dividend  Growth investors and value investors might turn up their noses at the stock  but income seeking investors should really like J J 
Investors buy dividend stocks because they want steady and reliable dividend payouts  Johnson   Johnson s dividend currently yields 2 6   but what s even more appealing is the company s track record  J J has increased its dividend for 57 consecutive years 
If you re looking for income  that s the kind of history you like to see  It also helps that J J is well diversified across the healthcare space and operates more than 260 different businesses  This gives the company a broad revenue base that allows it to keep those dividends flowing    and growing ",2020-01-05,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pdt94,2052532
197615,419131,JNJ,Why Johnson   Johnson Will Survive its Latest Litigation Wave,news,"Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  has long been plagued with lawsuits alleging its talcum products contain the cancer causing substance asbestos  Unluckily for Johnson   Johnson  these allegations are a series in a long line of legal troubles  Just in October 2019  Johnson   Johnson was directed to pay  8 billion in damages to plaintiffs for pressuring medical providers to prescribe Risperdal to patients  
At the time of this article  Johnson   Johnson is embroiled in a stream of over 16 000 asbestos related legal actions filed by enraged consumers  The stakes were raised even higher when just two days into the New Year  the state of New Mexico filed a civil claim against Johnson   Johnson for allegedly deceiving users regarding the safety of its talc products  This is one of the first times ever that an asbestos lawsuit has been filed by a state  rather than a person  against a pharmaceutical manufacturer  

Needless to stay  the steady stream of lawsuits pummeling Johnson   Johnson has some investors concerned  But  Johnson and Johnson has seen considerably positive returns over the past year  Here s why Johnson   Johnson will likely be able to weather this storm in the months ahead  
Johnson   Johnson showed healthy earnings growth in the third quarter
In Johnson   Johnson s Q3 report  released in October 2019  the company showed a strong year to year revenue boost of 1 9  with sales totaling more than  20 billion  Factoring out certain currency irregularities  the company experienced an operational growth rate of 3 2 percent on a year over year basis  Earnings per share also exceeded analyst s projections in Q3  with an adjusted value of  2 12  
A company s cash flow is also an excellent measurement of the valuation and risk attached to a particular stock  At the close of the Q3  Johnson   Johnson had produced a year to date free cash flow of just under  20 billion  Both Johnson   Johnson s earnings report and cash flow are indicative of the company s strong overall financial health  
Johnson   Johnson will release its Q4 earnings on January 22  at which point stockholders should take a close look to assess whether its operations continue to forecast positive performance and guidance in the new year  
Johnson   Johnson s global footprint continues to expand 
Despite the fact that the lion s share of Johnson   Johnson s sales is U S  based  the company continues to expand its worldwide footprint  Its Q3 report announced that consumer product earnings increased by 3 3  year over year  with worldwide revenue growth of 3 2  
The company s pharmaceutical sector grew by a monumental 6 4   with one of the most notable contenders being the plaque psoriasis drug Tremfya  In the final week of December  China put its stamp of approval on imports of Tremfya into the country  which will almost certainly lead to a healthy spike in Johnson   Johnson s gross sales and net income  
It s tough to beat Johnson   Johnson s dividend payout
One of the primary reasons Johnson   Johnson stock has been so attractive to investors in the past is its excellent dividends  The current 2 65  dividend rate is certainly less than other stocks on the market  but Johnson   Johnson s consistent pattern of increasing its dividend payout year to year is more than a little attractive to long term investors  
For example  if you were to invest  20 000 in Johnson   Johnson stock today  you d receive  530 annually in dividends  Assuming Johnson   Johnson continues its long standing pattern of annually increasing its dividends  that figure would only grow  
Even amid growing consumer claims  Johnson   Johnson has paid out  9 8 billion of its nearly  20 billion in free cash flow over the past year  All things considered  it appears that litigation likely won t impact investor dividends anytime soon 
The bottom line
Despite the fact that Johnson   Johnson has been slapped with over 100 000 lawsuits in recent years  its overall growth has been steady  albeit slow  A huge factor in Johnson   Johnson s resilience despite an eroding moat has been its clear diversification strategy  With its hands in everything from medical devices to pharmaceutical products  Johnson   Johnson has weathered many a legal storm in its time and come through relatively unscathed 
I m not saying investors should disregard the potential impact that future lawsuits could have on the company s top and bottom line    but for now  alarmism seems premature ",2020-01-14,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pi30n,2059598
197616,419132,JNJ,Better Buy  Johnson   Johnson vs  Merck,news,"Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  and Merck   Co   NYSE MRK  are two heavyweights in the pharmaceutical sector  Both companies generate billions in sales and profits and have developed many successful drugs over the years 
However  both underperformed in 2019  Merck s 19  return last year was well above the 13  that Johnson   Johnson produced for its investors  but shares of both companies still fell well shy of the 30  return enjoyed by the S P 500 
Deciding which stock is the better buy today is no easy task  Both offer investors some great opportunities in healthcare  and there s not a whole lot separating the two  Let s take a closer look at the two stocks to see which one has the edge today 
Is J J worth the risk 
By looking at its financials  J J looks to be a solid stock  Sales of  20 billion in each of the last four quarters  accompanied with profits of at least  3 billion during that time  make the stock appear to be a very good buy  The company has even achieved modest growth in its most recent quarter  with sales climbing by 1 9    
Its global reach and wide range of products and services that cover consumer  pharmaceutical  and medical devices  make the stock an appealing option for long term investors as it offers a lot of diversification 

The problem with investing in J J is the danger the stock faces from a legal perspective 
It s already faced multiple lawsuits  with its talc powder issue being one of its more high profile concerns today  In November  the company lost a lawsuit relating to its vaginal mesh products in Australia  Oklahoma also went after J J for the company s role in opioid related deaths in the state   and it won  It sets a troubling precedent for the company  should other states follow suit 
Overall  the stock has good fundamentals today  and it s in a good position to handle these lawsuits with  18 billion in cash on its books and the company continuing to generate positive free cash flow  However  if the fines and lawsuits keep coming  it could put in a dent in not only the company s cash but its image as well 
Merck is a safer option  but it may not be diversified enough
Merck also has strong financials   without the same risks that J J is facing today 
Over the past four quarters  its numbers are a bit more modest  with profits ranging from  1 8 billion to  2 9 billion  and revenue typically hovering around  11 billion to  12 billion  However  it s also avoided the bad press that J J has endured over the years  which could make it a much safer and more predictable investment 
The company got some great news this month from the Food and Drug Administration  FDA  after it approved Keytruda for use in a specific type of bladder cancer for patients who have not had success with other treatment options 
Keytruda is already an important part of Merck s sales  as the cancer fighting drug also treats patients with other types of cancers as well 
In the company s third quarter results released in October  Keytruda s sales were up 63  from the prior year quarter  reaching  3 1 billion  The  1 2 billion increase in the drug s sales from a year ago was the main driver behind the company s overall improvement  as Merck s top line increased by just  1 6 billion during the quarter 
As valuable as Keytruda is  the danger for Merck is that it may be too dependent on this one blockbuster 
Why Merck is the better buy
There s not a lot separating these two stocks  While Merck may be smaller than J J  it s by no means worse for it 
Both stocks have good numbers and both trade at a forward price to earnings ratio of 16  Merck offers slightly better value when factoring in analyst expectations of growth  as its PEG ratio of 1 7 is lower than J J s  which comes in at 2 9  
Merck also offers a slightly higher dividend yield of 2 7   versus the 2 6  that J J pays  While J J has a stronger track record when it comes to increasing dividend payments and is a Dividend Aristocrat  that s not enough to tip the scales in its favor 
Overall  with a slight advantage in valuation and fewer risks facing the company  Merck is the better healthcare stock for investors today ",2020-01-15,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/piaxr,2059866

197633,419149,JNJ, No QE  Vaccine For Coronavirus s Threat To Markets,opinion,"Last week  I asked the question of whether the  correction was over  To wit 

 On a very short term basis  there is a potential for a reflexive bounce  If your  investment duration   or rather your  investment holding period  is very short  there may be a  trading  opportunity for you  

Well  that bounce came hard and fast during the first half of the week  as the S P 500 rebounded off the 50 dma to set new highs on Thursday  






The Good NewsAs noted  the market bounced firmly off the 50 dma and rallied back to new highs on Thursday  While Friday saw a bit of retracement  which isn t surprising given the torrid move early in the week  the  virus correction  was recovered  Importantly  the  buy signal   in the lower panel  was close to registering a  sell signal   The sharp early week rally kept that signal from triggering  which would have confirmed the  sell signal  in the top panel  Historically  when both  sell signals  are triggered  deeper corrections have tended to follow 
The Not So Good NewsPreviously  we discussed that we had taken profits out of portfolios as we were expecting between a 3 5  correction to allow for a better entry point to add equity exposure  While the  virus correction  did encompass a correction of 3   it was too shallow to reverse the rather extreme extension of the market  The rally this past week has reversed the corrective process  and returned the markets to 3 standard deviations above the 200 dma  Furthermore  all daily  weekly  and monthly conditions have returned to more extreme overbought levels as well 






Of course  the reason for the rally was more liquidity from the Federal Reserve  

While the economic impact from the virus is likely to be substantial  traders looked past economic realities  They focused instead on more liquidity being pumped into the markets by both the Fed  and the PBOC  Peoples Bank of China  

 The PBOC decided that instead of unwinding the large liquidity provision  they would double down on it  and that they did in size  The last four weeks have seen China supply over CNY2 trillion  net   into its financial system   something we have never seen anything like before     Zerohedge







But  as I stated  it wasn t just the PBOC  but also the Federal Reserve dumping tremendous amounts of liquidity into the markets which only had one place to go  equities 






While the Fed continues to deny current liquidity interventions are indeed  QE   they have been clearly concerned about the potential of global instability impacting the U S  In their most recent report to Congress  the  coronavirus  made its appearance as the latest threat to the global economic instability  
Do NOT dismiss that last sentence lightly  
Since last October  the Fed has been injecting the financial system with massive quantities of liquidity to fix  short term funding needs   Each time they have tried to slow the rates of funding  the market has declined  so they extended the facility  Initially  the facility was for October tax payments  Then it was extended for the  year end  turn  Then it was extended for April  tax payments   The  coronavirus  will be the next reason to extend the program into June 

Just in case you missed our previous report on this issue  the importance is that this type of funding has not occurred to such a magnitude outside of a financial crisis 






The question you should be asking is   exactly what is going on  
Dollar RallyCurrently  the flood of liquidity has been pulling foreign capital back into U S  Dollars  While the U S  dollar had previously started to breakdown heading into year end  which gave a boost to commodities and oil  Unfortunately  that breakdown has been reversed 
This past week  our analysis warned of the potential for a continued dollar rally  The importance of this rally is that a stronger U S  Dollar is not friendly to commodities  international  and emerging market exposure 






While there has been a good bit of excitement over the last couple of weeks of improving economic data points  it will likely be short lived  Given these data points are both  sentiment surveys  and  lagging  in nature  what they captured was the uptick in commodities seen at the end of 2019 as the dollar weakened on  trade deal  hopes 






What has yet to be captured is the subsequent reversion in the major  economically sensitive  components  While the markets have rallied on news of more liquidity  the impact from the  coronavirus  has only yet started to be felt economically  Even if the virus was cured today  the economic impact will continue to be felt over the rest of this year 
Importantly  the impact on China will be substantially greater  which will undermine any potential positive to the U S  from the  trade deal   That impact will result not only in the form of weaker economic growth in China  but globally as well due to the interlinked supply chains  This is going to manifest itself in weaker earnings and corporate profits  which will continue to make elevated asset prices harder to justify  
As shown in the long term chart below  despite the short term correction  which is barely noticeable  the market remains extremely extended  overbought  and pushing into the top of its long term trading range 
Furthermore  the put call ratio  which warned of the previous correction is once again pushing extreme levels rarely seen from a historical perspective 






The rally this past week serves as a stern reminder that market participants are trained to respond to  Pavlov s Bell   
For the time being  investors have gotten away with overpaying for value  ignoring risk  and chasing yield  Eventually  the party ends  and it always ends in the most brutal of fashions 
This is why it s important to have a process and adhere to it 
Trust The Process







There were quite a few questions about why we were buying into our portfolios this week 
The short answer is  

 Because that is what our process required us to do   
To understand the process  we have to go back  

 With bond yields plummeting this past week  our bond exposures have gotten extremely stretched  The sell off in the market  combined with the  risk off  rotation to bonds  sets the market up for a reflexive bounce  The duration and magnitude of that bounce will be critical as to our next steps in positioning   
A few weeks ago  Shawn Langlois at MarketWatch picked up our article discussing why we were selling positions in our portfolio  To wit 

 Specifically  Roberts raised cash by selling off shares of Apple  NASDAQ AAPL   Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT   United Healthcare  Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ   and Micron  NASDAQ MU   and scaling back overweight holdings in various ETF sector plays  such as the Technology Select Sector SPDR  and the Health Care Select Sector  
While at the time  it seemed like a wrong move  a couple of weeks later  the market sold off  The benefit was the extra cash  and reduced exposure  help limit the downside draw to about 1 3rd of the market decline  
Then  last week  things changed 
Chart updated through Friday






As noted  the market had gotten oversold on a short term basis  which brought the risk reward measures back into better alignment  This is where our process required we add equity exposure back into portfolios  

 The  bullish bias  is not dead as of yet  and investors will be quick to try and  write off  the impact of the  virus   After a decade of  macro events  not stopping the bullish charge  the belief the market is  bulletproof  has become so deeply ingrained into investor mentality it won t be dislodged until it is far too late to matter  
In the ETF Model  we added Financials  XLF  and increased our stake in HealthCare  XLV  with both of those sectors having gotten oversold and bouncing off their respective 50 dma s In the EQUITY Model  we added JP Morgan  JPM  and  Pfizer   NYSE PFE  while increasing our stakes in Abbvie  ABBV   United Healthcare  UNH   and Alerian MLP  AMLP   Importantly  this rebalancing of risk did not dramatically increase our equity exposure  This is because  as noted above  the longer term technical outlook remains  cautious  
Yes  we realize we are very late cycle  we also know that with the Fed  and global Central Banks  still intervening  we must give deference to the  bullish bias   At the moment  the bullish bias remains  and functioned as we predicted last week 
We have no certainty about when  or what will trigger the next bear market  
What we do know is that such an event will likely be far more brutal than most realize due to years of excess risk taking  leverage  and demographics  
However  this is what our process is designed to handle 
The portfolio is managed for risk by adjusting the level of equity exposure relative to market dynamics  return outlooks  and technical deviations from long term means The allocation is managed for risk by balancing positions for relative performance to our benchmark The positions are managed for risk by Employing trailing stop lossesRegularly rebalancing positions back to target weights  taking profits Cutting laggards which aren t performing as expectedMonitoring relative performance and participation
Importantly  notice that everything the process covers is the management against the  risk  of loss  
If we manage against the risk of capital loss  we can safely participate with markets as they rise  When something eventually does goes wrong  the process will systematically close out positions  protecting our investment capital  until that process is complete  Then the process reverses to rebuild exposure when risk reward dynamics are greatly improved  
As long as the process is followed  risk can be controlled  Where the majority of investors go wrong  is by not having a process 
 Hoping  markets will continue higher indefinitely  is not a process 
As we concluded last week 

 We won t know for sure until after the fact  This is why we manage risk in the short term  Managing risk allows us to navigate the  twists and turns  of the market without careening off the cliff  ",2020-02-09,Lance Roberts,https://www.investing.com/analysis/no-qe-vaccine-for-coronaviruss-threat-to-markets-200505881,200505881

197649,419165,JNJ,AstraZeneca shares rise on early U S  approval for leukemia drug,news,"FRANKFURT  Reuters    AstraZeneca  L AZN  shares rose 2 7  on Friday after the British drugmaker won earlier than expected U S  regulatory approval for a leukemia drug  in a challenge to rival AbbVie  N ABBV  
AstraZeneca said late on Thursday that the U S  Food and Drug Administration  FDA  had given its go ahead for the company s Calquence drug to treat chronic lymphocytic leukemia  CLL   one of the most common types of leukemia in adults 
The drug was approved under a new speedy review program in collaboration with drug watchdogs in Canada and Australia  and was also approved to treat small lymphocytic lymphoma  a similar disease 
That will pit the AstraZeneca drug against AbbVie and Johnson   Johnson s  N JNJ  established CLL treatment Imbruvica 
The FDA s green light  which analysts at brokerage Bryan Garnier said came at record speed  adds momentum to Astra s growing cancer drug business with brands including Tagrisso and Imfinzi 
 Physicians are used to Imbruvica and we do not expect a rapid and massive shift towards Calquence but we do see it progressively taking market share from the leader   Bryan Garnier analysts said  adding that FDA tests had showed Calquence performed well in terms of side effects 
Astra shares were up 2 1  at 1415 GMT  outperforming a 0 7  gain in the STOXX Europe 600 Health Care  SXDP  index 
Astra shares have risen 28  this year  boosted by revenue growth from new drugs 
Average analyst forecasts point to 2024 Calquence sales of almost  1 5 billion  up from a projected  160 million this year  according to Refinitiv data

197650,419166,JNJ,J J  JNJ  Plans To Develop Vaccine For New Coronavirus ,opinion,"Johnson   Johnson   NYSE JNJ   announced its interest in developing a vaccine with multi pronged approach to address the current novel coronavirus  2019 nCoV  outbreak  The company has initiated the process to identify compounds with antiviral activity against 2019 nCoV and develop a vaccine candidate 
The company will use Janssen s technologies  which will help it to rapidly upscale production of the optimal vaccine candidate  These technologies have already been used to develop vaccine candidates for other virus caused infections namely Ebola  HIV and for respiratory syncytial virus  a common respiratory virus  The company will also review previously tested medicines for coronavirus infections like SARS and MERS to determine their efficacy in preventing the 2019 nCoV infection 
Moreover  the company is also donating its HIV medication  Prezcobix  to several China based entities engaged in developing a 2019 nCoV vaccine  Prezcobix includes a protease inhibitor   PI   as its component and PI has shown favorable clinical response against SARS 
Meanwhile  several other large and small pharma companies are working on developing a vaccine for fighting the coronavirus outbreak  A Bloomberg  stated that AbbVie s   NYSE ABBV   HIV drug  Kaletra  has been recommended for treating 2019 nCoV infection by a Chinese authority  The drug has previous history of clinical response against SARS 
Moreover  Gilead   NASDAQ GILD   is planning to develop its failed Ebola vaccine as a 2019 nCoV vaccine  per a CNBC   Smaller biotechs like Moderna   NASDAQ MRNA   and Inovio Pharmaceuticals have received grant from CEPI  a public private nonprofit organization  to develop a similar vaccine 
The 2019 nCOV infection is spreading rapidly in China with latest data showing nearly 6 000 infections and almost 130 deaths  With several large cap pharma companies showing interest and promising to provide support to fight the infection  development of vaccines may be accelerated 
However  we note that development of an effective vaccine may take some time as clinical studies are required to test its efficacy in humans  Meanwhile  stocks of some small biotechs  which had rallied last week on the coronavirus news  declined on Jan 29 following J J s interest  Entry of large cap players with significant funds and strong expertise may impact the potential of small biotechs 
J J s stock has risen 13 1  in the past year compared with an increase of 12 1  recorded by the  

 
In a separate press release  J J announced that the European Commission   EC   has granted marketing authorization to its new prostate cancer drug Erleada for an expanded patient population 
With the latest approval  Erleada will be available in Europe to treat patients with metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer  also known as metastatic castration sensitive prostate cancer  in combination with androgen deprivation therapy Erleada is already approved in the EU for the treatment of men with non metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer

197670,419186,JNJ,Exclusive  J J s own expert  working for FDA  found asbestos in Baby Powder,news,"By Chad Terhune and Lisa Girion  Reuters    Ever since Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  disclosed this month that a government test had turned up asbestos in its Baby Powder  the company has attacked the validity of the result  On Tuesday  for example  J J announced that other labs it hired ultimately found no asbestos in samples from the bottle tested by the U S  Food and Drug Administration or from the same production lot  In challenging the FDA s finding  however  the healthcare giant is casting doubt on one of its own experts  The private Maryland lab that found asbestos in Baby Powder under a contract with the FDA is run by a paid expert witness for J J  Andreas Saldivar  laboratory director of AMA Analytical Services Inc  has served as a litigation expert on several occasions for J J since 2017 in its defense against plaintiffs  claims that asbestos in talc caused their cancers  He testified in a May 2018 deposition that testing he did in 2010 for the FDA showed no evidence of asbestos in Johnson s Baby Powder  helping to bolster the company s argument that its iconic brand is safe  Saldivar s lab began testing cosmetic talc products for the FDA again this year  and in September it found asbestos in an unmarked sample that the FDA later identified as Johnson s Baby Powder   I have never heard of anything like this   said Richard Ausness  a University of Kentucky law professor who specializes in product liability  referring to Saldivar s dual roles   This is bad news for J J  The plaintiffs are clearly going to say this lab director worked for J J for years  and he found asbestos so there must be asbestos there   J J s challenge now is to discredit the single test result as erroneous without undermining the reputation and track record of its expert witness  Ausness said   J J could try to frame it as not so much this lab director is unreliable or incompetent  but false positives do happen and additional tests are called for   Ausness said  The company appeared to do just that on Tuesday  saying testing done by other laboratories J J hired had found no asbestos in the same bottle of Baby Powder tested by Saldivar for the FDA  nor in the lot of Baby Powder recalled as a result of Saldivar s finding  In an interview with Reuters on Tuesday  FDA officials said they stood by the AMA lab and its results  They also said they were not surprised by J J s findings because contaminants are not uniformly dispersed throughout talc and different testing methods can yield varying results  The company  would say the product is free of asbestos based on their testing  and we would say the opposite for that sample   said Steve Musser  deputy director for scientific operations in FDA s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition  Plaintiffs  attorneys said Saldivar s finding for the FDA could be detrimental to J J s defense in court  The company faces lawsuits from more than 16 000 people alleging that asbestos in its powders caused cancer  The impact was immediate in one courtroom  Hours after J J disclosed the FDA s asbestos finding on Oct  18  a plaintiff s lawyer  Nate Finch  asked an Indianapolis judge to let him tell the jury about it in a trial involving a 71 year old woman who alleged that Baby Powder contributed to her cancer  J J s lawyers opposed the request  arguing that the information could prejudice the jury against the company  but the judge granted Finch s request  Days later  Finch told the judge his client had come to a confidential resolution with J J  a trial transcript shows  Finch told Reuters he could not comment on the resolution  J J did not respond to questions about the Indianapolis case  The company declined to comment on Saldivar s role in the FDA testing  or on how it might affect the company s legal strategy going forward   Saldivar declined to comment  NO SAFE LEVELS In a June deposition  Saldivar said J J lawyers had retained him in 2017 as a company expert in  maybe 20 or 30  cases  His firm bills  200 to  350 an hour for his services  he testified  Under the FDA contract  his lab found asbestos fibers in the Baby Powder sample on Sept  7  according to the lab s report  J J said it was notified of the finding by FDA officials on Oct  16  prompting the company to recall 33 000 bottles  out of an abundance of caution   In response  some major U S  retailers have said they are removing all 22 ounce bottles of Johnson s baby powder from their shelves   At the same time  the company has expressed suspicions about the finding  saying it had launched its own investigation  to determine the integrity of the tested sample  and the validity of the test results   On Friday  the FDA posted online Saldivar s 16 page report to the agency on the analysis of J J Baby Powder  In samples weighing less than a gram  the lab said it found six chrysotile asbestos fibers  Given that the samples were extremely small  the asbestos could amount to millions of fibers per gram  testing experts told Reuters  While most people exposed to asbestos never develop cancer  for some  even small amounts are enough to trigger the disease years later  Just how small hasn t been established  The World Health Organization and other health authorities recognize no safe level of exposure to asbestos  a known carcinogen   Since there are no known safe levels of asbestos  the FDA has asked manufacturers to voluntarily recall their products when fibers consistent with asbestos are found in them   the agency said this month  Several juries over the past two years have concluded that Baby Powder exposures caused cancer and have awarded plaintiffs more than  5 billion  Other juries have sided with J J  and some cases have settled   JUST NOT CORRECT  The FDA has never before announced that government testing found asbestos in J J s Baby Powder  Since the early 1970s  J J has pushed back hard on reports of asbestos in its talc by outside scientists  plaintiffs  experts and  on several occasions  by its own testing labs  In an Oct  3 deposition in a New York lawsuit  J J Chief Executive Alex Gorsky dismissed the findings of asbestos over the years  saying  they were later shown to be inaccurate  incomplete and just not correct   Attacking Saldivar s finding  some legal experts told Reuters  could hurt the company s ability to use him as a witness in lawsuits and undercut its broader message to jurors and consumers  That message boils down to  Trust our experts  But a product liability defense lawyer who helped organize a recent talc litigation symposium said the impact on pending cases could be limited because asbestos related cancers are known to take decades to develop  The FDA s new finding  would be difficult to tie  to cancers allegedly caused by long ago exposures  said Edward Ulloa  a Los Angeles based lawyer who does not represent J J  The FDA findings are  essentially anecdotal   Ulloa said   specific to that product and that particular sample   In its Tuesday announcement  J J said that one of the labs it hired initially found asbestos in three samples of Baby Powder  but the lab determined that a portable air conditioner running when the samples were prepared was contaminated with asbestos  Subsequent tests in a different room found no asbestos  the company said  NO EXPERIENCE  NO ASBESTOS In 2010  when the AMA lab tested 34 talc products for the FDA  including Johnson s Baby Powder  the lab had no experience looking for asbestos fibers in talc milled for powders and cosmetics  Saldivar testified in several depositions that the lab s work had previously focused on determining the amount of asbestos in old building products  such as vinyl flooring  AMA made fast work of the 2010 FDA job  lab records reviewed by Reuters show  His lab examined 102 samples  three from each product  in a single day  using a method called transmission electron microscopy  TEM   That works out to less than five minutes per sample  assuming an eight hour shift with no breaks  Experts who have found asbestos in milled talc powders told Reuters they require anywhere from a half hour to a day per sample using TEM  and litigation records show they often look at more talc per sample than Saldivar has testified is the practice at AMA  In a deposition earlier this year  Saldivar acknowledged that he looked at less talc per sample than others in the field and that looking at more talc  would raise your analytical sensitivity    the ability to find any contamination  But he said he believed that his methods were sufficient  After the AMA lab found no asbestos in 2010  the FDA cautioned against reading too much into the results   not because of the sensitivity of the test but because so few products were tested  Though the agency has described the testing as using the  most sensitive techniques available   it said the results  do not prove that most or all talc or talc containing cosmetic products currently marketed in the United States are likely to be free of asbestos contamination   When J J s lawyers approached Saldivar a few years ago about serving as an expert and testing Baby Powder  they  wanted me to follow my protocols that I used on my FDA testing  in 2010  Saldivar testified in May 2018  In June  he testified that his lab had never found any asbestos in talc samples  including Baby Powder  that it had tested for J J and other manufacturer defendants  The testing by Saldivar s lab for the FDA this year was a different story  
 This positive test turns up the heat on J J   said Nora Freeman Engstrom  a Stanford University law professor who studies complex litigation   And their expert lit the match  ",2019-10-30,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/exclusive-jjs-own-expert-working-for-fda-found-asbestos-in-baby-powder-2007445,2007445

197672,419188,JNJ,Davos Diverts Attention From BoC Decision And Earnings,opinion,"It s a mixed bag across Europe on Wednesday  with much of the headlines coming from Davos where Trump delivered his keynote speech yesterday 






It s always interesting to hear the views of some of the world s most influential people at these events but so far  as many expected  it s having little impact on the markets  It was interesting to hear the President once again blaming the Fed for the slower economy and Dow not being another 10 000 points higher  something I expect we ll hear repeated over and over again this year 
Fear around the spread of coronavirus is not yet having any real impact on markets outside of China but with reports of cases appearing outside the country  that may change  It s difficult to say at this stage how much and quickly it will spread but everyone is clearly very alert to the prospect of this becoming a much greater problem 

While much of the headlines will continue to come from Davos today  it is worth noting that another batch of companies will report on the fourth quarter today including Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ   The Bank of Canada will also announce its interest rate decision  although no change is expected today or for the rest of the year  in fact  That could change though and the statement and press conference will tell us if any shift on the committee is happening

Gold s rally on Tuesday didn t last long  a further sign that we re likely trading at the upper end of its range at the moment  The spike earlier this year was driven by increased geopolitical risk and even then  it struggled to break  1 600  The path of least resistance may  therefore  be below  although for now  it is clinging onto the hard fought gains of the last couple of weeks

recalling around 33 000 bottles of baby powder in the United States after U S  health regulators found trace amounts of asbestos in samples taken from a bottle purchased online  J J shares fell more than 6  to close at  127 70  The move marks the first time the company has recalled its iconic baby powder for possible asbestos contamination  and the first time U S  regulators have announced a finding of asbestos in the product  Asbestos is a known carcinogen that has been linked to deadly mesothelioma  The recall is the latest blow to the more than 130 year old U S  healthcare conglomerate that is facing thousands of lawsuits over a variety of products  including baby powder  opioids  medical devices and the antipsychotic Risperdal  A jury last week ordered the company to pay  8 billion

early to confirm whether cross contamination of the sample had caused a false positive  whether the sample was taken from a bottle with an intact seal or whether the it was prepared in a controlled environment  It added that it could not confirm whether the tested product was authentic or counterfeit   It is so critical that we perform a thorough investigation of the sample to determine the source of contamination   Nicholson said  Since 2003  talc in Johnson s Baby Powder sold in the United States has come from China through supplier Imerys Talc America  a unit of Paris based Imerys SA and a co defendant in much of the talc litigation  Imerys and J J said the Chinese talc is safe   J J has known for decades that asbestos lurked in its talc  Reuters reported last year  Internal company records  trial testimony and other evidence show that from at least 1971 to the early 2000s  the company s raw talc and finished powders sometimes tested positive for small amounts of asbestos  Company executives  mine managers  scientists  doctors and lawyers fretted over the problem and how to address it  while failing to disclose it to regulators or the public  Reuters found  J J has repeatedly said that its talc products are safe  and that decades of studies have shown them to be asbestos free and that they do not cause cancer  The FDA test indicated the presence of no greater than 0 00002  of chrysotile asbestos in the tested sample  J J said  The World Health Organization and other authorities recognize no safe level of exposure to asbestos  While most people exposed never develop cancer  for some  even small amounts of asbestos are enough to trigger the disease years later  Thousands of the lawsuits against J J have been consolidated before a New Jersey federal judge  who is currently weighing company motions to disqualify plaintiffs  expert witnesses  including the head of an asbestos testing lab who has testified in earlier trials that he found the contaminant in J J powders  Leigh O Dell  one of the lead plaintiff attorneys  on Friday said the recall  vindicates the position we ve been taking for months    Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC  analyst Larry Biegelsen said in a research note that the recall could encourage additional lawsuits and prompt the company to pursue a broader settlement  Jefferies healthcare strategist Jared Holz said J J has already lost close to  10 billion in market value due to the talc issue over the past year  He said further downside to J J stock is likely to be limited because legal concerns over talc are well known and have already taken a toll on the share price   This is one single bottle within one lot with barely a trace here   he said  J J said in February that it had received subpoenas from the U S  Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission for documents related to the asbestos contamination allegations  A Bloomberg report  which Reuters has confirmed  said those inquiries include a criminal grand jury investigation into how forthright J J has been in its statements about the safety of its powders

197720,419236,JNJ,Johnson   Johnson  JNJ  Expected To Beat Earnings Estimates  What To Know Ahead Of Q4 Release,opinion,"Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 22  2020  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This world s biggest maker of health care products is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 87 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  5 1  
Revenues are expected to be  20 79 billion  up 2  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2 81  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Johnson   Johnson 
For Johnson   Johnson  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 77  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination indicates that Johnson   Johnson will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Johnson   Johnson would post earnings of  2 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 12  delivering a surprise of  6  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

197722,419238,JNJ,Is Johnson   Johnson  JNJ  A Good Pick For Value Investors ,opinion,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Johnson   Johnson  Inc    NYSE JNJ   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Johnson   Johnson has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 16 90  as you can see in the chart below 
This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 20 57  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Johnson   Johnson s current PE ratio slightly below its midpoint  which is 17 12  over the past five years 
Further  the stock s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Medical sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 23 48  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers 
 We should also point out that Johnson   Johnson has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 16 18  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Johnson   Johnson s stock in the near term too P CF RatioAn often overlooked ratio that can still be a great indicator of value is the price cash flow metric  This ratio doesn t take amortization and depreciation into account  so can give a more accurate picture of the financial health in a business  This is a preferred metric to some valuation investors because cash flows are  a  generally less prone to manipulation by the company s management and  b  are less affected by variation in accounting policies between different companies The ratio is generally applied to find out whether a company s stock is overpriced or underpriced with reference to its cash flows generation potential compared with its competitors  However  it is not commonly used for cross industry comparison  as the average price to cash flow ratio varies from industry to industry In this case  Johnson   Johnson s P CF ratio of 17 01 is lower than the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry average of 19 35  which indicates that the stock is somewhat undervalued in this respect 
Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Johnson   Johnson currently has a Value Style Score of B  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes JNJ a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Johnson   Johnson might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of C and a Momentum score of B  This gives JNJ a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past thirty days compared to none lower  while the current year estimate has seen a similar trend in the same time period This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has inched up 0 5  in the past one month  while the current year estimate has nudged up 0 1   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Johnson   Johnson Price and Consensus
    This somewhat favorable trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and why we are looking for better performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineJohnson   Johnson is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Boasting a strong industry rank  top 21  out of more than 250 industries  and a solid Zacks Rank  the company deserves attention right now  In fact  over the past one year  the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for industry trend to turn favorable in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick

197737,419253,JNJ,Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Wednesday,news,"Investing com    Hopes for a limited trade deal spark a modest bounce in stocks  while Turkey gets ready to invade Syria and the Federal Reserve prepares to release the minutes from its last policy meeting  Here s what you need to know in financial markets on Wednesday  9th October 
1  Trade hope springs eternal
China remains open to a partial trade deal with the U S   despite a spate of interventions over the last couple of days that had seemed to banish any hope of meaningful progress  according to Bloomberg 
China would accept a limited deal as long as no more tariffs are imposed by President Donald Trump  including two rounds of higher duties set to take effect this month and in December  it cited an official as saying  In return  Beijing would offer to buy more U S  agricultural products  albeit without conceding anything major on issues like subsidies for state owned firms 
The offshore Chinese yuan strengthened to an intraday high of 7 1348 to the dollar on the news  but further gains will depend on whether the U S  signals greater willingness to accept a narrow deal in the short term  President Donald Trump said at the weekend the prospect didn t interest him 
2  Stocks set to open higher
The choppy week for U S  stock markets looks set to continue  with major indices poised to regain around two thirds of Tuesday s losses at the opening   mostly on the back of the positive noises from China 
By 6 AM ET  Dow futures were indicated up 201 points or 0 8   while S P 500 Futures were up 27 points or 0 9  and Nasdaq 100 Futures were up 1 1  
It s a quiet day for earnings and economic data  although the Federal Reserve will release the minutes of its latest policy meeting at 2 PM ET  1800 GMT  
Yields on U S  Treasury bonds were a fraction higher as the appetite for risk returned  The 2 Year yield rose two basis points to 1 44   while the 10 Year rose by the same to 1 56    
3  Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  hit with  8 billion Risperdal verdict  Levi s beats expectations
Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  was ordered by a Philadelphia jury to pay a Maryland man  8 billion because its antipsychotic drug Risperdal caused him to grow enlarged breasts 
It was the biggest award to date among the 13 000 suits that J J faces over Risperdal  While it s unlikely to be upheld on appeal  it s a new source of legal risk for a company that has already had to pay heavily for issues relating to its opioid drugs and its talc baby powder   The shares fell 1 5  in after hours trading on the news 
Also in focus  Levi Strauss  NYSE LEVI  shares may be due a pop at opening after the company beat expectations with its third quarter earnings after the bell on Tuesday 
4  Turkish troops enter Syria
Turkish forces and Syrian rebel allies are set to cross the border into Syria  shortly   newswires quoted a Turkish official as saying  in an operation that could open a new chapter in Syria s ruinous eight year old war 
The move has put pressure on the Turkish lira  with traders mindful that President Donald Trump threatened to  obliterate the Turkish economy  in his  great and unmatched wisdom  if the country s forces attacked Syrian Kurds  which had enjoyed the protection of the U S  until this week  when Trump announced he would pull U S  forces out of the country 
The lira  which weakened to within touching distance of a three month low on Tuesday  edged lower again on Wednesday 
5  Crude inventories data due
The U S  government will release its weekly update on U S  oil supplies at 10 30 AM ET  An increase of 1 4 million barrels in crude inventories is expected by analysts 
Last week s surprisingly strong increase of 3 1 million barrels had refocused the market on the issue of weakening global demand as the world economy slows down  A further warning may be on the cards today  given that the American Petroleum Institute s data  released Tuesday  showed a 4 1 million barrel increase in stocks 
By 6 AM ET  revived hopes for a U S  China trade deal had helped U S  crude futures recoup the losses they suffered on the API data  WTI Futures were at  53 16 a barrel  up 1 0  on the day  while Brent futures were up 1 0  at  58 80 ",2019-10-09,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/economy/top-5-things-to-know-in-the-market-on-wednesday-1993775,1993775
197738,419254,JNJ,Why Johnson   Johnson  JNJ  Could Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well positioned to maintain its earnings beat streak in its upcoming report  It is worth considering Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ   which belongs to the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry 
This world s biggest maker of health care products has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 6 31  
For the last reported quarter  Johnson   Johnson came out with earnings of  2 12 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 per share  representing a surprise of 6   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  2 42 per share and it actually produced earnings of  2 58 per share  delivering a surprise of 6 61  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for Johnson   Johnson  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Johnson   Johnson currently has an Earnings ESP of  0 77   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  2  Buy  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on January 22  2020 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2020-01-13,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-johnson--johnson-jnj-could-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200498408,200498408

197822,419338,JNJ,StockBeat   J J Falls as Justice Department Launches Probe Into Talc Cancer Claims,news,"Investing com   Johnson   Johnson plunged Friday as the Justice Department reportedly launched a criminal investigation into whether the company lied about the possible cancer risks of its talcum powder  
A grand jury in Washington is examining documents related to what company officials knew about any carcinogens in their products  Bloomberg reported  Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  fell nearly 5   That was enough to subtract 46 points from the Dow on an otherwise bullish day 
The company said in a statement that it is cooperating with the previously announced DOJ investigation and that there are no new developments  It also reiterated its previous denials of wrongdoing 
With Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  already facing more than 13 000 talc related lawsuits nationwide  the Justice Department probe will do little to ease investor fears the healthcare conglomerate could be on the hook to pay out hefty settlements to claimants  resulting in massive liabilities   
Last month  a California jury ruled in favor of a plaintiff who claimed her use of the company s talc powder caused a rare cancer  In May  the company was ordered to pay out  300 million in punitive damages to women who also claimed the company s talc powder caused asbestos linked cancer 
Reuters said last year that an examination of internal company memos and other documents found the Johnson   Johnson was aware of the presence of asbestos in its products from as early as 1971 but failed to disclose that fact to regulators or to the general public 
The company called the Reuters report  one sided  false and inflammatory  and has continually denied its Baby Powder talc causes cancer  stressing that numerous studies and tests by regulators worldwide have shown that it is safe 
While Baby Powder only makes up a small portion of total revenue  it is a core brand

Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 12 cents  The company had reported loss of 19 cents in the year ago quarter Total revenues increased 80 5  year over year to  46 2 million  driven by higher product sales  partially offset by lower royalties  However  the top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  58 82 million Shares of Halozyme were down 4 6  in after market trading on Nov 12  following the earnings release  However  the stock has gained 14 6  so far this year compared with the  s 1 2  growth   Quarterly HighlightsHalozyme s top line comprises product sales  royalties and revenues under collaborative agreements Royalty revenues were  16 6 million in the third quarter  down 11 2  from the year ago quarter  The decline was due to lower sales of Roche s   OTC RHHBY   breast cancer drug  Herceptin SC  which was partially offset by higher sales of Roche s Rituxan Hycela and Takeda s   NYSE TAK   HyQvia  These drugs are developed using Halozyme s ENHANZE drug delivery technology Product sales  solely from the sale of bulk rHuPH20 to collaborators using the ENHANZE platform for drug development  increased 365  to  29 2 million in the third quarter  The significant increase was primarily attributable to sales of  20 1 million to Janssen  a subsidiary of J J   NYSE JNJ   Revenues under collaborative agreements were  0 4 million compared with  0 6 million in the prior year quarter Research and development expenses declined 14 1  to  30 5 million primarily due to lower expenses related to clinical studies  as the company progressed toward the completion of HALO 301 study on its lead pipeline candidate  PEGPH20 General and administrative expenses were up 20 8  to  18 million in the reported quarter primarily due to costs related to commercialization initiatives to support oncology operations Business DevelopmentsIn November  Halozyme announced that the phase III study  evaluating a combination regimen of PEGPH20 as a first line treatment for metastatic pancreas cancer  failed to meet the primary end point of overall survival In October 2019  Halozyme s partner Roche nominated one new undisclosed target for evaluation in clinical study  utilizing the ENHANZE technology  This triggered a  10 million milestone payment to Halozyme In September 2019  Roche successfully completed the phase III FeDeriCa study  which evaluated a fixed dose combination of Perjeta and Herceptin for subcutaneous administration  using Halozyme s ENHANZE drug delivery technology  for treating HER2 positive breast cancer In August 2019  Roche initiated a phase I study to evaluate Ocrevus  utilizing the ENHANZE technology in patients with multiple sclerosis In October 2019  Halozyme s another partner Bristol Myers Squibb  NYSE BMY  initiated a phase I study to evaluate relatlimab in combination with Opdivo  utilizing the ENHANZE technology Restructuring InitiativesEarlier this month  Halozyme announced strategic actions as part of its restructuring plan to focus on its ENHANZE drug delivery technology and close oncology operations  These initiatives were planned following the failure of its lead pipeline candidate PEGPH20 in late stage pancreatic cancer study The company will halt all clinical developmental activities related to PEGPH20 and oncology operations  As part of the plan  it will reduce headcount by 55  or 160 employees The restructuring and cost saving efforts are likely to generate savings of  130  140 million in 2020  Halozyme is anticipating a decline in operating expenses  excluding cost of goods sold  of  65  75 million for 2020  most likely driven by lower research   development expenses  following the discontinuation of the PEGPH20 development  The company expects to reach sustainable profitability by the second quarter of 2020  It also authorized the initiation of a share repurchase program worth  350 million to be completed over the next three years 2019 GuidanceHalozyme lowered its revenue guidance for 2019 to  195  205 million from  205  215 million mentioned earlier  The guidance was lowered due to delay in the initiation of a planned phase III study on a partnered candidate  partially offset by new unplanned target nomination  These activities generate revenues for the company either through product sales or milestone payments  It also lowered its guidance for Royalty revenues to  67  69 million from  72  74 million stated previously The company maintained its expectation for year end cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of  220  230 million  It increased the outlook for operating expenses to  255 265 million from previously mentioned  215 225 million  The increase was led by anticipated one time restructuring costs of  25  27 million  which

197839,419355,JNJ,Fate of opioid litigation hinges on government  police power ,news,"By Mike Spector and Nate Raymond NEW YORK BOSTON  Reuters    The fate of thousands of lawsuits seeking to hold drugmakers responsible for fueling the U S  opioid epidemic hinges in part on a thorny legal question  Can a company use a bankruptcy to stop lawsuits from cities and states   U S  Bankruptcy Judge Kevin Gross is expected in July to decide whether to halt more than 160 active lawsuits brought by state attorneys general  cities and counties against opioid manufacturer Insys Therapeutics Inc  When it filed for Chapter 11 protection in Delaware earlier this month  Insys requested the cases be paused   A bankruptcy filing would normally halt active litigation immediately  giving a company such as Insys time to reorganize and preserve money that would otherwise be spent fighting the cases   But a longstanding exception in U S  bankruptcy law can keep the lawsuits alive if they are enforcing government officials   police or regulatory power   The exception holds that government actions seeking to enforce laws related to matters such as public health and safety are not automatically stopped by a company s bankruptcy filing as other lawsuits are   State and local officials are suing Insys and other drugmakers in an attempt to address harm from an opioid crisis that has killed nearly 400 000 people between 1999 and 2017  More than half these deaths resulted from prescription painkillers  according to the U S  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention   For a graphic  click   Criminal enterprises   should not be permitted to shield themselves from the consequences of their misconduct by running to bankruptcy court and obtaining the equivalent of a stay that allows them to evade justice   said Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison and Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh in a Tuesday legal filing opposing Insys s request to halt lawsuits   The opioid crisis  is a national public health emergency   they said in the filing  which other state attorneys general supported  including those in New York  New Jersey and Arizona   The interests of the public therefore are served by allowing these police powers actions of the states to continue unfettered by the injunctions that Insys seeks   A spokesman for Insys  which faces trials in Maryland and Minnesota beginning in August  declined to comment beyond the company s court filings   Insys already had reached a  225 million settlement before filing for bankruptcy with the U S  Justice Department  admitting to illegal conduct in resolving claims that it bribed doctors to write prescriptions  including medically unnecessary ones  for a fentanyl spray called Subsys designed to treat cancer pain  The Chandler  Arizona based company still faces  overall  more than 1 000 lawsuits raising similar allegations of deception and fraud in marketing its opioids  The misconduct occurred under a prior management team that has since  entirely turned over  and Insys is now committed to lawful marketing practices  the company said in court papers  Insys contends in bankruptcy court filings that Judge Gross should halt the lawsuits against it regardless of any exceptions  lest the company drain limited financial resources fighting cases on multiple fronts   Allowing the cases to continue would leave less money for creditors  including the very government officials seeking to hold it to account  Insys contends  adding that its request is not an attempt to escape liability   It had less than  40 million in the bank when filing for bankruptcy and predicts spending up to  9 million through December to continue fighting lawsuits  according to court papers  The judge s ruling is expected to influence whether another opioid manufacturer facing 2 000 lawsuits   OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP   decides to file for bankruptcy protection  according to a person familiar with the matter and legal experts  A Purdue spokesman declined to comment   A ruling allowing the Insys litigation to proceed could discourage Purdue from seeking bankruptcy protection  while pausing the cases might signal that Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings are a viable way to halt lawsuits and take advantage of breathing room to reach a broader settlement with plaintiffs  according to the person familiar with the matter and several legal experts  Insys lawyers are attempting to persuade government officials to agree to voluntarily halt their cases  according to a bankruptcy court filing  Insys is nearing a deal that would effectively halt some of those legal claims against the drugmaker that are consolidated in an Ohio federal court  said Paul Hanly  a lead lawyer for plaintiffs in the opioid litigation  An Insys spokesman declined to comment on the potential agreement   Insys has some legal precedent backing its approach  In 2017  a bankruptcy judge sided with Takata Corp when temporarily halting lawsuits brought by Hawaii  New Mexico and the U S  Virgin Islands against the Japanese supplier of automobile airbags that exploded  finding that allowing the litigation to continue threatened the company s reorganization  That would have harmed creditors  including those seeking to hold Takata accountable for widespread deaths and injuries  the judge ruled  The ruling allowed Takata to focus on completing a sale to a rival  creating a combined company called Joyson Safety Systems  A Joyson representative declined to comment  The Minnesota and Maryland attorneys general argued in their legal filing on Tuesday that Insys has not demonstrated the kind of exceptional circumstances present in the Takata case   an unprecedented automotive recall   that warranted halting government lawsuits  While the outcome in the Insys case is not critical for opioid manufacturers with stronger balance sheets that face lawsuits  such as Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ   it holds significance for the likes of OxyContin maker Purdue  according to several legal experts  In March  Reuters reported that Purdue was exploring filing for bankruptcy protection to address lawsuits alleging it pushed prescription painkillers while downplaying their abuse and overdose risks  according to people familiar with the matter  Purdue s CEO later confirmed the company was considering a bankruptcy filing   
The company has denied allegations it contributed to the opioid crisis  pointing to the U S  Food and Drug Administration approving labels on its drugs carrying warnings about risk and abuse associated with treating pain ",2019-06-26,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/fate-of-opioid-litigation-hinges-on-government-police-power-1907828,1907828

197857,419373,JNJ,Exclusive  Canada told drugmakers it would limit scope of some new price rules,news,By Allison Martell TORONTO  Reuters    The Canadian government has assured the pharmaceutical industry that new features of its plan to cut drug costs would apply only to new medicines  Health Canada said  offering some relief to drugmakers even as other regulations could still lower prices of medicines already on the market  Drugmakers have argued that new regulations should only apply to newly approved drugs  The Health Canada clarification comes after draft rules published in 2017 sowed confusion over how the government would implement its plan  The new features of the government s proposed regulations  which would take into account cost effectiveness of medicines and their likely impact on government budgets  would be limited to new drugs  Health Canada told Innovative Medicines Canada  IMC  and BIOTECanada  the patented drug industry s main lobby groups  in a letter dated April 8  2019  It added that other parts of the same draft regulation  changing the list of countries Canadian officials use as a basis for comparison when setting maximum prices  would apply to all drugs   Health Canada described the contents of the letter in response to questions  but Reuters has not seen the letter  Canada  like governments around the world  is grappling with the rising cost of drugs  particularly expensive new specialty medicines for cancer and rare diseases  A new national prescription drug program is one of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau s key promises ahead of an October federal election  making tackling prices a priority    The overall intent of the regulatory proposal is prospective application to new drugs   Health Canada said in a statement   There is some scope for this information to affect the prices of drugs already in the marketplace   it added  The department acknowledged that as originally written  the draft regulation would have involved all prescription drugs  new and old  but said that is not its intention  Global drugmakers have campaigned against the Canadian plan  which would change the way a little known federal agency called the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board decides whether high drug prices are legal  Canada s patented drug prices are among the highest in the world  PLAN DELAYED The regulations  originally expected to go into effect in January  were delayed so the government could spend more time reviewing comments  The plan could still be softened or even scrapped  But earlier this month  Minister of Health Ginette Petitpas Taylor said final regulations would be ready soon  IMC  whose members include Merck   Co  Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ    Pfizer  Inc  NYSE PFE  and others  was not satisfied by assurances in the letter   We remain concerned that changes to the group of comparator countries and other aspects of the amendments may be applied to both new and existing products   the organization said in a statement  Applying any new rules to already marketed drugs would create  significant uncertainty  for companies whose business planning is based on existing prices  it added  The industry has said it believes the reforms duplicate processes that already exist  and could hurt Canadians  access to new drugs as well as spending on research and development   We remain committed to working with the government to find alternative solutions that balance the need for more affordable medicines with a competitive regulatory environment for health research   IMC said  Health Canada described the letter as  re confirming  details it had stated publicly before  Asked where those details had been disclosed  a spokesman pointed to a cost benefit analysis cited in the 2017 draft regulations  and an expert review of that analysis that was not made public until Reuters reported on it in February  Patented drug sales in Canada were C 16 8 billion   12 4 billion  in 2017  according to government data  The original cost benefit analysis estimated the new regulations would cost drugmakers C 8 6 billion   6 4 billion  over 10 years  As an alternative to the proposed changes  drugmakers offered to voluntarily give up C 8 6 billion in revenue over the same period  Reuters reported in February  Exactly how much the new rules will reduce prices depends on implementation details that have not yet been decided  Lower prices in Canada could have a ripple effect on drugmakers  most lucrative market   the United States   given recent proposals there to lower medical costs for U S  consumers   The United States is mulling basing drug prices paid under its government Medicare health program on the cost of medicines in other countries  including Canada  And some U S  lawmakers and states are looking into allowing importation of less expensive prescription drugs from Canada

197858,419374,JNJ,These 21 Safe Funds Pay Monthly  Never Go Down,opinion," Brett  give me some bond funds with big yields  And it d be great if their prices never went down  
My money manager friend was chasing the holy grail of retirement income  He wanted safe payouts from bonds to balance his clients  stock exposure 
 How about the Artisan High Income Fund Investor Shares   I replied   It pays a steady 6  or so  And it never goes down  
Up  Up  Up With Barely a Blip




 The only problem is that it doesn t quite have double digit yearly return potential  And that s prevented me from recommending it to my Contrarian Income Report subscribers  
Our CIR portfolio has returned 11 7  per year since inception  Adding ARTFX to the mix would drag our retirement boat lower 
I prefer price upside alongside my dividends  And for big gains we must consider closed end funds  CEFs   which are bought and sold with less efficiency than blue chip stocks and ETFs 
The dividend dictionary is filled with the latter  We know Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  for its century old dividend and the SPDR  Bloomberg  Barclays   LON BARC  High Yield Bond ETF  NYSE JNK  because its ticker spells  junk   But few turn the page to the underrated PIMCO Dynamic Credit Income Fund  NYSE PCI  
This is a shame because PCI pays a generous 8 3  today while JNJ yields just 3  and JNK pays 5 6   It s doubly ironic because PCI has more than doubled the returns of its two better known  competitors  
PCI Pays More  Goes Up Faster Than JNJ and JNK




PCI s payout is safe but its price is subject to market whims  As a CEF  the fund has a fixed amount of shares  like an individual stock   This means its price can swing up and down  like an individual stock   Over the long haul this  volatility  works in our favor as patient investors  but it can cause indigestion for folks who watch their tickers daily  or worse  hourly  
The Hare Won  As Long As You Didn t Sell 




And I get it some of you just do check your stock quotes every day  and that s just how it s always going to be  Or you may have plenty of potential action packed into the rest of the portfolio  whether it s dividend growth or cryptocurrencies or weed stocks  I m not judging  and you just want anchors that can help steady the ship and pay you every month no matter what happens 
A bond CEF is a great addition to a  no withdrawal  portfolio  or an account in which you are comfortable letting prices do what they will while you collect your monthly and quarterly payouts  But bond CEF prices are going to fluctuate day to day  while ARTFX is a distribution rock 
Want more bond rocks  Let s dig  Here are 11 more funds that  like ARTFX  meet the following strict criteria 
First  they pay 5  or better  While we re not looking for moonshots  we are looking for meaningful yield 
Second  they ve returned 4 5  or better annualized over the last five years  This means these funds have at least  returned their yields   They re not tapping their own portfolios  or net asset values  NAVs  to pay us 
And finally  their  betas  are in the basement at 0 2 or below  This is the measure of how much the stock swings relative to the broader market  If the S P 500 moved 10 points  we d expect these prices to only move a point or two at most 
The 12 Safest Bond Mutual Funds That Actually Pay




The 12 funds above are all mutual funds  a tribute to the value that an active manager can add in Bondland  Now I know that some investors prefer ETFs  either by choice or by necessity  This is doable but we must widen our strike zone a bit to allow for lower yields and yearly returns 
The 8 Safest Bond ETFs That Actually Pay




As we discussed with ARTFX  I don t anticipate I ll ever formally recommend one of these funds in CIR  Their total returns are unlikely to clear my high single digit yearly hurdle  However  they are good ideas for anyone looking to tie down their portfolio during any market turbulence  These 5  and 6  yields are about as steady as they come 
The Best Bond Funds  CEFs for 8 5  Yields and 78  Returns 
I prefer CEFs to mutual funds and ETFs because 
They yield more  andThey can go up in price more quickly In fact  CEFs flash a crystal clear buy signal when a big price rise is coming  You ll find it in the discount to NAV  which is the percentage by which the fund s market price trails the market value of all the assets in its portfolio  known as the net asset value  or NAV  
This makes our plan simple  wait for the discount to sink below its normal level and make our move  Then we ll keep rolling our dividend cash into that fund until its discount closes  or swings to a premium  
This is exactly what happened when we bought the PIMCO Dynamic Credit and Mortgage Fund  PCI  in my Contrarian Income Report service in May 2016  Not only did we collect the fund s generous dividend  but we won two more ways over the three years we ve held PCI because its 
NAV increased  orange line below   and  Its discount window tightened as its price  blue line  caught up with and eventually surpassed its NAV 2 Ways to Win for 78  Total Returns




We ve earned 78  total returns from PCI  thanks to the dividends we ve collected  the NAV gains we ve enjoyed and the discount window closing entirely and flipping to a premium 
For much of PCI s run  I ve had a  buy  rating on the fund when this  twofer  potential remained in place  making it a perfect destination for both reinvested dividends and new cash my members had available to invest 
For a period of time  though  PCI has cruised along as a  hold  for us  This happened after its price rallied so furiously that its discount window closed 
When this happens  it makes sense to bank our PCI dividends  or  redirect  them to our other Contrarian Income Report buys  and wait for our next buying opportunity 
That s what happened with PCI  Its discount window opened again in the late 2018 selloff   on October 5  to be precise   when its market price fell below my  23 50 buy up to level  Investors who got in then picked up a nice 14  total return  nearly three times the market s gain 
Buy Window Opens  Gains  and Dividends  Ensue




As you can see in the orange line above  your typical S P 500 investor didn t come anywhere close to those returns in that time 
Yours Now  My Next 8    Monthly  Income Buys 
As you can probably guess from the chart above  PCI is trading at a massive premium to NAV now  so I ve switched it back to a hold 
But it s only a matter of time before our buy window slides open again and we can put more cash into this amazing 8 7  yielder 
When you take a no risk trial to Contrarian Income Report  you ll be the first to know when the time is right 
Meantime  if you re looking for some stout monthly high yielders to buy NOW  fear not  I ve got you covered there  too 
Those would be the stocks  high yield REITs and CEFs in my powerful     With just  500K invested  this dynamic collection of investments will hand you a rock solid  40 000 a year income stream  That s easily enough for most folks to retire on 
The best part is you won t have to go back to  lumpy  quarterly payouts to do it  Thanks to this breakthrough portfolio s reliable monthly dividends  you can look forward to the steady drip of  3 333 in income  month in and month out on your  500K  give or take a couple hundred bucks 
Full details on these stalwart income plays are   You ll discover 
An 8 1  payer that s set to rake in huge profits from an artificially depressed sector The brainchild of one of the top fund managers on the planet that s giving out a generous 9 1  yield And a rock steady 6 9  dividend trading at a massive discount to NAV Don t miss your chance to start tapping this retirement changing dividend stream while you can still get in at a bargain

197939,419455,JNJ,FDA finds asbestos in three Claire s cosmetics products,news,"By Chad Terhune  Reuters    The U S  Food and Drug Administration called on Congress to modernize rules for cosmetics safety on Tuesday after it issued an alert warning consumers not to use three cosmetics products sold by Claire s Stores Inc because they tested positive for asbestos  a known carcinogen  The FDA said it would work with Congress to update the regulatory framework that the agency has been operating under for more than 80 years for cosmetics  It said there are currently no legal requirements for any cosmetic manufacturer selling goods to American consumers to test their products for safety  In its safety alert  the FDA identified the products as Claire s eye shadows  contour palette and compact powder and cited the talc used in the products  Claire s disputed the FDA test results  saying they  show significant errors  and have  mischaracterized fibers in the products as asbestos   The retailer  which emerged from bankruptcy in October  said   There is no evidence that any products sold by Claire s are unsafe   However  out of an abundance of caution  it said it removed the three products in question from stores as well as  any remaining talc based cosmetic products   The FDA has come under intensifying pressure from lawmakers and consumer advocates to investigate possible asbestos contamination of talc following a report published by Reuters on Dec  14 about talc in Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  powders  The Reuters report detailed that J J knew that the talc in its raw and finished powders sometimes tested positive for small amounts of asbestos from the 1970s into the early 2000s  J J did not disclose its test results to regulators or consumers  The alleged presence of asbestos in talc products is at issue in thousands of lawsuits filed against J J  Last month  J J said it had received federal subpoenas for the first time related to the asbestos litigation and said it is cooperating with the inquiries  J J and its talc supplier  Imerys Talc America  have said numerous studies and tests by regulators worldwide have shown their talc to be safe and asbestos free  In response to the FDA s call on Tuesday for new rules  J J said it supports the agency s efforts to  reaffirm the safety of cosmetic talc products   The company said it has backed previous legislative efforts to modernize FDA s regulatory authority over cosmetics  J J also reiterated Tuesday that  for decades global independent laboratories and health authorities have tested Johnson s Baby Powder and have never found asbestos     SHIFT THE SAFETY PARADIGM  The FDA on Tuesday said it would investigate cosmetics manufacturers  sources for talc and what steps they take to test the raw material or their finished products  The agency did not name specific companies   We also want to know how many cosmetics products contain talc and whether manufacturers have received adverse event reports associated with talc containing products   the FDA said  In a joint statement on Tuesday  FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb  who separately announced his resignation  and the director of the agency s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition  Susan Mayne  said federal rules have not keep pace with the cosmetic industry s substantial growth and a global supply chain   To significantly shift the safety paradigm of cosmetics in the U S   we would need to work with stakeholders  including Congress  to modernize the outdated regulatory framework that the FDA has been operating under for more than 80 years when it comes to cosmetics   they said in the statement  The FDA said the new rules for cosmetics manufacturers may require companies to report adverse events  provide access to consumer complaints during routine inspections and disclose known allergens on a product s label  In the meantime  U S  regulators are asking cosmetics firms to voluntarily register their products and a list of ingredients  including talc  with the FDA  Asbestos is a mineral often found near talc  a common ingredient in many cosmetics  and if steps are not taken to purify raw talc sufficiently the talc put in consumer products may be contaminated with asbestos  the FDA said  Talc may be used in cosmetics  for example  to prevent caking or to make facial makeup opaque  In 2017  the FDA said it became aware of reports of asbestos contamination in several cosmetics sold by Claire s and another retailer  Justice  which is owned by Ascena Retail Group Inc  The two retailers subsequently removed certain products  such as glitter creams  eye shadows and make up sets  The FDA then ordered independent tests and the results received in late February confirmed asbestos in three Claire s products and one from Justice  The Justice product had already been recalled from the market   In a statement on Tuesday  Justice said it  quickly and responsibly issued a voluntary recall in 2017 out of an abundance of caution   The FDA said Claire s had refused to comply with its request to recall the products that tested positive for asbestos  The FDA said it does not have the authority to mandate a recall  so it issued the safety alert   The United States Public Interest Research Group last May reported the health and safety regulator for the Netherlands ordered Claire s to remove several makeup products from Dutch shops after a study by U S  PIRG showed contamination with asbestos  Claire s in March 2018  in a statement  questioned the accuracy of asbestos testing by Dutch authorities  It said its own testing at independent laboratories in the European Union and the United States labs found that Claire s products were  compliant with all relevant cosmetic safety regulations    Claire s

197940,419456,JNJ,World s second man cleared of AIDS virus invigorates quest for cure,news,"By Kate Kelland and Julie Steenhuysen LONDON CHICAGO  Reuters    Scientific investigation into the world s second man cleared of the AIDS virus is zooming in on a gene and a treatment side effect  as newly enthused researchers strive to find a cure for the disease that has killed millions   Known as the  London Patient   the man had HIV and a type of blood cancer called Hodgkin s lymphoma  He responded successfully to a bone marrow transplant from a donor with rare genetic resistance to HIV infection  The transplant cleared the man s cancer and his HIV  but the resistant genes may not be the sole cause of his HIV remission   Since the pandemic began in the 1980s  more than 70 million people have been infected with HIV and about 35 million have died  most in Africa  Medical advances mean tests can detect HIV early  new drugs can control it  and there are ways to stop it spreading   but 37 million people still live with the virus  The London Patient s case gives fresh hope to scientists and pharmaceutical researchers who have spent decades looking for ways to end AIDS  HIV expert Sharon Lewin said two factors were probably at play in his success story  the genetic resistance and a transplant side effect that attacks immune cells   The new bone marrow is resistant to HIV  and also the new bone marrow is actively eliminating any HIV infected cells through something called  graft versus host  disease   said Lewin  co chair of the International AIDS Society s cure research advisory board and a researcher at Australia s Doherty Institute   The London Patient joins the first case of this kind  Timothy Ray Brown   or the  Berlin Patient    whose HIV was eradicated by a similar transplant treatment in 2007  It involved the destruction of his immune system and transplanted stem cells with a gene mutation called CCR5 that resists HIV  The AIDS virus uses CCR5 to enter cells  but if the gene is mutated  HIV cannot latch onto cells and infect them  This  graft versus host  effect is akin to a deadly battle of two immune systems  explained Steven Deeks  an HIV expert at the University of California  The incoming transplanted donor immune cells seek out and destroy all the host s immune cells   including those in which HIV can hide out  he said   The transplant resulted in the complete destruction of the old immune system and the construction of a new immune system in which the  HIV  virus can t replicate  because of the genetic mutation   That is the cure   Deeks told Reuters    LONG WAY TO GO  But such transplants are complex  expensive and highly risky to the patients  who would run a risk of dying in the process   So the key is that someone has to come up with a way to deliver  CCR5  gene editing capability to all the  immune system  T cells   and that s what people are working on right now   Deeks added  Teams in labs around the world  as well as drug companies including Gilead Sciences  NASDAQ GILD   Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  and GSK s ViiV Healthcare  have very early stage cure studies in the works  said Rowena Johnston  director of research at U S  AIDS research foundation amfAR    Companies dip their toes in and out of cure research   But the idea of looking for a cure involving bone marrow transplants to destroy and replace the immune systems of all those infected with HIV is a non starter   Many patients currently have good control of their disease with treatments such as Gilead s anti retroviral drug Biktarvy  which combines three HIV medicines in a single daily tablet    I d rather be on the single pill a day with very little toxicities than risk something as draconian as a transplant   said Anthony Fauci  director of the U S  National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases  He and others said the London Patient s case does  however  underline that in this approach  two factors combined are crucial   the CCR5 genetic resistance  plus its delivery to all cells  including immune cells  Some research teams in the United States and elsewhere are developing gene editing techniques to edit CCR5 cells outside of the body and reintroduce the edited cells back to patients   Specialists said this method has its limits  because it only edits some cells and leaves native wild type cells untouched in the body where HIV can still hide  Other avenues are also being explored   Dan Barouch  a vaccine researcher at the Harvard affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston  is working with Gilead to develop what s known as a  kick and kill  treatment  The idea is to use an initial drug to flush out HIV that is hiding from the immune system and then use standard antiretrovirals to kill the newly exposed virus  Animal studies have shown hope  but it has not yet been proven in people   All HIV cure approaches in general are in their infancy   he said in a telephone interview

197959,419475,JNJ,Court ruling could help J J defeat St  Louis talc lawsuits,news,"By Tina Bellon NEW YORK  Reuters    A Missouri Supreme Court ruling on talc lawsuits could reduce the liability and number of large trials Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  faces over allegations its talc products  including baby powder  cause cancer  The ruling will likely offer some respite to the healthcare conglomerate as it deals with growing pressure over the safety of its talc products  some defense lawyers said  The company revealed in its annual report on Wednesday that it had received subpoenas from the U S  Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission related to talc litigation  Some plaintiffs  lawyers  however  played down the impact of the ruling  It was a trial in St  Louis s 22nd Circuit Court  brought by 21 plaintiffs from outside of the city whose cases were joined to that of a single St  Louis resident  that in July produced a record  4 69 billion talc verdict against J J  The company is facing several more such lawsuits in St  Louis   However  Missouri s high court on Feb  13 ruled in a separate talc case that allowed a non resident to participate in joined cases was  a clear and direct violation  of state law barring the use of joinder   combining two or more cases   to allow courts to hear cases they otherwise could not   Most state courts can only hear cases involving plaintiffs or defendants from that state or alleging injuries occurring within their jurisdiction  The U S  Supreme Court strengthened those restrictions in a 2017 decision  But the St  Louis court had allowed out of state residents to continue to sue New Jersey based J J through liberal use of joinder  In the case that produced the July verdict  18 of the plaintiffs were from outside Missouri and three were from outside the city of St  Louis  Of the roughly 700 talc cases filed in St  Louis  only 40 involve Missouri residents  according to court filings   If the Feb  13 ruling closes off the St  Louis court to non resident claims  J J may have a stronger hand defending itself in smaller talc cases spread out among other  potentially less plaintiff friendly state and federal courts    There s no real way of reading this decision other than this court clearly saying you can t join claims if the injury did not occur in the venue   said Mark Cheffo  a New York based product liability defense lawyer not involved in talc litigation   J J in a statement said it was pleased with the decision   One claim that is properly before a court cannot provide a basis for drawing into a trial other claims that are not  We believe that decision is clearly correct  and we continue to believe that the science doesn t support plaintiffs  claims   the company said  declining further comment  IMPACT UNCLEAR Some plaintiffs  lawyers said the Feb  13 ruling was not as definitive as Cheffo suggests   If defendants are celebrating this ruling as the end of St  Louis mass tort  they have not read the entire Missouri case law   said Eric Holland  a St  Louis based plaintiff lawyer involved in the talc litigation  Holland pointed to a 2016 Missouri Supreme Court decision that upheld a  38 million verdict in a pharmaceutical product liability case the defendant claimed had been improperly joined  The court let the result stand  saying that even an improper joinder did not render the trial unfair to defendants  Though the 2016 ruling involved a case already decided  Holland and other plaintiffs  lawyers said they planned to argue its fairness analysis also applies to out of state talc claims in cases yet to go to trial  They said they would also argue joining the cases was the most efficient use of judicial resources  Defense lawyers said the Feb  13 decision would likely mean dismissal or severing of the out of state claims from four upcoming multi plaintiff cases scheduled for trial in St  Louis  Two of the cases were halted by the Missouri Supreme Court ahead of its ruling  Holland and other plaintiff lawyers said they would challenge J J requests to sever or dismiss talc cases by arguing the Feb  13 decision did not overrule the 2016 ruling  Cheffo said the 2016 ruling could make it harder for J J to overturn the July verdict and its record penalty because the company would have to prove the joinder led to an unfair trial   FORUM SHOPPING  BY OUT OF STATE PLAINTIFFS The St  Louis court has been a venue for more talc trials and has seen larger verdicts than any other jurisdiction  Outside of St  Louis  the only other significant talc verdicts against J J to date have come in lawsuits filed by individual plaintiffs in New Jersey and California  where the company is currently facing jury verdicts totaling  142 million   A Los Angeles jury delivered a  417 million talc verdict against J J in 2017  but the judge threw out the award weeks later as unsupported by the evidence  All talc verdicts against J J are on appeal  The St  Louis court has a history of issuing large punitive damages against companies and has often been criticized by business groups as allowing  forum shopping  by out of state plaintiffs   While J J faces some trials brought by individuals in other jurisdictions  the multi plaintiff St  Louis cases are the largest and have the most potential to produce additional billion dollar verdicts  Plaintiffs allege that the talc in Johnson s baby powder and other J J products causes ovarian cancer  or that asbestos contamination in the talc causes ovarian cancer and mesothelioma  Asbestos is a known carcinogen linked to mesothelioma  J J and its talc supplier  Imerys Talc America  a co defendant in the litigation  deny the allegations  saying numerous studies and tests by regulators worldwide have shown their talc to be safe and asbestos free  Reuters on Dec  14 published a report detailing that J J knew that the talc in its raw and finished powders sometimes tested positive for small amounts of asbestos from the 1970s into the early 2000s   test results it did not disclose to regulators or consumers      J J is currently facing roughly 13 000 lawsuits over talc  most of which have been consolidated in federal court in New Jersey  Many plaintiff s lawyers have fought to keep cases out of federal court  which they feel favors corporate defendants  Three juries have rejected claims that Baby Powder was tainted with asbestos or caused plaintiffs  mesothelioma  Five other juries have failed to reach verdicts  resulting in mistrials  
In a statement  Imerys Talc America said the Missouri ruling affirmed legal arguments it has made in litigation for the last four years  The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Feb  13  saying it lacked the financial clout to defend against talc lawsuits ",2019-02-25,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/court-ruling-could-help-jj-defeat-st-louis-talc-lawsuits-1789039,1789039

197975,419491,JNJ,Earnings Preview  Johnson   Johnson  JNJ  Q3 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"The market expects Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on October 15  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This world s biggest maker of health care products is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  2 4  
Revenues are expected to be  20 05 billion  down 1 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Johnson   Johnson 
For Johnson   Johnson  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Johnson   Johnson will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Johnson   Johnson would post earnings of  2 42 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 58  delivering a surprise of  6 61  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss

The U S  Department of Health and Human Services has proposed policy changes aimed at lowering drug prices and passing on more of the discounts negotiated by health insurers to patients  Those measures are not expected to provide relief to consumers in the short term  however  and fall short of giving government health agencies direct authority to negotiate or regulate drug prices ",2019-01-10,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/jj-raises-us-prices-on-around-two-dozen-drugs-1744051,1744051

198010,419526,JNJ,Are You Looking For A High Growth Dividend Stock  Johnson   Johnson  JNJ  Could Be A Great Choice,opinion,"Whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  all investors love seeing their portfolios score big returns  But for income investors  generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus 
Cash flow can come from bond interest  interest from other types of investments  and of course  dividends  A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  and investors often view it by its dividend yield  a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long term returns  and in many cases  dividend contributions surpass one third of total returns 
Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  in Focus
Johnson   Johnson  JNJ  is headquartered in New Brunswick  and is in the Medical sector  The stock has seen a price change of 0 48  since the start of the year  Currently paying a dividend of  0 95 per share  the company has a dividend yield of 2 93   In comparison  the Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry s yield is 2 78   while the S P 500 s yield is 1 88  
Looking at dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  3 80 is up 7 3  from last year  Johnson   Johnson has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 6 34   Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Right now  Johnson   Johnson s payout ratio is 44   which means it paid out 44  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Looking at this fiscal year  JNJ expects solid earnings growth  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  8 60 per share  with earnings expected to increase 5 13  from the year ago period 
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for many reasons  they greatly improve stock investing profits  decrease overall portfolio risk  and carry tax advantages  among others  However  not all companies offer a quarterly payout 
For instance  it s a rare occurrence when a tech start up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend  It s more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends  Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  With that in mind  JNJ is a compelling investment opportunity  Not only is it a strong dividend play  but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3  Hold  ",2019-09-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/are-you-looking-for-a-highgrowth-dividend-stock-johnson--johnson-jnj-could-be-a-great-choice-200465724,200465724

198018,419534,JNJ,As Ebola threatens mega cities  vaccine stockpile needs grow,news,"By Kate Kelland LONDON  Dec 20  Reuters    Doubts are growing about whether the world s emergency stockpile of 300 000 Ebola vaccine doses is enough to control future epidemics as the deadly disease moves out of rural forest areas and into urban mega cities  Outbreak response experts at the World Health Organization  WHO  and at the vaccines alliance GAVI are already talking to the leading Ebola vaccine manufacturer  Merck  to reassess just how much larger global stocks need to be   We re actively engaged with the World Health Organization and with groups like GAVI  the U S  government and others to try to understand what will be an appropriate sized stockpile in the future   Merck s head of vaccines clinical research  Beth Ann Coller  said in a telephone interview  Supply of the Merck shot  which is currently being used to fight a large and spreading outbreak of Ebola in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo  is not a problem right now  according to the WHO s deputy director general of emergency preparedness and response  Peter Salama  But the nature of Ebola outbreaks is changing  he told Reuters  As the virus finds its way out of rural villages into populous urban settings  plans for how to contain it in future must change too   What I m concerned about is the medium  to long term stockpile  The figure of 300 000 was very much based on previous Ebola outbreaks where you never really had huge numbers of cases because they were in isolated  rural  populations  But now  we increasingly see Ebola in mega cities and towns     We need to view it now as an urban disease as well as a rural one   and therefore one requiring a different order of magnitude of preparations  including vaccines   he said  Merck s experimental Ebola vaccine  known as rVSV ZEBOV  is the furthest ahead in development  Another potential vaccine being developed by Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  could also eventually become part of the stockpile  global health officials say   Congo s two Ebola outbreaks this year illustrate the shifting nature of the threat  The first was relatively contained  infecting up to 54 people and killing 33 of them in an area of DRC s Equateur Province that is remote and sparsely populated   Several of the eight outbreaks before this one in Congo   including one in 2014 and another in 2017 both also in Equateur   were also quickly contained and limited in size   But this year s second outbreak in Congo   and the country s tenth since the virus was first identified there in 1976   is concentrated not in rural villages but in urban areas of the North Kivu and Ituri provinces   It has already infected more than 450 people  killed more than 270  and last month spread to Butembo  a densely populated city of about one million  This kind of prospect means global health emergency responders must  review our assumptions around Ebola   Salama said   If it were to take off in Butembo  or Goma  or  even worse  Kinshasa  we d be talking about a totally different issue in terms of     vaccine supplies required   Seth Berkley  chief executive of the GAVI vaccines alliance which has an agreement with Merck to ensure a current stockpile of 300 000 rVSV ZEBOV doses  told Reuters that around 40 000 doses had been used so far in the Congo outbreak   The emergency response is based on  ring vaccination  which aims to control an outbreak by identifying and offering the vaccine to contacts of anyone likely to be infected  This method uses relatively small numbers of vaccine doses and forms a human buffer of immunity to try to prevent spread of the disease  For now in Congo  Berkley said  there is no immediate need to boost the stockpile  But looking towards future inevitable outbreaks  the numbers would likely need to change   The challenge we would have   and this has been under discussion   is if we started to do community based vaccination in urban and semi urban areas  That s when the numbers would start to get quite big quite quickly   he told Reuters   Merck s shot has proven safe and effective in trials in West Africa but has yet to be approved for a license by U S  and European regulators  so is being used in the Congo outbreak under special emergency rules for experimental products  When it gets approval  which Coller hopes would be in 2019  it will be made at a newly built manufacturing plant in Germany

198022,419538,JNJ,After damaging Reuters report  J J doubles down on talc safety message,news,"By Mike Spector and Lisa Girion NEW YORK LOS ANGELES  Reuters    Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  Inc s statement was unequivocal   The FDA has tested Johnson s talc since the  70s  Every single time it did not contain asbestos   the company said in a Dec  19 tweet  It followed by several days the publication of a Reuters investigation    that found the healthcare conglomerate knew for decades that the carcinogen lurked in its Baby Powder and other cosmetic talc products  The tweet  posted under the handle  JNJNews  didn t mention that the U S  Food and Drug Administration  FDA  found traces of asbestos in the company s Shower to Shower talc in 1973  as revealed in agency documents  reviewed by Reuters  And it is only one of dozens of tweets conveying a similar message about talc safety since the Reuters article appeared Dec  14  The Reuters article prompted a stock selloff that erased about  40 billion from J J s market value in one day and created a public relations crisis as the blue chip healthcare conglomerate faced widespread questions about the possible health effects of one of its most iconic products  To reassure investors and consumers  J J has tweeted  posted on Facebook  NASDAQ FB   run a series of full page newspaper ads across the United States  published a lengthy rebuttal to the Reuters investigation on its website and announced a  5 billion stock buyback  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Alex Gorsky has appeared in a company video and on CNBC s  Mad Money  to reinforce the company s position  That position has been unwavering  J J insists that its Baby Powder is safe and has been asbestos free at least since regular testing began in the 1970s  The message doubles down on the stance the company has taken to defend against lawsuits in which about 11 700 plaintiffs allege that the J J talc they used in past decades caused their cancer  The company is pursuing this strategy despite the evidence that talc in its raw and finished powders sometimes tested positive for the carcinogen from the 1970s into the early 2000s   test results that the company didn t disclose to regulators or consumers  In response to a Reuters request for comment  the company said it is committed to defending the talc litigation   and that same  long term view is reflected in our ongoing communications that consistently point to the strong scientific evidence that our talc is and always has been safe   As for the 1973 Shower to Shower test  J J noted that the result didn t  reflect FDA s final determination about this sample  in a 1976 table summarizing the agency s early 1970s cosmetic talc testing  However  in that 1976 table  which Reuters examined  the FDA did not indicate any result  positive or negative  for the type of asbestos found in the Shower to Shower sample in 1973  Given the mass of litigation it faces  J J has little choice but to zealously dispute findings that its products sometimes contained traces of asbestos  said Eric Dezenhall  a crisis management consultant in Washington  D C   If your position in court is that the claims being made are false you can t just shrug your shoulders   he said  Soon after the Reuters article appeared  J J executives consulted crisis management experts  according to people familiar with the matter  Among the company s reasons for deciding to maintain its stance on absolute talc purity  these people said  was a conviction that a company known for putting health and safety first had the facts on its side  a litigation track record that included victories and mistrials  and the expectation that adverse verdicts will be overturned on appeal  THROUGH LAWYERS Many of J J s subsequent messages have mirrored the company s written responses to questions and findings Reuters presented to the company during its investigation  They deny that the company kept information from regulators and point to the many studies finding that talc is safe and doesn t cause cancer  Those earlier responses were composed by J J s outside litigators  led by Peter Bicks at Orrick  Herrington   Sutcliffe  and conveyed to Reuters by lawyers at a crisis management firm co founded by Lanny Davis  a lawyer who represented U S  President Bill Clinton in the 1990s and Michael Cohen  President Donald Trump s former attorney who has pleaded guilty to multiple criminal charges  Gorsky  in his appearance on  Mad Money   invoked J J s now legendary response to the Tylenol crisis as evidence that the company can be trusted to address any safety problems linked to its products  In 1982  J J moved decisively to pull all Tylenol from store shelves after seven people died from taking cyanide laced pills   I can t believe the company that took that dramatic of an action would allow a product that they felt in any way could be harmful to stay on the market   Gorsky told  Mad Money  host Jim Cramer   We unequivocally believe that our talc  our Baby Powder  does not contain asbestos   Citing the Tylenol recall provides  some reputational buffer   said Stephen A  Greyser  the Harvard Business School professor who wrote the first study of the company s handling of that crisis   But it is not a total protection  because it won t shield the company from a loss of trust if consumers or investors conclude the company hasn t been fully forthcoming in this case  he said  J J needs to guard against  reputational contagion   the risk that a loss of confidence in Baby Powder could bleed over into how consumers  shareholders and others view the company more broadly  Greyser added  The key difference between the two crises is that poisoned Tylenol presented a threat to consumers at the time  while the documented asbestos contamination of J J talc that Reuters investigated spanned from 1971 to the early 2000s  J J says that if it believed that Baby Powder today presented safety risks  it wouldn t hesitate to remove it from store shelves  given that the product accounts for less than 0 5  of annual revenue  The company joined its talc supplier  Imerys Talc America  a unit of Paris based Imerys SA  in requesting that a trial scheduled for January in St  Louis be delayed for  among other things  what they called  negative national and local news coverage  resulting from the Reuters investigation that would inevitably taint prospective jurors  The judge denied the motion  The same judge recently upheld a  4 69 billion jury award in a separate ovarian cancer case  which J J says it expects to be overturned on appeal  The judge said J J s promotion of a product that the evidence showed was contaminated with a known carcinogen was  particularly reprehensible   In an emailed statement  Imerys Talc America said it  is committed to the quality and safety of its products   and that rigorous research  overwhelmingly confirms that talc is safe  and no agency has asserted that talc causes cancer   UNDERMINED BY EVIDENCE Some of J J s messages in its recent campaign omit key details regarding findings on talc and  in certain instances  are undermined by other evidence  according to a Reuters review of the company s statements  The Dec  19 tweet claiming that the FDA s own tests never found asbestos in J J talc  for example  ignores an agency scientist s 1973 finding that a Shower to Shower sample contained asbestos fibers  according to a copy of an FDA report titled  Asbestos and Other Contaminants in Talc  and a deposition of a former J J head toxicologist  The FDA did not respond to questions for this article  citing a partial government shutdown  On CNBC  Gorsky said   We also not only used the best testing methodologies that were available  but we continued to improve them through the years   J J s testing methods do exceed the industry standard  But even so  as a geologist and frequent J J expert witness acknowledged in court this year  only a tiny fraction of the company s talc sold over the past 40 years has been tested using what is widely recognized as the best method to detect asbestos fibers  known as transmission electron microscopy  Plaintiffs  lawyers are already homing in on inconsistencies between J J s statements and other evidence regarding its talc  and they are planning to depose Gorsky in coming weeks   There is no flexibility in what they re saying   said Leigh O Dell  one of the lead lawyers representing plaintiffs in thousands of lawsuits against J J consolidated in a New Jersey federal court   Taking these statements on behalf of the company and pointing out to juries and judges the misrepresentations contained in those statements   I think you re going to see that in every case going forward  whether it s an ovarian cancer case or a mesothelioma case   One of J J s recent tweets criticized plaintiffs  lawyers   Far from a new theory or insight  plaintiffs  lawyers have resurrected a disproven argument about asbestos in our talc that dates to the 1970s   The Reuters investigation found that tests by J J s own contract labs and others periodically found small amounts of asbestos in talc from mines that supplied the mineral for Baby Powder as recently as the early 2000s  Some J J tweets and newspaper ads have adopted a question and answer format   What about the allegation you withheld safety information   the company said in a full page ad in USA Today the day after Christmas   It is false   the company said   All safety concerns are taken seriously  and we share all relevant information with regulators   Some Twitter users have responded to J J s tweets with praise and support  Others have referenced their relatives  longtime use of J J talc products and subsequent deaths from ovarian cancer   We re very sorry to hear this   J J responded to several Twitter users  expressing a desire to speak with them and offering a phone number to call  In response

198028,419544,JNJ,J J moves to limit impact of Reuters report on asbestos in Baby Powder,news,"By Mike Spector NEW YORK  Reuters    Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  on Monday scrambled to contain fallout from a Reuters report that the healthcare conglomerate knew for decades that cancer causing asbestos lurked in its Baby Powder  taking out full page newspaper ads defending its product and practices  and readying its chief executive for his first television interview since investors erased tens of billions of dollars from the company s market value  J J shares fell nearly 3 percent Monday  closing at  129 14 in New York Stock Exchange trading  That drop was on top of the 10 percent plunge that wiped out about  40 billion of the company s market capitalization following the Reuters report  Friday  J J also announced Monday that it would be repurchasing up to  5 billion of its common stock  Senator Edward Markey  a Massachusetts Democrat on the Environment and Public Works Committee  on Friday sent a letter to the head of the U S  Food and Drug Administration calling on the agency to investigate the findings in the Reuters report to determine whether J J misled regulators and whether its Baby Powder products threaten public health and safety  J J Chief Executive Alex Gorsky  in his first interview since the Reuters article was published  defended the company during an appearance on CNBC s  Mad Money  with host Jim Cramer on Monday night  J J knew for decades about the presence of small amounts of asbestos in its products dating back to as early as 1971  a Reuters examination of company memos  internal reports and other confidential documents showed  In response to the report  J J said on Friday that  any suggestion that Johnson   Johnson knew or hid information about the safety of talc is false   A Monday full page ad from J J    headlined  Science  Not sensationalism      ran in newspapers including The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal  The ad asserted that J J has scientific evidence its talc is safe and beneficial to use   If we had any reasons to believe our talc was unsafe  it would be off our shelves   the ad said  J J rebutted Reuters  report in a lengthy written critique of the article and a video from Gorsky  In the written critique  posted on the company s website   J J said Reuters omitted information it supplied to the news organization that demonstrated the healthcare conglomerate s Baby Powder is safe and does not cause cancer  that J J s baby powder has repeatedly been tested and found to be asbestos free  and that the company has cooperated with the U S  FDA and other regulators around the world to provide information requested over decades   Since tests for asbestos in talc were first developed  J J s Baby Powder has never contained asbestos   Gorsky said in the video   He added that regulators  have always found our talc to be asbestos free   A Reuters spokeswoman on Monday said the agency  stands by its reporting   Reuters  investigation found that while most tests in past decades found no asbestos in J J talc and talc products  tests on Baby Powder conducted by scientists at Mount Sinai Medical Center in 1971 and Rutgers University in 1991  as well as by labs for plaintiffs in cancer lawsuits  found small amounts of asbestos  In 1972  a University of Minnesota scientist found what he called  incontrovertible asbestos  in a sample of Shower to Shower  Other tests by J J s own contract labs and others periodically found small amounts of asbestos in talc from mines that supplied the mineral for Baby Powder and other cosmetic products into the early 2000s   The company did not report to the FDA three tests by three different labs from 1972 to 1975 that found asbestos in the company s talc  The Reuters story drew no conclusions about whether talc itself causes ovarian cancer  Asbestos  however  is a carcinogen  The World Health Organization s International Agency for Research on Cancer has listed asbestos contaminated talc as a carcinogen since 1987  Reuters also found that J J tested only a fraction of the talc powder it sold  The company never adopted a method for increasing the sensitivity of its tests that was recommended to the company by consultants in 1973 and in a published report in a peer review scientific journal in 1991  The ad J J ran in newspapers Monday also pointed to an online talc fact page the company created with  independent studies from leading universities  research from medical journals and third party opinions   That website has changed since early December  according to a Reuters review of online archives  The website  for instance  no longer contains a section headlined  Conclusions from Global Authorities  that as recently as Dec  5 listed organizations including the U S  FDA  the European Union and Health Canada as among entities that have  reviewed and analyzed all available data and concluded that the evidence is insufficient to link talc use to cancer   On Dec  14  the day Reuters published its report  that section of the website had been removed  It is not clear exactly when the online page changed  The Canadian government released a draft report this month that found a  consistent and statistically significant positive association  between talc exposure and ovarian cancer  The draft report also said that talc meets criteria to be deemed toxic  The draft report put forth proposed conclusions that are subject to a public comment period and confirmation in a so called final screening assessment  Health Canada said  If the conclusions are confirmed  Canadian officials will consider adding talc to a government list of toxic substances and implementing measures to prohibit or restrict use of talc in some cosmetics  non prescription drugs and natural health products  Health Canada said   A J J spokeswoman said the company removed the website section after the Canadian government issued the draft report   We chose to be conservative while that draft is under review   the spokeswoman said

198032,419548,JNJ,Large U S  Stocks May Be Underestimating  Worldwide Manufacturing Recession,opinion,"Global manufacturing data have been exceedingly grim  One would be hard pressed to find a country in Europe  Asia or North America that is exporting products with little difficulty 
If the United States wishes to export products at a higher clip  we d require partners with the means to afford our products  Yet the U S  dollar s strength alongside foreign tariffs is impeding the process 





One might think that the dollar s strength would be helpful in importing products from other countries  At the moment  however  a wide range of imported goods have been tagged with tariffs that wind up costing end using consumers a whole lot more money 
For the most part  the U S  consumer has been strong and resilient  On the other hand  if we re not acquiring enough goods from places like the United Kingdom and Germany  it may adversely affect jobs stateside 





Consider the manufacturing recessions that are burgeoning in Europe   See the charts below   Readings below 50 represent contraction 





Notice that I have not even mentioned the elephant in the global room  China  The world s 2nd largest economy is not just our trading partner  but it is pivotal in nearly everything that transpires across the Asia Pacific region 
The fact that China s economy is now growing at its slowest pace in 27 years is downright devastating  One might even take notice that the last two times that Chinese GDP fell to these levels   2000 and 2008   the U S  experience significant economic downturns 





Importantly  the U S  manufacturing segment recently began contracting like the rest of the world   Some may dismiss the reality because we are a consumer oriented society  Others may point to the recessionary pressures in U S  manufacturing from 2013 and 2016  where broader based contraction did not come to pass 
There are differences  however  Throughout the early 2010s  the U S  engaged in  emergency  level stimulus with zero percent rate policy and quantitative easing  In a similar vein  nearly every major central bank in the world  double downed  on more quantitative easing stimulus  QE  in 2016  What s more  in 2016  fiscal stimulus via tax cut promises occurred alongside a Republican sweep of the branches of government 





Here in 2019  Congress is unlikely to authorize any fiscal packages prior to the 2020 election  As for monetary stimulus  dissent at the Federal Reserve would likely restrict voting members to a more subtle rate cutting trajectory   They d require more evidence of an industry wide recession that has spread beyond manufacturing before throwing in the towel and kick starting more QE 
Still  it is clear that the U S  manufacturing slowdown is adversely impacting the U S  economy at large  Take a look at the rather dramatic slide in S P 500 per share estimates in 2019 





An optimist might choose to look at the absolute levels of the S P 500  A mere 3  off of all time highs  Surely U S  stocks would be down much more than that if we were closing in on an industry wide recession beyond the manufacturing segment  Wouldn t they 
It is worth remembering that the S P 500 was only 5  off of its all time record at the time that the Great Recession began in December of 2007  It is also worth remembering that the experts in charge of identifying receptions were nearly 12 months late in declaring the Great Recession s reception  It was not until 12 1 2008 when NBER finally announced that a recession had started roughly one year earlier 





It is fair to say that we may be underestimating the impact of a worldwide slowdown on the U S  economy and U S  asset prices  Some will tell you that  17 trillion in negative interest rate bonds are not suggesting that something s awry  Others will dismiss the fact that every maturity on the U S  Treasury curve has inverted below the overnight lending rate 





Is the global bond market truly wrong  Or have U S  large cap stocks simply stayed late at a party that actually ended more than 19 months ago in January of 2018 
Credit spreads between Treasury bonds and corporate bonds tend to widen significantly before a full fledged recession  One has come to expect a widening of roughly 500 basis points  The reality that spreads remain tight and that a flight away from corporate bonds has yet to occur is a prominent positive for risk takers 





Still  a reversal could happen very quickly  Moreover  the bulk of data  including the resurgence of gold  is hinting at some amount of risk reduction 
For the bulk of my near retiree and retiree client base  we still maintain roughly 48  50  in equity  including assets like Vanguard Dividend Appreciation  NYSE VIG   iShares Minimum Volatility Global  NYSE ACWV   iShares U S  REIT  NYSE USRT  and Vanguard MegaCap  NYSE MGC   We also see value in a few individual companies like Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  
In the income space  we have a wide variety of preferreds  including Van Eck Preferred EX Financial  NYSE PFXF  and individual names like STANLEY BLACK   DECKER INC 5 75  PRF 2052   NYSE SWJ   We ve also held on to income mainstays such as iShares Core U S  Treasury  NYSE GOVT  as well as iShares Aaa A Rated Corporate Bond  NYSE QLTA   as well as cash equivalents like SPDR Bloomberg  Barclays   LON BARC  1 3 Month T Bill ETF  NYSE BIL  
Keep in mind  if we believed that we were early in the credit cycle  we would likely be looking for 65  growth 35  income as well as a much wider array of risk assets  However  the likelihood is that we are very late in the credit cycle  This means we are keenly aware of the potential for things to devolve  We would not hesitate to cut our allocation to stocks and other risks if our outlook called for greater portfolio protection

198033,419549,JNJ,Mallinckrodt  MNK  To Resolve Opioid Cases With Ohio Counties,opinion,"Mallinckrodt plc   NYSE MNK   announced that it has reached a settlement in principle with Cuyahoga and Summit Counties in Ohio in connection with lawsuits pending in multidistrict opioid litigation  MDL  
The settlement will fully resolve the Track 1 Cases against Mallinckrodt and subsidiaries that are scheduled to go to trial in October 2019 in the MDL  Per the terms  Mallinckrodt will pay a total sum of  24 million in cash and donate  6 million in generic products including addiction treatment products 
Consequently  cases against all entities will be dismissed 
The resolution of the Track 1 Cases will provide Mallinckrodt with adequate time to resolve its pending opioid lawsuits 
Last week  shares of Mallinckrodt plummeted following a Bloomberg report that suggested its restructuring plans  It also stated that the company may file for bankruptcy to limit its liabilities related to the pending opioid litigations 
Per the report  Mallinckrodt hired restructuring advisers to explore options that could help avoid the multi district litigation scheduled in October  The company is mulling over insolvency if costs become unwieldy  Moreover  its high debt levels make matters worse as it is a prospective threat in case a settlement is reached or a penalty is slapped by the court  The company may also divest its generic business  which includes opioid drugs 
Mallinckrodt s shares have tanked 88 4  so far this year compared with the  s fall of 6 7  due to pricing pressure in the generic segment and the rising menace of penalties regarding litigations 

 
Apart from Mallinckrodt  many pharma companies like Endo International   NASDAQ ENDP   and Teva Pharma   NYSE TEVA   are embroiled in multiple opioid litigations filed by several states  counties and other political subdivisions in the United States in relation to the abuse of opioid based drugs  These industry players are accused of faulty marketing practices  which downplayed the risk of addiction from these drugs and boosted their consumption instead 
Earlier  Johnson   Johnson   NYSE JNJ   received an unfavorable ruling in the court case filed by the state authorities of Oklahoma pertaining to the abuse of its opioid based drugs  namely Duragesic  Nucynta and Nucynta ER  The Cleveland County District Court charged JNJ a fine of  572 million

198043,419559,JNJ,Special Report  J J knew for decades that asbestos lurked in its Baby Powder,news,By Lisa Girion LOS ANGELES  Reuters    Darlene Coker knew she was dying  She just wanted to know why  She knew that her cancer  mesothelioma  arose in the delicate membrane surrounding her lungs and other organs  She knew it was as rare as it was deadly  a signature of exposure to asbestos  And she knew it afflicted mostly men who inhaled asbestos dust in mines and industries such as shipbuilding that used the carcinogen before its risks were understood  Coker  52 years old  had raised two daughters and was running a massage school in Lumberton  a small town in eastern Texas  How had she been exposed to asbestos   She wanted answers   her daughter Cady Evans said  Fighting for every breath and in crippling pain  Coker hired Herschel Hobson  a personal injury lawyer  He homed in on a suspect  the Johnson s Baby Powder that Coker had used on her infant children and sprinkled on herself all her life  Hobson knew that talc and asbestos often occurred together in the earth  and that mined talc could be contaminated with the carcinogen  Coker sued Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ   alleging that  poisonous talc  in the company s beloved product was her killer  J J denied the claim  Baby Powder was asbestos free  it said  As the case proceeded  J J was able to avoid handing over talc test results and other internal company records Hobson had requested to make the case against Baby Powder  Coker had no choice but to drop her lawsuit  Hobson said   When you are the plaintiff  you have the burden of proof   he said   We didn t have it   That was in 1999  Two decades later  the material Coker and her lawyer sought is emerging as J J has been compelled to share thousands of pages of company memos  internal reports and other confidential documents with lawyers for some of the 11 700 plaintiffs now claiming that the company s talc caused their cancers   including thousands of women with ovarian cancer  A Reuters examination of many of those documents  as well as deposition and trial testimony  shows that from at least 1971 to the early 2000s  the company s raw talc and finished powders sometimes tested positive for small amounts of asbestos  and that company executives  mine managers  scientists  doctors and lawyers fretted over the problem and how to address it while failing to disclose it to regulators or the public  The documents also depict successful efforts to influence U S  regulators  plans to limit asbestos in cosmetic talc products and scientific research on the health effects of talc  A small portion of the documents have been produced at trial and cited in media reports  Many were shielded from public view by court orders that allowed J J to turn over thousands of documents it designated as confidential  Much of their contents is reported here for the first time   RATHER HIGH  The earliest mentions of tainted J J talc that Reuters found come from 1957 and 1958 reports by a consulting lab  They describe contaminants in talc from J J s Italian supplier as fibrous and  acicular   or needle like  tremolite  That s one of the six minerals that in their naturally occurring fibrous form are classified as asbestos  At various times from then into the early 2000s  reports by scientists at J J  outside labs and J J s supplier yielded similar findings  The reports identify contaminants in talc and finished powder products as asbestos or describe them in terms typically applied to asbestos  such as  fiberform  and  rods   In 1976  as the U S  Food and Drug Administration  FDA  was weighing limits on asbestos in cosmetic talc products  J J assured the regulator that no asbestos was  detected in any sample  of talc produced between December 1972 and October 1973  It didn t tell the agency that at least three tests by three different labs from 1972 to 1975 had found asbestos in its talc   in one case at levels reported as  rather high   Most internal J J asbestos test reports Reuters reviewed do not find asbestos  However  while J J s testing methods improved over time  they have always had limitations that allow trace contaminants to go undetected   and only a tiny fraction of the company s talc is tested  The World Health Organization and other authorities recognize no safe level of exposure to asbestos  While most people exposed never develop cancer  for some  even small amounts of asbestos are enough to trigger the disease years later  Just how small hasn t been established  Many plaintiffs allege that the amounts they inhaled when they dusted themselves with tainted talcum powder were enough  The evidence of what J J knew has surfaced after people who suspected that talc caused their cancers hired lawyers experienced in the decades long deluge of litigation involving workers exposed to asbestos  Some of the lawyers knew from those earlier cases that talc producers tested for asbestos  and they began demanding J J s testing documentation  What J J produced in response to those demands has allowed plaintiffs  lawyers to refine their argument  The culprit wasn t necessarily talc itself  but also asbestos in the talc  That assertion  backed by decades of solid science showing that asbestos causes mesothelioma and is associated with ovarian and other cancers  has had mixed success in court  In two cases earlier this year   in New Jersey and California   juries awarded big sums to plaintiffs who  like Coker  blamed asbestos tainted J J talc products for their mesothelioma  A third verdict  in St  Louis  was a watershed  broadening J J s potential liability  The 22 plaintiffs were the first to succeed with a claim that asbestos tainted Baby Powder and Shower to Shower talc  a longtime brand the company sold in 2012  caused ovarian cancer  which is much more common than mesothelioma  The jury awarded them  4 69 billion in damages  Most of the talc cases have been brought by women with ovarian cancer who say they regularly used J J talc products as a perineal antiperspirant and deodorant  At the same time  at least three juries have rejected claims that Baby Powder was tainted with asbestos or caused plaintiffs  mesothelioma  Others have failed to reach verdicts  resulting in mistrials   JUNK  SCIENCE J J has said it will appeal the recent verdicts against it  It has maintained in public statements that its talc is safe  as shown for years by the best tests available  and that the information it has been required to divulge in recent litigation shows the care the company takes to ensure its products are asbestos free  It has blamed its losses on juror confusion   junk  science  unfair court rules and overzealous lawyers looking for a fresh pool of asbestos plaintiffs   Plaintiffs  attorneys out for personal financial gain are distorting historical documents and intentionally creating confusion in the courtroom and in the media   Ernie Knewitz  J J s vice president of global media relations  wrote in an emailed response to Reuters  findings   This is all a calculated attempt to distract from the fact that thousands of independent tests prove our talc does not contain asbestos or cause cancer  Any suggestion that Johnson   Johnson knew or hid information about the safety of talc is false   J J declined to comment further for this article  For more than two months  it turned down repeated requests for an interview with J J executives  On Dec  8  the company offered to make an expert available  It had not done so as of Thursday evening  The company referred all inquiries to its outside litigation counsel  Peter Bicks  In emailed responses  Bicks rejected Reuters  findings as  false and misleading    The scientific consensus is that the talc used in talc based body powders does not cause cancer  regardless of what is in that talc   Bicks wrote   This is true even if   and it does not   Johnson   Johnson s cosmetic talc had ever contained minute  undetectable amounts of asbestos   He dismissed tests cited in this article as  outlier  results  In court  J J lawyers have told jurors that company records showing that asbestos was detected in its talc referred to talc intended for industrial use  Other records  they have argued  referred to non asbestos forms of the same minerals that their experts say are harmless  J J has also argued that some tests picked up  background  asbestos   stray fibers that could have contaminated samples after floating into a mill or lab from a vehicle clutch or fraying insulation  The company has made some of the same arguments about lab tests conducted by experts hired by plaintiffs  One of those labs found asbestos in Shower to Shower talc from the 1990s  according to an Aug  11  2017  court report  Another lab found asbestos in more than half of multiple samples of Baby Powder from past decades   in bottles from plaintiffs  cupboards and acquired from eBay  NASDAQ EBAY   and even a 1978 bottle held in J J s corporate museum  The concentrations were great enough that users  would have  more likely than not  been exposed   the plaintiffs  lab report presented in several cases this year concluded  Matthew Sanchez  a geologist with consultants RJ Lee Group Inc and a frequent expert witness for J J  dismissed those findings in testimony in the St  Louis trial   I have not found asbestos in any of the current or modern  what I consider modern  Johnson   Johnson talc products   Sanchez told the jury  Sanchez did not return calls seeking comment  RJ Lee said it does not comment on the work it does for clients  Since 2003  talc in Baby Powder sold in the United States has come from China through supplier Imerys SA  a co defendant in most of the talc litigation  Both companies said the Chinese talc is safe  An Imerys spokesman said the Paris based company s tests  consistently show no asbestos  Talc s safe use has been confirmed by multiple regulatory and scientific bodies   J J  based in New Brunswick  New Jersey  has dominated the talc powder market for more than 100 years  its sales outpacing those of all competitors combined  according to Euromonitor International data  And while talc products contributed just  420 million to J J s  76 5 billion in revenue last year  Baby Powder is considered an essential facet of the healthcare products maker s carefully tended image as a caring company   a  sacred cow   as one 2003 internal email put it   When people really understand what s going on  I think it increases J J s exposure a thousand fold   said Mark Lanier  one of the lawyers for the women in the St  Louis case  The mounting controversy surrounding J J talc hasn t shaken investors  The share price is up about 6 percent so far this year  Talc cases make up fewer than 10 percent of all personal injury lawsuits pending against J J  based on the company s Aug  2 quarterly report  in which the company said it believed it had  strong grounds on appeal   J J Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Alex Gorsky has pledged to fight on  telling analysts in July   We remain confident that our products do not contain asbestos   Gorsky s comment  echoed in countless J J statements  misses a crucial point  Asbestos  like many environmental carcinogens  has a long latency period  Diagnosis usually comes years after initial exposure   20 years or longer for mesothelioma  J J talc products today may be safe  but the talc at issue in thousands of lawsuits was sold and used over the past 60 years   SAFETY FIRST  In 1886  Robert Wood Johnson enlisted his younger brothers in an eponymous startup built around the  Safety First  motto  Johnson s Baby Powder grew out of a line of medicated plasters  sticky rubber strips loaded with mustard and other home remedies  When customers complained of skin irritation  the brothers sent packets of talc  Soon  mothers began applying the talc to infants  diaper chafed skin  The Johnsons took note  They added a fragrance that would become one of the most recognizable in the world  sifted the talc into tin boxes and  in 1893  began selling it as Johnson s Baby Powder  In the late 1950s  J J discovered that talc from its chief source mine for the U S  market in the Italian Alps contained tremolite  That s one of six minerals   along with chrysotile  actinolite  amosite  anthophyllite and crocidolite   that occur in nature as crystalline fibers known as asbestos  a recognized carcinogen  Some of them  including tremolite  also occur as unremarkable  non asbestiform  rocks  Both forms often occur together and in talc deposits  J J s worry at the time was that contaminants made the company s powder abrasive  It sent tons of its Italian talc to a private lab in Columbus  Ohio  to find ways to improve the appearance  feel and purity of the powder by removing as much  grit  as possible  In a pair of reports from 1957 and 1958  the lab said the talc contained  from less than 1 percent to about 3 percent of contaminants   described as mostly fibrous and  acicular  tremolite  Most of the authors of these and other J J records cited in this article are dead  Sanchez  the RJ Lee geologist whose firm has agreed to provide him as a witness in up to 100 J J talc trials  has testified that tremolite found decades ago in the company s talc  from Italy and later Vermont  was not tremolite asbestos at all  Rather  he has said  it was  cleavage fragments  from non asbestiform tremolite  J J s original records don t always make that distinction  In terms of health risk  regulators since the early 1970s have treated small fiber shaped particles of both forms the same  The U S  Environmental Protection Agency  for example   makes no distinction between fibers and  comparable  cleavage fragments   agency officials wrote in a response to an RJ Lee report on an unrelated matter in 2006  the year before the firm hired Sanchez  The Occupational Safety and Health Administration  OSHA   though it dropped the non fibrous forms of the minerals from its definition of asbestos in 1992  nonetheless recommends that fiber shaped fragments indistinguishable from asbestos be counted in its exposure tests  And as the product safety director for J J s talc supplier acknowledged in a 2008 email to colleagues    I f a deposit contains  non asbestiform  tremolite  there is also asbestiform tremolite naturally present as well    THE LUNGS OF BABIES  In 1964  J J s Windsor Minerals Inc subsidiary bought a cluster of talc mines in Vermont  with names like Argonaut  Rainbow  Frostbite and Black Bear  By 1966  it was blasting and bulldozing white rock out of the Green Mountain state  J J used the milled powder in its cosmetic powders and sold a less refined grade to roofing  flooring and tire companies for use in manufacturing  Ten years after tremolite turned up in the Italian talc  it showed up in Vermont talc  too  In 1967  J J found traces of tremolite and another mineral that can occur as asbestos  according to a table attached to a Nov  1  1967  memo by William Ashton  the executive in charge of J J s talc supply for decades  J J continued to search for sources of clean talc  But in an April 9  1969  memo to a company doctor  Ashton said it was  normal  to find tremolite in many U S  talc deposits  He suggested J J rethink its approach   Historically  in our Company  Tremolite has been bad   Ashton wrote   How bad is Tremolite medically  and how much of it can safely be in a talc base we might develop   Since pulmonary disease  including cancer  appeared to be on the rise   it would seem to be prudent to limit any possible content of Tremolite   to an absolute minimum   came the reply from another physician executive days later  The doctor told Ashton that J J was receiving safety questions from pediatricians  Even Robert Wood Johnson II  the founder s son and then retired CEO  had expressed  concern over the possibility of the adverse effects on the lungs of babies or mothers   he wrote   We have replied   the doctor wrote  that  we would not regard the usage of our powders as presenting any hazard   Such assurances would be impossible  he added   if we do include Tremolite in more than unavoidable trace amounts   The memo is the earliest J J document reviewed by Reuters that discusses tremolite as more than a scratchy nuisance  The doctor urged Ashton to consult with company lawyers because  it is not inconceivable that we could become involved in litigation   NEVER  100  CLEAN  By the early 1970s  asbestos was widely recognized as the primary cause of mesothelioma among workers involved in producing it and in industries that used it in their products  Regulation was in the air  In 1972  President Richard Nixon s newly created OSHA issued its first rule  setting limits on workplace exposure to asbestos dust  By then  a team at Mount Sinai Medical Center led by pre eminent asbestos researcher Irving Selikoff had started looking at talcum powders as a possible solution to a puzzle  Why were tests of lung tissue taken post mortem from New Yorkers who never worked with asbestos finding signs of the mineral  Since talc deposits are often laced with asbestos  the scientists reasoned  perhaps talcum powders played a role  They shared their preliminary findings with New York City s environmental protection chief  Jerome Kretchmer  On June 29  1971  Kretchmer informed the Nixon administration and called a press conference to announce that two unidentified brands of cosmetic talc appeared to contain asbestos  The FDA opened an inquiry  J J issued a statement   Our fifty years of research knowledge in this area indicates that there is no asbestos contained in the powder manufactured by Johnson   Johnson   Later that year  another Mount Sinai researcher  mineralogist Arthur Langer  told J J in a letter that the team had found a  relatively small  amount of chrysotile asbestos in Baby Powder  Langer  Selikoff and Kretchmer ended up on a J J list of  antagonistic personalities  in a Nov  29  1972  memo  which described Selikoff as the leader of an  attack on talc    I suppose I was antagonistic   Langer told Reuters  Even so  in a subsequent test of J J powders in 1976  he didn t find asbestos   a result that Mount Sinai announced  Langer said he told J J lawyers who visited him last year that he stood by all of his findings  J J has not called him as a witness  Selikoff died in 1992  Kretchmer said he recently read that a jury had concluded that Baby Powder was contaminated with asbestos   I said to myself   How come it took so long     he said  In July 1971  meanwhile  J J sent a delegation of scientists to Washington to talk to the FDA officials looking into asbestos in talcum powders  According to an FDA account of the meeting  J J shared  evidence that their talc contains less than 1   if any  asbestos   Later that month  Wilson Nashed  one of the J J scientists who visited the FDA  said in a memo to the company s public relations department that J J s talc contained trace amounts of  fibrous minerals  tremolite actinolite     INCONTROVERTIBLE ASBESTOS  As the FDA continued to investigate asbestos in talc  J J sent powder samples to be tested at private and university labs  Though a private lab in Chicago found trace amounts of tremolite  it declared the amount  insignificant  and the samples  substantially free of asbestiform material   J J reported that finding to the FDA under a cover letter that said the  results clearly show  the samples tested  contain no chrysotile asbestos   J J s lawyer told Reuters the tremolite found in the samples was not asbestos  But J J s FDA submission left out University of Minnesota professor Thomas E  Hutchinson s finding of chrysotile in a Shower to Shower sample    incontrovertible asbestos   as he described it in a lab note  The FDA s own examinations found no asbestos in J J powder samples in the 1f970s  Those tests  however  did not use the most sensitive detection methods  An early test  for example  was incapable of detecting chrysotile fibers  as an FDA official recognized in a J J account of an Aug  11  1972  meeting with the agency   I understand that some samples will be passed even though they contain such fibers  but we are willing to live with it   By 1973  Tom Shelley  director of J J s Central Research Laboratories in New Jersey  was looking into acquiring patents on a process that a British mineralogist and J J consultant was developing to separate talc from tremolite   It is quite possible that eventually tremolite will be prohibited in all talc   Shelley wrote on Feb  20  1973  to a British colleague  Therefore  he added  the  process may well be valuable property to us   At the end of March  Shelley recognized the sensitivity of the plan in a memo sent to a J J lawyer in New Jersey   We will want to carefully consider the   patents re asbestos in talc  It s quite possible that we may wish to keep the whole thing confidential rather than allow it to be published in patent form and thus let the whole world know   J J did not obtain the patents  While Shelley was looking into the patents  J J research director DeWitt Petterson visited the company s Vermont mining operation   Occasionally  sub trace quantities of tremolite or actinolite are identifiable   he wrote in an April 1973 report on the visit   And these might be classified as asbestos fiber   J J should  protect our powder franchise  by eliminating as many tiny fibers that can be inhaled in airborne talc dust as possible  Petterson wrote  He warned  however  that  no final product will ever be made which will be totally free from respirable particles   Introducing a cornstarch version of Baby Powder  he noted   is obviously another answer   Bicks told Reuters that J J believes that the tremolite and actinolite Petterson cited were not asbestos  Cornstarch came up again in a March 5  1974  report in which Ashton  the J J talc supply chief  recommended that the company research that alternative  for defensive reasons  because  the thrust against talc has centered primarily on biological problems alleged to result from the inhalation of talc and related mineral particles    WE MAY HAVE PROBLEMS  A few months after Petterson s recognition that talc purity was a pipe dream  the FDA proposed a rule that talc used in drugs contain no more than 0 1 percent asbestos  While the agency s cosmetics division was considering similar action on talcum powders  it asked companies to suggest testing methods  At the time  J J s Baby Powder franchise was consuming 20 000 tons of Vermont talc a year  J J pressed the FDA to approve an X ray scanning technique that a company scientist said in an April 1973 memo allowed for  an automatic 1  tolerance for asbestos   That would mean talc with up to 10 times the FDA s proposed limit for asbestos in drugs could pass muster  The same scientist confided in an Oct  23  1973  note to a colleague that  depending on what test the FDA adopted for detecting asbestos in cosmetic talc   we may have problems   The best way to detect asbestos in talc was to concentrate the sample and then examine it through microscopes  the Colorado School of Mines Research Institute told J J in a Dec  27  1973  report  In a memo  a J J lab supervisor said the concentration technique  which the company s own researchers had earlier used to identify a  tremolite type  asbestos in Vermont talc  had one limitation   It may be too sensitive   In his email to Reuters  J J s lawyer said the lab supervisor s concern was that the test would result in  false positives   showing asbestos where there was none  J J also launched research to find out how much powder a baby was exposed to during a diapering and how much asbestos could be in that powder and remain within OSHA s new workplace exposure limits  Its researchers had strapped an air sampling device to a doll to take measurements while it was powdered  according to J J memos and the minutes of a Feb  19  1974  meeting of the Cosmetic Toiletry and Fragrance Association  CTFA   an industry group   It was calculated that even if talc were pure asbestos the levels of exposure of a baby during a normal powdering are far below the accepted tolerance limits   the minutes state  In a Sept  6  1974  letter  J J told the FDA that since  a substantial safety factor can be expected  with talc that contains 1 percent asbestos   methods capable of determining less than 1  asbestos in talc are not necessary to assure the safety of cosmetic talc   Not everyone at the FDA thought that basing a detection method on such a calculation was a good idea  One official called it  foolish   adding  according to a J J account of a February 1975 meeting   No mother was going to powder her baby with 1  of a known carcinogen irregardless of the large safety factor   PUSH FOR SELF REGULATION Having failed to persuade the FDA that up to 1 percent asbestos contamination was tolerable  J J began promoting self policing as an alternative to regulation  The centerpiece of this approach was a March 15  1976  package of letters from J J and other manufacturers that the CTFA gave to the agency to show that they had succeeded at eliminating asbestos from cosmetic talc   The attached letters demonstrate responsibility of industry in monitoring its talcs   the cover letter said   We are certain that the summary will give you assurance as to the freedom from contamination by asbestos for materials of cosmetic talc products   In its letter  J J said samples of talc produced between December 1972 and October 1973 were tested for asbestos  and none was detected  in any sample   J J didn t tell the FDA about a 1974 test by a professor at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire that turned up asbestos in talc from J J    fiberform  actinolite  as he put it  Nor did the company tell the FDA about a 1975 report from its longtime lab that found particles identified as  asbestos fibers  in five of 17 samples of talc from the chief source mine for Baby Powder   Some of them seem rather high   the private lab wrote in its cover letter  Bicks  the J J lawyer  said the contract lab s results were irrelevant because the talc was intended for industrial use  He said the company now believes that the actinolite the Dartmouth professor found  was not asbestiform   based on its interpretation of a photo in the original lab report  Just two months after the Dartmouth professor reported his findings  Windsor Minerals Research and Development Manager Vernon Zeitz wrote that chrysotile   fibrous anthophyllite  and other types of asbestos had been  found in association with the Hammondsville ore body    the Vermont deposit that supplied Baby Powder talc for more than two decades  Zeitz s May 1974 report on efforts to minimize asbestos in Vermont talc  strongly urged  the adoption of ways to protect  against what are currently considered to be materials presenting a severe health hazard and are potentially present in all talc ores in use at this time   Bicks said that Zeitz was not reporting on actual test results  The following year  Zeitz reported that based on weekly tests of talc samples over six months   it can be stated with a greater than 99 9  certainty that the ores and materials produced from the ores at all Windsor Mineral locations are free from asbestos or asbestiform minerals    MISREPRESENTATION BY OMISSION  J J s selective use of test results figured in a New Jersey judge s decision this year to affirm the first verdict against the company in a case claiming asbestos in J J products caused cancer   Providing the FDA favorable results showing no asbestos and withholding or failing to provide unfavorable results  which show asbestos  is a form of a misrepresentation by omission   Middlesex County Superior Court Judge Ana Viscomi said in her June ruling   J J respectfully disagrees with the Judge s comments   Bicks said   J J did not withhold any relevant testing from FDA   The FDA declined to comment on the ruling  Lacking consensus on testing methods  the FDA postponed action to limit asbestos in talc  Years later  it did set limits on asbestos in talc used in drugs  It has never limited asbestos in cosmetic talc or established a preferred method for detecting it  Instead  in 1976  a CTFA committee chaired by a J J executive drafted voluntary guidelines  establishing a form of X ray scanning with a 0 5 percent detection limit as the primary test  the method J J preferred  The method is not designed to detect the most commonly used type of asbestos  chrysotile  at all  The group said the more sensitive electron microscopy was impractical  The CTFA  which now does business as the Personal Care Products Council  declined to comment  X ray scanning is the primary method J J has used for decades  The company also periodically requires the more sensitive checks with electron microscopes  J J s lawyer said the company s tests exceed the trade association standard  and they do  He also said that today  J J s X ray scans can detect suspect minerals at levels as low as 0 1 percent of a sample  But the company never adopted the Colorado lab s 1973 recommendation that samples be concentrated before examination under a microscope  And the talc samples that were subjected to the most sensitive electron microscopy test were a tiny fraction of what was sold  For those and other reasons  J J couldn t guarantee its Baby Powder was asbestos free when plaintiffs used it  according to experts  including some who testified for plaintiffs  As early as 1976  Ashton  J J s longtime talc overseer  recognized as much in a memo to colleagues  He wrote that talc in general  if subjected to the most sensitive testing method  using concentrated samples   will be hard pressed in supporting purity claims   He described this sort of testing as both  sophisticated  and  disturbing    FREE OF HAZARD  By 1977  J J appeared to have tamped down concerns about the safety of talc  An internal August report on J J s  Defense of Talc Safety  campaign noted that independent authorities had deemed cosmetic talc products to be  free of hazard   It attributed  this growing opinion  to the dissemination to scientific and medical communities in the United States and Britain of  favorable data from the various J J sponsored studies   In 1984  FDA cosmetics chief and former J J employee Heinz Eiermann reiterated that view  He told the New York Times that the agency s investigation a decade earlier had prompted the industry to ensure that talc was asbestos free   So in subsequent analyses   he told the paper   we really could not identify asbestos or only on very rare occasions   Two years later  the FDA rejected a citizen request that cosmetic talc carry an asbestos warning label  saying that even if there were trace contamination  the use of talc powder during two years of normal diapering would not increase the risk of cancer  In 1980  J J began offering a cornstarch version of Baby Powder   to expand its customer base to people who prefer cornstarch  the company says  The persistence of the industry s view that cosmetic talc is asbestos free is why no studies have been conducted on the incidence of mesothelioma among users of the products  It s also partly why regulations that protect people in mines  mills  factories and schools from asbestos laden talc don t apply to babies and others exposed to cosmetic talc   even though Baby Powder talc has at times come from the same mines as talc sold for industrial use  J J says cosmetic talc is more thoroughly processed and thus purer than industrial talc  Until recently  the American Cancer Society  ACS  accepted the industry s position  saying on its website   All talcum products used in homes have been asbestos free since the 1970s   After receiving inquiries from Reuters  the ACS in early December revised its website to remove the assurance that cosmetic talcs are free of asbestos  Now  it says  quoting the industry s standards  that all cosmetic talc products in the United States  should be free from detectable amounts of asbestos   The revised ACS web page also notes that the World Health Organization s International Agency for Research on Cancer classifies talc that contains asbestos as  carcinogenic to humans   Despite the success of J J s efforts to promote the safety of its talc  the company s test lab found asbestos fibers in samples taken from the Vermont operation in 1984  1985 and 1986  Bicks said   The samples that we know of during this time period that contained a fiber or two of asbestos were not cosmetic talc samples   Then  in 1992  three years after J J sold its Vermont mines  the new owner  Cyprus Minerals  said in an internal report on  important environmental issues  in its talc reserves that there was  past tremolite  in the Hammondsville deposit  Hammondsville was the primary source of Baby Powder talc from 1966 until its shutdown in 1990  Bicks rejected the Cyprus report as hearsay  saying there is no original documentation to confirm it  Hammondsville mine records  according to a 1993 J J memo   were destroyed by the mine management staff just prior to the J J divestiture   Bicks said the destroyed documents did not include talc testing records  In 2002 and 2003  Vermont mine operators found chrysotile asbestos fibers on several occasions in talc produced for Baby Powder sold in Canada  In each case  a single fiber was recorded   a finding deemed  BDL    below detection limit  Bicks described the finding as  background asbestos  that did not come from any talc source  In 2009  the FDA  responding to growing public concern about talc  commissioned tests on 34 samples  including a bottle of J J Baby Powder and samples of Imerys talc from China  No asbestos was detected  FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said the agency continues to receive a lot of questions about talc cosmetics   I recognize the concern   he told Reuters  He said the agency s policing of cosmetics in general   fewer than 30 people regulating a  vast  industry   was  a place where we think we can be doing more   Gottlieb said the FDA planned to host a public forum in early 2019 to  look at how we would develop standards for evaluating any potential risk   An agency spokeswoman said that would include examining  scientific test methods for assessment of asbestos    FISHING EXPEDITION  Before law school  Herschel Hobson worked at a rubber plant  There  his job included ensuring that asbestos in talc the workers were exposed to didn t exceed OSHA limits  That s why he zeroed in on Johnson s Baby Powder after he took on Darlene Coker as a client in 1997  The lawsuit Coker and her husband  Roy  filed that year against J J in Jefferson County District Court in Beaumont  Texas  is the earliest Reuters found alleging Baby Powder caused cancer  Hobson asked J J for any research it had into the health of its mine workers  talc production records from the mid 1940s through the 1980s  depositions from managers of three labs that tested talc for J J and any documents related to testing for fibrous or asbestiform materials  J J objected  Hobson s  fishing expedition  would not turn up any relevant evidence  it asserted in a May 6  1998  motion  In fact  among the thousands of documents Hobson s request could have turned up was a letter J J lawyers had received only weeks earlier from a Rutgers University geologist confirming that she had found asbestos in the company s Baby Powder  identified in her 1991 published study as tremolite  asbestos  needles  Hobson agreed to postpone his discovery demands until he got the pathology report on Coker s lung tissue  Before it came in  J J asked the judge to dismiss the case  arguing that Coker had  no evidence  Baby Powder caused mesothelioma  Ten days later  the pathology report landed  Coker s lung tissue contained tens of thousands of  long fibers  of four different types of asbestos  The findings were  consistent with exposure to talc containing chrysotile and tremolite contamination   the report concluded   The asbestos fibers found raise a new issue of fact   Hobson told the judge in a request for more time to file an opposition to J J s dismissal motion  The judge gave him more time but turned down his request to resume discovery  Without evidence from J J and no hope of ever getting any  Hobson advised Coker to drop the suit  Hobson is still practicing law in Nederland  Texas  When Reuters told him about the evidence that had emerged in recent litigation  he said   They knew what the problems were  and they hid it   J J s records would have made a  100  difference  in Coker s case  Had the information about asbestos in J J s talc come out earlier  he said   maybe there would have been 20 years less exposure  for other people  Bicks  the J J lawyer  said Coker dropped her case because  the discovery established that J J talc had nothing to do with Plaintiff s disease  and that asbestos exposure from a commercial or occupational setting was the likely cause   Coker never learned why she had mesothelioma  She did beat the odds  though  Most patients die within a year of diagnosis  Coker held on long enough to see her two grandchildren  She died in 2009  12 years after her diagnosis  at age 63  Coker s daughter Crystal Deckard was 5 when her sister  Cady  was born in 1971  Deckard remembers seeing the white bottle of Johnson s Baby Powder on the changing table where her mother diapered her new sister   When Mom was given this death sentence  she was the same age as I am right now   Deckard said   I have it in the back of my mind all the time  Could it happen to us  Me  My

against a 1 4  decrease for its industry   Meanwhile  estimates for 2019 have inched up 1 4  in the past 30 days Its successful product launches  increasing focus in the oncology area  and positive

Healthcare in partnership with Johnson   Johnson   NYSE JNJ   In fact  these new products coupled with the restructuring in the Consumer Health unit strengthened Glaxo s competitive position In June 2018  Glaxo bought Novartis    NYSE NVS   36 5  stake in their Consumer Healthcare joint venture  JV  for  13 billion   9 2 billion   In December 2018  Glaxo and Pfizer   NYSE PFE   announced an

198069,419585,JNJ,Johnson   Johnson  A Long Term Buy Despite Near Term Fears,opinion,"It s safe to say that Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ   has lagged the S P 500 considerably so far in 2019  The company is in the midst of facing financial and reputational damages due to litigation pertaining to both its talcum baby powder  which is alleged in thousands of lawsuits to have contained traces of asbestos  and its opioid drugs Nucynta and Duragesic  which the state of Oklahoma claims helped to fuel a major public health crisis 

The company s stock has justifiably suffered under the weight of these uncertainties  and JNJ has increasingly fallen out of favor with an investor community that had formerly regarded the company as having the most pristine of reputations  As a result  the stock is now trading negative on the year  falling behind both the S P index as well as its sector benchmark  Health Care Select Sector SPDR  NYSE XLV    in which it serves as the largest component 




But even with all of the uncertainty facing JNJ  it s clear that the market has been pricing in an extreme worst case scenario for the company  The stock has experienced several 10   corrections over the last year and a half  with each of them in some way having to do with the litigation concerns being faced by the company  From a peak market capitalization of  397 billion  the decline in JNJ reflects a loss in market cap of approximately  60 billion 





This seems quite overdone  given that Bloomberg s worst case estimate for potential talc settlements reaches  15 billion  and that the company seems to have a reasonable case against liability in the opioid case  Unlike peers Purdue Pharma and Teva Pharma Industries Ltd ADR  NYSE TEVA   which chose to settle against similar accusations by the state of Oklahoma  Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  has chosen to oppose the accusations head on  claiming that its opioid products represented a small fraction of total opioid sales in Oklahoma  It s hard to quantify how much total opioid lawsuit damages could cost for the company  while Oklahoma is demanding  17 billion to be paid over 30 years  there are also several other states looking into lawsuits of their own  However  even if JNJ were to lose its trial against the state of Oklahoma  the actual payout would likely be nowhere near the  17 billion demanded  due to the high likelihood of a reversal or reduction upon appeal 




On top of all this  the company already has a considerable cash reserve of over  14 billion  as well as a AAA credit rating that enables it to borrow money on more advantageous terms  as if the cost of borrowing money wasn t already cheap   All in all  this combination of a lagging stock price coupled with what seems to be better than feared fundamentals provides an opportunity for long term investors to build a position in JNJ at a discount 





A Strong Dividend At A Reasonable Valuation
Throughout the duration of JNJ s underperformance  the stock has experienced a steady increase in its dividend yield  Since the start of 2018 the stock s returns have essentially remained flat  yet company management has increased the quarterly dividend twice  first from  0 84 to  0 90 in mid 2018 and again from  0 90 to  0 95 in mid 2019 
Examining the stock s dividend yield history over the last three years  there have been four prior periods where JNJ s yield has fallen within the 2 8  2 9  range  December 2016  January 2017  June 2018  and December 2018  Each of these instances ended up representing a bottom for the stock  and the fact that JNJ s yield is once again trading within this range leads me to believe that another bottom could be in the cards 




Additionally  it should be noted that JNJ is experiencing somewhat of a valuation contraction  which I attribute to a combination of company specific litigation fears and industry wide regulation fears  The stock currently carries a P E ratio of 21 2  While this valuation may seem expensive at face value  it s not unreasonable for a blue chip company of JNJ s caliber  with exceptional diversification across the health care industry  a solid international presence  high quality management  and a consistent history of growth with regards to revenues  earnings  and dividends  And taking into consideration that JNJ has historically traded at a mid 20s multiple on earnings  one can reach the conclusion that the stock is cheap relative to past valuations 





Conclusion
Despite what I view as quality fundamentals for Johnson   Johnson  I would be wary of adding shares prior to Monday s upcoming opioid trial verdict  it s impossible to tell how JNJ will react to the news  and in an environment that s this volatile  the market isn t willing to show mercy to any stock with signs of weakness  But for investors seeking high quality exposure to the health care sector  Johnson   Johnson presents a strong long term buying opportunity  I believe that the litigation concerns around the company s talc and opioid products are real but overblown  and that investor panic has provided a chance to take advantage of an outsized dividend at a deflated valuation ",2019-08-25,Nima Abbaszadeh,https://www.investing.com/analysis/johnson--johnson-a-longterm-buy-despite-nearterm-fears-200458386,200458386

198081,419597,JNJ,3 Reasons Why Growth Investors Shouldn t Overlook J J Snack Foods  JJSF ,opinion,"Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above average financial growth  as this feature helps these securities garner the market s attention and deliver solid returns  But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all 
That s because  these stocks usually carry above average risk and volatility  In fact  betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss 
However  the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects  makes it pretty easy to find cutting edge growth stocks 
J J  NYSE JNJ  Snack Foods  JJSF  is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system  In addition to a favorable Growth Score  it carries a top Zacks Rank 
Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market  And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   returns are even better 
While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this drink and snack maker is a great growth pick right now  we have highlighted three of the most important factors below 
Earnings Growth
Earnings growth is arguably the most important factor  as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors  And for growth investors  double digit earnings growth is definitely preferable  and often an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for J J Snack Foods is 4 4   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 22 5  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 4 8  
Impressive Asset Utilization Ratio
Growth investors often overlook asset utilization ratio  also known as sales to total assets  S TA  ratio  but it is an important feature of a real growth stock  This metric shows how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales 
Right now  J J Snack Foods has an S TA ratio of 1 23  which means that the company gets  1 23 in sales for each dollar in assets  Comparing this to the industry average of 1 2  it can be said that the company is more efficient 
While the level of efficiency in generating sales matters a lot  so does the sales growth of a company  And J J Snack Foods looks attractive from a sales growth perspective as well  The company s sales are expected to grow 3 7  this year versus the industry average of 0  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Beyond the metrics outlined above  investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is a plus here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
There have been upward revisions in current year earnings estimates for J J Snack Foods  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 1  over the past month 
Bottom Line
J J Snack Foods has not only earned a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above  but it also carries a Zacks Rank  2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions 
You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
This combination indicates that J J Snack Foods is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors ",2019-08-20,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-reasons-why-growth-investors-shouldnt-overlook-jj-snack-foods-jjsf-200456814,200456814

198091,419607,JNJ,These 21 Safe Bond Funds Pay Up To 8 5  And Never Go Down,opinion,"The 8 Safest Bond ETFs That Actually Pay




As we discussed with ARTFX  I don t anticipate I ll ever formally recommend one of these funds in CIR  Their total returns are unlikely to clear my high single digit yearly hurdle  However  they are good ideas for anyone looking to tie down their portfolio during any market turbulence  These 5  and 6  yields are about as steady as they come 
The Best Bond Funds  CEFs for 8 5  Yields and 78  Returns 
I prefer CEFs to mutual funds and ETFs because 
They yield more  andThey can go up in price more quickly In fact  CEFs flash a crystal clear buy signal when a big price rise is coming  You ll find it in the discount to NAV  which is the percentage by which the fund s market price trails the market value of all the assets in its portfolio  known as the net asset value  or NAV  
This makes our plan simple  wait for the discount to sink below its normal level and make our move  Then we ll keep rolling our dividend cash into that fund until its discount closes  or swings to a premium  
This is exactly what happened when we bought the PIMCO Dynamic Credit and Mortgage Fund  PCI  in my Contrarian Income Report service in May 2016  Not only did we collect the fund s generous dividend  but we won two more ways over the three years we ve held PCI because its 
NAV increased  orange line below   and  Its discount window tightened as its price  blue line  caught up with and eventually surpassed its NAV 2 Ways to Win for 78  Total Returns




We ve earned 78  total returns from PCI  thanks to the dividends we ve collected  the NAV gains we ve enjoyed and the discount window closing entirely and flipping to a premium 
For much of PCI s run  I ve had a  buy  rating on the fund when this  twofer  potential remained in place  making it a perfect destination for both reinvested dividends and new cash my members had to invest 
For a period of time  though  PCI has cruised along as a  hold  for us  This happened after its price rallied so furiously that its discount window closed 
When this happens  it makes sense to bank our PCI dividends  or  redirect  them to our other Contrarian Income Report buys  and wait for our next buying opportunity 
That s what happened with PCI  Its discount window opened again in the late 2018 selloff on October 5  to be precise when its market price fell below my  23 50 buy up to level  Investors who got in then picked up a nice 14  total return  nearly three times the market s gain 
Buy Window Opens  Gains  and Dividends  Ensue




As you can see in the orange line above  your typical S P 500 investor didn t come anywhere close to those returns in that time 
Yours Now  My Next 8    Monthly  Income Buys 
As you can probably guess from the chart above  PCI is trading at a massive premium to NAV now  so I ve switched it back to a hold 
But it s only a matter of time before our buy window slides open again and we can put more cash into this amazing 8 7  yielder 
When you take a no risk trial to Contrarian Income Report  you ll be the first to know when the time is right 
Meantime  if you re looking for some stout monthly high yielders to buy NOW  fear not  I ve got you covered there  too 
Those would be the stocks  high yield REITs and CEFs in my powerful     With just  500K invested  this dynamic collection of investments will hand you a rock solid  40 000 a year income stream  That s easily enough for most folks to retire on 
The best part is you won t have to go back to  lumpy  quarterly payouts to do it  Thanks to this breakthrough portfolio s reliable monthly dividends  you can look forward to the steady drip of  3 333 in income  month in and month out on your  500K  give or take a couple hundred bucks 
Full details on these stalwart income plays are   You ll discover 
An 8 1  payer that s set to rake in huge profits from an artificially depressed sector The brainchild of one of the top fund managers on the planet that s giving out a generous 9 1  yield And a rock steady 6 9  dividend trading at a massive discount to NAV 
Disclosure  Brett Owens and Michael Foster are contrarian income investors who look for undervalued stocks funds across the U S  markets  Click here to learn how to profit from their strategies in the latest report   7 Great Dividend Growth Stocks for a Secure Retirement  
 Brett  give me some bond funds with big yields  And it d be great if their prices never went down  
My money manager friend was chasing the holy grail of retirement income  He wanted safe payouts from bonds to balance his clients  stock exposure 
 How about the Artisan High Income Investor Fund  ARTFX    I replied   It pays a steady 6  or so  And it never goes down  
Same S P Yearly Return  Less Heartburn




 The only problem is that it never goes up  either  And that s prevented me from recommending it to my Contrarian Income Report subscribers  
Our CIR portfolio holds eight bond funds today  versus ten stocks and stock funds   Our average annualized return on these eight open fixed income holdings is 11 2   which means adding ARTFX to the mix would drag our retirement boat lower 
I prefer price upside alongside my monthly bond payouts  And for big gains we must consider closed end funds  CEFs   which are bought and sold with less efficiency than ETFs and blue chip stocks 
Many investors buy Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  for its dividend and recall the SPDR Bloomberg  Barclays   LON BARC  High Yield Bond ETF  JNK   because its ticker spells  junk    but few know about PIMCO s Dynamic Credit and Mortgage Fund  PCI   This is ironic because PCI pays a generous 8 5  today while JNJ yields just 2 9  and JNK pays 5 5   It s doubly ironic because PCI has more than doubled the returns of its two better known  competitors  
PCI Pays More  Goes Up Faster Than JNJ and JNK




PCI s payout is safe but its price is subject to market whims  As a CEF  the fund has a fixed amount of shares  like an individual stock   This means its price can swing up and down  like an individual stock   Over the long haul this  volatility  works in our favor as patient investors  but it can cause indigestion for folks who watch their tickers daily  or worse  hourly  
The Hare Won  As Long As You Didn t Sell 




And I get it some of you just do check your stock quotes every day  and that s just how it s always going to be  Or you may have plenty of potential action packed into the rest of the portfolio  whether it s dividend growth or cryptocurrencies or weed stocks  I m not judging  and you just want anchors that can help steady the ship and pay you every month no matter what happens 
A bond CEF is a great addition to a  no withdrawal  portfolio  or an account in which you are comfortable letting prices do what they will while you collect your monthly and quarterly payouts  But bond CEF prices are going to fluctuate day to day  while ARTFX is the type of distribution rock that would make Bob Seger blush 
Want more bond rocks  Let s dig  Here are 11 more funds that  like ARTFX  meet the following strict criteria 
First  they pay 5  or better  While we re not looking for moonshots  we are looking for meaningful yield 
Second  they ve returned 4 5  or better over the last five years  This means these funds have at least  returned their yields   They re not tapping their own portfolios  or net asset values  NAVs  to pay us 
And finally  their  betas  are in the basement at 0 2 or below  This is the measure of how much the stock swings relative to the broader market  If the S P 500 moved 10 points  we d expect these prices to only move a point or two at most 
The 12 Safest Bond Mutual Funds That Actually Pay




The 12 funds above are all mutual funds  a tribute to the value that an active manager can add in Bondland  Now I know that some investors prefer ETFs  either by choice  they like the ease of buying and watching the TV commercials  or by necessity  their brokerage account requires a regular stock like ticker   This is doable but we must widen our strike zone a bit to allow for lower yields and yearly returns ",2019-07-31,Brett Owens,https://www.investing.com/analysis/these-21-safe-bond-funds-pay-up-to-85-and-never-go-down-200447803,200447803
198092,419608,JNJ,Looking For A Growth Stock  3 Reasons Why J J Snack Foods  JJSF  Is A Solid Choice,opinion,"Growth stocks are attractive to many investors  as above average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market s attention and produce exceptional returns  However  it isn t easy to find a great growth stock 
By their very nature  these stocks carry above average risk and volatility  Moreover  if a company s growth story is over or nearing its end  betting on it could lead to significant loss

Earnings Growth

Impressive Asset Utilization Ratio

While the level of efficiency in generating sales matters a lot  so does the sales growth of a company  And J J Snack Foods looks attractive from a sales growth perspective as well  The company s sales are expected to grow 2 8  this year versus the industry average of 0  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Beyond the metrics outlined above  investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is a plus here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
There have been upward revisions in current year earnings estimates for J J Snack Foods  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 1  over the past month 
Bottom Line

198098,419614,JNJ,J J Snack Foods  JJSF  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"The market expects J J  NYSE JNJ  Snack Foods  JJSF  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 29  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This drink and snack maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 54 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  10 8  
Revenues are expected to be  313 million  up 2 2  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for J J Snack Foods 
For J J Snack Foods  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that J J Snack Foods will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that J J Snack Foods would post earnings of  1 02 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 08  delivering a surprise of  5 88  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
J J Snack Foods doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-21,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/jj-snack-foods-jjsf-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200442580,200442580

198100,419616,JNJ,Social Media Earnings  Facebook And Twitter Prepare To Share,opinion,"Earnings are in full swing this week and technology investors who hold any of the nation s major social media companies are likely preparing for a hectic few days  Facebook  NASDAQ FB  and Twitter  NYSE TWTR   two platforms on which millions of investors and non investors alike share their memories  gripes and sometimes everyday mundane doings through posts and tweets  are opening their books this week 
Both social media giants reported double digit revenue growth in Q1 as their active users numbers climbed  helping to rev up advertising dollars  FB is at the top of the mountain in both users and ad revenue  and TWTR looks to be holding its own  but on a smaller scale 
Have the companies been able to keep up the momentum in Q2  If their stock prices are any indication  it appears investors at least are keeping the faith  FB has been among the top tech guns elevating the S P 500 s  SPX  climbs to fresh peaks   FB stock represents 1 9  of the index and is up some 50  since the beginning of the year  TWTR s path has been a bit wobbly  but it has still managed to clock about a 28  increase 
Analysts watching FB say they will be looking for solid upticks in all the numbers and updates on a potential  5 billion fine for FB from the Federal Trade Commission  For TWTR  analysts may be looking at how TWTR says it s monitoring those who violate the site s community standards rules 
There s a lot of focus on potential regulatory issues  and a key thing to consider is that companies under a government shadow might see less of a potential bullish response if their earnings beat  Even if FB and TWTR have killer earnings  the fact that they re in the cross hairs could limit gains for their stocks 
That dynamic arguably played out last week when Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  the subject of a Justice Department probe didn t get much lift despite an impressive earnings performance across the entire company 
FB s Regulatory Fines
FB is expected to move the conversation  away from putting out privacy fires and back toward innovation   Barclays  LON BARC  analyst Ross Sandler told MarketWatch  He said he will be looking for signs  for example  that advertisers are beginning to embrace FB s  Stories  format an Instagram copycat layout launched last September as a means of stepping up engagement between users and advertisers 
There are also a number of issues investors might be interested in hearing updates about  a few of which are tied to regulatory issues that some investors and analysts point out could be good for FB 
Every time FB announces that it s settled with a government here or abroad  the stock gets a boost  Josh Brown  chief executive of Ritholtz Wealth Management said on CNBC   The Street loves when there s finality to those things   he said 
Here s a short list of issues analysts have said they will be listening to on FB s conference call 
Updates on its  1 billion acquisition of Instagram in 2012 and its  19 billion acquisition of WhatsApp in 2014  both drivers of new users across diverse age groups 
What other mergers and acquisition FB might be toying with as it builds its user empire  FB typically acquires apps and companies that are outside its main offerings and tend to be attractive to a broad range of age groups  what McKinsey calls  programmatic M A   FB has acquired 72 companies since August 2005  according to Techwyse com  at a cost of  23 36 billion 
Libra  the new cryptocurrency it s launching that looks to be facing a barrage of headwinds from a nearly every commercial and political corner of the world  Mixing internet services with banking on a social media platform appears to be helping stir the controversy  But FB has said cryptocurrency could be the next best thing to the gold standard  Stay tuned 
That expected  5 billion fine that FB is said to have settled with the Federal Trade but has not been officially announced publicly  While  5 billion is a big chunk of change from nearly anyone s pocketbook  investors should remember that FB already took a  3 billion charge in Q1 in anticipation of a multi billion dollar hit 
And if that doesn t do it for you  think back to FB s 2018 results  Net income of  22 11 billion on  55 84 billion in revenue  And then there was its record breaking Q1 of  15 1 billion in revenue 
Plus  the markets embraced the stock when the rumored  5 billion figure hit the headlines  reaching a fresh peak since the start of the year  possibly because it could signal that the end was near  It barely flinched when Libra was announced and the backlash began  possibly supporting Brown s theory  The stock is up some 50  since the beginning of the year 
Analysts polled by FactSet expect Facebook to report Q2 earnings per share of  1 87  up nearly 7  from the year ago result of  1 74 a share  and revenue of  16 5 billion  which would represent a 25  increase from  13 23 billion 
FB reports Wednesday  July 24 after the bell with a conference call at 5 p m  ET 
FB Options Activity
The options market has priced in an expected share price move of about 5 9  in either direction around the earnings release  according to the Market Maker Move  indicator on the thinkorswim  platform

Note  Call options represent the right  but not the obligation  to buy the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time  Put options represent the right  but not the obligation  to sell the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time 
TWTR s Got a New Look
The pot is not nearly as full at TWTR  but investors might want to hear more about the short messaging app s tests to make conversation threads easier to follow  TWTR last week unveiled its latest plan to achieve that by using icons instead of labels in replies 
Will this help  Some would argue the platform s interface isn t that complicated to begin with 
Twitter also rolled out a new design with  a refreshed and updated website that s faster  easier to navigate and more personalized   according to the company s release  Techies appear to have mixed feelings about it  The customization options look like they re a hit  but some critics say they don t like all the sidebar additions on the left  Change is never easy 
Some investors might want to know what those outages earlier in the month were all about  At the time  TWTR said the shutdown was due to an  internal configuration change   but didn t explain exactly what that meant and what might be the likelihood of it happening again 
And finally  TWTR said in late June that it was adding disclaimers to world leaders  tweets that break the firm s community standards if they are in the public interest 
How might TWTR determine where to draw the line between  public interest  and misinformation   This is not about perceived bias but about providing more clarity if our rules have been broken   a Twitter spokesperson told CNN Business 
TWTR is expected to report per share earnings of  0 18 a 5 9  increase over the year ago period on revenue of  829 million which would be a 16 6  lift from the year ago period 
Twitter s earnings are expected to be released on Friday  July 26  ahead of the market s open 
TWTR Options Activity
The options market has priced in an expected share price move of about 9 4  in either direction around the earnings release  according to the Market Maker Move  indicator on the thinkorswim  platform 
Call activity has been relatively light  but heaviest at the 37 5 and 39 strikes  Put volume has been heavier overall  with the highest concentration at the 35 strike  The implied volatility sits at the 41st percentile

198101,419617,JNJ,Why Johnson   Johnson  JNJ  Is A Great Dividend Stock Right Now,opinion,"Getting big returns from financial portfolios  whether through stocks  bonds  ETFs  other securities  or a combination of all  is an investor s dream  However  when you re an income investor  your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments 
While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments  income investors hone in on dividends  A dividend is the distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  it s often viewed by its dividend yield  a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long term returns  and in many cases  dividend contributions surpass one third of total returns 
Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  in Focus
Headquartered in New Brunswick  Johnson   Johnson  JNJ  is a Medical stock that has seen a price change of 0 57  so far this year  The world s biggest maker of health care products is paying out a dividend of  0 95 per share at the moment  with a dividend yield of 2 93  compared to the Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry s yield of 3 09  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 86  
Looking at dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  3 80 is up 7 3  from last year  Over the last 5 years  Johnson   Johnson has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 6 34   Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company s payout ratio  a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Johnson   Johnson s current payout ratio is 44   This means it paid out 44  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Earnings growth looks solid for JNJ for this fiscal year  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  8 60 per share  with earnings expected to increase 5 13  from the year ago period 
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for many reasons  they greatly improve stock investing profits  decrease overall portfolio risk  and carry tax advantages  among others  It s important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout 
For instance  it s a rare occurrence when a tech start up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend  It s more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends  Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  With that in mind  JNJ is a compelling investment opportunity  Not only is it a strong dividend play  but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3  Hold  ",2019-07-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-johnson--johnson-jnj-is-a-great-dividend-stock-right-now-200444739,200444739

JNJ is inching higher today  up 0 6  at  135 13  but has barely put a dent in the damage caused by last Friday s 4 1  plummet  Looking more broadly  JNJ has experienced a choppy year on the charts  with a late June attempt to close last December s dramatic bear gap capped at the  145 region  On the other hand  the equity has managed a 4 6  year to date gain  and is up 7 2  year over year 
This recent drop may have created a short term buying opportunity  if history is any indicator  During its pullback  JNJ retreated to its 320 day moving average  According to data from Schaeffer s Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White  in the five other times the equity pulled back to this trendline in the last couple years  it was higher 21 days later 60  of the time  and averaged a one month return of 3 84   A similar move would put JNJ right near Thursday s pre bear gap levels at  140

198120,419636,JNJ,Monday Market Momentum Continues,opinion,"And we keep going higher 
The S P is now up 15  for the year and 25  off the December lows and 10  off the June lows  so it s been quite a year for the senior index  Citigroup  NYSE C  kicked off earnings season this morning with a decent report but tomorrow things begin to get serious and it will be a jam packed couple of weeks as July 4th cost us a week so we re a bit behind in our reporting already 
Income at C is up 7  from last year at  4 5Bn for the quarter  which is  1 95 share vs  1 85 expected but revenues were only in line at  18 5Bn so we re not likely to get a very enthusiastic reaction with the stock already at  72  we are long C with a 2021 target of  75 in our LTP   There aren t many bank stocks we like but C is one of them so no surprise here  Wells Fargo  NYSE WFC  tomorrow will be much more interesing and Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  also reports in the morning and we ll see what they set aside for their talcum powder scandal 


These are probably the most fun earnings to play but it s early in the season and we have little to go on though we are already long on Skechers  SKX  and Cliffs  CLF  though SKX passed our  27 target long agao and we re just waiting to get paid as the spread is netting just  11 025 out of a potential  16 000 so it still has  4 975  45   left to gain between now and Jan 17th  2020 even though it s  20  in the money   aren t options fun 

So  as a brand new trade  you can take this spread and make up to 45  from scratch  Of course  we netted in originally for a  1 680 credit and we re making almost 10x more than that if SKX finishes the cycle over  27   now THAT is what I call fun  SKX is at the top of their trading range and hopefully they pull back a bit on earnings so we can add them to the OOP  though we ll come up with something that makes more than 45    so dull  
Our favorite kinds of earnings plays are to pick up stocks other peope are throwing away for the wrong reasons but  as I noted above  early in the season we re more worried about playing defense with our existing positions  rather than chasing after new ones unless there s a particularly amazing bargain to be had  like BBBY last week  

Getting back to Cleveland Cliffs  CLF   I can t believe they are still down in the dumps and I m tempted to add more ahead of their earnings on Friday as Iron Ore pricing has shot up and CLF has the advantage of being a US producer in the trade wars yet the stock is languising around  10 50  which is  on track  for our 2021  12 target but our spread has only gained  1 100 and it s a potential  8 000 spread that s currently net  1 500 so another  6 500  433   potential to gain so  even if you missed our original  400 entry last month   433  upside in 18 months doesn t suck 

Here s how ridiculously cheap CLF is   10 50 is just under  3Bn in market cap yet last year CLF had  1 1Bn in profit though  475M of that was a tax credit so call it  625M but they ll pay taxes on that this year so we ll call it net profits of  500M for  3Bn and the p e is 6x at  10 50 but Iron Ore prices have gone up 50  since the start of the year and that can have a tremendous impact on earnings yet estimates for CLF have barely budged  0 57 expected Fri vs 0 55 last year   so I m expecting a nice beat and raised guidance 
We ll see what joys the earnings season can bring us and we have a ton of Fed speak on tap with 7 speeches just tomorrow and one today  one Thursday and two Friday  all surrounding the Fed s Beige Book Report on Wednesday  We have the Empire State Manufacturing this mornng  Retail Sales and Industrial Production tomorrow  the Philly Fed Thursday and Consumer Sentiment on Friday   along with about 200 earnings reports this week ",2019-07-16,Phoenix Capital Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/monday-market-momentum-continues-200440001,200440001

What s Next for Johnson   Johnson 
While Johnson   Johnson has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Johnson   Johnson was favorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  Large Cap Pharmaceuticals is currently in the top 11  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2019-07-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/johnson--johnson-jnj-tops-q2-earnings-and-revenue-estimates-200440106,200440106

For Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  investors no news is good news until the world s largest maker of both consumer and pharmaceutical health care products finds a way to settle thousands of lawsuits claiming its talcum powder caused ovarian cancer 
There are so many of these cases 14 000 according to media estimates that the issue threatens enormous financial and reputational risks to the multinational pharmaceutical company  The stock plunged more than 4  on Friday after reports the U S  Justice Department is investigating whether the company has withheld from the public the possible cancerous risks of its talcum powder 
The criminal probe coincides with a regulatory investigation and civil claims by thousands of cancer patients that J J s Baby Powder talc was responsible for their illness  Now  a grand jury in Washington is examining documents that could help shed light onto what officials from the company may have known about any carcinogens in its products  a Bloomberg report said citing unnamed sources 
These developments and ongoing litigations in multiple jurisdictions have kept JNJ shares under pressure since December last year  despite some positive news on the earnings front  Trading at  134 29 at Friday s close  J J stock is up just 5 5  this year  underperforming the S P 500  which surged more than 20  in the same period 

For the quarter that ended on June 30  the company is expected to earn  2 44 a share on sales of  20 9 billion  according to analysts  consensus estimate  Though baby powder accounts for only a tiny fraction of J J s annual revenue  it s been a core brand for the company for more than a century as well as a big drag on the company s financial health amid uncertainty about the amount it may need to set aside for out of court settlements 
The company has said it has set aside money for legal costs related to talc claims but hasn t specified the amount  According to Bloomberg estimates civil settlements could cost J J as much as  15 billion overall  The company  however  maintains that it has no liability because its products are safe 
J J Earnings Strength
Keeping the lawsuits related risk aside  J J has consistently proven that its product portfolio is strong enough to produce hefty cash flows for investors  In the first quarter  the company s fast growing pharmaceutical unit was key to offsetting its weaker consumer and medical device lines 
J J s drug business is now the largest of the company s three main segments  with Q1 sales growing 4 1  to  10 2 billion helped by psoriasis drug Stelara  sales of which were up 32  to  1 4 billion 
Another bright spot was the launch of nasal spray Spravato  a close chemical cousin of the anaesthetic ketamine that works quickly to alleviate symptoms of depression  The rollout is  off to a very  very strong start   Jennifer Taubert  head of the group s pharmaceutical unit  told investors on a conference call 
Bottom Line

198134,419650,JNJ,Special Report  Biotech incubator taps investors through in house brokerage,news,By Elizabeth Dilts  Benjamin Lesser  Carl O Donnell and Michael Erman NEW YORK  Reuters    Last August  National Securities Corp analyst Jonathan Aschoff was bullish on  Avenue Therapeutics Inc   O ATXI   a fledgling biotechnology company with no revenue and one drug in clinical trials  In a research note posted on National s website  he rated the newly listed stock a  buy  and predicted that the share price would more than double in a year   Graphic  National Securities note on Avenue Therapeutics     Nearly a year later  Avenue shares are down 36 percent  at about  4  A few months earlier  Aschoff had waxed equally optimistic about another biotech venture   Checkpoint Therapeutics  Inc  O CKPT   with several cancer drugs in various stages of development  He predicted the share price would rise from  10 75 to  18 in a year  It is now around  2 60   Graphic  National Securities note on Checkpoint Therapeutics     Then in September  he recommended  Mustang Bio  Inc  O MBIO   which is working on a drug to treat brain cancer  He forecast a 12 month increase in the share price from around  12 to  21  That stock is now at  6 62   Graphic  National Securities note on Mustang Bio     What Aschoff did not mention in any of these bullish notes  His employer  National Securities  is owned by the same company that controls Avenue  Checkpoint and Mustang  That company is Fortress Biotech Inc  N FBIO   the brainchild of longtime biotech entrepreneurs Dr Lindsay Rosenwald and Michael Weiss  In September 2016  Fortress acquired a controlling stake in National Securities  parent   National Holdings  Corp  O NHLD   The deal solidified an unusual relationship that dates to 2010  when Rosenwald and Weiss  through an investment fund they control  invested  3 million in National Holdings  Owning National gives Fortress an in house underwriter and a private sales force of about 700 brokers   nearly a third of whom have been flagged by regulators   to help it raise money for its stable of nine ventures that are developing new drugs or treatments  If this setup seems like a conflict of interest  that s because it is one  National brokers are required under U S  regulations to ensure that they promote investments deemed appropriate for their clients   the same clients to whom they are marketing securities in their parent company s ventures in biotech  a notoriously high risk sector   I ve never seen a firm that needs to raise a lot of capital acquire a brokerage for that purpose   said Benjamin Edwards  an associate professor of securities law at the University of Nevada  Las Vegas  echoing nearly a dozen other experts in corporate finance and securities law whom Reuters interviewed for this article  Since coming under Fortress s umbrella  National brokers  with an assist from analysts like Aschoff  have helped raise at least  240 million from thousands of individual investors across the United States to fund Fortress or its related biotech companies  according to data from National  And U S  Securities and Exchange Commission  SEC  filings show that Fortress related deals are in the works to raise as much as an additional  125 million  OUT IN THE OPEN While Aschoff did not disclose the relationship in the analyst notes  National discloses the conflict of interest in prospectuses for securities offerings it underwrites for Fortress  in keeping with U S  regulations  The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority  FINRA   the watchdog funded by the industry it monitors  approved National s application for ownership change when Fortress acquired it  as required under U S  regulations  FINRA declined to answer questions about the deal  saying it does not discuss specific firms  The SEC did not respond to requests for comment  The agency asked Avenue for greater disclosure of its connection to National in the lead up to the biotech firm s initial public offering last year  but ultimately allowed it to raise money through the investment firm  filings show  Still   na ve investors may not even know the connection  Most small investors don t read the prospectus   said Roni Michaely  a professor of finance at Cornell University   If you are selling your own company  you want to sell it at the highest possible price  This is a situation that is very troublesome    Personally  I wouldn t touch  the offerings  with a 9 foot pole   In an interview with Reuters  Weiss  executive vice chairman of Fortress  said   We over disclose  We tell everything  We are the most honest management team ever to walk through this biotech business   Weiss served as chairman of the National Holdings board from shortly after Fortress acquired a controlling stake in the company until he resigned in June   A National executive acknowledged on Dec  4  2017  that Aschoff s research notes did not disclose the relationships between Fortress and its cash raising subsidiaries on one hand and National on the other  In an email Weiss forwarded to Reuters  the executive said National republished the notes in September last year to correct the omission  However  the notes as they appeared on National s website in December did not contain such company specific disclosures  The notes have since been removed from the site  National on June 5 this year denied that the notes ever lacked proper disclosure  pointing to nonspecific boilerplate language in them that says   One or more directors  officers  and or employees of NSC  National Securities Corp  and its affiliated companies  or independent contractors affiliated with NSC may be a director of the issuer of the securities mentioned herein   Even with that general disclosure   it does not eliminate the conflict of interest   said Michael McMillan  director of ethics education at the CFA Institute   In most cases  a firm will suspend analyst coverage of a company if a potential conflict of interest arises between the firm and the covered company  McMillan said  Fortress s ownership of National  he said  raises questions about the ability of its analysts to remain independent and objective  On May 15  more than a year and a half after Fortress acquired its controlling interest in National   and as Reuters continued to make inquiries about the relationship   National posted on its website a page titled  Meet our Majority Shareholder  Fortress Biotech    In a section on potential conflicts of interest  National says it and Fortress  have built a unique model that inherently aligns Fortress  business objectives with the financial interest of National s clients   The company says it is  proud  of the Fortress affiliated deals it has handled since the acquisition  It notes that those are a fraction of the total of  2 835 billion in deals National has closed during the same period  BROKERS WITH A PAST In June 2017  Reuters reported  that 35 percent of National s brokers   more than three times the industry average   had a history of regulatory run ins  legal disputes or personal financial difficulties that must be disclosed to investors under FINRA rules  based on a Reuters analysis of the regulator s data  A fresh analysis encompassing disclosures from 2000 through June 2018 found that the proportion still hovered at 30 percent  National executives said the Reuters analysis did not adequately reflect efforts to implement  a new culture at National    an effort that has included removing 298 brokers since shortly after Fortress bought the company  National also questioned the value of including regulatory disclosures from more than a decade ago  and it pointed out that the firm itself hasn t been hit with any regulatory sanctions since 2015   We ve worked so hard at changing the culture   said Michael Mullen  National Holdings  chief executive officer and a longtime business associate of Rosenwald  In 2002  FINRA accused analyst Aschoff of falsely claiming to be a medical doctor to obtain inside information about a drug development program at an unidentified publicly traded company  Aschoff  working for B  Riley FBR Inc at the time  agreed to a  10 000 fine and a two week suspension without admitting or denying wrongdoing  In a statement provided by National  Aschoff acknowledged the incident and declined to comment on it further  A former National broker told Reuters he learned he was raising money for the National parent s biotech ventures only after several months of recruiting investors for Mustang Bio  When he asked his supervisor about potential conflicts  he said   I was told to stop asking questions and get back to dialing   Weiss said he found  it hard to believe that there is a broker at National who   did not read anything in the prospectus that says that Fortress has a majority interest in National   He said National brokers recruited mostly accredited investors   individuals who under U S  law meet certain minimum wealth requirements   for Fortress deals  National brokers  Weiss said  sell Fortress deals because the investments make money for brokers and clients alike  UNUSUAL STRUCTURES For outside investors  Fortress s ventures not only carry the typical risks of a long shot biotech bet  they also come with unique conditions that can put outsiders at a disadvantage relative to the parent company  For one thing  the upside potential for outside investors is damped by covenants between Fortress and its offshoots that favor Fortress with equity awards over time  Fortress also treats the cost of acquiring drug development rights as debt owed by its startups  and that debt is repaid from money raised from sales of the startups  shares  Fortress ventures have paid at least  5 million under such arrangements across two deals  SEC filings show  The amounts may seem small  biotech analysts and investors said  but they allow Fortress to shift costs onto outside investors   It s a very sweet deal for Fortress   said Erik Gordon  a professor at University of Michigan s Ross School of Business   I think someone could see it as either very smart or very tricky   Weiss and Rosenwald acknowledged the unusual nature of the equity awards  but said that by pricing stock offerings at low valuations  they mitigate the impact of the dilution  In addition  they said  many investors don t plan to hold the stock long enough for the dilution to hit them very hard  Rosenwald and Weiss together owned 30 5 percent of Fortress as of March 31  For the past three years combined  each was paid  1 6 million in Fortress related compensation and  5 6 million in stock awards  according to SEC filings  As for National  its investment banking revenue surged more than 25 percent to  44 6 million in fiscal 2017 from a year earlier  thanks in part to fees from Fortress related offerings  according to a Reuters review of SEC filings  And National s brokerage operation collects commissions on Fortress related shares sold to investors   Retail investors need more protections than institutional investors   and the complex structures of Fortress deals  do the opposite of that   said Les Funtleyder  a portfolio manager at E Squared Capital Management   That s compounded by the fact that biotech  because it s so risky  isn t really appropriate for retail investors to begin with   In an interview  Rosenwald argued that  if anybody thinks that Fortress is getting too good of a deal from the  subsidiary  companies   then you can go out and buy Fortress stock   Those shares are down 35 percent  at  2 25  since April 2015  when publicly listed Coronado Biosciences  a failed venture  was renamed Fortress and became an incubator for Rosenwald and Weiss biotech ventures  The structure of Fortress s deals  Rosenwald said  doesn t eliminate all risk for the parent company and its executives  Fortress covers overhead costs for its ventures  he noted  including office space  management  human resources and legal advice  amounting to millions of dollars a year  Some of that  however  is repaid to Fortress through fees charged to each company  Fortress said it holds  30 million in direct investments in the ventures  and Rosenwald is an Avenue investor  However  the biggest risk for Fortress  is reputational   Rosenwald said   You re allowed to fail in biotech  If they all fail  that s horrible   EASING PAIN Failure is common in biotech  Lead times are long  Startups burn through cash and usually have no revenue  Treatments that show early promise can blow up in late stage trials  Nine times out of 10  according to a 2016 study by a group of biotech industry organizations  ventures do not achieve the ultimate goal  U S  Food and Drug Administration approval of a new drug or therapy  But while payoff is rare  it can be huge  That s why the sector typically attracts venture capital funds and other  smart money  investors who are willing to take on more risk than most  Over the past two decades  Rosenwald and Weiss have  together and separately  launched more than 50 separate biotech firms  Most of their ventures have conformed to the industry norm  failing to receive FDA approval  They ve had rare successes  too  such as Cougar Biotechnology Inc  which was developing prostate cancer drug Zytiga when Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  bought the company for  1 billion in 2009  The purchase price represented a 16 percent premium to the company s market value at the time  Zytiga received FDA approval in 2011  Whether a venture succeeds or fails  Fortress has found a way to boost the benefit and trim the risk for itself relative to the retail investors who help fund its ventures  That innovation was on display recently with Avenue Therapeutics  In 2015  Fortress  then still known as Coronado Biosciences  created Avenue to develop for the U S  market an intravenous formulation of the synthetic opioid Tramadol to treat pain in patients after surgery  The drug is already sold worldwide in oral form  and outside the United States for intravenous use  Avenue  with no revenue and only the one drug in its pipeline  went public last summer  Fortress hired Oppenheimer   Co as lead underwriter for the IPO   a role that includes conducting due diligence on the deal and the issuing company  In an unusual move  two thirds of the Avenue shares offered were allotted to National   The deal from the beginning was designed to be a National led transaction for our clients   Weiss said   We hired Oppenheimer   to satisfy the regulatory requirements   Oppenheimer declined to comment  The IPO raised nearly  38 million  That was already much less than the  50 million Fortress had initially hoped to raise  according to SEC filings  Avenue soon afterward paid out  6 6 million  or 17 percent of the IPO proceeds  More than  3 million went to cover Fortress s debt from buying the rights to IV Tramadol  The rest repaid a line of credit that Fortress had provided to Avenue  With that debt repaid  outside investors are now bearing most of the cost of developing IV Tramadol and carrying the most risk if Avenue fails  Typically  biotech companies hold little debt  if any  when going public so that shareholders are protected from undue risk if the company struggles to bring its product to market  several biotech investors told Reuters  For Fortress  debt is part of the formula   We are using debt as Fortress s balance sheet grows  We prefer not to   Rosenwald said   We will probably stop using debt soon   Further  the founders agreement between Fortress and Avenue gives the parent company the equivalent of 2 5 percent of Avenue s outstanding shares each year  plus additional shares equal to 2 5 percent of any equity or debt financing  That provision would benefit Fortress  relative to outside investors  should Avenue succeed and the shares take off  Over  say  15 years  the annual transfer alone would dilute the value of outside investors  holdings in Avenue by nearly a third  Rosenwald told Reuters that over such a 15 year span  he and Weiss would  add so much value to these companies that the little bit that keeps us interested financially will be a decimal point   Avenue s Tramadol formulation is now in late stage clinical trials  and the company expects to apply for FDA approval by the end of 2019   I have never seen a structure like this one before   said Funtleyder  the E Squared portfolio manager   We would need a really good reason to participate in something like that and probably wouldn t on principle because there are so many other investments that don t have this kind of baggage   The founders agreement also calls for Avenue to send Fortress 4 5 percent of net sales each year  if Avenue begins producing revenue  The annual 2 5 percent equity transfer is contained in the founders agreements between Fortress and nine ventures  according to SEC filings  One of them is Checkpoint Therapeutics  whose shares began trading on Nasdaq last June  just after Aschoff published his  buy  recommendation  Another is Mustang Bio  whose shares began trading on Nasdaq in August last year  Mustang is in the early stages of developing several immunotherapy products to treat cancer  In a July 2017 appearance on the Fox TV network morning show  Fox   Friends   Rosenwald and Mustang s CEO talked about the potential of one of those drugs to help U S  Senator John McCain  who had recently been diagnosed with a lethal brain cancer   It s early clinical trials   Rosenwald said during the broadcast   We have to prove the effectiveness   A year ago  National completed a private placement of Mustang shares  raising  95 million  according to SEC filings  National s fee came to 10 percent  or  9 5 million  An additional  2 million paid Fortress s debt from licensing fees  Caelum Biosciences  another company with the same founders agreement  is in the early stages of developing a treatment for a rare immune system disorder called amyloidosis  National raised  9 9 million for the company through the sale of convertible notes to around 170 investors  earning nearly  1 million in commissions  SEC filings show  ALL IN THE FAMILY In 1987  Rosenwald  who holds a medical degree from Temple University  started working at D H  Blair   Co  a Wall Street boiler room that a New York state judge likened to a criminal enterprise and that was led for decades by Rosenwald s father in law  J  Morton  Morty  Davis  In 2000  several executives and employees were charged in New York state court with 173 counts of securities fraud  among other violations  Two years later  the firm and three officers  including two of Rosenwald s brothers in law  pleaded guilty to and were convicted of three counts of violating state securities law   One brother in law served time in prison  the other got probation   Neither Rosenwald nor Davis was charged  Rosenwald had already left to launch his own small brokerage  Paramount BioCapital  in 1991  he said  Weiss came on board in 1994  Paramount functioned much as National does now  raising money for Rosenwald startups in biotech  In 2009  FINRA records show  the regulator determined that in two deals for Rosenwald controlled biotech companies  Paramount had failed to meet the requirement that it hire an independent underwriter  to protect investors from purchasing shares at an unfair price   FINRA also found that Paramount had failed to obtain approval to issue initial public offerings  Paramount paid a fine of  20 000  without admitting wrongdoing  Rosenwald said that the people involved  are no longer working with us   and that the violations were  minor technical infractions  not worth fighting  The following year  Opus Point Partners  an investment fund controlled by Rosenwald and Weiss  invested  3 million in National  Opus and National then formed OPN Capital Markets  a boutique investment bank focused on the healthcare industry  Rosenwald shuttered Paramount  National took up where Paramount left off  handling a private placement and later serving as co lead underwriter for the IPO of Ventrus BioSciences  a Rosenwald venture that was developing treatments for gastrointestinal ailments  A month after the December 2010 IPO  National analyst Jason Kolbert published a research report with an enthusiastic  buy  recommendation   Bet the horse  bet the jockey   he wrote  The report did not disclose the connection between National  Rosenwald and Ventrus  Kolbert did not respond to requests for comment  Representatives for National and Fortress pointed out that the note included boilerplate language stating   One or more directors  officers  and or employees of NSC and its affiliated companies  or independent contractors affiliated with NSC may be a director of the issuer of the securities mentioned herein   Ventrus raised  65 million through the private placement  IPO and several follow on offerings  Over the next two years  Ventrus s stock rose from a  6 initial offering price to as high as  21 as investors awaited news on the hemorrhoid ointment  the anal fissure cream and the incontinence gel the company was developing  As underwriter  National   including its many brokers with FINRA flags   was key to promoting the shares  In one case Reuters found  17 separate purchases of Ventrus stock were among 38 unauthorized trades a National broker made on a single client s account between May 24 and July 26  2012  according to the complaint filed by FINRA  The broker  Glenn McDowell  was permanently barred from the securities business  National fired McDowell in January 2013  Reuters was unable to locate McDowell  On June 25  2012  Ventrus announced that it would abandon development of what had been its most promising product   the hemorrhoid ointment   after it failed its final clinical trial  The share price plunged more than 50 percent in a day  In February 2014  the anal fissure cream failed a key clinical trial  and the stock plunged 63 percent  A few months later  Ventrus merged with Assembly Biosciences  a small biotech with no ties to Fortress  Though Rosenwald said he  lost millions  on Ventrus  he  Weiss and other National executives described Ventrus as a success because investors who got out of the stock at the right time made a profit   Edited by Brian Thevenot  Lauren Tara LaCapra and John Blanton  OLUSECON Reuters US Online Report Economy 20180802T130754

198135,419651,JNJ,Can Johnson   Johnson  JNJ  Keep The Earnings Surprise Streak Alive ,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ   which belongs to the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
This world s biggest maker of health care products has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 2 24  
For the last reported quarter  Johnson   Johnson came out with earnings of  2 10 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 03 per share  representing a surprise of 3 45   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  1 95 per share and it actually produced earnings of  1 97 per share  delivering a surprise of 1 03  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for Johnson   Johnson  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Johnson   Johnson currently has an Earnings ESP of  2 54   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on July 16  2019 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-07-08,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-johnson--johnson-jnj-keep-the-earnings-surprise-streak-alive-200438158,200438158

198145,419661,JNJ,J J s Rising Pharmaceutical Sales Hurt by Strong U S  Dollar,news," Bloomberg     Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  recorded 20 percent growth in its drug unit in the second quarter  but the company is trimming its forecast for the year as a strong dollar hampers its growth 
The U S  medical conglomerate said in a statement Tuesday that it was cutting its full year revenue projection to  80 5 billion to  81 3 billion  from  81 billion to  81 8 billion  and narrowing its adjusted earnings forecast 
The shares were up 0 6 percent to  125 40 in trading before the markets opened in New York  reversing earlier losses 
J J is based in New Brunswick  New Jersey  but generates about half its sales overseas  It s one of the first major U S  multinationals to report earnings after President Donald Trump began implementing a round of tariffs and threatening others  which has rattled markets 
Those changes in the markets appear to have affected J J  Three months ago  the company said exchange rates would give it a 4 2 percent boost to sales  this quarter it cut that estimate to 1 9 percent 
Currency trends could weigh on other large drugmakers as well  said Vamil Divan  an analyst with  Credit Suisse   SIX CSGN  Group AG 
 This was a key driver of the company lowering full year sales guidance and sets a potentially cautious tone for earnings season for the U S  pharma space  especially those with greater ex US exposure   Divan said in a note 
Since April 16  the day before J J s last quarterly report  the U S  dollar is up 5 4 percent against a basket of 10 major global currencies  Trade and monetary policy tensions between nations can have a stark impact on currency markets 
J J Chief Financial Officer Joseph Wolk  who took over the role this month  said the company hadn t been hurt by specific tariffs    although products in its consumer unit are most vulnerable
 It s really not attributable to the trade war at all   Wolk said   It s simply the macro effect of a stronger dollar  
The currency shifts have also affected J J s drug unit  which has grown quickly through deals and new products to become the company s biggest  The unit s benefit from exchange rates fell to 2 3 percent in the second quarter  compared to 4 3 percent in the prior period 
Wolk also said the company will continue to defend itself in the legal saga surrounding its talc products  Last week  a jury ordered the company to pay  4 69 billion to women who claimed asbestos in the products caused them to develop ovarian cancer  the six largest product defect verdict in U S  history 
 We believe the science is overwhelmingly on our side   Wolk said  The company has said it will appeal the judgment

J J s stock has risen 9  this year so far compared with an increase of 1 9  recorded by the  
The approval was based on data from the phase III MAIA study  which showed that at a median follow up of 28 months  the addition of Darzalex to Rd significantly reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 44  in such patients compared to treatment with Rd alone  While progression free survival   PFS   for patients who received Rd alone was 31 9 months  the median PFS for Darzalex plus Rd arm was not reached  The regulatory application was reviewed by the FDA under the Real Time Oncology Review pilot program  which ensures a more efficient review process 
Darzalex has been generating strong sales and is a key contributor to J J s top line  The drug generated sales of  629 million in the first quarter of 2019  representing year over year growth of nearly 45 5  
Meanwhile  Darzalex is being evaluated in a comprehensive clinical development program across a range of treatment settings in multiple myeloma  such as in frontline and relapsed settings

198155,419671,JNJ,J J vows to overturn  4 7 billion talc verdict but experts see hurdles,news,"By Tina Bellon NEW YORK  Reuters    Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  has vowed to appeal a  4 7 billion verdict awarded to 22 women who claim asbestos contaminated talc in the company s products gave them ovarian cancer by arguing the plaintiffs  science was flawed and the case should not have been heard in Missouri  But several legal experts said that even though J J has been successful in winning appeals of other talc cases in Missouri  it will face a challenging road in appealing the verdict handed down on Thursday in the Circuit Court of the City of St  Louis  John Beisner  a lawyer for Johnson   Johnson  said   One of the hardest things will be prioritizing what to appeal first   He described to Reuters the company s jurisdictional and scientific arguments for overturning Thursday s verdict  In a statement responding to the verdict  J J reiterated its position that its products never contained asbestos and were not carcinogenic   Thursday s verdict is the largest to date arising from lawsuits alleging talc based products like J J s baby powder have caused cancer  The jury reached its decision in less than a day  following five weeks of expert testimony from both sides  The stakes are potentially high for J J  which is facing 9 000 cases nationwide over talc  The company has had previous success in overturning large verdicts in talc cases as well as others alleging harm from its products  But several legal experts said Missouri courts  including at the appellate and supreme court level  were historically plaintiff friendly and could prove unreceptive to J J s arguments   J J has strong arguments  but unless they get to certify this case to the U S  Supreme Court  which are very long odds  this decision is likely to stand   said Lars Noah  a law professor at the University of Florida  He said he expected J J would go through the appeals process but would ultimately wind up settling the case  Beisner said he was not aware of any interest in settlement   Our attention will remain focused on the appeals from this and the other trials awaiting review   Beisner said jurisdiction will be one major basis for J J to appeal Thursday s verdict  Most of the 22 plaintiffs were not Missouri residents  and he said they should not have been allowed to sue New Jersey based Johnson   Johnson in St  Louis under a recent U S  Supreme Court decision that severely restricted state courts  jurisdiction over injury lawsuits brought by non residents against out of state companies  J J seized on that decision to successfully overturn previous talc verdicts in Missouri  Mark Lanier  the plaintiffs  lawyer who won Thursday s verdict  said he was ready for that argument  Lanier said his team amassed  hundreds of pages of evidence  showing lobbying efforts and baby powder focus groups J J conducted in the state  He also spotlighted the claim by 15 of his non resident clients that they used a specific short lived J J talc based product manufactured by Missouri based contractor   I hope they focus their appeal on jurisdiction because I m confident we ll win that   Lanier said  He did say that he expects the punitive damages award to be halved during the appeals process due to a Missouri state law that caps such damages  but is confident the verdict would stand overall  The  4 69 billion in total damages includes  550 million in compensatory damages and  4 14 billion in punitive damages  Elizabeth Burch  a law professor at the University of Georgia  said that even under the new Supreme Court guidance  the women s claim that they used the specific product  if true  provided  a pretty strong link to Missouri   At trial J J had unsuccessfully sought to cast doubt on the 15 women s claims to have used the same product that was only available for a few months  depicting it as a ruse designed to bypass the jurisdiction issue  Beisner said J J would make the same argument on appeal  Along with jurisdictional arguments  Beisner said the company would continue to put forth its case that scientific studies overwhelmingly show talc itself is safe and the company s talc based products never contained asbestos    None of plaintiffs  experts were able to put forward a valid theory and there is simply no science to support what they call asbestos in the product   said Beisner  J J says decades of testing by laboratories and independent agencies  including a study by the U S  Food and Drug Administration  support its position  The company said plaintiffs  tests showing asbestos contamination were  junk science   But Lanier argued that it was the agencies and labs cited by J J that used flawed testing methods that failed to detect asbestos  Noah said Missouri judges have historically applied a lower standard than federal court for admitting scientific evidence  Last year the state passed a law requiring its courts to

198161,419677,JNJ,Is J J Snack Foods  JJSF  A Solid Growth Stock  3 Reasons To Think   Yes  ,opinion,"Growth stocks are attractive to many investors  as above average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market s attention and produce exceptional returns  But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all 
By their very nature  these stocks carry above average risk and volatility  Moreover  if a company s growth story is over or nearing its end  betting on it could lead to significant loss 
However  the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects  makes it pretty easy to find cutting edge growth stocks 
J J  NYSE JNJ  Snack Foods  JJSF  is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system  In addition to a favorable Growth Score  it carries a top Zacks Rank 
Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market  And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   returns are even better 
Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this drink and snack maker a great growth pick right now 
Earnings Growth

While the historical EPS growth rate for J J Snack Foods is 3 8   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 21 3  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 6  
Impressive Asset Utilization Ratio
Growth investors often overlook asset utilization ratio  also known as sales to total assets  S TA  ratio  but it is an important feature of a real growth stock  This metric exhibits how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales 
Right now  J J Snack Foods has an S TA ratio of 1 24  which means that the company gets  1 24 in sales for each dollar in assets  Comparing this to the industry average of 1 2  it can be said that the company is more efficient 
In addition to efficiency in generating sales  sales growth plays an important role  And J J Snack Foods looks attractive from a sales growth perspective as well  The company s sales are expected to grow 2 8  this year versus the industry average of 0 2  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Beyond the metrics outlined above  investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is a plus here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
The current year earnings estimates for J J Snack Foods have been revising upward  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 1  over the past month 
Bottom Line
J J Snack Foods has not only earned a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above  but it also carries a Zacks Rank  2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions

198170,419686,JNJ,Johnson   Johnson  Best In Class Dividend Growth Stock ,opinion,"Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  has raised its dividend for 57 consecutive years and thus it is a Dividend King  Thanks to the strength of its brands and its solid growth trajectory  it has always been a slow moving stock  However  the stock has been facing a series of litigation issues since December and hence it has entered a remarkably volatile period  As a result  it has shed 6  in the last week and is now trading 12  lower off its peak  in December  The big question is whether the stock has become a bargain 
Business overview
Johnson   Johnson is an outstanding company  It has grown its operational earnings for 35 consecutive years and its dividend for 57 years in a row  The company has 26 brands platforms that generate more than  1 billion in annual sales  with 14 of them generating more than  2 billion in annual sales 
Source  Investor Presentation
Johnson   Johnson generates approximately 70  of its sales from the Nr 1 or 2 position  It is also the Nr 5 in the U S  and Nr 8 globally in R D investment  Thanks to this leading position  it currently generates about 25  of its sales from products that were introduced in the last five years  This is an impressive accomplishment for a mature company that has a market capitalization of  348 billion  which reassures investors that management never rests on its laurels  instead  it continuously tries to keep the company in its enviable  multi decade growth trajectory 
Growth prospects
Johnson   Johnson is well known for its consumer products but the main growth driver of the company is its pharmaceutical segment  which generates about half of the total revenues  The consumer segment has stumbled in the last two years  as it has become very easy to launch a new product online and market it at a minimum cost via social media  This is reflected in the performance of this division  which grew its revenue by only 2  last year  Moreover  the medical device segment grew its revenue by only 1  last year whereas the pharmaceutical segment achieved 12  revenue growth  A similar trend was observed in the first quarter of this year as well 
It is thus evident that Johnson   Johnson relies primarily on its pharmaceutical business to keep growing its earnings at a meaningful pace  Indeed this segment has exciting growth prospects ahead  In the first quarter  it posted 8  revenue growth mostly thanks to strong uptake of Stelara in Crohn s disease and market share gain of Darzalex in the U S   Europe  Japan and Latin America  as well as strong momentum of Imbruvica  These brands will continue to drive growth in the upcoming years thanks to increased penetration 
Moreover  Johnson   Johnson expects up to 10 major launches over the next three years  Each of these launches is expected to generate more than  1 billion in annual revenues  Furthermore  the acquisition of Actellion  which cost  30 billion  is likely to provide another source of growth  Thanks to all these growth drivers  management expects to grow the operational earnings per share by 5 7  7 6  this year and will continue growing them at a significant rate in the upcoming years 
Dividend
Johnson   Johnson has raised its dividend for 57 consecutive years and thus it is a dividend king  It has been able to achieve such an impressive dividend growth streak thanks to its consistent earnings growth record  The company has grown its operational earnings for 35 consecutive years  These growth streaks are impressive  particularly given the intense competition in the pharmaceutical business and the shocks in the cash flows that are sometimes caused by the expiration of patents 
Moreover  the company has a low dividend payout ratio  which stands at 42   and a pristine balance sheet  Given also its promising growth prospects  Johnson   Johnson is likely to continue raising its dividend for several more years  Therefore  investors can purchase the stock at its current 2 9  dividend yield and rest assured that the dividend will keep rising for the foreseeable future

198177,419693,JNJ,FDA names drugmakers potentially acting to delay cheap generics,news,"By Michael Erman  Reuters    The U S  Food and Drug Administration on Thursday listed a number of drugmakers it said could be improperly blocking access to their medicines in order to delay generic competition  But many of the companies immediately pushed back  saying the FDA list of drugmakers may be out of date and that some of the drugs included on it already have generic competitors  The FDA said the list contained all of the inquiries about drugs it had received from generic drugmakers since 2005  It said companies generally do not inform it if they have made samples available after a generic developer has reached out to the agency   Releasing the list of drugmakers  which includes  Celgene Corp   O CELG   Johnson   Johnson  N JNJ   Gilead Sciences  O GILD  and  Novartis  AG  S NOVN   is part of the Trump administration s efforts to pressure companies to lower drug prices  Last week  U S  President Donald Trump unveiled a  blueprint  aimed at doing that  but critics have said the proposals did not do nearly enough to substantially decrease the cost of drugs for consumers  Shares of drugmakers rose on Friday after Trump s speech  The agency said companies on the list may be using FDA safety regulations and other tactics to deny access to their medicines from generic drugmakers hoping to copy them  Generic drugmakers may not be able to develop alternatives without access to samples of branded products they intend to copy  the FDA said   I want to be very clear  a path to securing samples of brand drugs for the purpose of generic drug development should always be available   FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said in a statement   Gottlieb  who has made faster approvals of cheaper generic medicines a priority  said this should be true even in cases where there is limited access to drugs for safety reasons  The FDA is notifying the Federal Trade Commission  which can investigate anti competitive acts  of cases where drugmakers may be blocking access to their products if there is no safety reason  Gottlieb added   The FDA said it had also heard of some drugmakers adopting tactics to make it hard for generic companies to purchase branded drugs even at a fair value in the open market  Industry lobby group Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America  PhRMA  said it was concerned that the FDA list lacks context and conflates a number of issues    It is important to differentiate between those products for which FDA has received complaints as opposed to those products for which it has received a request for a safety determination letter   PhRMA said  Celgene  for example  argued that the three of its products on the FDA list all carry risk of significant side effects  including severe birth defects   These therapies are subjected to rigorous safety controls that have been developed by the company and approved by the FDA   Celgene said in a statement  It noted that two of the three drugs already have generic versions licensed to enter the market in coming years  including multiple myeloma treatment Revlimid  by far the company s biggest selling product  A number of other companies said the drugs in question already had generic competition  Roche  S ROG   which was listed for acne drug Accutane  said it stopped making or selling the drug in the United States in 2009  RBC Capital Markets analyst Brian Abrahams said in a research note that the effect of the FDA s list will likely be limited

In addition to efficiency in generating sales  sales growth plays an important role  And J J Snack Foods looks attractive from a sales growth perspective as well  The company s sales are expected to grow 2 8  this year versus the industry average of 0  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions

Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is AbbVie due for a pullback  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts  AbbVie Beats on Q1 Earnings   Sales  Raises EPS ViewFirst quarter 2019 earnings of  2 14 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 06  Earnings rose 14 4  year over year driven by higher sales and operating margins  Earnings per share were also better than the guided range of  2 05 and  2 07 Revenues of  7 83 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  7 75 billion  Sales decreased 1 3  on a reported basis  Excluding a 1 7  unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rate fluctuations  operational revenues rose 0 4  backed by higher sales of several products  which offset the impact of international biosimilar competition  Revenues were higher than the guided figure of approximately  7 7 billion Quarter in DetailsHumira sales declined 5 6   3 8  on an operational basis  to  4 4 billion Sales in the United States increased 7 1  to  3 22 billion  in line with the guidance  driven by strong demand trends  Humira sales in ex U S  markets were down 23  on an operational basis and 27 9  on a reported basis to  1 23 billionInternational sales were severely impacted by the launch of several direct biosimilar drugs in Europe and other international markets  On the call  the company said that biosimilar trends and dynamics were in line with management expectations In the U S  market  Humira sales are expected to rise approximately 7  in 2019  which is less than growth of 10  in 2018 due to lighter price contribution for the year  In 2019  international Humira sales are expected to decline approximately 30  on an operational basis AbbVie s oncology hematology  including Imbruvica and Venclexta  sales rose 43 2  to  1 17 billion in the quarter driven by strong growth of both Imbruvica and Venclexta  First quarter net revenues from Imbruvica were  1 02 billion  in line with the guidance  up 34  year over year  U S  sales of Imbruvica grossed  829 million  up 32 8  from the year ago figure primarily driven by continued uptake in the frontline CLL segment  AbbVie logged  193 million of international profit sharing with J J  NYSE JNJ   up 39 6  year over year Venclexta  brought in revenues of  151 million  up more than 100  year over year driven by continued uptake in the second line plus setting following approval in the broad relapsed refractory CLL segment  MURANO study  last year and the recent launch in first line AML In 2019  Imbruvica global revenues are expected to approach  4 4 billion with sales in the United States growing approximately 21   Venclexta sales are expected to be approximately  725 million  Total global oncology hematology sales are expected to be approximately  5 1 billion HCV products  including Viekira and Mavyret  recorded sales of  815 million  down 11 3   down 9 1  on an operational basis  year over year on lower sales of Mavyret as well as Viekira  In the United States  HCV revenues rose 17 3  to  403 million reflecting market share gains Mavyret accounted for  790 million in the quarter  down 6 9   down 4 9  on an operational basis  year over year In 2019  global HCV sales are expected to be higher than  3 3 billion with roughly flat performance in the United States and international sales of approximately  1 7 billion Other products that delivered an impressive performance include Duodopa  It recorded revenue growth of 14 4  on an operational basis and 8 3  on a reported basis  While Creon  which generates sales from U S  markets  witnessed an increase of 8 6  in revenues  sales of Kaletra grew 10 9  and 6 9  on operational and reported basis  respectively Drugs that recorded sales decline include Androgel  Synagis and Sevoflurane  which fell 42 9   7  and 8 5   respectively  operationally  during the quarter Margins RiseAdjusted gross margin rose 310 bps to 83 3  in the quarter  Adjusted gross margin includes a 280 bps benefit due to low Humira royalties owed  Adjusted SG A expenses decreased 6 4  to  1 56 billion  However  as a percentage of sales  SG A expenses declined 100 bps to 20  in the quarter  R D expenses rose almost 1  to  1 2 billion in the first quarter due to greater investments in the pipeline  Adjusted operating margin was 48 1  of sales in the reported quarter  up 400 bps year over year 2019 GuidanceAbbVie raised its guidance for adjusted EPS based on a strong first quarter performance and strong business momentum  Earnings are now expected in the range of  8 73  8 83  up from the previous guidance of  8 65  8 75 for 2019  The earnings guidance indicates a year over year increase of 11  at the mid point Revenues are expected to grow approximately 1  on an operational basis in 2019  Currency headwinds are expected to hurt 2019 revenues by approximately 1   compared to less than 1  expected previously In 2019  AbbVie expects roughly  2 billion of erosion related to international biosimilar competition to Humira  In addition  it expects a  400 million headwind from generic competition to AndroGel in 2019  Also  costs to support expected launches of five new products and line extensions should put pressure on margins  However  these new products will be at early stages of their launch trajectory in 2019 and will not be a significant offset to international biosimilar impact  However  AbbVie believes the products will grow over the next few years and provide significant offset to the 2023 U S  biosimilar event In 2019  AbbVie believes that the loss of international Humira revenues will be made up for by U S  Humira and hematological oncology franchise growth Adjusted gross margin is expected to approach 83  of sales in 2019  up from 82 5  expected previously Operating margin is expected to be just above 47   an increase of roughly 250 basis points year over year  Previously  the operating margin was expected to be just above 46 5   representing an increase of 200 bps While R D is expected to be approximately 15 5  of sales  SG A is expected to be approximately 20 5  of salesSecond Quarter 2019 OutlookSecond quarter earnings are expected between  2 20 and  2 22 per share  Revenues are estimated to be above  8 1 billion  Foreign exchange is expected to have approximately 1 5  unfavorable impact on sales in the quarter While U S  Humira sales are expected to rise approximately 7   international Humira sales are expected to be approximately  1 billion  Imbruvica is expected to record sales of approximately  1 1 billion Adjusted operating margin is expected to be similar to the first quarter level of 48 1   which is higher than the full year expectation of just above 47   This is because the company expects higher spending related to new product launches in the second half  In the second quarter  sales contribution from Skyrizi is expected to be modest  Skyrizi is expected to contribute approximately  150 million of sales in the second half of 2019  Orilissa sales are expected to be approximately  200 million in 2019  
How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then

cancer drugs like Imbruvica and Darzalex rose 9  in the quarter to  2 52 billion  Other core products like Stelara  Simponi Simponi Aria and Invega Sustenna and new immunology medicines like Tremfya

United States Imbruvica sales rose 33 5  to  784 million in the quarter driven by market share gains and strong market growth across multiple indications in the United States and strong uptake in the European and Asia Pacific markets Darzalex sales rose 45 5  to  629 million in the quarter  In United States  market growth and market share gains drove sales  In outside U S  markets  increased

strong start and could prove to be an important growth driver for the company Zytiga sales declined 19 6  to  679 million in the quarter as growth outside the United States was offset by sales decline in the United States due to generic competition Sales of Procrit Eprex declined 18  to  226 million in the quarter Xarelto sales declined 6 3  in the quarter to  542 million as prescription growth was offset by increased discounts and rebates The October 2018 FDA approval of Xarelto for a new 2 5 milligram vascular dose for the CAD PAD indication significantly expands the drug s eligible patient population  which can improve sales of the drug in the future quarters  Regarding this label expansion  management said on the call that it has seen positive response to the 2 5 milligram vascular dose and it could be a significant contributor to Xarelto s sales in the future quarters  Also  if J J s sNDA to include data from MARINER and MAGELLAN studies on Xarelto s label is approved and

198213,419729,JNJ,Why Johnson   Johnson  JNJ  Is A Top Dividend Stock For Your Portfolio,opinion,"All investors love getting big returns from their portfolio  whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  But when you re an income investor  your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments 
While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments  income investors hone in on dividends  A dividend is the distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  it s often viewed by its dividend yield  a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long term returns  with dividend contributions exceeding one third of total returns in many cases 
Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  in Focus
Johnson   Johnson  JNJ  is headquartered in New Brunswick  and is in the Medical sector  The stock has seen a price change of 10  since the start of the year  Currently paying a dividend of  0 9 per share  the company has a dividend yield of 2 54   In comparison  the Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry s yield is 2 98   while the S P 500 s yield is 1 88  
In terms of dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  3 60 is up 1 7  from last year  Over the last 5 years  Johnson   Johnson has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 6 11   Looking ahead  future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Johnson   Johnson s current payout ratio is 44   This means it paid out 44  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
JNJ is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  8 60 per share  which represents a year over year growth rate of 5 13  
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for many reasons  they greatly improve stock investing profits  decrease overall portfolio risk  and carry tax advantages  among others  It s important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout 
High growth firms or tech start ups  for example  rarely provide their shareholders a dividend  while larger  more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  With that in mind  JNJ is a compelling investment opportunity  Not only is it a strong dividend play  but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3  Hold  ",2019-05-01,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-johnson--johnson-jnj-is-a-top-dividend-stock-for-your-portfolio-200415595,200415595

198237,419753,JNJ,Looking For A Growth Stock  3 Reasons Why Johnson   Johnson  JNJ  Is A Solid Choice,opinion,"Growth stocks are attractive to many investors  as above average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market s attention and produce exceptional returns  But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all 
That s because  these stocks usually carry above average risk and volatility  In fact  betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss 
However  the task of finding cutting edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects 
Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends  The company not only has a favorable Growth Score  but also carries a top Zacks Rank 
Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market  And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   returns are even better 
Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this world s biggest maker of health care products a great growth pick right now 
Earnings Growth
Earnings growth is arguably the most important factor  as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors  And for growth investors  double digit earnings growth is definitely preferable  and often an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Johnson   Johnson is 7 8   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 4 9  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 0 7  
Cash Flow Growth
Cash is the lifeblood of any business  but higher than average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for Johnson   Johnson is 13 9   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 10 2  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 7 9  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 3 3  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Superiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is of course favorable here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
There have been upward revisions in current year earnings estimates for Johnson   Johnson  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0 1  over the past month 
Bottom Line
Johnson   Johnson has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above  but it also carries a Zacks Rank  2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions

Cash flow can come from bond interest  interest from other types of investments  and of course  dividends  A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  and investors often view it by its dividend yield  a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long term returns  with dividend contributions exceeding one third of total returns in many cases 
Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  in Focus
Johnson   Johnson  JNJ  is headquartered in New Brunswick  and is in the Medical sector  The stock has seen a price change of 5 79  since the start of the year  The world s biggest maker of health care products is paying out a dividend of  0 9 per share at the moment  with a dividend yield of 2 64  compared to the Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry s yield of 2 91  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 9  
Taking a look at the company s dividend growth  its current annualized dividend of  3 60 is up 1 7  from last year  Over the last 5 years  Johnson   Johnson has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 6 11   Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company s payout ratio  a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Johnson   Johnson s current payout ratio is 44   This means it paid out 44  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Looking at this fiscal year  JNJ expects solid earnings growth  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  8 58 per share  representing a year over year earnings growth rate of 4 89  
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for many reasons  they greatly improve stock investing profits  decrease overall portfolio risk  and carry tax advantages  among others  However  not all companies offer a quarterly payout 
Big  established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  but it s fairly uncommon to see high growth businesses or tech start ups offer their stockholders a dividend  Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  With that in mind  JNJ presents a compelling investment opportunity  it s not only an attractive dividend play  but the stock also boasts a strong Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  ",2019-04-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/johnson--johnson-jnj-is-a-top-dividend-stock-right-now-should-you-buy-200407141,200407141

198249,419765,JNJ,Sanofi beats Novo to buy Ablynx for  4 8 billion in biotech M A boom,news,"By Matthias Blamont and Ben Hirschler PARIS LONDON  Reuters    French drugmaker Sanofi  PA SASY  has agreed to buy Belgian biotech company Ablynx for 3 9 billion euros   4 8 billion   beating  Novo Nordisk   CO NOVOb  and marking its second big deal this month after buying Bioverativ  The transaction is a further sign of accelerating merger and acquisition  M A  activity in the global biotech sector and comes after Ablynx rejected a 2 6 billion euro offer from Denmark s Novo Nordisk  Sanofi said on Monday it would pay 45 euros per share in cash for Ablynx  a premium of 21 percent over its closing price on Friday  and more than double the price before Novo went public with its initial bid  Novo Nordisk conceded defeat  saying it could not justify the knock out price being paid by Sanofi for Ablynx  which is developing a prized experimental drug for a rare blood disorder  This month has seen a spike in multibillion dollar deals in biotech  with U S  based Celgene  NASDAQ CELG  paying  9 billion for cancer specialist Juno Therapeutics  and several experts predicting a bumper year for M A  Total biotech M A so far this month now stands at  26 3 billion  or more than 80 percent of the value of all deals in 2016 and far ahead of any comparable January tally in over a decade  according to Thomson Reuters data  Such deals are being driven by the need for large drugmakers to tap the promising new medicines being developed by smaller rivals to help revive flagging growth  Last week  Sanofi agreed to buy U S  haemophilia specialist Bioverativ for  11 6 billion  its biggest deal for seven years and a major play to strengthen its presence in treatments for rare diseases  Sanofi Chief Executive Officer Olivier Brandicourt said the deals expanded the French company s late stage pipeline and strengthened its line up of treatments for rare blood disorders   but did not necessarily mark the end of its M A ambitions   We have a strong balance sheet  We generate significant cash flow  We are going to look at opportunities on a case by case basis   he told reporters   We also identified CHC  consumer healthcare  previously as an area where we want to sustain a leadership position and therefore you can expect us to evaluate opportunities   Both  Pfizer   NYSE PFE  and Merck  NYSE MRK  KGaA are currently looking to divest consumer health businesses  Sanofi  which expects the cost of debt to finance the deal to be around 1 percent  said Ablynx would boost long term shareholder value  while being neutral for business earnings per share in 2018 and 2019   The Belgian group specializes in the research of novel drugs based on so called nanobodies found in the immune systems of llamas and alpacas  for which it partners with several of the world s largest pharmaceutical companies  EXPERIMENTAL DRUG  Sanofi is already one of Ablynx s big pharma partners  after striking a deal in July 2017 to find new treatments for inflammatory diseases  By buying the company outright it will now get access to Ablynx s most promising asset  the experimental drug caplacizumab for treating the blood disease acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura  Brandicourt said caplacizumab would complement Sanofi s line up of blood products  following the acquisition of Bioverativ and an earlier deal to obtain global rights for fitusiran from Alnylam  Sanofi will be able to use its existing infrastructure and the recently acquired platform from Bioverativ to help to commercialize caplacizumab  It will also benefit from some of the other drugs Ablynx is working on  such as an infant anti viral treatment  that would not have fitted within Novo Nordisk  Berenberg analysts said Ablynx was a good fit but they estimated the deal would generate no more than a 4 percent return on invested capital  assuming caplacizumab sales of around 400 million euros by 2023  Ablynx itself has forecast peak caplacizumab sales of 1 2 billion euros  but Sanofi said it was too early to comment  The rare blood drug was also the main attraction for Novo Nordisk  The Danish group has sat out previous rounds of M A in the drugs sector to focus on its core diabetes business but it now needs to find new products for its struggling smaller biopharmaceutical unit  where Ablynx would have been a good fit  That remains a challenge for CEO Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen  who took over a year ago  and has previously stated that Novo Nordisk needs external innovation to broaden its product line up  Chief Financial Officer Jesper Brandgaard told Reuters Novo Nordisk would continue to hunt for promising assets to boost its blood products business  Shares in Sanofi were little changed  with pricing considerations offset by relief that Sanofi was finally taking action to improve its drugs portfolio  following its past failure to land big deals  Sanofi lost out on buying California based cancer specialist Medivation to Pfizer in 2016  and also missed acquiring Swiss biotech company Actelion  which was bought by Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  last year   Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS  and Lazard advised Sanofi on the deal while JP Morgan advised Ablynx

    J J s stock has risen 5 1  this year so far compared with an increase of 3 9  recorded by the  
  Factors to ConsiderJ J s sales growth accelerated in 2018 backed by above market sales growth in the Pharmaceutical segment and improved performance of the Medical Devices unit  However  on the fourth quarter conference call  J J said that 2019 sales are likely to be hurt by generic biosimilar headwinds in the Pharma unit The strong performance of the Pharmaceuticals segment was driven by its oncology portfolio  a trend expected to remain unchanged in the first quarter of 2019  J J s cancer drugs like Imbruvica and Darzalex should continue to perform well  In the first quarter  J J gained line extension approvals for a split dosing regimen of Darzalex in the United States and EU and for Imbruvica in the United States in combination with Roche s   OTC RHHBY   Gazyva  obinutuzumab  for the treatment of first line chronic lymphocytic leukemia small lymphocytic lymphoma  CLL SLL   The label expansions will contribute to these drugs  sales in the quarter Other core products like Stelara and Invega Sustenna should also contribute to growth  However  sales of some other key drugs like Simponi Simponi Aria and Xarelto declined in the fourth quarter  It remains to be seen if these drugs  sales improve in the first quarter  The FDA approval of Xarelto for a new 2 5 milligram vascular dose for the CAD PAD indication in October has significantly expanded the drug s eligible patient population  which may improve sales of the drug in the first quarter Also  new drugs like Erleada and Tremfya should perform well  Regarding newly launched Tremfya  J J said on the Q4 call that the product is seeing strong demand trends and has captured 6 6  share of the psoriasis market in the United States In the pulmonary arterial hypertension  PAH category  strong demand for Uptravi and Opsumit is likely to be partially offset by a decline in Tracleer due to increased use of Opsumit as well as generic competition in Europe Continued biosimilar competition for Remicade and Procrit and generic competition for Velcade  Tracleer and Zytiga in the United States are expected to hurt revenues in 2019  Other than that  pricing pressure will continue to hurt salesSeveral generic versions of key prostate cancer drug Zytiga have entered the market  J J received an unfavorable ruling in district court cases related to generic versions of Zytiga  which opened doors for an earlier than expected generic launch in 2018  Sales of Zytiga slowed down significantly in the fourth quarter due to the impact of generic competition in the United States  a negative trend expected to continue in the first quarter While the Consumer unit will grow slightly above the market in 2019 supported by innovation and improved go to market models  the Medical Devices segment is expected to improve driven by better execution and product introductions The Zacks Consensus Estimate for J J s Pharmaceuticals  Consumer and Medical Device segments is  9 8 billion   3 4 billion and  6 4 billion  respectively Investor focus on the call will be on the launch plans for J J s newly approved nasal spray Spravato  esketamine  for treatment resistant depression  TRD  in adults  Spravato was approved by the FDA last month Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that J J is likely to beat on earnings this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive

198251,419767,JNJ,5 Stocks To Prepare For A Global Economic Slowdown,opinion,On Apr 9  the International Monetary Fund  IMF  reduced its growth forecast for the year once again  The international lending body believes economic headwinds including monetary tightening by the Federal Reserve and trade conflicts could derail global growth in the months ahead The IMF also cited industrial production data and surveys of purchasing managers to justify its projection for slower global growth in 2019  Meanwhile  even as China implements stimulus measures to boost its flagging economy  the situation in Eurozone remains worrying With a lurking global economic slowdown  it makes sense to fortify your portfolio for such conditions  In such an event  demand for products and services generated by utilities  consumer staples and medical companies remain invariant  Investing in stocks from these sectors looks like a smart option IMF Cuts Global Growth ProjectionsOn Tuesday  the IMF reduced its forecast for global economic growth for the third time in six months  The international lending body now believes that global growth will clock in at 3 3  for 2019  0 2  lower than the estimate released in January  However  its projection for 2020 remained flat at 3 6  A major headwind for the global economy is the lingering trade war between the United States and China  The IMF thinks that the inability to come to an agreement and the resultant tariff barriers would result in  higher costs of imported intermediate and capital goods and higher final goods prices for consumers  And despite the Federal Reserve s recent attempts to step away from its earlier hawkish standpoint  the IMF thinks a change in the monetary stance of central banks could also imperil global growth  The IMF thinks that market expectations for the federal funds rate is well below the Fed s projections According to the global lender  this is likely to  result in higher US interest rates  renewed dollar appreciation  and tighter financial conditions  for emerging economies with large volumes of debt Global Stimulus Needed  Eurozone VulnerableSpeaking at a news conference in Washington on Tuesday  IMF chief economist Gita Gopinath said that this was a  delicate moment for the global economy   The IMF believes that coordinated global stimulus measures would be needed to cushion the impact of a sharp downturn  Gopinath added that a dovish monetary approach would also be needed to counter the slowdown According to the IMF  most of the global economy s likely troubles this year will originate from problems in developed economies  including leading members of the EU  Apart from the impact of an inevitable Brexit  other factors are impeding growth in the region The outlook for Germany  the Eurozone s economic powerhouse  has softened because of sluggish demand for exports and a decline in consumer spending  Tougher emission standards are also likely to weigh on sales of cars produced in the country Our ChoicesThe IMF s decision to cut global growth projections is likely to rattle investors across the world  The risks it lays out while justifying this reduction are very real and likely to weigh on the pace of economic expansion in the near term Investing in stocks whose demand remains invariant even during an all encompassing slowdown looks prudent at this time

198265,419781,JNJ,Earnings Preview  Johnson   Johnson  JNJ  Q1 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 16  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This world s biggest maker of health care products is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 04 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  1  
Revenues are expected to be  19 63 billion  down 1 9  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2 53  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Johnson   Johnson 
For Johnson   Johnson  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  2 52  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Johnson   Johnson will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Johnson   Johnson would post earnings of  1 95 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 97  delivering a surprise of  1 03  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Johnson   Johnson doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-08,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-johnson--johnson-jnj-q1-earnings-expected-to-decline-200405140,200405140
198266,419782,JNJ,Johnson   Johnson  An Ideal DRIP Stock,opinion,"Investors that take advantage of a DRIP  Dividend Reinvestment Plan  get access to direct purchases of a company s stock  funded by the dividend payments they are receiving  This happens automatically and is seamless to the investor 
There are many stocks that offer DRIPs to investors  but some of them require the stockholder to pay a fee to use the DRIP  Obviously  that is a negative for the investor as these fees eat into returns over time  The good news is that there are companies that offer no fee DRIPs  which help investors build their wealth more quickly when used with high quality  dividend paying companies 
Dividend Aristocrats are the perfect subset of stocks to examine for DRIP investors as they are among the best of the best in terms of dividend stocks  They have at least 25 year track records of growing dividends and are members of the S P 500 index  One Dividend Aristocrat that offers investors a no fee DRIP is Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ   We see it as among the best DRIP stocks 
Business Overview And Recent Events
Johnson   Johnson is a diversified health care company that provides a wide variety of common use and specialized medical products around the world  The company derives about half of its revenue from pharmaceuticals  about a third from medical devices  and the balance from general consumer products  Johnson   Johnson was founded in 1886 and today  it employs 125 000 people around the world  The stock has a current market capitalization of more than  360 billion 
The company has an impressive slate of dominant products in their respective categories 

Source  Earnings presentation  page 22
In fact  the company has 26 different product families that each produces at least a billion dollars in annual revenue  including 12 that have at least  2 billion in annual revenue 
Johnson   Johnson reported full year earnings on January 22  2019  and results looked quite good  Earnings per share rose 12  year over year to  8 18  The revenue growth came in at 7  for 2018 thanks to broad gains across its segments 
The largest segment  pharmaceuticals  grew its top line by 12 4  in 2018 thanks mostly due to strong organic growth  Worldwide sales for this segment rose 8 4  without the benefit of acquisitions and divestitures  completing another year of strong performance from the company s core business  Oncology and immunology drugs were the big winners and drove a strong performance for the segment as a whole 
Medical devices showed much lower growth rates throughout 2018 and finished the year with a 1 5  worldwide sales gain  Excluding acquisitions and divestitures  that number rose to 2 6  as strength in interventional solutions  surgery  and vision was offset by weakness in diabetes care and orthopedics 
Finally  the consumer products segment saw 2018 growth of 1 8  on the top line  which was 3 2  excluding acquisitions and divestitures  The company suffered mightily in its wound care business  which declined by more than 13  in 2018  However  beauty care showed strength  as did OTC  which sells highly recognizable products like Tylenol and Zyrtec 
In total  2018 represented another year of strong growth that also highlighted the benefits Johnson   Johnson accrues from its deep and wide portfolio of health care products  Johnson   Johnson is present in an enormous variety of segments and product families and over time  this diversification has produced good results for shareholders 
Management expects earnings per share to come in around  8 58 for 2019  representing prospective growth of about 5  over last year 
Based upon this midpoint of earnings guidance  Johnson   Johnson trades today at a price to earnings multiple of 15 9  which is nearly exactly in line with our estimate of fair value at 15 8 times earnings  This is based upon the company s own historical price to earnings multiples and given the rate of growth earnings should experience this year  we see it as a reasonable valuation  Given that the current valuation and our estimate of fair value are essentially the same  we see no impact to total returns from the valuation in the coming years 
In total  we forecast total returns of about 9  for Johnson   Johnson annually in the coming years  Returns will accrue from a combination of earnings growth  which we see at 6  annually  and the dividend yield  which is currently 2 6   As mentioned  we see no change from the valuation 
Dividend Growth And DRIP Stocks
Johnson   Johnson s latest dividend declaration was for 90 cents  marking the fourth quarter of dividends in that amount  The annualized payout of  3 60 is good for a 2 6  yield today as the share price has rallied in recent weeks  Johnson   Johnson normally raises its dividend in April for May distribution  so we d expect to see an announcement of a higher payout in the coming weeks 
When investors elect to use the DRIP feature offered by Johnson   Johnson  the compounding effect of the dividend on one s wealth becomes even more profound  If an investor bought shares today at the 2 6  yield and elected into the DRIP  that investor would automatically receive the 2 6  yield in additional shares each quarter as the dividend is paid  The second year  assuming a flat share price and no change in the payout  the investor would receive dividends on 102 6  of their original investment  compounding the impact of the dividend 
Johnson   Johnson also continues to grow its payout   averaging more than 6  annual growth in the past decade   which creates a double compounding effect from the DRIP 
Over the course of many years  this impact can be enormous as the investor s yield on cost grows over time  Finding high quality dividend names with long track records of dividend growth   and no fee DRIPs   is one of the best ways to build dividend stock wealth over time 
We see Johnson   Johnson as a high quality stock that has a deep and wide product portfolio that affords it strong earnings growth potential  With the stock right at fair value and the yield at 2 6    a number that should be higher in a few weeks thanks to an anticipated dividend raise   we see Johnson   Johnson as offering attractive returns for dividend investors  When combined with the fact that the company offers a no fee DRIP  we believe it is a terrific opportunity for investors to build their wealth over time

Per the deal  the companies will develop and commercialize Daiichi Sankyo s proprietary antibody drug conjugate  ADC  trastuzumab deruxtecan  which they claim has the potential to redefine the standard of care in cancer treatment  This is because targeted cancer medicines like ADC s deliver chemotherapy selectively to cancer cells and reduce systemic exposure unlike conventional chemotherapy medicines 
Trastuzumab deruxtecan is being developed in HER2 expressing cancers including five pivotal late stage studies for HER2 expressing breast and gastric cancers and mid stage studies for HER2 expressing advanced colorectal cancer and metastatic non squamous HER2 overexpressing or HER2 mutated NSCLC  The first regulatory application for trastuzumab deruxtecan is expected to be filed in the second half of 2019 for advanced or refractory breast cancer 
The candidate enjoys FDA s Breakthrough Therapy status for HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer in patients who have been previously treated with Roche s   OTC RHHBY   breast cancer medicines Herceptin  trastuzumab  and Perjeta  pertuzumab  and witnessed disease progression after trastuzumab emtansine 
For the deal  AstraZeneca will make an upfront payment of  1 35 billion while being entitled to make contingent payments  comprising regulatory and sales related milestone fees of up to  5 55 billion
Daiichi  however  retained exclusive rights to the drug in Japan  The companies will equally share development and commercialization costs  AstraZeneca informed that it will fund the transaction partly through a share issue of up to  3 5 billion  
The deal further strengthens AstraZeneca s oncology pipeline  AstraZeneca is aggressively working on strengthening its oncology product portfolio and has several candidates in its pipeline  Oncology sales now comprise around 29  of total product sales for AstraZeneca and rose 50  in 2018  Key new and successful cancer drugs in its pipeline are Imfinzi  Lynparza and Tagrisso 
AstraZeneca s shares were down 5  in pre market trading on Friday probably as investors found the deal costly  Nonetheless  AstraZeneca s stock has rallied 13 1  this year so far  outperforming the rise of 4 4

198303,419819,JNJ,3 Reasons Why Johnson   Johnson  JNJ  Is A Great Growth Stock,opinion,"Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above average financial growth  as this feature helps these securities garner the market s attention and deliver solid returns  But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task 
In addition to volatility  these stocks carry above average risk by their very nature  Also  one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end 
However  it s pretty easy to find cutting edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects 
Our proprietary system currently recommends Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  as one such stock  This company not only has a favorable Growth Score  but also carries a top Zacks Rank 
Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market  And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   returns are even better 
Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this world s biggest maker of health care products a great growth pick right now 
Earnings Growth
Earnings growth is arguably the most important factor  as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors  For growth investors  double digit earnings growth is highly preferable  as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Johnson   Johnson is 7 8   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 4 9  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 1 6  
Cash Flow Growth
While cash is the lifeblood of any business  higher than average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for Johnson   Johnson is 13 9   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 10 2  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 7 9  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 3 3  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Superiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is of course favorable here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
There have been upward revisions in current year earnings estimates for Johnson   Johnson  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0 1  over the past month 
Bottom Line
While the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Johnson   Johnson a Zacks Rank  2 stock  it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above

198304,419820,JNJ,This Is Why Johnson   Johnson  JNJ  Is A Great Dividend Stock,opinion,"All investors love getting big returns from their portfolio  whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  But for income investors  generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus 
Cash flow can come from bond interest  interest from other types of investments  and of course  dividends  A dividend is the distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  it s often viewed by its dividend yield  a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long term returns  and in many cases  dividend contributions surpass one third of total returns 
Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  in Focus
Headquartered in New Brunswick  Johnson   Johnson  JNJ  is a Medical stock that has seen a price change of 7 48  so far this year  The world s biggest maker of health care products is paying out a dividend of  0 9 per share at the moment  with a dividend yield of 2 6  compared to the Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry s yield of 2 7  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 98  
Taking a look at the company s dividend growth  its current annualized dividend of  3 60 is up 1 7  from last year  In the past five year period  Johnson   Johnson has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 6 40   Looking ahead  future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Right now  Johnson   Johnson s payout ratio is 44   which means it paid out 44  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Looking at this fiscal year  JNJ expects solid earnings growth  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  8 58 per share  which represents a year over year growth rate of 4 89  
Bottom Line
From greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages  investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  It s important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout 
For instance  it s a rare occurrence when a tech start up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend  It s more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends  Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  With that in mind  JNJ presents a compelling investment opportunity  it s not only an attractive dividend play  but the stock also boasts a strong Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  ",2019-03-27,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/this-is-why-johnson--johnson-jnj-is-a-great-dividend-stock-200401876,200401876

the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 98 cents  The bottom line also decreased 24 2  year over year Net sales declined 6 9  year over year to  1 2 billion but outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 18 billion  The year over year decline was mainly due to lower sales volume in the Prescription segment  Sales of  51 million from new products were partially offset by a loss of  16 million in sales of from discontinued products Shares of Perrigo were down 4 6  in pre market trading on Feb 28  possibly due to lowered earnings and revenue guidance for 2018  Also  the stock has declined 40 8  in a

CHCA net sales in the fourth quarter of 2018 came in at  617 million  down 4 1  year over year  Strong performance of smoking cessation and analgesics was more than offset by lower net sales in the animal health business and nutrition categories  The new product sales of  10 million were completely offset by the lost sales from discontinued products  Excluding animal health category  sales decreased 1 9  organically CHCI  CHCI segment reported net sales of  356 million  down 4 9  from the year ago period  On a constant currency basis  the metric decreased 0 5   Excluding the sales of  2 million from the exited Russian and unprofitable distribution businesses in 2017 and unfavorable foreign currency movements of  10 million  net sales remained almost flat   Net sales of diagnostics and analgesics categories and new product sales of  10 million were mostly offset by lower sales in lifestyle and cough cold category  The company lost sales of  2 million from discontinued products RX   This segment s net sales declined 14 9  to  222 million on a reported basis as well as on a constant currency basis  The downside can be attributed to several industry based factors including pricing pressure and supply constraints for few products While new product sales of  22 million contributed to the top line  the company lost sales of  4 million from discontinued products 2018 ResultsPerrigo recorded full year sales of  4 7 billion  down 4 3  on a year over year basis  The reported figure included new product sales of  170 million  partially offset by discontinued products of  66 million  Currency movements resulted in a loss of  34 million in sales  The company s adjusted loss for the period was  4 55 per share  lower than the year ago loss of  4 93 per share The company has announced that it will provide an update on portfolio reconfiguration and cost savings plans among others as well as its guidance for 2019 at the Investor Day presentation to be held on May 9  2019 Our TakePerrigo s revenues and margins have been under pressure in 2018 mainly due to the challenges faced by its Rx segment  This is likely to continue in 2019  However  the company s plan to divest the Rx segment will help it to better capitalize on differentiated generic pharmaceutical products and focus on expanding its leading consumer business  Perrigo also expects sales to

at  1 97 per share  which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 95 and increased 13 2  from the year ago period driven by higher revenues and lower tax rate Adjusted earnings excluded after tax

perform well  Core products like Stelara and Invega Sustenna also contributed to growth  However  sales of some other key drugs like Simponi Simponi Aria and Xarelto declined in the quarter  Sales of Zytiga slowed down significantly from the previous quarter due to the impact of generic competition in the United States Imbruvica sales rose 34 7  to  703 million in the quarter driven by market share gains and strong market growth across multiple indications in the United States and strong uptake in the European and Asia Pacific markets Darzalex sales rose 57 4  to  584 million in the

sales declined 14 4  in the quarter to  608 million as prescription growth was offset by increased discounts and rebates  The October FDA approval of Xarelto for a new 2 5 milligram vascular dose for

call that the initial customer response has been positive Sales of Remicade were down 15 6  in the quarter to  1 24 billion due to increased discounts and share loss to biosimilars   While U S  sales

operational constant currency growth rate between 5 7  and 7 6  Revenues are expected in the range of  80 4 to  81 2 billion  including currency impact  Currency fluctuations are expected to unfavorably impact sales by approximately 1 5  with Fix headwinds being more pronounced in the first half Operational constant currency sales growth is expected to be in the range of 0  to 1   Acquisitions and divestitures are expected to hurt sales growth by about 2  Adjusted operational sales growth   excluding FX  acquisitions divestitures  is expected to be in the range of 2  to 3   which marks a deceleration from 5 5  in 2018 In 2019  J J expects that the Pharmaceutical unit will deliver growth despite significant impacts from biosimilar and generic competition for some of its drugs In Pharmaceuticals  management is optimistic that key drugs like Darzalex  Imbruvica and Stelara should witness continued uptake and line extensions and new drugs like Erleada and Tremfya should perform well  However  continued biosimilar competition for Remicade and Procrit and generic competition for Velcade  Tracleer and Zytiga in the U S  will hurt revenues by  3 billion in 2019  Other than that  pricing pressure will continue to hurt sales While the Consumer unit will grow slightly above the market in 2019 supported by innovation and improved go to market models  the Medical Devices segment is expected to continue to improve driven by improved execution and new product introductions Adjusted pre tax operating margin is expected to improve slightly in 2019 Adjusted tax

approximately 1  on an operational basis in 2019  Currency headwinds are expected to hurt 2019 revenues by less than 1  In 2019  AbbVie expects roughly  2 billion of erosion related to international biosimilar competition to Humira  In addition  it expects a  400 million headwind from generic competition to AndroGel in 2019  Also  costs to support expected launches of five new products and line extensions should put pressure on margins  However  these new products will be at early stages of their launch trajectory in 2019 and will not be a significant offset to international biosimilar impact  However  AbbVie believes the products will grow over the next few years and provide significant offset to the 2023 U S  biosimilar event In 2019  AbbVie believes that the loss of international Humira revenues will be made up for by U S  Humira and hematological oncology franchise growth Adjusted gross margin is expected to be above 82 5  of sales in 2019  While  R D is expected to be

198363,419879,JNJ,Is A Beat In Store For AbbVie  ABBV  This Earnings Season ,opinion,"We expect AbbVie Inc    NYSE ABBV   to beat expectations when it reports fourth quarter 2018 results on Jan 25  before market open  In the last reported quarter  the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 6 47  Shares of AbbVie have declined 0 8  in the past six months against the  s increase of 5 8  Notably  AbbVie s earnings history is quite impressive with the pharmaceuticals company outpacing estimates in all the last four quarters with the average beat being 3 54  Let s see how things are shaping up for the company this quarter Factors to ConsiderAbbVie expects earnings per share for the quarter to be in the range of  1 89 and  1 91  Revenues are expected to be driven by operational growth of 7   However  currency movement is likely to have an unfavorable impact of less than 1   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings and revenue stands at  1 91 per share and  8 38 billion  respectively AbbVie s flagship product  Humira  which is approved for several inflammatory indications  has witnessed strong demand trends despite the launch of drugs with new mechanisms of action and competition from indirect biosimilars  U S  sales were above expectation in the third quarter and in the soon to be reported quarter a similar performance is likely  However  international sales are likely to have an unfavorable impact as several biosimilar versions of the drug were launched in Europe in October  U S  Humira sales are expected to be  13 7 billion in 2018 while the company reduced its guidance for international sales from  6 4 billion to  6 3 billion  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter Humira sales is pegged at  5 billion The company also has a strong oncology portfolio  New drug Imbruvica has shown impressive adoption in the approved indications  especially front line chronic lymphocytic leukemia  AbbVie continues to develop the drug in several indications  There were several positive data readouts during the quarter  Earlier this week  the company s partner  Johnson   Johnson   NYSE JNJ   reported earnings  Sales of Imbruvica confirm the growth trend in the fourth quarter Label expansion of Imbruvica in combination with Roche Biogen s Rituxan for treating Waldenstr m s macroglobulinemia in August is likely to boost sales this quarter  In 2018  the company expects Imbruvica global revenues to exceed  3 5 billion with sales in the United States likely to cross  2 9 billion  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the drug is pegged at  967 million in the soon to be reported quarter Other drugs  namely Duodopa and Creon  are also likely to continue their year to date strong performance in the soon to be reported quarter  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Duodopa and Creon sales is  113 million and  246 million  respectively Sales of another leukemia drug  Venclexta  is also growing rapidly on the back of label expansion in second line plus setting for CLL patients and doubled year over year in the third quarter  In September  the drug s label was expanded to include CLL patients with minimal residual disease  broadening the eligible patient population in the fourth quarter  However  impact on sales remains to be seen In November  the drug received approval for newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukaemia  AML  patients aged 75 years or older or those ineligible for intensive induction chemotherapy in the United States  In October  the drug was approved in combination with Roche s Rituxan for treating CLL in second or later line setting in Europe AbbVie s hepatitis C virus   HCV   segment also showed impressive growth on the back of better than expected uptake of Mavyret despite stiff competition  Mavyret has become a major growth driver for AbbVie within a short time of its launch and commanded roughly 50  market share globally at the end of the third quarter  We expect the positive trend to continue this quarter  However  Viekira may continue to see declining sales  affected by intense pricing and competitive pressure in the HCV market  Full year HCV global sales are estimated to be  3 5 billion  up nearly 2 7 times from 2017 The company may continue to see higher operating expense due to ongoing clinical studies and launch of new drugs and label expansions Why a Likely Positive Surprise Our proven model indicates that AbbVie is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen Earnings ESP  Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate Estimate   1 97  and the Zacks Consensus Estimate   1 91   stands at  2 65   You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Zacks Rank  AbbVie has a Zacks Rank  3  The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank makes us reasonably confident

198365,419881,JNJ,On Trade And Growth Concerns Safe Haven Assets Rally,opinion,"Risk aversion has been the dominating direction this week  It first started with China s GDP growing at slowest pace since 1990  then we saw cuts to the global outlook by the IMF  followed by concerns from Chinese President Xi over a  black swan  or  gray rhino  event  today earnings mostly missed and lastly the U S  reportedly turned down latest Chinese offer  that story was later refuted  but doubts still grew that a deal could be reached by the March 1st deadline 
Japanese Yen
The Japanese yen has rallied against most of its major trading partners as markets can t seem to shrug off global growth concerns and the resumption of tough trade talk from the U S  The news that the Trump administration scrapped this week s preparatory trade talks with two Chinese vice ministers was later refuted by White House Adviser Larry Kudlow  Even though the story was refuted  it should be expected to start to see the U S  show a tougher stance as we near the trade truce deadline  Throughout the stages of negotiations of trade talks  the U S  consistently provides dissatisfaction once we get closer to pivotal deadlines to enhance their negotiation stance  The issue of forced technology transfers and structural reforms to the Chinese economy are unlikely to see major progress by the March 
British Pound
The British pound  rallied against all of its major trading partners as expectations are still high that we will not see a no deal Brexit and that today s wage data raised expectations for the BOE to deliver a hike by the fall  Today s wage data rose to the highest pace since 2008 and it could help deliver higher inflation  Current expectations are that we could see a 65  chance the BOE raise rates at the November meeting  earlier in the month the markets were pricing a rate hike at the first meeting in 2020  a day before Governor Carney s term ends 

Stocks
U S  stocks returned from a 3 day weekend and delivered the worst drop in three weeks as trade tensions ramp up and earning season continues to deliver softer outlooks  The trade war escalation could continue to weigh on technology  energy and multinational businesses  Earlier this morning  poor outlooks and guidance from Haliburton and Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  kept the narrative negative 

Commodities
Commodities got crushed across the board  except for gold  The story behind the broad based selling is an easy one  falling demand  China growth falling to a near three decade low  the IMF slashing global growth forecasts and many large early reporters this earning season have expressed concern with their outlooks  U S  shale production continues to surge and pushing refiners to the highest pace in 15 years  Record stocks of fuel keep the gasoline glut in focus

198370,419886,JNJ,For Johnson   Johnson  Lawsuits  Not Earnings  Are The Pain Point ,opinion,"Reports Q4 2018 results onTuesday  January 22  before the market open
Revenue Expectation   20 17 billion
EPS Expectation   1 95
Even if Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ   the world s largest maker of both consumer and pharmaceutical health care products  delivers a blowout quarter when they report Tuesday  investors might still not be delighted  A massive beat won t overshadow the biggest worry currently stalking stakeholders  the outcome of litigation brought by nearly 12 000 plaintiffs over the company s baby powder and other talc products  The complainants allege that asbestos in those Johnson   Johnson products caused their ovarian cancer 
The company paid a steep price during 2018 because of these claims  In July  a jury ordered J J to pay  4 69 billion to 22 women who blamed the talc based product for their ovarian cancer  The prospect of similar judgments increased after Reuters published a story last month alleging that the company had known for years that its talcum powder contained  small amounts of asbestos   and had kept that knowledge a secret 

The news abruptly ended an impressive rally in JNJ stock  causing it to plunge from a near record high of almost  149 in December  wiping out  45 billion in the company s market value  Currently trading at  131  JNJ shares have barely recovered since the stumble 
Though the July verdict was appealed  the company lost the motion in mid December  Still  Johnson   Johnson plans to continue seeking a reversal of the motion via additional appeals  Going forward  the question no one can answer at this juncture is how will all this be resolved 
For mega cap consumer companies such as JNJ  reputation is paramount  Without addressing the argument that JNJ says it has strong scientific research backing its case that its talc does not contain asbestos  the problem we see is that the company has a mixed track record in this battle 
Juries in states including Missouri  California and New Jersey have handed down more than  5 billion in total awards to plaintiffs since suits started going to trial in 2016  However  some of those verdicts have been thrown out by judges  J J has appealed or won verdicts in other cases while still others were declared mistrials  To date Johnson   Johnson has only settled in one case 
Estimates put the possible damage to JNJ as a result of these claims at as high as  20 billion  That s a colossal amount  Even if that number were to be cut in half  it means the company will lose its income for the next two quarters  assuming it continues to produce around  4 billion in net quarterly profit 
Bottom Line
We believe Johnson   Johnson will continue to fight these claims  Given the large number of cases involved  the company will find it hard to settle  If the situation persists well into 2019  it will continue to be a major weight on J J s share price 
In our view  now is not the time to call a bottom on JNJ shares despite the company s excellent moat  Even its attractive 2 79  dividend yield and stellar history of raising its payout for 55 years in a row isn t enough to make the stock a buy right now  For investors  the prudent strategy is to stay on the sidelines and monitor how the situation evolves  at least into the summer ",2019-01-21,Haris Anwar/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/for-johnson--johnson-baby-powder-lawsuits-hurt-more-than-earnings-----reports-t-200377460,200377460

  Factors to ConsiderJ J s sales growth has accelerated in the past few quarters backed by continued above market growth in the Pharmaceutical segment and improved organic sales growth in the Medical Devices and the Consumer segments  In fact  J J raised its full year organic sales growth expectations thrice in 2018 J J s strong performance in pharmaceuticals segment is being led by its oncology portfolio  a trend expected to remain unchanged in the fourth quarter  Core products like Imbruvica  Darzalex Stelara  Zytiga  Simponi Simponi Aria and Invega Sustenna should contribute to growth  Though sales of another key drug  Xarelto declined in the third quarter  the situation is expected to improve in this time around  A new 2 5 milligram vascular dose of Xarelto for the CAD PAD indication was approved by the FDA in October 2018  which significantly expanded the drug s eligible patient population  This is expected to drive sales of the drug in the fourth quarter and in 2019 In the pulmonary arterial hypertension  PAH  category  strong demand for Uptravi and Opsumit will be partially offset by an expected decline in Tracleer outside the United States due to generic competition Meanwhile  biosimilar competition is expected persist  hurting key arthritis drug Remicade outside the United States  Please note that J J markets Remicade in partnership with MerckRegarding newly launched Tremfya  J J  on its third quarter call  noted strong demand for the product  The drug captured 5 8  share of the psoriasis market in the United States We expect the drug to generate higher sales in the fourth quarter than the previous quarters On the same call  J J had said that while the Consumer and Medical Device businesses should continue to improve in the fourth quarter  the Pharmaceuticals segment might see slower growth  The Pharmaceuticals segment is likely to face difficult comparisons in fourth quarter  which coupled with expected biosimilar and generic competition to Tracleer and Procrit in late 2018  may put pressure on the segment s growth  Though the generic version of Tracleer was not launched in 2018  a biosimilar of Procrit was launched by Pfizer   NYSE PFE   in November The Zacks Consensus Estimate for J J s Pharmaceuticals  Consumer and Medical Device segments is  9 87 billion   3 57 billion and  6 72 billion  respectively Higher R D

198379,419895,JNJ,J J Snack Foods  JJSF  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"J J  NYSE JNJ  Snack Foods  JJSF  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 28  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This drink and snack maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 87 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  11 5  
Revenues are expected to be  270 45 million  up 2  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for J J Snack Foods 
For J J Snack Foods  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that J J Snack Foods will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that J J Snack Foods would post earnings of  1 32 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 22  delivering a surprise of  7 58  
The company has not been able to beat consensus EPS estimates in any of the last four quarters 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
J J Snack Foods doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-20,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/jj-snack-foods-jjsf-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200377674,200377674

The phase III RESOLVE study investigated the efficacy of Imbruvica in combination with chemotherapy agents nab paclitaxel and gemcitabine compared with placebo in combination with these chemotherapy agents for first line treatment of patients suffering metastatic pancreatic cancer  The study did not show a statistically significant PFS or OS benefit in the Imbruvica combo arm as compared to the placebo one 
Complete data from the study will be submitted for presentation at a future medical conference 
Shares of AbbVie have declined 16  in the past year  wider than the  dip of 0 8  

 
Notably  Imbruvica has been jointly developed and marketed by AbbVie and Janssen Biotech  a unit of Johnson   Johnson   NYSE JNJ   
Currently approved for nine cancer indications  Imbruvica has multi billion dollar potential and AbbVie is exploring the potential to expand Imbruvica s label into solid tumors and autoimmune diseases 
In the first nine months of 2018  Imbruvica generated sales of  2 58 billion  reflecting a surge of 38 7  year over year  AbbVie expects Imbruvica s peak sales to be more than  7 billion and revenues of about  5 billion in 2020  However  study failure like that of RESOLVE will cause a hindrance to AbbVie J J s expansion plans for Imbruvica 
Another important cancer drug in AbbVie s oncology portfolio is Venclexta  Regulatory applications seeking an approval for Venclexta plus Roche s   OTC RHHBY   Rituxan for relapse refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia  based on MURANO study data  were lent with a nod in the United States  last June and in the EU  last October  Visibly  label expansion for this indication has increased the patient population for Venclexta significantly  which will further boost its commercial potential 
Also  last November  AbbVie gained an FDA approval for Venclexta for first line acute myeloid leukemia  AML  while outcomes from the phase III program on multiple myeloma are awaited in the first half of 2019  AbbVie Roche also plans to soon file for approving Venclexta  Gazyva in first line CLL setting

Investors will be hoping for strength from JNJ as it approaches its next earnings release  which is expected to be January 22  2019  On that day  JNJ is projected to report earnings of  1 95 per share  which would represent year over year growth of 12 07   Meanwhile  our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of  20 11 billion  down 0 42  from the prior year quarter 
Any recent changes to analyst estimates for JNJ should also be noted by investors  These revisions help to show the ever changing nature of near term business trends  As a result  we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company s business outlook 
Based on our research  we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near team stock moves  To benefit from this  we have developed the Zacks Rank  a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system

198390,419906,JNJ,Johnson   Johnson  JNJ  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"The market expects Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 22  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This world s biggest maker of health care products is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 95 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  12 1  
Revenues are expected to be  20 11 billion  down 0 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 96  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Johnson   Johnson 
For Johnson   Johnson  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Johnson   Johnson will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Johnson   Johnson would post earnings of  2 03 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 05  delivering a surprise of  0 99  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Johnson   Johnson doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-14,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/johnson--johnson-jnj-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200375742,200375742

198403,419919,JNJ,4 Worst ETF Areas Of Q4,opinion,"The fourth quarter of 2018 was horrible for Wall Street with the key indexes losing in double digits  A flattening yield curve causing recessionary fears in the United States led to this massacre  And why not  The return of global growth concerns pulled down long term treasury yields meaningfully while a hawkish Fed kept pushing short term rates higher 
While six out of the 11 sectors in the S P 500 have so far undergone double digit losses  per an article published on Wall Street Journal  below we highlight a few key ETF areas that have lost around 30  so far in the quarter  as of Dec 19  2018  
Energy
Concerns over rising output amid softer than expected U S  sanctions on Iran and falling demand from global growth worries have weighed on oil prices in the fourth quarter United States Oil  NYSE USO   haslost about 35 in the quarter  Even the fresh output cut decided by the OPEC and Russia in early December for the first six months of 2019 could not save the liquid commodity  read    
SPDR S P Oil   Gas Equipment   Services  NYSE XES  ETF   down 45 2    Invesco S P SmallCap Energy ETF  NYSE XLE    down 44 4    VanEck Vectors Oil Services ETF   CA OIH    down 41 4   and Invesco Dynamic Oil   Gas Services ETF  are of the worst performing energy ETFs of the fourth quarter 
Marijuana
Marijuana stocks and ETF were hot trades in 2018 due to growing efforts for legalization  both for medical and recreational usages  it saw a volatile phase in November on bubble fears and some downbeat earnings releases  ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF   SNX MJ   is down 35 5  so far this year  as of Dec 19  2018   read   
Some industry experts are of the view that overvaluation is a threat to the space  It does have bright long term prospects  But things will probably shore up slower than anticipated  Probably this is why despite going through the roof in mid September  the fund succumbed to a steep slowdown in December  read    
Biotech
This fund follows an index  which is equal weighted and is designed to measure the equity market performance of the common stock of U S  exchange listed biotechnology companies with a primary product offering that is in a phase 1  phase 2 or phase 3 clinical trial stage of development 
Being a high beta and high growth sector  biotech has been beaten down badly on a broad market rout  Some sector specific news also played foul  The world s biggest maker of health care products Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  had a tumultuous ride in December on reports that its baby powder contained cancer causing asbestos 
Also  a federal judge in Texas ruled that President Barack Obama s signature health law   the Affordable Care Act  ACA  or Obamacare   is unconstitutional in December  Virtus LifeSci Biotech Clinical Trials ETF   MZ BBC   is off 33 2  this quarter  read    
Tech   Media
It is one of the prominent spaces which saw huge selloffs in 2018  Investors should note that tech stocks  particularly FAANGs  were once investors  darling this year  However  things took a turn  causing a steep slump in Wall Street  in the October November period  Rising rate worries  overvaluation and U S  China trade tensions led to the upheaval  read    
Per   technology and Internet based companies normally see high profit margins  In a rising rate environment  the profitability of such companies will be compromised as they will end up paying higher interests on borrowed money  As a result  AdvisorShares New Tech and Media ETF   BR FNG   is down 30 3  in the fourth quarter

198413,419929,JNJ,Sector ETF Week In Review For December 10 14,opinion,"Summary
Once again  the sector orientation is defensive on a 1 week  1 month  and 3 month basis
Defensive sectors are outperforming SPY  NYSE SPY 
Don t forget about other asset classes like bonds
Let s start where we always do   the weekly performance table 
It should surprise no one that most sectors were lower last week  Financials led the way  followed by energy and real estate  Two defensive sectors   utilities and consumer staples   held the first and third spot  respectively  While most of XLV s  NYSE XLV  largest members were down  JNJ  NYSE JNJ  disproportionately impacted the sector  which explains why this traditionally defensive sector was the fourth worst performer this week 
Next up  let s look at the performance of the sectors over the last month 

Four conservative sectors are at the top of the list  Utilities were up 4 26   Real estate was up marginally  The other two defensive sectors were modestly lower  At the bottom of the list are financials  industrials  and energy 
Finally  we have the three month performance table 

Again  we have a defensive orientation  Utilities were the only real gainer  rising 5 65  Staples were up fractionally  Real estate was off modestly  healthcare was down  again  remember the JNJ effect   Thanks to weak oil prices  energy is off the most  Industrials and financials rounded out the worst performers 
The relative performance continues to favor defensive sectors 

The defensive sectors continue to outperform SPY  While financials and basic materials are  improving   neither sector is poised for solid runs right now 

After selling off with the broader market this fall  the basic materials sector is now near a 52 week low  All the EMAs are moving lower with the shorter below the longer  Prices are below all the EMAs  which will keep pulling the averages down  Momentum is negative 

Financials are near a 52 week low  Like XLB  NYSE XLB   the chart technicals are bearish  shorter EMAs are below the longer with prices poised to pull them lower  broadening Bollinger Bands  signal higher volatility  and momentum is weak and moving lower 
So  the two industries that might show potential are only  improving  because they re doing less badly than SPY  But the daily charts of both sectors are very bearish 
But looking at the 6 month charts of all the sectors  we see a near universal bearishness 
Real estate  top row  far left  is in the top third of its chart and is in the middle of a 2 month rally  It s benefitting from high yields and a belief that we re nearing the end of the Fed s tightening cycle 
Basic materials  top row  second from left   see above for technical analysis   Fundamentally  this industry relies on international trade  which means increasing trade tensions are a key factor hurting the industry  In addition  a slowing global trade environment is also a net negative 
Energy  top row  second from right   Oil is now in a bear market  Adding to the problems  the IEA recently noted that global growth  and therefore oil demand  will be weaker in 2019  further hampering the industry 
Financials  top row  far right   a flattening yield curve is hurting the industry  In addition  weaker growth decreases loan demand 
Industrials  middle row  far left   This industry is comprised of large  multi national companies that rely on international trade and global growth  meaning they re on the negative receiving end of the global trade war 
Technology  middle row  second from left   The FAANG stocks   which drove this sector higher for the majority of this expansion   are now correcting for various reasons  The global trade war issues are also hurting as is the possibility of increased regulation 
Consumer staples  middle row  second from right   a defensive sector that is currently consolidating gains 
Utilities  middle row  right   a defensive sector that is currently in an upward sloping rally 
Healthcare  bottom left   Healthcare is comprised of truly conservative companies  drug companies   wholesalers  and financial companies  health insurers   The more conservative companies are doing well  the others are mixed 
Consumer discretionary  bottom right   assuming we re at the end of the expansion  we can expect consumers to start pulling back from spending 
So what s an investor to do in this environment  First  getting defensive is entirely appropriate  Stick with healthcare  utilities  and consumer staples  Also  don t forget other assets classes  At the end of an economic cycle  bonds typically outperform stocks  which we re seeing right now 
IEF  NASDAQ IEF  the 7 10 year Treasury  is leading SPY  Finally  don t forget cash  Remember that shorter dated bonds are now providing modestly decent yields  relatively speaking

198414,419930,JNJ,Technically Speaking For December 17,opinion,"Summary
The high yield market s problems are continuing
Retail stocks are selling off
At a time when the bulls could really use some good news  they didn t get any
According to the Financial Times  the high yield market is  drying up  
Investment banks are having a difficult time finding buyers for leveraged loans  leading to the postponement of a number of deals until after the first of the year  Yields in the high yield market continue to move higher 

The CCC market rose over 200 basis points over the last few months  It looked like the market had crested in mid November  but rates continued to climb in early December  Overall  rates are now at their highest level since the oil price caused blow out of 2015 2016 

This is a standard  end of the economic cycle development 
Despite a positive retail sales report on Friday  the market is selling retail stocks  
The Consumer Discretionary  NYSE RXI  is trading near a 52 week low  Other retail stocks are also falling  The VanEck Vectors Retail ETF  NYSEARCA RTH     the ETF that tracks retail stocks    is in a clear downtrend 

The ETF peaked at 112 23 at the beginning of October  It has been moving consistently lower since printing a continuing series of lower lows and lower highs  Prices are now below all the EMAs  The 10 day EMA has moved below the 200 day EMA  the 20 day will soon follow  Department stores are also falling 

The six major stores are all technically weak  The timing of this sell off    at the height of the holiday shopping season    is particularly telling 
The market s underlying technicals are deteriorating  
Let s start with the percentage of Nasdaq  stocks above their respective 50 and 200 day EMAs 



Both are right above 20     a very low level  We see the same thing for the NYSE 

Both are also in the low 20  range  In other times during this  most hated rally in history   we d be in classic  buy the dip  territory  However  the current bearish state of the market means these are very worrying numbers 
Let s check in on today s performance table 

There s a lot of red in that table  The IWM  NYSE IWM  fell the most  it was off 2 3   The QQQ  NASDAQ QQQ  wasn t far behind  neither were the mid caps or the Dow  The long end of the Treasury curve continued to rally  which will send yields lower and further compress the curve 
The industry table wasn t any better 

Everybody was down today    even the defensive sectors  utilities were the second worst performer  staples were the fourth worst  Healthcare    which has the Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  handicap    actually performed modestly well  only dropping slightly more than 2  
Before looking at the charts  let s remember where we left off last week  A lot of indexes are at or near 52 week lows  All the charts have a number of bearish indicators such as declining EMAs  shorter EMAs below longer EMAs  and negative momentum  This is also the Fed week  it would not be unheard of for the markets to tread water until the Fed announcement Wednesday afternoon 
However  most of the charts continue to contain a number of very bearish indicators

The markets opened lower  They tried to rally in the morning  twice attempting to move through last week s closing price  After forming a double top  prices moved lower for the remainder of the session  printing a series of lower lows and lower highs 
The bearishness continues on the 5 day chart 

Prices are in a solid and continual three day downtrend 
The 30 day chart is also bearish 

Prices have moved through the last technical support level and are now near a 30 day low 
And  yes  the daily chart is also bearish 
Prices have broken the lower support line of the sideways consolidation pattern 
The next logical technical support level is the 52 week low  And that s never a good place to be

198419,419935,JNJ,Nestle plan hailed as only the start of Schneider s shake up,news,"By Silke Koltrowitz and Maiya Keidan ZURICH LONDON  Reuters    Nestle s  S NESN  plan to shore up its capital structure  announced only days after being thrust into the spotlight by activist shareholder Third Point  was received by investors as a precursor to bigger changes under the company s new leadership  Shares in the world s largest foodmaker rose as much as 2 percent on Wednesday  close to the record high touched on Monday after the New York based hedge fund disclosed a  3 5 billion stake and urged Nestle to buy back shares  set a target for margin growth and shed non core assets including its stake in L Oreal  PA OREP   Investors did not have to wait long for a response  with Nestle announcing late on Tuesday that it would launch a 20 billion Swiss franc   20 8 billion  share buyback program while leaving room for near term acquisitions  Nestle also said it would continue adjusting its portfolio and assess opportunities to boost profit margins  stopping short of setting a firm target  It added that the measures were the result of a review instigated at the start of the year after Mark Schneider took over as chief executive   The moves were welcomed by stakeholders large and small   This is a new era for Nestle and I m extremely positive on the prospects for internal and external growth   said Carine Menache  who runs a Monaco investment firm that owns Nestle shares  She and UBS analysts said the buyback should lift earnings by 6 percent  while increased merger and acquisition  M A  activity could provide a further boost    Nestle may have a poor track record for M A  but the new CEO  Schneider  is now in charge and he has a great track record   she added   Reaching a 19 percent operating margin  the midpoint of Third Point s recommendation  would lift earnings by another 8 percent  according to UBS  which said Nestle shares now offered the greatest opportunity for growth of all the European packaged goods companies it covers  bolstering its  buy  rating  Of Nestle s plan  which they described as  responsive but not reactionary  to Third Point  UBS said   We think this sends a strong message to the markets   expect more to come    SECTOR CONVULSIONS The global packaged food sector is convulsing as its main players struggle with slowing growth  changing consumer habits and the growing influence of global investment firm 3G Capital  3G s Kraft Heinz  O KHC  launched a surprise  143 billion takeover bid for  Unilever   L ULVR  in February  sparking a deep review and new agenda at the target company  Many of the demands laid out in Third Point s letter echo the steps Unilever took in the wake of the Kraft bid   Investors said the biggest omission from Nestle s response was any reference to its 25 billion euro   28 4 billion  stake in L Oreal  which dates back to 1974  when the French heiress Liliane Bettencourt sold a large part of her holding to Nestle  That omission and lack of a margin target means the announcement may not completely satisfy Third Point  which is controlled by billionaire investor Daniel Loeb  Third Point has declined to comment on the announcement at this stage and Nestle is expected to say more at its investor day in September   It s only a start   said Mirabaud Asset Management s Nicolas Burki   It will not be enough   Nestle has long touted the L Oreal stake as value creating  and a source familiar with the company s thinking said there was no change to that view   The big question  however is what Nestle would do with the cash  besides buybacks  if it sold down the L Oreal stake  The company did say its capital spending would be focused on higher growth categories of coffee  pet food  baby food and water  It added consumer health to the list of priorities  potentially making it a competitor to the likes of Johnson   Johnson  N JNJ  and GlaxoSmithKline  L GSK   However  EFG Asset Management s Urs Beck cashed out of his Nestle position on Monday s price spike and is skeptical that it can find acquisitions big enough to move the needle for a company with  93 billion in sales   The ship is just too big to be steered into different waters through portfolio management   he said  VICTORY ON BOTH SIDES  Nestle is Europe s most valuable company  with a market value of  263 billion last week  before Loeb s position was made public  adding  10 billion in one day  The positive reaction most likely reflects the bullishness of long term investors rather than event driven hedge funds looking for quick turnarounds  says Michael Wegener at Case Equity Partners in Hong Kong   Wegener said he doubts that many arbitrageurs have moved into Nestle s stock yet  since the Loeb stake remains too soft a catalyst at this stage   But one London based manager of an event driven hedge fund with no involvement with Nestle described the situation as a victory for both sides    I suspect  Third Point s  presence actually helps Schneider with his change agenda   said the manager  who asked not to be named   I suspect the buyback is not enough  but Third Point is unlikely to feel the need to get shouty    Swiss activist shareholder Rudolf Bohli said that Loeb  known for campaigns against Yahoo  NASDAQ AABA   Sony Corp  T 6758  and the Dow DuPont merger  is on the right track   
 Loeb has set the right tone and his agenda is correct   said Bohli  who recently exited GAM Holding with a profit after failing to replace the financial company s chief executive ",2017-06-28,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/nestle-plan-hailed-as-only-the-start-of-schneider's-shake-up-500218,500218

198423,419939,JNJ,The Market Turns Risk Off After Disappointing Overseas Data,opinion," Friday Market Close  Weaker economic data from China were a mirror image to strong numbers from the United States  and as investors on Friday reflected on the two sets of figures it seems they focused more on the negative than the positive 
The losses on all three major U S  indices were around 2  after retail sales data from China showed slower than expected growth and the weakest reading in five years  Numbers also showed industrial output there grew the slowest in three years  a potential sign of the effects of the ongoing trade war with the United States  Meanwhile  private sector business activity in Europe also fell  news that came just one day after the European Central Bank sliced its growth and inflation forecasts  European and Asian shares fell across the board 
The data from China contrasted with retail sales and industrial figures from the United States  where November U S  retail sales growth of 0 2  that matched Wall Street analysts  expectations and U S  industrial production in November increased by 0 6   ahead of the 0 3  forecast in a Briefing com consensus 
That wasn t enough to outweigh the concerns about economic growth abroad  Perhaps that s because the overseas data come amid a backdrop of continued worry about global economic growth prospects as the trade war between the United States and China drags on 
JNJ Weighs on Healthcare Sector
Corporate news also weighed on the market  with Dow Jones Industrial Average   DJI  component Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  dropping more than 10  after a Reuters report said the company s Baby Powder product was sometimes tainted with carcinogenic asbestos and the company kept the information from regulators and the public  JNJ issued a statement saying the Reuters article is  one sided  false and inflammatory  
JNJ helped weigh on the S P 500  SPX  healthcare sector  which was the worst performer of the day  but other healthcare names were also markedly lower  Some of the other selling could be coming as traders look toward  quadruple witching hour  next Friday  which refers to the last hour of the trading day when market index futures and options expire along with stock options and stock futures  This can result in volatility as traders unwind positions 
The strength in the dollar might have been one sign that investors were flocking to perceived  safe haven  assets  though no investment is truly safe  Market participants were also buying up U S  government debt  pushing yields lower  Wall Street s main fear gauge  the Cboe Volatility Index  VIX  jumped after days of being on the decline 
Lots of Data Scheduled
Friday s ugly trading appeared to be data driven  and investors can expect the closely watched economic numbers to keep coming in the next few days  As the numbers come in  it could be interesting to see if investors continue to buy more bonds next week and continue exiting riskier positions 
Arguably the biggest bit of economic news would be the Fed s interest rate decision  expected Wednesday  Based on the futures market  most investors seem to be expecting the central bank to raise its key rate by another 25 basis points  but the odds have dropped  and it appears that there is a not insubstantial segment of the market thinking that monetary policy makers may stand pat on rates next week 
That could be because commentary from Fed officials in recent days has become seemingly more dovish  And the picture for rate moves into next year becomes more murky  Still  the futures market projects around a 75  chance of a hike next week  which would be the fourth this year 
Even with a Fed rate hike perhaps already baked into the proverbial cake  investors are still likely to comb through Fed comments accompanying the announcement to try to glean any fresh tidbits about where policymakers think the economy and inflation could be headed 
They ll get another clue about inflation later in the week when the government reports November personal consumption expenditure  PCE  data  According to the Fed  core PCE numbers are the central bank s preferred inflation gauge  A similar number  the core consumer price index  showed prices rose an as expected 0 2  in November even while headline consumer prices were flat month over month 
One economic uncertainty that s been percolating  perhaps a bit under the radar  is the state of the U S  housing market and its effect on the broader economy  Recent numbers have been mixed  but overall it seems that higher mortgage rates have been eating into home affordability even as input prices for steel and lumber also rise 
So investors may want to pay attention to reports on November building permits and housing starts on Tuesday and existing home sales for last month on Thursday 
Investors are also scheduled to see the government s third estimate for Q3 gross domestic product  arguably the mother of all economic reports because it includes the total value of the goods and services produced in the country 
Meanwhile  a fresh reading Friday from the Atlanta Fed s GDPNow model estimated that Q4 GDP would come in at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3   The estimate rose from 2 4  on Dec  7 after the U S  retail sales report helped boost Q4 PCE growth expectations along with a stronger than expected showing for U S  industrial production in November 
Other notable economic reports in coming days include November data on leading indicators  durable goods orders  and personal income and spending  As with the other report  a stronger than expected data point  while good for the economy  can spark worries on Wall Street that the Fed might tighten rates too quickly and put an artificial damper on economic and corporate growth  Weaker than forecast readings can boost the market  while as expected figures can be non events 

Figure 1  Health Stocks Take A Powder  The health sector  which had been  well  pretty healthy lately  took a dive Friday along with the S P 500 Index  purple line   hurt in part by shares of key component Johnson   Johnson  JNJ   which dived after a negative media report  Data Source  S P Dow Jones Indices  Chart source  The thinkorswim  platform from TD Ameritrade  For illustrative purposes only  Past performance does not guarantee future results 
Not an Immaterial Selloff in 2018   When looking at the various stock sectors  a few of them tend to grab a lot of the headlines  especially in 2018  Info tech  for example  has been the belle of the ball over the last few years  but lately has been dancing to a dismal tune  Crude oil s massive downturn has dragged energy shares down over 12  on the year  Financials  also down over 12  have been worth watching as a bellwether to not only the overall business climate  but also as sort of a proxy for the future of interest rates  But when you look at 2018 sector performance  it s Materials that has led the charge lower down about 15  on the year 
It seems the sector has been dragged down by some of the same fundamentals pressuring energy and financials  namely concerns of a global economic slowdown  But pressure at a few individual names have certainly added fuel to the flame  DowDuPont  DWDP   which at 19  has the highest weighting in the S P 500 materials sector index  has been the target of a number of analyst downgrades as it continues its plan to split into 3 companies  and likely loses its standing as a Dow component   according to media reports  Shares are down over 20  on the year  Other big names down over 20  include International Paper  IP   Vulcan Materials  VMC  and  the biggest laggard of all  mining giant Freeport McMoran  FCX   down over 40  since the start of the year 
Cheap for A Reason  There s a quote attributed to Thomas Jefferson that says   Never buy what you do not want  because it is cheap  it will be dear to you   He could have been talking about European equities  According to research firm CFRA  European stocks are cheaper when compared to historical averages  But just because something is cheap doesn t mean it s a good deal  In this column  we ve often touched on problems facing Europe and weighing on investor s minds  But with much of the geopolitical headlines these days dominated by news of the progress  or lack thereof  on the China U S  trade front  we thought it would be a good time to dig deeper into some of the headwinds that investors in Europe could face 
Various economic indicators have shown signs of slowing growth in Europe  according to the research firm  Even so  the European Central Bank announced recently that it will end its bond buying program  And  although it may be easy to forget with all the tariff issues surrounding the U S  and China  the United States still has tariffs on steel and aluminum from the European Union  Meanwhile  France is facing violent protests  and Italy s budget remains an overhang  Even as Britain is enmeshed in trying to work out a negotiated exit from the European Union  Spain continues to face separatist pressure from people who want Catalonia to secede  While it may be tempting to chase what seems like a bargain  caution is always in order   All told  a significant amount of uncertainty remains in Europe   CFRA said   Even though valuation is attractive with the S P Euro 350 trading at 6  discount to its long term average price to  earnings ratio  CFRA remains on the sideline

198437,419953,JNJ,Key Pharma Players With HIV Focus Ahead Of World Aids Day ,opinion,"Acquired Immuno Deficiency Syndrome  popularly known as AIDS  is a pandemic caused due to the infection of human immunodeficiency virus   HIV    The virus weakens the immune system by destroying cells that fight diseases and infections  eventually leading to AIDS  Medicines for the treatment of HIV are called antiretroviral therapy   ART   that slow or put a check on the progression of the disease  The majority of them work either by blocking enzymes needed by HIV virus to multiply or inhibiting its entry into certain immune cells Like every year  World AIDS Day will be celebrated on Dec 1 in an effort to unite people in the fight against HIV  show support for HIV affected people and in memory of people who have lost their lives to AIDS related illness 
World AIDS Day is one of the eight official global public health campaigns carried out by the World Health Organization   WHO    According to WHO  globally  about 36 7 million people are living with the deadly virus  Per an estimate  the disease has taken more than 35 million lives since it was first identified in 1984 Per a UNAIDS report  more than 9 4 million people are unaware of their HIV infected status  Thus  the theme of the 30th anniversary of this campaign is  Know Your Status  Although there is no cure for the disease yet  there has been significant progress in the field of HIV treatment  which helps to slow disease progression and restrict secondary infections and complications  However  the huge number of HIV affected patients shows that it is a long road ahead before the disease can be eradicated completely  The lack of knowledge of HIV status is a significant roadblock as it prevents timely and accurate treatment Despite improved medical understanding of HIV and significant efforts made by leading government and medical bodies to prevent and treat HIV AIDS  this disease still has limited treatment options  Based on these statistics  it is not surprising that several healthcare companies are investing a significant amount of their R D expenditures on developing treatments and devices for HIV and AIDS  There are more than 40 FDA approved therapies available including 8 new regimens receiving approval this year  Several therapies are under development Stocks to Watch Out For Ahead of World AIDS Day  we present some key pharma companies developing treatments for HIV GlaxoSmithKline   NYSE GSK   has a long standing commitment to HIV and AIDS  The company had developed the widely used antibiotic amoxycillin around 40 years ago  which was the first medicine approved to treat HIV  Though sales of its older HIV products   Epzicom and Selzentry   have been declining due to generic competition  its new products  Triumeq and Tivicay  are among the major drivers of the company s top line  In 2017  it received approval for its first two drug regimen for HIV   Juluca   which is a combination of Johnson   Johnson s   NYSE JNJ   Edurant and Glaxo s Tivicay  It is also showing strong uptake  The company s HIV portfolio generated sales of  4 6 billion in first nine months of 2018  representing year over year growth of 12  at constant exchange rate On its third quarter conference call  the company stated that it expects the HIV franchise to be an important growth driver for its Pharma business going forward  There were some positive developments in its HIV pipeline recently  It has made regulatory filings in the United States and Europe to get its HIV drug  Tivicay approved as a two drug regimen  2DR  in combination with lamivudine on the back of the positive GEMINI study data  Glaxo anticipates U S  approval in the second quarter of 2019 Glaxo also announced positive data from both the FLAIR and ATLAS studies this year  evaluating cabotegravir plus rilpivirine in a long acting  once monthly HIV formulation  Glaxo believes that this long acting injectable HIV therapy will provide a highly differentiated treatment option for patients seeking a long lasting therapy for HIV  freeing them of the burden of daily oral therapy  It believes the positive data from these studies will allow it to file for approval in the first half of 2019 Glaxo currently carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  Gilead   NASDAQ GILD   is another dominant player in the HIV market with an impressive portfolio  In fact  Gilead s HIV franchise is a major contributor to sales with approved drugs like Genvoya  Truvada  Atripla  Stribild  Descovy  Odefsey and Complera  Sales at this franchise have grown 10  year over year to  10 6 billion in the first nine months of 2018  It also represents more than 65  of total product revenues for the period The company is the first to introduce single tablet regimen   STR   for treating HIV and has several STR regimens in its portfolio  Gilead s latest STR treatment for HIV is Biktarvy  which was approved earlier this year  The company is developing Biktarvy for treatment na ve adults in a late stage study  Meanwhile  Gilead is looking to transition the HIV market to drugs with improved long term safety profiles However  the older drugs are facing generic competition and their sales have slumped significantly year over year Gilead currently sports a Zacks Rank  1 Another company working toward developing HIV drugs is Johnson and Johnson  The company markets Juluca with Glaxo  Further  the company along with The Bill   Melinda Gates Foundation and National Institutes of Health is conducting a clinical study for an investigational mosaic HIV 1

198451,419967,JNJ,AMAG s Label Expansion Of Lead Products Raises Share Price,opinion,"Share price of AMAG Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ AMAG   has increased 37 9  year to date  against the  s decline of 19 0  

AMAG has three marketed products  namely Feraheme  ferumoxytol   which is approved for intravenous  IV  as iron replacement therapy for the treatment of iron deficiency anemia  IDA  in adults with chronic kidney disease  CKD   Makena  hydroxyprogesterone caproate injection   which is a progestin approved to reduce the risk of preterm birth in women pregnant with a single baby who have a history of singleton spontaneous preterm birth  and MuGard for the management of oral mucositis and stomatitis 
The company made efforts towards the label expansion of its marketed drugs  In February 2018  the company received FDA approval for the label expansion of Feraheme and Makena  The FDA approved label expansion of Feraheme  ferumoxytol injection  beyond the current CKD indication 
The new approval includes all eligible adult Iron Deficiency Anemia   IDA   patients who have intolerance to or have had unsatisfactory response to oral iron  The company launched Feraheme with broad IV IDA label during the first quarter of 2018 and the drug is already capturing additional market share In February 2018  the FDA also approved a new administration option for Makena  subcutaneous autoinjector drug device combination product to reduce the risk of preterm birth in certain at risk women  The company has developed an auto injector device for subcutaneous administration of Makena  Makena SQ   including chemistry  manufacturing and controls development  in partnership with Antares Pharma  AMAG also launched it in the first quarter of 2018 
Makena SQ auto injector will ensure easier administration by healthcare providers and less painful injections for patients  This might lead to better sales of the drug  Revenues for the Makena subcutaneous autoinjector grew three fold in the third quarter of 2018 versus that in the second quarter  and made up 57  of the total Makena brand revenues  The company is optimistic about the Makena subcutaneous autoinjector 
Further  AMAG bought exclusive U S  rights to develop and commercialize Palatin Technologies  Vyleesi  bremelanotide  this year  Vyleesi is designed for the on demand treatment of HSDD in pre menopausal women  In March 2018  AMAG submitted a new drug application  NDA  for bremelanotide to treat hypoactive sexual desire disorder  HSDD   which was accepted by the FDA in June 
Vyleesi is currently under review with the FDA and the company is preparing for the upcoming FDA advisory committee meeting in January 2019 and a PDUFA date of Mar 23  2019  A potential approval of this candidate will be a big boost for the company as it caters to a huge unmet medical need for women 
To further boost its maternal health portfolio  in September 2018  AMAG exercised its option to acquire the global rights to an orphan drug candidate  AMAG 423   The move was in accordance with an option agreement entered into in July 2015 with Velo Bio  LLC  a privately held life sciences company  the terms of which were amended at the time of exercise 
AMAG 423 is a polyclonal antibody  currently in clinical development for the treatment of severe preeclampsia in pregnant women  The candidate has been granted both orphan drug and fast track review designations by the FDA  AMAG will now complete the phase IIb IIIa study that Velo initiated in the second quarter of 2017  AMAG expects to report top line data from the study in the first half of 2020 and plans to submit a new drug application  NDA  to the FDA  soon 
Meanwhile  the company completed the divestiture of Cord Blood Registry  CBR  in August 2018 and this sale will allow AMAG to strengthen its balance sheet significantly by paying off its  475 million high yield notes  The deal also underscores the company s commitment to focus on the development and commercialization of medicines that address unmet medical needs 
However  we note that Feraheme currently competes with IV iron replacement therapies like Venofer  Injectafer  Ferrlecit and their generic versions  among others  Feraheme may also face competition from generic IV iron replacement products that could further limit sales AMAG Pharmaceuticals  Inc  Price

The sBLA is supported by data from a pediatric open label study which evaluated Nucala for pharmacokinetics  pharmacodynamics and long term safety in patients aged six to 11 years 
Notably  Nucala received approval for similar indication in Europe in August 2018  In December 2017  Nucala was also approved for eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis in the United States 
Glaxo s shares have gained 13 7  so far this year  outperforming the  s rally of 8 2  

 
The company is also developing the drug in additional indications  A phase III is currently evaluating Nucala in patients with nasal polyps  A potential approval in pediatric asthma patients and successful development in other indications will further boost the prospects of the drug  driving the company s top line 
However in September  Glaxo suffered a regulatory setback related to Nucala when the FDA issued a complete response letter for a sBLA seeking label expansion of Nucala in eosinophilic chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
Meanwhile  Regeneron Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ REGN   and its partner Sanofi   NYSE SNY   received approval for Dupixent as an add on maintenance therapy for treating moderate to severe asthma with an eosinophilic phenotype last month  This is likely to intensify competitive pressures on Nucala  Notably  the companies are also developing Dupixent in pediatric patients 
Nucala is a key drug in Galxo s portfolio of new respiratory drugs  Sales of Nucala were more than  500 million in the first nine months of 2018  registering growth of around 80   However  Glaxo s older inhaled respiratory products  particularly Seretide Advair  are facing competitive and continued pricing pressure  consequently hurting sales 
Further  continued transition to newer products is affecting sales of Advair  The drug is expected to face generic competition in the United States this year  which will hurt sales further GlaxoSmithKline plc Price

198460,419976,JNJ,Bayer Hurts From Generic Competition   Pipeline Setbacks,opinion,"We issued an update report on Bayer AG  DE BAYGN    OTC BAYRY   on Nov 22  2018 
It is a life science company with core competencies in the areas of health care and agriculture 
Several pipeline and regulatory updates are expected from the company in the coming quarters Any adverse pipeline related news can impact the stock unfavorably 
In August 2018  Bayer and partner Johnson and Johnson   NYSE JNJ    announced data from two late stage studies  which demonstrated that blood thinner drug  Xarelto failed to show statistical benefits  These studies were being evaluated to expand the drug s eligible patient population 
Data from the two phase III studies   MARINER and COMMANDER HF   showed no significant difference between Xarelto and placebo for the primary efficacy endpoints  The studies are part of Xarelto s large clinical development program EXPLORER  which evaluates the potential of Xarelto in treating a wide range of critical medical conditions 
The company is currently facing generic competition for many of its products  including the Yaz franchise  oral contraceptives   This will negatively impact revenues of the company  Bayer s dependence on its pharmaceutical segment for growth is a concern 
The company s stock has declined 41 5  year to date  against the  s growth of 9 9  

 
However  Bayer has made several acquisitions and entered into a number of deals in the past few quarters to enhance its portfolio 
In June 2018  Bayer successfully completed the acquisition of Monsanto  NYSE MON  for  63 million  The combined business is expected to boost Bayer s Crop Science business and provide accretion to its core earnings from the first year of the closing of the transaction  followed by double digit percentage growth 
Bayer also expects annual earnings contribution of around  1 5 billion from synergies after three years of closing the transaction along with additional future benefits from integrated offerings  The Monsanto acquisition is a strategic move  which will offer Bayer a broad set of solutions to meet farmers  current and future needs 
The company also received approval for few drugs  which bode well 
In August 2018  the FDA approved Jivi  BAY94 9027  for the routine prophylactic treatment of hemophilia A in previously treated adults and adolescents aged 12 years or older in the United States  The FDA also approved Jivi for on demand treatment and perioperative management of bleeding in the same population  Jivi is a long acting PEGylated recombinant human Factor VIII  rFVIII  replacement therapy 
In September 2018  the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use  CHMP  of the European Medicines Agency recommended Jivi for marketing authorization for the treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in previously treated patients aged 12 years or older with hemophilia A 
In August 2018  the European Commission approved a new treatment approach for Eylea  The approach enables clinicians to combine proactive treatment with early extension of the injection interval for patients with neovascular age related macular degeneration  nAMD   Bayer also has a robust pipeline  The company plans to launch at least 20 products by the end of 2023 and is already on track for the same  A potential approval of its pipeline candidates will boost sales of the company Bayer Aktiengesellschaft Price

Are imminent Zytiga generics a complication 
One of the bear points from our previous note was the potential for generic competition to Zytiga  abiraterone    a blockbuster oral drug to treat prostate cancer  The day after the proposed acquisition of BTG by Boston Scientific was announced  a US Appeals Court ruling allowed generic abiraterone launches while the invalidation of Zytiga s last valid US patent is being appealed

198468,419984,JNJ,This REIT Yields Over 7  And Will Profit From A Major Healthcare Trend ,opinion,"Investors looking to add healthcare stocks to their portfolio typically buy a pharmaceutical company like Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  or Pfizer  NYSE PFE   But investors can also gain exposure to the healthcare industry indirectly  through Real Estate Investment Trusts that invest in healthcare properties  The beauty of healthcare REITs is that they commonly offer significantly higher dividend yields than pharmaceutical stocks 
For example  Omega Healthcare Investors Inc  NYSE OHI  is one of the biggest healthcare REITs in the U S   and it has a 7 7  dividend yield  It has a very high dividend yield  compared with the S P 500 Index  which has an average dividend yield below 2  right now  Plus  Omega has potential for future growth  thanks to a huge healthcare trend set to unfold over the next several years  This makes Omega an attractive stock for income investors 
Business Overview   Recent Events
Omega Healthcare Investors is a REIT that owns healthcare properties  The company was founded in 1992  and today has a market capitalization above  6 billion  It utilizes long term triple net leases  The triple net structure is advantageous for Omega  as it provides fixed rent payments from tenants with annual escalators  And  property level expenses  such as labor  insurance  property taxes  and capital expenditures  are the operator s responsibility 
At the end of the third quarter  Omega s portfolio consisted of 923 healthcare facilities  located in 41 states and the United Kingdom  Its portfolio includes skilled nursing facilities  83  of revenue   senior housing  13  of revenue  as well as a small collection of other properties  4  of revenue  

Source  Investor Presentation  page 4
The past year has been difficult for Omega  due to some problems with two tenants  Orianna and Preferred Care  which entered bankruptcy  Preferred Care was a relatively small tenant with annual contractual revenues of just  3 million  but Orianna was Omega Healthcare s fifth largest tenant  with annual contractual revenues of  47 million 
Elevated costs related to the issues facing Orianna and Preferred Care weighed on Omega s cash flow  but the company is making progress reshaping its portfolio  Omega has transitioned the Mississippi based Orianna facilities and will generate contractual annual rent of  12 million from them  The company reaffirmed it expects  32 to  38 million in annual rent total from these assets once they are transitioned or sold 
Omega s strong third quarter earnings report showed that the steps taken to improve its property portfolio are having a positive impact  For the quarter  revenue of  222 million increased 1  year over year  and beat analyst estimates by  28 million  Funds from operation  FFO  per share of  0 77 also beat by  0 02 per share  and declined 2 5  from the same quarter last year  Higher tenant revenue was more than offset by higher restructuring and interest expenses 
Still  Omega generates more than enough cash flow to reward shareholders with a strong dividend  For 2018  the company expects FFO per share in a range of  3 03 to  3 06  Assuming the company reaches its FFO forecast  it will easily cover its  2 64 per share dividend  There could even be room for future dividend increases  as the company is set to grow FFO in the years ahead 
Profiting From The Aging Population
One of the advantages of investing in health care REITs is that the industry has a positive long term growth outlook  Healthcare REITs like Omega are ideally positioned to capitalize on a major trend  the aging population  Older generations of Americans such as the Baby Boomers are large in size  and growing  relative to other generational groups  To that end  Omega expects the 65  population to continue growing  as a share of the overall population 

Source  Investor Presentation  page 13
Continued growth of the 65  cohort means demand for healthcare real estate properties  such as skilled nursing facilities and senior housing facilities  is likely to grow for the foreseeable future  The number of elderly people in need of healthcare is expected to grow at a fast pace over the next decade  In addition  the trend is for the elderly to spend an increasing amount of money on healthcare  Healthcare spending is likely to rise at a faster rate than GDP growth in the United States going forward 
Omega s portfolio remains in good shape  It will see only a small portion of its leases expire over the next decade  Moreover  it has no material debt maturities until 2022  Therefore  the REIT is likely to enjoy reliable free cash flows in the upcoming years  without any shocks from debt maturities  Omega s FFO growth could be restrained while the company works through its tenant issues  but the company is well positioned for the long run 
Omega stock could generate strong returns for shareholders over the next five years  due to FFO growth  a low stock valuation  and dividends  During the last decade  the company grew FFO at a 4 5  average annual rate  As it is likely to complete its asset repositioning this year  it is reasonable to expect the REIT to grow its FFO at a 4 5  average annual rate over the next five years 
In addition  Omega shares appear to be undervalued today  Lingering concerns over its property portfolio caused Omega s stock valuation to decline in the past year  Now  Omega stock trades for a price to FFO ratio of 11 2  compared with a 10 year average ratio of 12 4  This means Omega is valued more cheaply than its long term historical average  which could signal a buying opportunity  The stock is expected to revert towards its average valuation level  since the company s turnaround efforts are likely to be successful  If this occurs  the stock will enjoy a 2 1  average annual gain thanks to expansion of the valuation multiple through 2023 
Lastly  dividends are a major component of REIT shareholder returns  In this case  Omega stock pays a current dividend yield of 7 7   This is a high and appealing dividend for investors searching for yield in a low interest rate environment  Adding it all up  the combination of valuation changes  FFO growth  and dividends cumulatively result in total expected returns of over 14  per year 
Final Thoughts
Stocks with high dividend yields should be approached with caution  It is important for investors to understand the unique risks of high yield stocks  and make sure the high yield is sustainable  In this case  Omega appears to be a safe high yield stock  with sufficient cash flow to maintain the dividend payout  And  Omega has positive growth potential for the future  thanks to the aging population and continued need for healthcare real estate  With a 7 7  yield and total expected returns of over 14  per year  Omega is an appealing stock for income investors

198471,419987,JNJ,Johnson   Johnson  JNJ  Up 3 4  Since Last Earnings Report  Can It Continue ,opinion,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ   Shares have added about 3 4  in that time frame  outperforming the S P 500 
Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is Johnson   Johnson due for a pullback  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts  J J Tops on Third Quarter Earnings   Sales  Ups ViewJ J s third quarter 2018 earnings came in at  2 05 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 03 and increasing 7 9  from the year ago period driven by higher revenues and better operating margins Adjusted earnings excluded amortization expense and a charge for some after tax special items  Including these items  J J reported third quarter earnings of  1 44 per share  up 5 1  year over year Sales came in at  20 3 billion  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  19 91 billion  Sales increased 3 6  from the year ago quarter  reflecting an operational increase of 5 5  and an unfavorable currency impact of 1 9  Organically  excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures  sales increased 6 1  on an operational basis  slightly less than 6 3  increase seen in the previous quarter  Continued above market growth in the Pharmaceutical segment and improved organic sales growth in the Medical Devices and the Consumer segments led to strong performance in the quarter Third quarter sales grew 3 6  in the domestic market to  10 66 billion and 3 5  in international markets to  9 68 billion  reflecting 7 5  operational growth and 4  negative currency impact Segment DetailsJ J s Pharma segment is performing better than the market in 2018 despite the impact of biosimilars on Remicade sales Pharmaceutical segment sales rose 6 7  year over year to  10 3 billion  reflecting 8 2  operational growth and 1 5  negative currency impact as sales rose in both domestic and international markets  Sales in the domestic market rose 4 8  to  6 1 billion  International sales grew 9 5  to  4 25 billion  operational increase of 13 2    The strong performance was led by the company s oncology portfolio  Worldwide sales of J J s cancer drugs rose 36 4  in the quarter  Acquisitions and divestitures had a negligible impact to sales growth in the quarter New products like Imbruvica  cancer  and Darzalex  multiple myeloma  continued to perform well  Core products like Stelara  Zytiga  Simponi Simponi Aria and Invega Sustenna also contributed to growth Imbruvica sales rose 37 7  to  705 million in the quarter driven largely by share gains across all lines of therapy Darzalex sales rose 57 1  to  498 million in the quarter  In United States  market growth and strong launch uptake in the first line setting  for which approval was received in May  drove sales  In outside U S  markets  increased penetration and share gains drove sales growth Zytiga sales rose 43 2  to  958 million in the quarter due to continued strong market growth and share gains  Zytiga was approved in the first line setting in February  which has been a key driver of Zytiga s strong performance in the past three quarters Stelara sales rose 16 5  to  1 31 billion in the quarter  Stelara has witnessed a strong uptake in its new indication for Crohn s disease  experiencing share gains in the third quarter  Simponi Simponi Aria sales rose 12 6  to  536 million in the quarter  Invega Sustenna sales rose 16 5  to  749 million in the quarter In the quarter  J J recorded pulmonary arterial hypertension  PAH  revenues of  656 million  up 3 8  year over year  Strong demand for Uptravi and Opsumit was partially offset by the expected decline of Tracleer outside the United States due to generic competition  The Actelion acquisition added 3 8  to sales growth in the third quarter compared with 6 6  in the second quarter Sales of Invokana Invokamet declined 28 3  to  190 million due to higher managed care discounting and market share decline due to competitive pressure Xarelto sales declined 3 6  in the quarter to  612 million with continued share gains being offset by increased rebates and a negative impact from prior quarter adjustments  Excluding these adjustments  the drug s underlying growth would have been approximately 2 5   The October FDA approval of Xarelto for a new 2 5 milligram vascular dose for the CAD PAD indication significantly expands the drug s eligible patient population  which can drive sales of the drug in future quarters Sales of Remicade were down 16 3  in the quarter to  1 38 billion due to competition from biosimilars   While U S  sales declined 18 2   U S  exports went down 35 9   Remicade sales rose 2 5  in international markets Regarding newly launched Tremfya  J J said that the product is seeing strong demand trends with more than 25 000 patients now on therapy and the drug capturing 5 8  share of the psoriasis market in the United States  Tremfya recorded sales of  171 million in the quarter compared with  126 million in the second quarter Medical Devices segment sales came in at  6 59 billion  down 0 2  from the year ago period  It included an operational increase of 1 7  and negative currency movement of 1 9  Excluding the impact of all acquisitions and divestitures  on an operational basis  worldwide sales increased 2 9   same as in the second quarter Operational growth was driven by continued strong performance in vision care and electrophysiology and improving performance in spine and keens and the orthopedics portfolio  which made up for a weaker sales performance in the diabetes care  Domestic market sales rose 0 3  year over year to  3 2 billion  International market sales decreased 0 6   operational increase of 3   year over year to  3 4 billion The Consumer segment recorded revenues of  3 4 billion in the reported quarter  up 1 8  year over year  Moreover  on an operational basis  Consumer segment sales increased 4 9   partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency movement of 3 1  Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures  adjusted operational sales growth was 6 1  worldwide  a significant acceleration from the second quarter  The improved performance was driven by growth in beauty and over the counter products and the benefit of re stocking of retail inventory to support the re launch of the Johnson s baby care brand in August Regarding the baby care brand re launch  management informed that they launched in the United States  China and India during the third quarter  and plan to continue the full global rollout into 2019 Sales in the domestic market rose 6 6  from the year ago period to  1 4 billion  Meanwhile  the international segment recorded a decline of 1 3  to  2 04 billion  The operational increase of 3 7  was offset by negative currency impact of 5  in the quarter 2018 Outlook TrimmedJ J raised its previously issued earnings and sales guidance for 2018 J J expects 2018 adjusted earnings per share in the range of  8 13    8 18 compared with  8 07    8 17 expected previously  The guidance range reflects an operational growth rate between 9 3  and 10   previously 8 5  and 9 9    Currency fluctuations are expected to favorably impact EPS by approximately 15 cents  which remains unchanged from the prior guidance Revenues are expected in the range of  81 to  81 4 billion  higher than the previously expected  80 5 to  81 3 billion  reflecting operational constant currency sales growth rate in the range of 5 5  to 6   previously 4 5  to 5 5   Organic sales growth  excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures  is expected to be in the range of 4 5  higher than 3 5  4 5  previously  J J has raised its full year organic sales growth expectations thrice this yearCurrency fluctuations are expected to favorably impact sales by 50 basis points  lower than 80 basis points  previously In the fourth quarter  while the Consumer and Medical Device businesses should continue to improve  the Pharmaceuticals segment might see slower growth  The Pharmaceuticals segment is facing difficult comparisons in second half of 2018  which coupled with expected biosimilar and generic competition to Tracleer and Procrit later this year  may put pressure on the segment s growth in the fourth quarter  Adjusted pre tax operating margin is expected to increase at least 150 basis points in 2018  previously approximately150 basis points   Although a stronger than expected year to date performance would have resulted in higher margins  increased R D investments in the fourth quarter will offset some of the  benefit Adjusted tax rate is guided in the range of 17 5   18   17 previously  The company does not expect any biosimilar entrants for Zytiga  Prezista  Risperdal Consta  or Invega Sustenna in the United States in 2018  However  the company is confident that it can absorb the impact of any potential Zytiga headwind should there be an earlier than expected generics launch in 2018 However  the 2018 guidance includes the impact of generics for Procrit and Tracleer as well as Remicade biosimilars

198480,419996,JNJ,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  HCA Healthcare  Molina Healthcare  Johnson   Johnson  Facebook And Twitter,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   November 7  2018   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include HCA Healthcare  Inc    NYSE HCA    Molina Healthcare  Inc    NYSE MOH    Johnson   Johnson   NYSE JNJ    Facebook  Inc    NASDAQ FB   and Twitter  Inc    NYSE TWTR   Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations    Here are highlights from Tuesday s Analyst Blog Election Day 2018  Here Are the Stock Market Winners   LosersTuesday s mid term election will certainly change the tone of politics in the coming two years  if not the balance of power in Washington  The election is widely expected to see Democrats gaining control over the House of Representatives  while Republicans will probably retain control of the Senate  resulting in a divided Congress But state by state and district by district  the outcome will depend on voter turnout  enthusiasm and several other factors that polling may not take into account Thus  the results will not only have implications for the stock market but for the economy as a whole  After all  it will shape the outlook for the 2020 presidential election  Let us  thus  look into the sectors that are most likely to be impacted by the election results A Divided Congress Bodes Well for Healthcare StocksThe prospects of a divided Congress could be helpful for healthcare stocks  The Affordable Care Act  ACA  did come under tremendous assault by Republicans following Donald Trump s election in 2016  ACA was subjected to a series of legislative changes  Democrats  however  now are expected to take over the House of Representatives and that is a blessing in disguise for the ACA With not much legislative changes under Democrats  things are surely looking up for Medicaid health maintenance organization  HMOs  and hospitals  And why not  ACA has always encouraged the development of Medicaid HMOs and benefited hospitals by reducing the number of uninsured patients who cannot pay their bills Leading hospital company  HCA Healthcare  Inc  and Medicaid HMO provider  Molina Healthcare  Inc  are  thus  most likely to gain from the election outcome  While HCA Healthcare carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   Molina Healthcare sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see   By the way  a split Congress should also benefit pharma bigwigs  This is because legislative action on drug pricing will be put off  something that has haunted the drug manufacturers in recent times  Johnson   Johnson should breathe a sigh of relief as many of their drugs derive sales growth from price increases Democrats Increasing Clout Not Necessarily a Threat for BanksDemocrats taking over the House may exert some near term pressure on bank stocks  But Republicans are forecast to retain control of the Senate and that should help banks in the long term  Republicans have remained sympathetic to big banks and President Trump has taken enough steps to ease stringent banking rules  And  any how the current rising interest rate scenario bodes well for banks  Minutes from the U S  Federal Reserve s September meeting had already confirmed that the central bank is most likely to continue hiking benchmark lending rates at a gradual pace this year and beyond A Democratic House Could Affect Energy PlayersShares of integrated oil majors as well as exploration and production  refining and drilling companies could take a beating provided Democrats take the House  A Democratic House will surely try to reverse the easing of environmental regulations by the Trump administration And even if bills find it difficult to get through a Republican Senate  renewed focus on regulatory issues could become a potential headwind  Joe McMonigle  senior energy policy analyst at Hedgeye Risk Management said that  Democrats may bring a focus to other issues such as climate change   He added that  there could also be an oversight spotlight on the Environmental Protection Agency and Interior Department environmental regulations  Auto Makers   Big Tech Have Much Riding on Election ResultsStakes are also high for the American auto industry  In general  Democrats winning the House is not good news for automakers  They are widely expected to support the more stringent Obama era corporate average fuel economy standards currently in place  Thus  only if Republicans can control both the House and the Senate  a relief rally in auto stocks is possible Unlike automakers  no matter which party controls Congress  things aren t looking good for big Internet players  purely from a regulation standpoint  Both the parties have stuck a similar tone on online privacy policy through a series of hearings that roasted top executives from Facebook  Inc  and Twitter  Inc  as security and data related issues piled up Any Election Outcome Bodes Well for CannabisIf the Democrats gain ground  then the proposed federal laws like the SAFE Act will easily get implemented  This Act blocks the government from punishing banks that serve marijuana business in legal states GOP holding ground also does not necessarily mean that pot legalization is dead  As rightly pointed out by Cowen   Co analysts Jaret Seiberg and Chris Krueger that  given popular support for cannabis legislation and a preference by many Senate Republicans to respect states  rights  a GOP Senate could advance a cannabis bill  Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest StrategiesIt s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But while the market gained

TESARO s key marketed drug  Zejula is approved as maintenance treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer patients 
Total revenues  primarily from Zejula  were approximately  64 4 million in the quarter  up 12 6  sequentially  Revenues  however  missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  69 51 million  The company had recorded total revenues of  142 8 million in the year ago quarter  TESARO had recorded an upfront payment of  100 million from Takeda in the year ago period  which was missing this quarter 
Shares of the company rose almost 7 4  in pre market trading on Nov 2  presumably on the back of strong growth in Zejula sales and an improved guidance  However  TESARO has underperformed the  so far this year  While the stock has lost 61 5   the industry decreased 3 8  

 
Quarter in Detail
Product revenues during the quarter rose 52 3  year over year to  63 6 million  The significant increase was mainly driven by impressive growth in sales of Zejula  which increased almost 61  from the year ago period to  63 2 million  Zejula s sales were up 17 3  sequentially 
Importantly  the company registered more than 10 000 new patients on Zejula therapy since its launch  On its last quarter earnings call  the company stated that more than 6000 patients had been prescribed Zejula since launch  The drug showed strong uptake in Europe 
The company s other marketed drug  Varubi  generated sales of  0 4 million in the quarter  In late June  TESARO entered into an agreement with TerSera Therapeutics to divest the U S  and Canadian rights of the drug  During the third quarter  the company closed the deal and received an upfront payment of  35 million 
License  collaboration and other revenues were  0 8 million compared with  101 million in the year ago period 
During the third quarter  research   development expenses increased 28 3  year over year to  94 2 million  primarily due to increased expenses for clinical studies on Zejula  TSR 042 and TSR 022  Selling  general and administrative  SG A  expenses increased 11 3  year over year to  93 5 million  reflecting increased activities to support commercialization of Zejula in the United States as well as Europe 
TESARO ended the quarter with  476 8 million of cash and cash equivalents  down from  575 1 million on Jun 30  2018 
Pipeline Update
The company is actively working on expanding the label of Zejula in first line ovarian cancer as well as in other cancer indications  Zejula is being evaluated in several clinical studies as monotherapy or in combination for additional indications  Janssen  a subsidiary of Johnson   Johnson   NYSE JNJ    is developing Zejula in prostate cancer with regulatory applications to be filed next year 
A regulatory application seeking label expansion of Zejula in late line ovarian cancer beyond BRCA mutation patients is expected before year end  A phase III study and a phase II study are evaluating Zejula monotherapy and Zejula in combination with Roche s   OTC RHHBY   Avastin  bevacizumab   respectively  in first line ovarian cancer  Data is expected in late 2019 from both the studies 
Apart from Zejula  TESARO s pipeline also includes immunotherapies   anti PD 1 antibody  TSR 042  and anti LAG 3 antibody  TSR 022  The company is developing TSR 042 in the lucrative first line non small cell lung cancer among other indications  The company expects to file a Biologics License Application   BLA   for TSR 042 in the second half of 2019 for recurrent endometrial cancer 
2018 Outlook Raised
TESARO raised the lower end of its sales guidance for 2018  after lowering it significantly on the second quarter earnings call  It now expects it to be in the range of  258 to  265 million compared with  250 to  265 million expected previously  Expectations for Zejula sales were also higher in the range of  233 to  238 million  previously  225 to  235   Sales of the drug in the fourth quarter are expected to be  67 to  72 million 
The company expects other revenues  including licensing and Varuby oral  in Europe   to be in the range of  25 to  27 million  previously  25 to  30 million  
The company maintained its cash and cash equivalents guidance at  400 million at year end 
Our Take
Although Zejula continues to show strong adoption  competition is increasing in the stagnating PARP inhibitor segment  Approval of Clovis Oncology s   NASDAQ CLVS   Rubraca in earlier line setting and expansion in patient population without BRCA mutation has made the ovarian cancer space more competitive  AstraZeneca s Lynpraza is the third PARP inhibitor approved for ovarian cancer 
However  successful development of Zejula  earlier than Rubraca and Lynparza  in first line ovarian cancer may boost sales of the drug TESARO  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

198499,420015,JNJ,Merck reveals seven years of its U S  drug price increase history,news,"By Bill Berkrot
 Reuters    Merck   Co  N MRK  on Friday posted seven years of information showing a high single digit percentage annual average price hike across its portfolio of medicines in a move that provides new details on its pricing practices for the U S  market 
Politicians  health insurers and most recently President Donald Trump have criticized drug companies over high U S  prices for prescription drugs and repeated price hikes  Trump said pharmaceutical companies have been  getting away with murder  
Other pharmaceutical companies have also signaled intentions to address rising criticism over prescription drug cost 
In every year after 2010  Merck said its average list price hikes over its entire drug portfolio was more than 9 percent  peaking at 10 5 percent in 2014  The averages are near the 10 percent level that some pharmaceutical executives and lawmakers have targeted recently 
See graphic 
The pricing information  which can be found on Merck s website  provides data from 2010 through 2016 on average annual increases to list price  as well as net price after discounts and rebates to payers  including pharmaceutical benefit managers and insurers  It also lists the average discount for each year 
Merck s most important new revenue growth driver  the cancer drug Keytruda  lists for about  150 000 per year of treatment  The class of medicines that are transforming cancer treatment by helping the immune system to attack tumors command high prices but so far help only about 20 percent of patients who receive them 
Merck s chart shows that its annual net price increases ranged from a low of 3 4 percent in 2010 to a high of 6 2 percent in 2012  In 2013  2015 and 2016  they were 5 5 percent 
The average discount from list price climbed from 27 3 percent in 2010 to 40 9 percent in 2016  Merck said  Payers have been demanding increasing discounts and rebates in exchange for covering a drugmakers  medicines 
Johnson   Johnson  N JNJ  on Tuesday said it was planning to release a  pharmaceutical transparency report  with new disclosures on U S  pricing  research and development expenses  and programs to supply medicines to those who cannot afford them 
Earlier this month  AbbVie  N ABBV  became the third major drugmaker to pledge to keep U S  price increases under 10 percent in 2017  It also said it would raise prices only once this year  rather than the common industry standard of two  often double digit percentage  price increases ",2017-01-27,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/merck-reveals-seven-years-of-its-u.s.-drug-price-increase-history-456249,456249

198508,420024,JNJ,J J  Royal Bank of Canada Are Perfect For Your Forever Portfolio,opinion,"A general principle of investing is buy low and sell high  But many investors  who have made fortunes  rarely sell once they ve bought a cash producing asset 
The great investor Philip Fisher  in his book  Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits   famously argues that the best time to sell a stock is  almost never   Warren Buffett  the world s most successful value investor  wrote that his  favorite holding period is forever  in his 1988 letter to Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa  shareholders 
If your goal is to build a solid cash stream for your retirement  then keeping some Forever Stocks in your portfolio is a great idea  You can tap your dividend stocks for regular income when you need it  And when you don t need passive income  you can use these cash flows to re invest and unlock the power of compounding 
Forever Stocks are the companies that pay dividends no matter what s happening with the general economy  Their payouts survive peaks and troughs  wars  depressions and asset bubbles 
Their products and services are so crucial that we can t imagine a normal life without them  This quality has turned these companies into cash machines that never run out 
J J Makes The Cash And Doles It Out
Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  is not the kind of stock you hear people bragging about at dinner parties  It s an old economy stock that rarely gets space in the financial press  But the New Brunswick  N J   based healthcare giant is exactly the kind of investment that buy and hold investors prefer 

JNJ is one of the world s most powerful brands  Through its three business units  the company runs more than 260 companies across the world  JNJ generated leveraged free cash flow of more than  18 billion in the last four reported quarters 
When it comes to rewarding investors  few companies have done better than Johnson   Johnson  The company has increased its quarterly dividend rate every year for 56 consecutive years  This remarkable performance puts Johnson   Johnson among an elite group known as Dividend Kings  companies with at least five decades of annual dividend hikes 
Royal Bank of Canada Can Weather Any Storm
Since the 2008 financial crisis  banks haven t been on the radar screen of some income investors because of the inherent risk they carry in times of distress  But north of the border  banking stocks have proven a much better bet than at home 

In Canada  banks operate in an oligopoly  where their domestic businesses are well protected from competition  Canadian banking regulations are much tougher when compared to other advanced markets 
The latest example of this strong regulatory environment is the nation s successful handling of its real estate market  where rampant speculations in the past decade had many banks exposed  This alarming situation prompted the nation s banking watchdog to tighten the mortgage rules in a timely manner and avoid a disaster 
To get exposure to one of the best banking systems in the world  buy Royal Bank Of Canada  NYSE RY   the nation s largest lender  RBC also fits nicely in any Forever Stock portfolio  The Toronto based lender generates hefty cash flows and distributes about half of its income in dividends each year 
The lender has paid dividends to shareholders every year since 1870  Since 1998  the share price in US dollars has increased more than 1 400 percent  In that period  there were recessions  bank closures and the financial crisis  RBC was able to ride through all these crises because it had a wide economic moat to defend itself 
Bottom Line
Buying and holding Forever Stocks such as J J and RBC is a tested approach to build your wealth for your nest egg  You can use these two names to identify other long term opportunities in the market with the aim of holding those stocks for the next 30 to 40 years  Look for strong balance sheets  rising cash flows and a dominant market position ",2018-09-21,Haris Anwar/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/jj-royal-bank-of-canada-are-perfect-for-your-forever-portfolio-200344854,200344854
198509,420025,JNJ,JNJ Stock Had A Nice Run Lately  Time To Sell ,opinion,"Less than four months ago  JNJ stock was trading below the  120 a share mark  down 20  from its all time high of  148 32  A 20  decline is a pretty serious thing for investors  especially when we talk about blue chip stocks  which are considered to be less volatile and therefore safer bets  In fact  many believe that once a security has fallen by 20  it is officially in a bear market and more weakness can be expected 
But instead of automatically jumping to a bearish conclusion simply because Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  was down 20   we decided to take a look at the Elliott Wave structure of this decline  The chart below  published on June 8th  revealed a much brighter picture 
The 20  drop from  148 32 to  118 62 looked like a textbook A B C zigzag correction with an ending diagonal pattern in the position of wave C  Ralph N  Elliott once discovered that ending diagonals are often followed by a  swift and sharp reversal   In other words  the structure of JNJ stock  s slump warned us not to join the bears near  123 a share in June and get ready for a major rally instead  Three and a half months later  here is an updated chart depicting JNJ s progress 
The bulls needed a little time to regroup at first  but they never allowed a new low to be reached   118 62 remained intact  so all investors had to do was stick to the analysis and stay long JNJ stock  Last Friday  Johnson and Johnson closed in the vicinity of  143 a share  up 15 9  since June 8th  Furthermore  it looks like a five wave impulse is in progress  If that is correct  we can expect JNJ to keep rising and eventually reach and exceed the  150 mark 
JNJ Stock  the Big Picture
Then what  No trend lasts forever and as the last 20  dip demonstrated  even blue chip stocks are not immune to sudden price declines  In order to decide if holding JNJ stock above  150 is worth the risk  let s take a look at its weekly chart  It reveals its entire uptrend since March  2009 
As visible  the recent selloff to  118 62 fits in the position of wave IV within a larger five wave advance from  46 25 in March  2009  A support cluster formed by the 38 2  Fibonacci level and the lower line of the trend channel helped JNJ stock recover in the second half of 2018  The problem is that every impulse is followed by a three wave correction in the opposite direction  Chances are good that the current rally is actually the fifth wave   V   of JNJ s post 2009 bull market  A major three wave decline can be expected as soon as it is over 
In conclusion  the Elliott Wave principle put us ahead of a strong and powerful recovery in a blue chip stock that was otherwise supposed to be in a bear market  The rally is not over as  150 is still there for the taking  but buying JNJ stock near all time highs is probably not a good idea

198515,420031,JNJ,Sanofi s M A misses frustrate some investors in drugmaker,news,"By Matthias Blamont  No lle Mennella and Ben Hirschler PARIS DAVOS  Switzerland  Reuters    For the last year  Sanofi s chief executive has made clear his quest for deals to help revive the fortunes of France s biggest drugmaker  The market is still waiting  Olivier Brandicourt s failure to land two big biotech acquisitions he was chasing has led to growing impatience among some investors   The company needs a growth driver and must make an acquisition  Time is running out   said Olivier David of Vega Investment Managers  who holds shares in the company  In an interview at the World Economic Forum in the Swiss resort of Davos this week Brandicourt defended his track record  citing an unwillingness to overpay for pricey assets and a paucity of good opportunities   We can grow without M A  However  it is a tool which we do continue to consider and which can help growth potentially  only if it makes sense strategically   he said   The reason why it is so competitive is that you don t have a very  very large number of potential targets    Sanofi s misses underscore the race for assets as the world s top drugmakers try to replenish their medicine cabinets  After entering exclusive talks  Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  appears to be closing in on a deal to buy Actelion for some  28 billion  edging out Sanofi  PA SASY   which also tried to buy the Swiss company  according to people familiar with the matter  It marks a second setback for Brandicourt s M A ambitions after he was beaten by Pfizer s  14 billion bid for U S  cancer specialist Medivation last August  Brandicourt said he had to tread a fine line between delivering and overpaying  arguing many shareholders appreciated the financial discipline needed to walk away from deals   Shareholders being frustrated after one year is not automatically what I m hearing  to be honest  because when I see investors they seem to be very happy for us not to have spent  14 billion on Medivation   he said   On Actelion  I m not making any comment but you will understand that a company like ours will continuously look at what s happening in the world of potential mergers and acquisitions   The global pharmaceutical industry has seen a flurry of acquisitions in recent years as leading players build their drug pipelines by snapping up young biotech firms   Sanofi has a particular need to do this because its core U S  diabetes business has stalled  Brandicourt   who joined the company in April 2015 after the ousting of former CEO Chris Viehbacher   insisted Sanofi was delivering effectively on a plan set out to 2020  The drugmaker posted better than expected quarterly earnings in October  helped by a surge in flu vaccine sales  but it stuck to its guidance for currency adjusted sales at its embattled diabetes business to shrink by 4 8 percent per year on average from 2015 to 2018  Despite a rally since October  over the last five years Sanofi shares have lagged the sector  rising around 37 percent  against a 61 percent gain for the STOXX Europe 600 Healthcare index   A lot of fund managers and historic shareholders are fed up with Sanofi and tired of seeing the stock in this  vegetative  state   said Frederic Rozier  a Sanofi investor and fund manager with Meeschaert   Cost cutting is not enough  we want to see growth in sales  that s where we need to see progress    CONSTANT SCREENING MODE   Sanofi is due to publish annual results on Feb  8 and its 2016 financial performance is expected to hinge on cost savings  The fear is that with few potential new blockbusters in development  with the notable exception of dupilumab for eczema and asthma  Sanofi may find itself stuck with no meaningful growth for a while   Sanofi is looking for a pipeline and for this very reason it must engage in external growth   said Rudi Van den Eynde  with asset management firm Candriam   At the moment  the company is being overtaken by other groups that are offering more money  One can applaud that Sanofi is financially disciplined but it is a pity that it misses its targets     it doesn t help in terms of credibility   Sanofi s failure to land either Medivation or Actelion has raised questions over its acquisition strategy  even as the group insists it is in  constant screening mode    Is Sanofi not too rigid when it comes to pricing  At the end  they lose to someone else   said a Paris based banker who asked not to be identified  Another banking source said Sanofi s hostile approach in the Medivation process had been a mistake  Weeks before losing out to  Pfizer   NYSE PFE   Sanofi tried to oust Medivation s board members to replace them with new directors   Everyone knows that 95 percent of hostile approaches go wrong   the source said  adding that in the final stage Pfizer and Sanofi were only a few hundred millions apart  Brandicourt said he simply stuck to his guns on price and he noted that Sanofi  with a relatively small oncology business  may have had fewer potential cost savings than competitors  IF YOU DON T LIKE IT  SWAP IT Sanofi has signaled its readiness to do deals of a similar size to its  20 billion purchase of Genzyme in 2011 but finding the right large biotech to fit is not that easy   Alternatively  Sanofi could purchase smaller companies  along the lines of the strategy pursued by Japan s Takeda  It would be more realistic   Van den Eynde said  Sanofi may also look at more asset swaps  after agreeing to hand its animal unit to Boehringer Ingelheim in exchange for the German firm s consumer healthcare operations  a business strand it is keen to grow  
 A number of healthcare companies are looking at Pfizer s consumer health unit  Sanofi is one of them   said one healthcare banker  A Sanofi spokesman declined to comment ",2017-01-20,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/sanofi's-m-amp;a-misses-frustrate-some-investors-in-drugmaker-454529,454529

198524,420040,JNJ,Johnson And Johnson  JNJ   Will Pipeline Drugs Offset Sales Erosion ,opinion,"Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  is a massive company with many products stretching across its three segments  Pharmaceutical  Consumer  and Medical Devices 
  The Pharmaceutical segment is the key to the bull and bear thesis  as it represents a majority of revenue and operating income  A number of drugs will face generic competition in 2019  and investors are watching to see if the pipeline is robust enough to fend off revenue erosion
  Consumer and Medical Devices have lagged Pharmaceuticals growth  but management outlined a robust plan to turn the businesses around over the next several years at a recent Investor Day on May 16  These segments may become a bigger part of the story should Pharmaceutical segment growth slow  and is essential for JNJ s multiple to recover
Pharmaceutical Segment to Likely Face Elevated Generic Competition in 2019
The Pharmaceutical segment represents  50  of sales and 66  of operating income  and therefore is key to the bull and bear thesis around Johnson and Johnson  The segment has seen high single to low double digits organic growth over the last several years 
However  investors fear that growth may begin to slow in 2019 as generics and biosimilars eat away at blockbuster drugs  In particular  investors are watching two drugs  Remicade and Zytiga 
Remicade is a drug that can be used to reduce signs and symptoms for a number of indications  including Colitis  Arthritis  and Crohn s Disease  Worldwide revenue began to decline in 2015 after the expiration of the EU patent  and then US revenue declined further in late 2016 after Inflectra  a Remicade biosimilar  launched  Today  many analysts believe current stock levels price in steep declines in Remicade revenue  Consensus estimates place Remicade revenues at  5 3 billion in 2018 and  4 6 billion in 2019 

Zytiga is used with Prednisone to treat mCRPC  an advanced form of metastatic prostate cancer  The drug faces generic competition that is thought to be 6 12 months away by most investors  Of note  Sun Pharma also recently received approval of its branded Yonsa drug  which is a new formulation of Zytiga  The approval was a surprise to many investors as Johnson and Johnson still holds onto a method of use patent on Zytiga  However  Yonsa is not a substitute for Zytiga  and is there expected to face an uphill battle in convincing doctors to write for Yonsa over Zytiga  As a result  investors remain focused on the expected generic competition in 2019  Consensus expects Zytiga revenue to drop from  3 1 billion in 2018 to  2 4 billion in 2019 

On the flip side  many of these same analysts also believe that not enough credit is being given to Johnson and Johnson s pipeline of drugs  They cite management s goal of filing 10 new products  each expected to drive  1B  in revenue  and 50 line extensions  11 with at least  500M potential  by 2021 as evidence of the company s efforts to offset potential blockbuster declines 
Within the pipeline  investors are particularly excited about Tremfya  Erleada  and Esketamine  Esketamine recently received strong top line phase 3 data for treatment resistant depression  TRD   which should support management s goal of a 2018 filing  Esketamine has received breakthrough therapy designations for TRD as well as for suicidal ideation  The addressable market is significant  as there are an estimated 6 million TRD patients in the US alone  Beyond the pipeline  investors are also watching for strength in Xarelto  Darzalex  and Imbruvica 
Key is whether the company s pipeline can offset erosion from competition
To summarize  investors are closely watching JNJ s Pharmaceutical segment for 1  Remicade and Zytiga sales erosion  especially as generics and biosimilars enter  and 2  the company s ability to offset erosion with new drugs and line extensions 
Consumer and Medical Devices are Show Me Stories
The Consumer and Medical Device segments represent the remainder of the 33  in operating income and have been a drag on overall growth at Johnson and Johnson  In mid May  Johnson and Johnson held an Investor Day to present the plan to turn around the businesses  These turnaround plans will be key in reviving JNJ s multiple and in de risking financials should the Pharmaceutical segment slow 
Consumer Segment Focused on Becoming More Nimble and Relevant
The Consumer segment saw solid  above market organic growth of about  3  between 2014 and 2016  However  the company experienced hiccups in 2017 as organic growth slowed to 1  driven by new entrants into the space 
Going forward  management expects the segment to grow at 1 2  above market growth between 2016 and 2020  They expect to achieve these goals through a number of organizational changes  including 
  Taking on more startup qualities while holding onto the benefits that come from a global brand with enormous scale
  Emphasis on e commerce channel  which they expect to grow significantly
  Tailored messaging that will be more local and consumer relevant
  The company continues to expect that the majority of revenue growth will be driven by its 12 megabrands  Specifically  watch for the relaunch of Baby and Oral Care  as these relaunches will be important indicators of whether the company s strategy will be effective 
Medical Devices Turnaround Expected to be Driven by Investments and New Product Launches
Medical Devices has underperformed for some time  but management believes the segment is now positioned to return to above market growth by 2020 driven by a number of factors 
  Management has invested heavily in the segment  with  5 billion in 2017 and  500 million year to date in 2018  Management believes the market outlook is bright as an aging population  increased urbanization  and growing access to healthcare globally drives market growth
  These investments will go towards 15 20 new product launches in 2018 and 20 25 product launches in 2019
  Robotic surgery  Verb Surgery  commercialization is expected in 2020
Turnaround Plan Encouraging  but Need to See Results
While analysts appear encouraged by the detailed plan put forth by management  the majority seem to be waiting for results to demonstrate traction within the Consumer and Medical Devices segments  As a result  investors will be watching in the coming quarters for signs that their strategy is bearing fruit ",2018-06-26,The Non-Consensus,https://www.investing.com/analysis/johnson-and-johnson-will-pipeline-drugs-offset-sales-erosion-to-upcoming-generics-200327720,200327720

Bradt said the final award could be even lower than  320 million  since the high court has also said punitive damages awards should be closely tied to plaintiffs  injuries rather than as a broader deterrent ",2016-12-07,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/j-amp;j-questions-fairness-of-hip-implant-trial,-$1-billion-verdict-446168",446168
198538,420054,JNJ,JNJ Stock Preparing For A Bullish Breakout,opinion,"Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  stock did not start the year in the best way possible  The share price fell from an all time high of  148 32 on January 17th to as low as  118 62 on May 29th  erasing 20  of the company s market capitalization  Such declines come to remind us that even the best of blue chip stocks do not always rise  On the other hand  price drops often provide a great buying opportunity  Is JNJ stock s plunge a chance to buy the dip or the start of a bigger crash  The chart below looks encouraging 
The hourly chart of Johnson   Johnson allows us to put the recent plunge into Elliott Wave perspective  It looks like JNJ stock has drawn a textbook A B C simple zigzag correction with an ending diagonal in the position of wave C  It is also interesting to notice that wave B is a smaller simple zigzag  labeled  a   b   c   where wave  b  is a triangle 
According to the theory  once a correction is over  the larger trend resumes  In JNJ stock s case  the larger trend is clearly to the upside  so it makes sense to expect more strength from now on towards a new all time high near  150 per share  The proper way to take advantage of the anticipated recovery is to wait for a decisive breach of the upper line of the ending diagonal and then put a stop loss order right below the bottom of wave 5 of C at  118 60  As long as this level holds  the positive outlook remains valid  Given that JNJ stock has already slightly breached the 2 4 line of the diagonal  the situation currently provides an excellent risk reward ratio of 5 6  So to answer the question from the first paragraph  it definitely looks more like a buy the dip opportunity than the beginning of a bear market  The bulls are still alive and kicking

198548,420064,JNJ,AbbVie  ABBV  Up 5 9  Since Earnings Report  Can It Continue ,opinion,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for AbbVie Inc    NYSE ABBV    Shares have added about 5 9  in that time frame 
Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is ABBV due for a pullback  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers AbbVie Tops Q1 Earnings   Revenue Estimates  Ups 2018 GuidanceAbbVie reported better than expected earnings and sales for the first quarter of 2018  Importantly  it raised its earnings expectations for 2018 based on strong Q1 performance and an optimistic outlook for future quarters AbbVie reported first quarter 2018 earnings of  1 87 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 80 by 3 9  and ahead of the guided range of  1 77 and  1 79  Earnings grew 46 1  year over year  Strong sales performance and higher operating profits led to the bottom line beat Revenues of  7 9 billion in the reported quarter marginally beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  7 7 billion  Sales increased 21 4  year over year  Excluding a 3 8  favorable impact from foreign exchange rate fluctuations  operational revenues rose 17 6  backed by continued strong performances by Humira and Imbruvica and solid uptake of new HCV medicine  Mavyret  Operational revenue growth was in line with management expectations of growth in a mid teen range  Currency tailwinds of 3 8  were also better than 3  expected by the company Quarter in DetailsHumira recorded sales growth of 14 4   10 7  on an operational basis  with revenues coming in at  4 7 billion  reflecting continued strong demand trends Sales in the United States increased 11 4  to  3 billion driven by strong prescription volume growth across all three major market categories  Humira sales in the ex U S  market were up 9 3  on an operational basis and 20  on a reported basis to  1 71 billion driven primarily by market growth across indications Humira holds the leading market position as a front line therapy in all three major market categories despite stiffer competition from new classes of drugs as well as an indirect biosimilar competition in the international marketsHowever  on the call  AbbVie said that retail specialty pharmacy destocking hurt sales of Humira somewhat in the quarter In 2018  Humira sales in the United States are expected to be approximately  13 7 billion  which is lower than the prior expectation of  14 0 billion  14 1 billion  Humira U S  sales expectations were softer than the previous outlook due to the impact of a retail specialty pharmacy destocking in the first quarter and a conservative stance on co pay costs associated with co pay accumulator programs Internationally  Humira sales are expected to approach  6 4 billion  up from  6 2 billion previously  which includes the expected impact of biosimilar entrants in Europe in the fourth quarter First quarter net revenues from Imbruvica were  762 million  up 38 5  year over year  This included U S  sales of  624 million  up 36 7   and  138 million  up 47 2   of international profit sharing with Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  Continued uptake in the front line CLL market and steady gains across other indications led to the strong performance of Imbruvica In 2018  Imbruvica global revenues are expected to exceed  3 3 billion with sales in the United States likely to cross  2 7 billion Other products that performed well include Lupron   219 million  up 13 3  year over year  Duodopa   103 million  up 28 9  year over year  and Creon   209 million  up 13   Despite competitive dynamics in the HCV market  AbbVie HCV sales  including Viekira and Mavyret  were  919 million in the quarter  up 80 2  on a sequential basis  Mavyret alone accounted for nearly  850 million in the quarter driven by better than expected launch uptake in the United States and international markets  Mavyret commands a market share of 45  in the United States with less than a year on the market  The medicine has also established a strong position in other major countries as well  such as Japan  Germany  Spain  and Italy  Viekira sales declined in the quarter In 2018  global HCV sales are expected to be approximately  3 5 billion  higher than  2 5 billion expected previously Adjusted gross margin rose 30 bps to 80 2  in the quarter  Adjusted SG A expenses increased 21 4  to  1 67 billion  As a percentage of sales  SG A expenses rose 20 bps to 21 0  in the quarter  reflecting new product launch costs  R D expenses escalated 7 2  to  1 19 billion in the quarter due to greater investments in the pipeline  Adjusted operating margin was 44 1  of sales in the reported quarter  up 200 bps year over year 2018 OutlookAbbVie raised its adjusted EPS guidance to a range of  7 66  7 76 for 2018 compared with  7 33  7 43 predicted earlier  A strong first quarter performance coupled with an optimistic outlook for stronger underlying business performance through the rest of the year and the benefit from the planned share buybacks through the  Dutch  tender offer propelled the increase in earnings guidance  The earnings guidance reflects a year over year surge of 38  at the mid point versus 32  previously Revenues are expected to approach  32 6 billion  up from the previous expectation of  32 billion  Currency impact is expected to benefit revenues by 2  in 2018 compared with 1 5  expected previously While R D expense is expected to be slightly more than 16  of revised sales outlook  SG A is expected to be about 20 5  of sales  Operating margin is expected to be above 43 5   roughly 100 basis points above 2017 levels  Previously  AbbVie expected operating margin to be approximately 44  of sales  AbbVie decreased the projected 2018 operating margin expectations as it plans to increase investments in upcoming product launches Adjusted tax rate is expected to be approximately 9  in 2018  The normalized tax rate expectation over the next five years is 13  Second Quarter 2018 OutlookSecond quarter earnings are expected between  1 94 and  1 96  Revenues are estimated to grow approximately 15  on an operational basis  Foreign exchange is expected to have approximately 3  favorable impact on sales in the second quarter U S  Humira sales are expected to grow at approximately 10  year over year  Internationally  sales are expected to be approximately  1 6 billion

198555,420071,JNJ,What Can I Expect to Make If I Invest In Johnson   Johnson Today  ,opinion,"Overview
AAA rated Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  has produced one of the most impeccable and consistent long term records of fundamental results and growth  No matter whether you are measuring earnings  cash flows or dividends  you will be hard pressed to find any company in any industry with a more consistent and complete record of operating excellence than Johnson   Johnson 
Consequently  in the minds of many investors  Johnson   Johnson is considered a forever stock  Personally  I can t disagree  However  even with forever stocks there are good and bad times to initiate an investment  For much of 2016 and most of 2017  Johnson   Johnson was a little pricey  However  in 2018 Johnson   Johnson s stock price has been steadily moving towards alignment with intrinsic value  Although I still don t consider it a screaming bargain  I do consider it a reasonable choice given its quality and above market dividend yield 
Johnson   Johnson  FAST Graphs Analyze out Loud Video

Organically  excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures  sales increased 7 5  on an operational basis  slightly less than 7 6  growth seen in the previous quarter  The strong performance was led by the company s oncology portfolio Imbruvica sales rose 43 5  to  587 million in the quarter driven largely by higher market share across all lines of therapy and market growth in the Unites

million  less than  610 million in the previous quarter  Strong demand for Uptravi and Opsumit was partially offset by the expected decline of Tracleer outside the United States due to generic

198557,420073,JNJ,Weighing The Week Ahead  Will Higher Interest Rates Lead To Lower Stock Prices   ,opinion,"The economic calendar is light  and the market week will be shortened  There is no holiday this week  but expect many participants to take off early for a long weekend  If interest remain above 3  on the ten year note  that will be the focus  Pundits will be asking 
Will higher interest rates lead to lower stock prices  
Last Week Recap
In my  I suggested that the week lacked a dominant theme  That part was right  I took the occasion to discuss which stocks might benefit from Trump policy changes  While few pundits took up the topic  it was still a useful exercise for me  and I hope for my readers as well 
The Story in One Chart
I always start my personal review of the week by looking at a great chart  I especially like the version  She includes a lot of valuable information in a single visual  The full post has even more charts and analysis  including commentary on volume  Check it out 


The market declined about 0 6  with a trading range of only 1 5   This is the quietest week we have seen in a long time  I summarize actual and implied volatility each week in our Indicator Snapshot section below  As you can see  volatility has been moving lower  and is back into the long term range 
Personal Note
Mrs  OldProf and I will be enjoying an extended holiday next weekend  so there will not be the regular WTWA installment  I ll try to update indicators if possible  She is in withdrawal in the absence of football of any sort  She was watching some wedding on TV when I asked her for a comment 
Thanks to the Intelligent Economist for once again including me among the   Most readers know that my labor of love is fueled by the knowledge that people find the work useful 
Noteworthy

From the   where you can also see prior years for comparison 



And  some updated information on debt from the NY Fed     The report also has information about various types of debt levels over time along with related credit scores 

The News
Each week I break down events into good and bad  For our purposes   good  has two components  The news must be market friendly and better than expectations  I avoid using my personal preferences in evaluating news   and you should  too  
Feel free to add items that I have missed  Please keep in mind that we are looking for current news  especially from the last week or so  WTWA is not about long term concerns like debt  These are important  of course  but not our weekly subject unless there has been some major change 
The overall picture remains positive  Economic strength is reasonable  and inflation is low   analysis of high frequency indicators shows some deterioration but retains the overall outlook 

Both the nowcast remains and the short term forecast remain positive 


The long term forecast has deteriorated further  with interest rates and money supply now both generally negative  Only the continued strength in housing and credit are keeping me from switching this from positive to neutral or even negative 

The Good 

The rail traffic growth cycle continues  Steven Hansen    does the best deep dive into this series  using his  intuitive sector  approach  rolling averages  and year over year comparisons  Here is just one of his summary tables and charts 



Industrial production increased 0 7  in April slightly beating expectations and matching the upwardly revised report from March  See  for charts and analysis 
Initial jobless claims while rising somewhat to 222K  continued lower on the less noisy four week moving average   observes   With this week s reading of 222K  the four week moving average dropped to 213 25K  That s a new low for the cycle  the century  and all the way back to December 1969  




Leading indicators matched expectations of 0 4  and the upwardly revised 0 4  from March    



Port traffic improves on both imports and exports  Steven Hansen s    analysis suggests that the implications are stronger for global economic growth than for the U S 
Improvement in the US China trade talks   reports that China has dropped sanctions against U S  sorghum  China is the largest destination for U S  sorghum exports  It remains difficult to get an accurate read on the progress 
NAHB index registered 70  a slight gain over April and beating expectations of 69    


The Bad 

Oil and gasoline prices move higher  The  quotes Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS  estimates that gasoline at  2 96 would take an annualized  38 billion from spending elsewhere  That is about a third of the additional take home pay from the tax cuts 



Housing starts declined to a SAAR of 1287K  down 3 7  and missing expectations of 1325K  Building permits were in line with expectations   provides analysis and charts  Bill also notes the volatility in multi family and the continuing  wide bottom  in single family starts  This long standing prediction has been quite accurate 
Mortgage rates reached a seven year high    

The Ugly 
Santa Fe  Texas  I understand that more people die from other causes  including terrorism around the world  These high school massacres are different  Senseless  Innocent young people  A familiar environment that we all expect to be safe 
The Week Ahead 
We would all like to know the direction of the market in advance  Good luck with that  Second best is planning what to look for and how to react 
The Calendar 
The economic calendar is light  Home sales data are most important  and many will pay careful attention to the FOMC minutes  Many participants will be taking off early to extend their holiday weekend 
 has a good U S  economic calendar for the week  and many other good features which I monitor each day   Here are the main U S  releases 

Next Week s Theme 
Without much news and a quiet week on tap  it is an open field for the punditry  Home sales and the FOMC minutes will get some attention  If interest rates do not move any lower I expect many to be asking 
Do higher interest rates imply lower stock prices  
There are a few clear cut positions 

Interest rates have broken to new levels and may move much higher   covers this angle 



Don t fight the Fed 
Interest rates will lead to a  and lower earnings 
Three steps and a stumble 
It is just a return to normalcy

The Indicator Snapshot 
 
Short term trading conditions improved dramatically  Despite the recent borderline ratings suggesting  bad weather  it was not quite enough to take us out of the market  A strength of our modeling approach  Thanks  Vince   is a touch more patience than shown by many technical systems  This has a mild cost  and can reap great rewards  as it has in the last few weeks 
A notable feature of the chart is that we recently increased the nine month recession odds to a chance of 25   While this is significantly higher than it has been during the long stock rally  it does not yet represent a real threat  Instead of thinking of the odds as higher than before  we must keep in mind the continuing evidence that a near term recession is unlikely  The odds are only slightly higher than the long term average 
That said  we watch this quite closely and plan to reduce position sizes if the risk grows much larger

Insight for Investors

Best of the Week 
If I had to pick a single most important source for investors to read this week it would be  of the current investment landscape  To get the setting  please consider some facts from this week s  about Jack Bogle  The story covers a lot of interesting and controversial ground  but I was drawn to this factual statement 

Bogle fears that ETFs are purely speculative  encouraging selling at the bottom and buying at the top  Bogle shared his analysis of dollar weighted investor returns  which accounts for money flows  with Barron s  The research shows that from 2005 to 2017  the average investor return from  Traditional Index Funds  was 8 4   For actively managed funds  it was 7 2   For ETFs  it was 5 5   even worse than actively managed funds  That contains the seeds of the category s demise   How long are investors going to be happy with that  Sure if you double your money  why would you complain  But you could have tripled it  I am glad we continue to be primarily on the TIF horse  and not the ETF horse   He also foresees that growth in ETFs will slow because  an awful lot of  market  niches have been populated   Next up   a lot of ETFs will go out of business along the way  

The key takeaway is that individual investors do worse than they would by merely holding some asset  How could this happen 
I cannot do justice to Lloyd s article with one quote  but here is a taste 

The media driven issue of the day is virtually always misleading  Ignore all of them  If you insist on watching CNBC  be sure to leave the sound off  Leave it off unless you actually know the person is worth listening to  Of course that usually requires years of experience   not just your emotional preferences  Leave the latter to your evening cable show watching  And leave it entirely out of your investment decision making 


There is no euphoria or even complacency in the U S  equity market today  Rather  it is clear to me that investors are scared  The VIX doesn t tell you what you might think it does  If it explodes over 40  it is worth looking at in conjunction with other psychological indicators  Recent public interpretations of it are preposterous  Bond funds have drawn ridiculous sums from individual investors  The Wall of Worry is huge 

As one who watches financial television with TIVO and mute  and who knows the players  I fully understand this description

198562,420078,JNJ,J J warns diabetic patients  Insulin pump vulnerable to hacking,news,"By Jim Finkle  Reuters    Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  is telling patients that it has learned of a security vulnerability in one of its insulin pumps that a hacker could exploit to overdose diabetic patients with insulin  though it describes the risk as low  Medical device experts said they believe it was the first time a manufacturer had issued such a warning to patients about a cyber vulnerability  a hot topic in the industry following revelations last month about possible bugs in pacemakers and defibrillators  J J executives told Reuters they knew of no examples of attempted hacking attacks on the device  the J J Animas OneTouch Ping insulin pump  The company is nonetheless warning customers and providing advice on how to fix the problem    The probability of unauthorized access to the OneTouch Ping system is extremely low   the company said in letters sent on Monday to doctors and about 114 000 patients who use the device in the United States and Canada   It would require technical expertise  sophisticated equipment and proximity to the pump  as the OneTouch Ping system is not connected to the internet or to any external network    A copy of the text of the letter was made available to Reuters  Insulin pumps are medical devices that patients attach to their bodies that injects insulin through catheters   The Animas OneTouch Ping  which was launched in 2008  is sold with a wireless remote control that patients can use to order the pump to dose insulin so that they do not need access to the device itself  which is typically worn under clothing and can be awkward to reach   Jay Radcliffe  a diabetic and researcher with cyber security firm Rapid7 Inc  said he had identified ways for a hacker to spoof communications between the remote control and the OneTouch Ping insulin pump  potentially forcing it to deliver unauthorized insulin injections   The system is vulnerable because those communications are not encrypted  or scrambled  to prevent hackers from gaining access to the device  said Radcliffe  who reported vulnerabilities in the pump to J J in April and published them on the Rapid7 blog on Tuesday   J J executives said they worked on the security issues with Radcliffe  Dosing a patient with too much insulin could cause hypoglycemia  or low blood sugar  which in extreme cases can be life threatening  said Brian Levy  chief medical officer with J J s diabetes unit  Company technicians were able to replicate Radcliffe s findings  confirming that a hacker could order the pump to dose insulin from a distance of up to 25 feet  Levy said  He said such attacks are difficult to pull off because they require specialized technical expertise and sophisticated equipment    We believe the OneTouch Ping system is safe and reliable  We urge patients to stay on the product   Levy said   J J s letter said that if patients were concerned  they could take several steps to thwart potential attacks  They include discontinuing use of a wireless remote control and programming the pump to limit the maximum insulin dose  Radcliffe said he believed that OneTouch Ping users would be safe if they followed the steps outlined in the letters from J J   They can give peace of mind to the patient or parent of a child using the device   he said  FDA GUIDANCE ON MEDICAL DEVICES In August  a prominent short seller and a cyber security research firm went public with allegations of potentially life threatening cyber vulnerabilities in heart devices from St  Jude Medical Inc   As its shares tumbled  St  Jude said the allegations were false  and the U S  Food and Drug Administration began an investigation  J J said before it sent out the letters  it reviewed the matter with the FDA  which is preparing to issue formal guidance on how medical device makers should handle reports about cyber vulnerabilities   An early draft of that guidance  which was released in January for public comments  called for device makers to work with security researchers  identify steps to mitigate risks  and provide patients with information about bugs so they can  make informed decisions  about device use   The FDA on Tuesday praised J J and Rapid7 for their work in discovering  finding ways to mitigate and disclosing the vulnerability   This is the proactive behavior the FDA has been looking to see from the medical device manufacturer and research community and demonstrates the collaborative manner in which vulnerabilities can be addressed in a way that best protects patients   the agency said in a statement  J J Chief Information Security Officer Marene Allison said her team would make sure other J J products do not have similar bugs  Radcliffe said he found vulnerabilities in the Animas OneTouch Ping  but not the Animas Vibe line of insulin pumps  The FDA has said it knows of no cases where hackers have exploited cyber vulnerabilities to harm a patient

198580,420096,JNJ,New incentives needed to develop antibiotics to fight superbugs,news,"By Bill Berkrot
NEW YORK  Reuters    Drugmakers are renewing efforts to develop medicines to fight emerging antibiotic resistant bacteria  but creating new classes of drugs on the scale needed is unlikely to happen without new financial incentives to make the effort worth the investment  companies and industry experts said 
American military researchers on Thursday announced the first U S  case of a patient with an infection found to be resistant to the antibiotic colistin  the drug often held in reserve for when all else fails 
That put a spotlight on the urgent need for new medicines that can combat what health officials have called  nightmare bacteria  
Drugmakers on Friday acknowledged that in the absence of a new way of compensating them  it simply does not make economic sense to pour serious resources into work on new antibiotics 
 The return on investment based on the current commercial model is not really commensurate with the amount of effort you have to put into it   said David Payne  who heads GlaxoSmithKline PLC s  L GSK  antibiotics drug group 
Other pharmaceutical companies expressed a similar sentiment 
In January  some 80 drugmakers and diagnostics companies  including  Pfizer  Inc  N PFE   Merck   Co  N MRK   Johnson   Johnson  N JNJ  and Glaxo  signed a declaration calling for cooperation among governments and companies to create incentives to revitalize research and development of new antibiotics 
It proposed a new business model in which profit would not be linked to higher sales  For example  governments and health organizations could offer lump sum rewards for development of a successful new antibiotic  A British government panel suggested this month that drug companies be offered up to  1 5 billion for successful development of a new antibiotic 
In the United States alone  antibiotic resistant bacteria causes 2 million serious infections and 23 000 deaths annually  according to U S  health officials 
Unrestrained overuse of current antibiotics by doctors and hospitals  often when they are not needed  and widespread antibiotic use in food livestock have contributed to the evolution of antibiotic resistant bacteria 
But in recent years  major drugmakers have poured most of their research dollars into highly profitable medicines to fight cancer  rare diseases and hepatitis C  These drugs not only command high prices  they also are typically used far longer than antibiotics 
And the companies  which have come under intense criticism in recent months for continually raising prices on popular drugs  say it costs about as much to develop a new antibiotic as it does to bring to market new cancer drugs that can command more than  100 000 a year per patient 
 Drug companies can t make an economic case for investing in superbug drugs   said Erik Gordon  a professor at the University of Michigan s Ross School of Business 
Gordon said governments and foundations need to get more involved in research and funding to spearhead efforts to combat the problem 
To critics who argue that U S  companies have enormous cash reserves that could be used to address a public health crisis  drugmakers say they have a fiduciary duty to shareholders to maximize profits 
ON THE R D FRONT LINES
One reason companies are calling for alternative compensation is that aggressive sales and use of new antibiotics could help create ever more dangerous bacteria that develop resistance to the new medicines 
Glaxo and Merck are among the large pharmaceutical companies developing new antibiotics they hope can beat back resistant bugs  while Pfizer is working on vaccines aimed at reducing the need for their use 
Industry experts said small  lesser known companies with promising approaches to tackling resistant superbugs included  Entasis Therapeutics  an AstraZeneca PLC spinoff   Tetraphase Pharmaceuticals Inc   O TTPH   and  Achaogen Inc   O AKAO  
 We believe plazomicin  our lead drug in late stage development  has the potential to play an important role in treating this dreaded superbug   Achaogen Chief Executive Kenneth Hillan said 
Allan Coukell  an antibiotics expert at the Pew Charitable Trusts nonprofit research and policy organization  said what is needed is a wave of new drugs based on new chemistry or that work in new ways 
 Most of what s being developed are variations on drugs that we ve had for decades   Coukell said 
Pew has outlined what its calls a scientific roadmap to create a body of work around new drug discovery that companies and academic researchers could draw upon to help jumpstart the process of finding new antibiotics 
Glaxo said its experimental antibiotic gepotidacin  in midstage testing  belongs to an entirely new class of antibacterials 
 Based on that  we re predicting it would work against infections that could be caused by bacteria that are resistant to available antibiotics   Payne said 
Other companies with late stage studies underway for antibiotics include   Cempra Inc   O CEMP   whose drug was recently validated in a Japanese trial  Medicines Co  O MDCO   and Paratek Pharmaceuticals Inc  O PRTK   J J is also putting money into battling antibiotic resistance

198583,420099,JNJ,Industry weighs radical shake up of European drug pricing,news,"By Ben Hirschler
LONDON  Reuters    The pharmaceutical industry is considering a radical shift in the way it prices drugs in Europe so companies are rewarded for the clinical benefit of treatments rather than the number of pills sold  according to an internal report 
The high price of drugs is straining Europe s cash strapped health systems and depriving some patients of the latest products  to the concern of manufacturers who argue they can save costs in the long run by keeping people out of hospital 
As a result  companies are looking at a fundamentally different way of getting paid for their innovations  according to the internal report  a copy of which was seen by Reuters 
Its proposed  roadmap for change toward outcomes based reward systems  will be discussed by the board of the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations  Efpia  on June 16  which groups the world s top drugmakers and national trade associations 
The report is the clearest sign yet that the drug industry is ready to negotiate a new pricing framework with governments and insurers 
 This is not without risk   according to the paper by Efpia s director of market access Francois Bouvy   If a product does not deliver on its clinical promise  society should not continue to pay for it  Equally  if the product delivers more value than was ever expected  this extra value must be rewarded  
Officials at Efpia declined to comment on the internal report because of its confidential nature 
TOO EXPENSIVE
The concept of drug pricing based on clinical results has been gaining ground for some years and has the support of several leading industry figures  including Novartis Chief Executive Joe Jimenez  the current president of Efpia 
Europe already has some ad hoc results based pricing agreements 
Britain  for example  agreed a deal with Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  a decade ago whereby the health service only pays for multiple myeloma drug Velcade in patients who respond after four treatment cycles  Italy uses patient registries to pay for new cancer drugs based on actual patient response 
But the Efpia proposals go further by suggesting the wholesale adoption of the new approach 
The report said  affordability is a major issue for healthcare systems across Europe  and the need for a better system would only grow with the rollout of hard to price cancer drug combinations  new antibiotics and stem cell therapies 
Drug pricing is a hot topic worldwide  as advances in medical science come at an increasingly high cost 
A study of cancer drug prices in seven countries released on Monday highlighted cost obstacles in many markets and a report last month into antibiotic resistance also called for a rethink of market mechanisms 
There are likely to be plenty of battles ahead  especially as the industry is looking for a trade off in the form of relief from market mechanisms that weigh on drug prices in Europe 
In particular  the Efpia paper says external reference pricing  which allows governments to refer to prices in other countries when determining what they will pay   should be removed as new systems evolve  
The industry also wants an end to tenders for patented medicines and curbs on parallel trade  under which wholesalers buy drugs in low cost European markets and sell them for higher prices elsewhere ",2016-06-09,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/industry-weighs-radical-shake-up-of-european-drug-pricing-407411,407411

frontrunner Donald Trump and other candidates  the next president will find it hard to raise manufacturing s share of a U S  labor force that keeps shifting toward services  While much of the jobs debate has centered on trade pacts that Democrats and Republicans have backed over the last quarter century  both successful and struggling companies and sectors offer evidence of long term trends that neither sharp trade negotiators nor aggressive political leaders can easily reverse  Even critics of trade deals acknowledge that labor intensive industries  such as textiles  which once employed hundreds of thousands of less skilled workers  are probably gone for good  Technology continues to diminish the share of labor in production and its spread around the world has made other nations   notably China  but also Korea  Brazil  Mexico and former Soviet bloc countries   competitive both as exporters and in their own markets  Investment worldwide is drifting steadily toward services  according to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  and Americans are spending relatively less of their income on manufactured goods   A Reuters analysis of federal data for 1 267 categories of goods shows that the United States has been running a trade deficit in more than 500 of them since at least 1992   before the North American Free Trade Agreement came into force or China joined the World Trade Organization  events often cited as turning points for U S  manufacturing  Since the 2007 2009 recession manufacturing has added about 800 000 jobs  but that has lagged overall job growth  As a result manufacturing s share of private employment has continued to fall  from about 11 percent since the recession ended   The move toward a more global market hurts the marginal  low skilled worker  but it was inevitable and you cannot roll it back   said Brookings Institution senior fellow Barry Bosworth  At CareerSource Northeast Florida  a job development group  President Bruce Ferguson  Jr  said by necessity he focused on finding a  path  for entry level service sector employees to move up a career ladder  because services are where the growth is    The raw  manufacturing  numbers don t look anything like the service sector and they never will   he said   VOTER ANGST AND PROMISES  A majority of 6 500 Americans surveyed in March as part of Reuters Ipsos 2016 campaign polling acknowledged that free trade brings lower prices  but also saw it as a drag on wages and jobs and an  important  issue for the next president to confront  Tapping such concerns  Trump has promised punitive tariffs to  bring back  jobs for those left behind in the current recovery  particularly the roughly two thirds of Americans without a college degree   Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton switched gears as a candidate to oppose a major Pacific trade deal and promises billions in public support for manufacturing  Her Democratic rival Bernie Sanders calls for worker protection against what he considers unfair trade  while Republican Ted Cruz has focused on trimming government red tape  However  playing tough on trade carries some risks and there are limits to what trade talks and tariffs can accomplish  The U S  steel industry is a case in point  The American Iron and Steel Institute estimates around 12 000 jobs were lost to a recent jump in imports  mainly from China  It reckons those jobs could be recovered with steps  such as the anti dumping duties imposed by Washington late last year  That pales  however  in comparison with more than 200 000 jobs that the sector has lost since the early 1980s  some because of imports  but some because the amount of labor needed to produce a ton of steel has fallen from 10 hours to less than two    There has been a short term loss that is definitely attributable to imports  while a longer term trend reflects technological innovation   said Kevin Dempsey  the institute s senior vice president   Such dynamic is not limited to old industries like steel  Florida is home to successful manufacturers big and small in a wide range of sectors  which export nearly half of their output   double the national average  Yet  as is the case nationally  the share of jobs available to those with a high school degree has been shrinking since 2000  according to federal data  and wages have been stagnant  Johnson   Johnson Vision Care s recent approval of a  300 million expansion  which added some 100 jobs  cements the company s U S  presence  but also shows how technology and innovation reshape the landscape  The company s local workforce has risen to around 1 700  but about 60 percent of that are white collar and non manufacturing jobs   from research positions for PhD scientists to those in sales and a highly automated shipping operation  Florida development officials say the trend is clear  manufacturers keep cutting the labor content of their products and each round of investment tends to drive up the skill levels that workers need  That may benefit the state s economy  but acts as a reality check for workers who hope that the November 8 presidential vote can reverse decades old trends  
 How do you evaluate a company that says we will spend a lot of money and make the workforce more qualified but not create many jobs   said Aaron Bowman  senior vice president for business development at JAXUSA Partnership  a regional economic development agency and division of the local chamber of commerce   Over time you see more projects that bring in fewer jobs but a bigger bang  ",2016-04-14,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/trump's-jobs-homecoming-a-long-shot-even-in-manufacturing-hot-spots-395369,395369

198597,420113,JNJ,Mexico explores regulating opium to fight drug violence,news,"By Gabriel Stargardter MEXICO CITY  Reuters    Mexico s government has explored regulating poppy production to make pharmaceutical opiates like morphine in an effort to weaken heroin smuggling gangs  according to two sources with knowledge of the government s thinking   Amid a government review of drugs policy  Interior Minister Miguel Angel Osorio Chong asked policy experts late last year whether Mexico could win authorization from the International Narcotics Control Board  INCB   a United Nations body  to grow and export opium poppies for painkillers   It s a legitimate question   said one of the sources with direct knowledge of the talks  who was not authorized to speak publicly   States have to ask themselves questions and have to discuss their policies   It is not clear how seriously the government is considering the regulation of poppy production and it has not yet approached the INCB directly but the discussion illustrates how concerned it is about heroin related violence  Mexico s interior ministry did not respond to a request for comment  On Thursday  Pena Nieto proposed legalizing marijuana based medicines  substantially raising the amount of pot that users can carry and freeing inmates on minor marijuana charges  With its shift  Mexico has joined a growing group of Latin American countries openly questioning the prohibitionist policies at the heart of the war on drugs   The terms of the drugs debate are changing in Mexico and the rest of the world   Pena Nieto said   Pena Nieto made no mention of poppy regulation on Thursday  but in a speech on drugs at the U N  General Assembly this week he said   we should create productive alternatives in those areas where drugs are grown    A heroin epidemic has killed tens of thousands of people in the United States in recent years and led to a surge in demand for Mexican heroin   Regulating poppy production would in theory make it more difficult for Mexico s drug gangs to produce heroin  although some drug experts say Mexico s unique mix of extreme gang violence and weak institutions render the idea a non starter   More than 100 000 people have died in drug related violence in Mexico in the last decade  Last month  Mexican news magazine Proceso reported on a government study examining the legalization of opium for medicinal uses as a way to lower violence  The governor of the southwestern state of Guerrero  which has been ravaged by drug violence  has also floated the idea  Click here for a graphic on opium poppy cultivation and murder rates in Mexico   Stefano Berterame  the INCB chief  said Mexico has not made contact over authorizing its opium crop for export  a prerequisite for major pharmaceutical buyers like Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ   He said the INCB would likely refuse any request because there is a global surplus of pharmaceutical opiates  resulting in low prices  The INCB frowns on opiate gluts because they can easily be diverted into the illegal market   Mexico could proceed without the INCB s blessing  as Portugal has previously done  to produce painkillers for its domestic market but it would struggle to offer poppy growers higher prices for their crop than those offered by drug cartels  Peter Reuter  a drugs expert at the University of Maryland  said regulation would provide farmers with two markets  one legal and the other illegal  encouraging them to grow even more  There is one precedent that could support the idea  Under pressure from the United States  Turkey managed to destroy its illegal poppy trade in the 1970s by regulating production to make opium based medicines   Turkey is indeed the poster child for this kind of policy   said Reuter   It was a major producer for the illegal market and then converted entirely to the legal market

   wo months ago  we detailed what the current Fed Chair  then a mere mortal  Jay Powell said during the October 23 24  2012 FOMC meeting   just one month after the Fed announced QE3  as exposed by recently released FOMC transcripts 

  W hen it is time for us to sell  or even to stop buying  the response could be quite strong  there is every reason to expect a strong response  So there are a couple of ways to look at it  It is about  1 2 trillion in sales  you take 60 months  you get about  20 billion a month  That is a very doable thing  it sounds like  in a market where the norm by the middle of next year is  80 billion a month  Another way to look at it  though  is that it s not so much the sale  the duration  it s also unloading our short volatility position 

SPX also makes a weekly key reversal

NDX also has a volatile week 

The NDXalso had a wide ranging week  but did not close beneath the prior week low  However  the test of the upper trendline of the two year channel failed This implies a retest of the February 9 low The Fractal Model also suggests that Long term support at 6280 96 may be tested again  
   As the recent swoon in the S P showed  the lasting pain from the February vol unwind has combined with multiple policy shocks to weigh on markets 
However  while the early Feb swoon was largely the result of the  Quant Quake   the transmission mechanism in this move lower is no longer systematic funds   vol target strategies  according to Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS  s Chris Metli  Instead  the MS executive director notes that this time selling has come from more fundamental discretionary investors   the MS PB Content team has noted that there were multiple large sell days from L S HFs this week  versus buying the week of Feb 5th     exacerbated by a lack of liquidity 
Here the lack of liquidity is important

The High Yield Bond Index rallied to Intermediate term resistance at 193 35  then sold off to the trendline at 184 00 The sell signal remains and the Cycles Model suggests that Long term support at 181 05 may be broken this week 
   There s something funny in the high yield bond market  and even Martin Fridson isn t quite sure what it means though he does believe the junk bond market has enjoyed a false tranquility for the past 30 years

The Euro Stoxx 50 Indexmade a key reversal by rallying to a new weekly high  then declining and closing beneath the prior weekly low  European stocks remain on a sell signal The Cycles Model suggests the decline may continue through the third week of March 
   A global stock market slide triggered by President Trump s tariff announcements on Thursday has spread into Europe on Friday morning  with all the continent s major bourses dropping substantially after the president said that  trade wars are good 

 When a country  USA  is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with  trade wars are good  and easy to win  Example  when we are down  100 billion with a certain country and they get cute  don t trade anymore we win big  It s easy    he tweeted 

On Thursday  Trump promised new tariffs   taxes on imports   of 25  for steel and 10  for aluminum  The president did not specify whether any countries would be exempt  but the restrictions are expected to be wide ranging 
The Yen breaks through the neckline 

The Yen broke broke through the Head   Shoulders neckline  activating that chart formation This solidifies the rising trend through early to mid March  During that time  the Cycle Top resistance may be challenged 
   President Donald Trump is touting the virtues of a trade war  In the  5 1 trillion a day currency market  the yen has emerged as a clear winner from the escalating rhetoric 
The latest move pushes forward the administration s trade agenda  after it took similar actions on other goods this year and jawboned the dollar lower  The potential hit to U S  and global growth from protectionism has sent stocks lower  initially drove bonds higher and buoyed the yen  Investors and strategists are wagering there s more of the same to come 
The unfolding events remind Chris Turner  global head of currency strategy at IING Groep NV  of the early 1990s when the U S  took protectionist steps against Japan 
Nikkei makes a weekly key reversal 

The Nikkei made a weekly Key Reversal by testing Short and Intermediate term resistance at 22695 57  then dropping to test Long term support at 21192 88 Cyclical strength appears to have disappeared with a major low may be due in the next week or two  The two year trendline at 21750 00 has been violated and may be retested as the next decline is launched 
   The Nikkei 225 Stock Average s so called death cross    when the 25 day moving average drops below the 75 day moving average    suggests that the market s rebound from its 10 percent correction isn t going to extend  according to Toshio Sumitani  chief market analyst at Tokai Tokyo Research Institute Co  in Tokyo   The death cross is a bad signal for Japanese stocks   indicating that investors may be ready to sell at lower levels following any rebound  he said 
U S  Dollar falters

USDfaltered after rising above trendline and Cycle Bottom support at 89 29 TheCycles Model indicates a probable week of strength left in this rally  This suggests that the Broadening Top  Point 7  target near the weekly mid Cycle resistance at 96 11 may be in question 
     The U S  dollar could face headwinds if President Donald Trump s proposals to impose stiff tariffs on steel and aluminium imports are enacted  with the biggest risk stemming from the possible flight of capital flows needed to finance ballooning U S  deficits 
Currency markets  in general  dislike any form of trade intervention and previous protectionist efforts by the U S  government have resulted in dollar weakness 

 The U S  is now in a very precarious position because it s putting a risk premium on U S  assets by introducing tariffs and going down this protectionist route  which is negative for growth   said Mark McCormick  head of North American FX strategy at TD Securities in Toronto 

 Gold bounces on Intermediate term support 

Gold bounced on Intermediate term support at 1308 21 this week  The bounce may extend for another week  according to the Cycles Model However  the upside may be limited  while a larger decline appears to be waiting soon after 
 Reuters    Rising inflation has put gold back on the radar for investors looking to protect themselves from emerging price pressures  but history suggests its reputation has been overstated 
The experience of the last 50 years suggests gold performs better as a hedge against inflation shocks   like the spike caused by surging oil prices in the late 1970s and early 1980s   than the widely anticipated grind higher currently seen 

 If you strip out the 1970s  you find the relationship between gold and inflation is quite weak   Brian Lucey  professor of international finance at Trinity College Dublin  said  That is because you have a very different inflation regime in the late 1980s and 1990s than you had in the 1970s  

Crude rebuffed at Cycle Top resistance 

Crudechallenged its Broadening Wedge trendline and Cycle Top resistance at 63 81but was pushed back to Intermediate term support at 60 62 The Cycles Model suggests some volatile swings in crude over the next week  A break of the Intermediate term support  however  gives crude a sell signal 
   U S  oil production surged to an all time high in November  topping the previous record set nearly half a century ago  government data showed on Wednesday 
The nation s drillers pumped 10 057 million barrels a day in November  the U S  Energy Information Administration said in a monthly report  That edges out the previous record of 10 044 million barrels a day set in November 1970 
The record setting output comes after a revision to last month s report showing November s output leaped to 10 038 million barrels a day 
Shanghai Composite may have broken critical supports 

The Shanghai Index rallied Short and Intermediate term resistance at 3344 3355 70  but was rejected It has since declined beneath Long term support at 3286 53 and the two year trendline as well This may set up the Shanghai to retest the February low and possibly the Cycle Bottom at 2798 18 in the coming weeks ",2018-03-04,Anthony M.

198602,420118,JNJ,Big verdict doesn t assure more wins for plaintiffs in talc cancer cases,news,By Jessica Dye NEW YORK  Reuters    The  72 million verdict this week against Johnson   Johnson  N JNJ  in a U S  case alleging links between talc based powder and ovarian cancer has prompted global headlines  social media buzz and calls to lawyers from would be plaintiffs  But the attention grabbing judgment is no guarantee future plaintiffs will be able to convince juries the company s products caused their illnesses  About 1 200 similar cases are pending  primarily in Missouri and New Jersey state courts  but the facts are different in every one  And even in cases with similar evidence and expert testimony  juries in mass personal injury litigation can come to different conclusions   While the survivors of Jacqueline Fox were awarded  72 million by a St  Louis jury Monday  jurors in a federal court action in South Dakota   the only other talc case to go to trial   found in 2013 that J J had been negligent but declined to award damages to plaintiff Deane Berg  Like Fox  Berg alleged her ovarian cancer was caused by her decades long use of J J s talc powder products for feminine hygiene  and jurors in both cases heard testimony about studies linking talc to cancer risks   But  unlike Fox  who passed away several months before the trial began  Berg was in remission at the time of the trial  according to court documents  In addition to factual differences among cases  venue can affect outcomes  Some state courts are considered more plaintiff friendly than federal courts  which have stricter rules for the admission of evidence and expert testimony  said lawyers involved in the litigation   One juror in the Missouri case  Jerome Kendrick  said in an interview with Reuters that he and other jurors were especially swayed by testimony from plaintiffs  medical experts and documents showing J J employees discussing talc powder s possible cancer risk    The problem I had is that  according to inter office documents  J J was aware of the potential concerns   Kendrick said   And it really looked like instead of trying to investigate  they started talking about how to combat what would eventually be a court case   J J has said that  decades of sound science  prove that talc is safe  The company on Tuesday issued a statement expressing sympathy for Fox s family but disagreeing with the verdict  It also said it is exploring its post trial options   UNDER THE RADAR Talc litigation got its start in 2009  when Berg filed her lawsuit  The Fox lawsuit was selected by plaintiffs  lawyers as the first to go to trial in Missouri  to serve as an early bellwether of how similar cases in that venue might fare  The litigation flew largely under the public s radar until jurors returned the award for the family of Fox  who died in October at 62  The plaintiffs said Fox used J J Baby Powder and Shower to Shower Powder for feminine hygiene daily for 35 years before she was diagnosed three years ago with ovarian cancer   It has resonated with the public far more than the Berg case  which  didn t get headlines because they didn t award any damages   said R  Allen Smith  a Missouri based lawyer who represented both the Fox family and Berg   More cases may be filed soon  and lawyers at several plaintiffs  firms who worked on the Fox case said they are investigating thousands of additional claims   Still  the talc cases represent a relatively small portion of the tens of thousands of lawsuits J J is facing over its many products  For instance  it is the target of more than 44 000 cases from women who say they were harmed by pelvic mesh devices made by its Ethicon unit  and more than 8 000 against its DePuy subsidiary regarding Pinnacle metal on metal hip systems   The next J J talc trial is set for April in St  Louis  and additional trial dates have been set for later this year   To be successful  plaintiffs must make both a general link between talc and ovarian cancer and show that J J s products   as opposed to something else   are to blame for their cancer   In spite of the increased interest in the litigation following the Fox verdict  attorney Danielle Mason of Beasley Allen  who was part of the team representing the Fox family at trial  said she expected J J to fight hard to defend itself in upcoming trials   We re in this for the long haul   she said ,2016-02-25,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/big-verdict-doesn't-assure-more-wins-for-plaintiffs-in-talc-cancer-cases-386611,386611

198608,420124,JNJ,Old Economy  Buy And Hold Dividend Stock Perfect For This Downturn,opinion,"As the volatility in the markets increases and investors re price their risks  one proven strategy to survive in this environment is to focus on companies which have time tested products and services  Stock prices of these old economy companies are sure to bounce back once the dust has settled and normal trading patterns resume 
If you re a long term income investor with plenty of dry powder on the sideline and were looking for better entry points  this market pullback is a great news  Lower stock prices of some top quality dividend stocks mean their yields have become more attractive  Keeping this theme in mind  I m recommending Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ   In this ongoing volatile trading  investors have seen J J s share value decline despite the fact that its business is growing and it s not facing any major threats to its future profitability 

Here s why this pharma behemoth might be a good pick for your portfolio 
Market Beating Returns 
Johnson   Johnson doesn t get too much financial press because it s an old  boring stock that rarely surprises investors  But if you analyze how much investors have benefited from having this stock in their portfolios you might be surprised  During the past two decades  this New Brunswick  New Jersey based healthcare giant delivered a total return of more than 489  to shareholders  To keep things in perspective  the benchmark S P 500 Index returned just under 288  over the same period 
The biggest advantage of having buy and hold stocks in your portfolio is that you don t need to worry about market ups and downs on a daily basis  You don t invest in J J to make a quick buck  All you care about is a consistent income stream that s beating the inflation beast and growing every year 
The dividend is your friend in both good and bad times  as long as the company is able to make their dividend payments during downturns as well as upturns  Increasing payouts make it easier for you to hold on to your investment even when the share price contracts  Investors who made about 500  in total returns while holding on to J J stock have successfully ridden through many market crashes and bubbles  including the Great Recession of 2008 and the dot com bubble of 2001 
When it comes to rewarding investors  few companies have done better than Johnson   Johnson  The company has increased its quarterly dividend rate every year for 56 consecutive years  This remarkable performance puts Johnson   Johnson among an elite group known as  dividend kings   companies with at least five decades of annual dividend hikes  And though its payout ratio of 57 04  could be considered a tad high by some  given the company s strength and stellar dividend history  it should be considered a healthy metric in this case 
Growth momentum 
The latest numbers suggest that J J s earning momentum is still going strong  and there is no reason for long term investors to panic  Last month  the company reported that its fourth quarter sales surged 11 5   while its net income jumped 9 5  as the company beat analysts expectations 
This strength came from the fact that J J has one of the biggest R D budgets in the industry  Since 2015 it has spent more than other large pharma firms on M A  And the company has done almost twice as many drug licensing deals as its nearest large pharma competitor over that same period  according to Bloomberg data

198620,420136,JNJ,Will Pfizer  PFE  Surpass Estimates This Earnings Season ,opinion,"We expect Pfizer  Inc    NYSE PFE   to beat expectations when it reports fourth quarter and full year 2017 results on Jan 30  before the market opens  Last quarter  the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3 08  
The pharma giant has a fairly decent record of earnings surprises  The company s earnings surpassed expectations in three of the last four quarters while missing in one  resulting in an average positive surprise of 0 79  
Pfizer s shares have risen 18 7  in the past year  comparing unfavorably with an increase of 24 7  for the  

Factors at Play
New products like Xeljanz  rheumatoid arthritis  and Ibrance  breast cancer  as well as older products like Lyrica  neuropathic pain   Chantix  smoking cessation  and Eliquis  blood thinner  are likely to contribute meaningfully to the top line 
However  the loss of exclusivity and associated generic competition for some products  primarily Pristiq in the United States and Vfend and Lyrica in developed Europe   supply shortages in legacy Hospira products  and divesture of the Hospira Infusion Systems unit will continue to hamper top line growth 
Blockbuster drug Enbrel s sales will continue to decline in the quarter due to biosimilar competition  The Prevnar Prevenar 13 vaccines franchise is likely to see lower sales while lower demand is expected to hurt sales of Viagra 
On the third quarter call  Pfizer said that it is facing supply shortages for products from legacy Hospira portfolio mainly due to capacity constraints and technical issues  At the time of acquiring Hospira in September 2015  Pfizer had estimated that it would take a couple of years to integrate the manufacturing plants and resolve the majority of the supply chain issues  The company also stated that the remediation of the business has taken longer than expected  We expect the supply shortages to hurt sales in the fourth quarter 
Meanwhile  the bottom line is likely to be driven by cost savings and share buybacks 
Two leukemia treatments   Besponsa inotuzumab ozogamicin  approved in EU in June 2017 and in the United States in August 2017  for relapsed refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia  ALL  and Mylotarg for newly diagnosed CD33 positive acute myeloid leukemia  AML  were approved in third quarter 2017 
Xeljanz  Sutent and Bosulif were approved for line extensions in the fourth quarter while Ixifi  Pfizer s second biosimilar version of Johnson   Johnson s   NYSE JNJ   blockbuster drug Remicade  was also launched in December 
All these new products and line extensions should bring in some additional sales in the fourth quarter 
We also expect management to update on the commercialization plans for new approved oral SGLT 2 inhibitor  Steglatro  ertugliflozin  tablets on the conference call  Apart from being approved as a monotherapy to treat type II diabetes  Steglatro has also been approved for use in combination with metformin under the brand name  Segluromet and with Januvia  under the brand name Steglujan 
What Our Model Indicates
Our proven model shows that Pfizer is likely to beat on earnings because it has the right combination of two key ingredients  A stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen 
Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate is  0 45   This is a meaningful indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our 
Zacks Rank  Pfizer has a Zacks Rank  2  The combination of Pfizer s Zacks Rank  2 and positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat in the upcoming release 
Sell rated stocks  Zacks Rank  4 or 5   on the other hand  should never be considered going into an earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
Other Stocks to Consider
Here are some other health care stocks worth considering per our model  These have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this time around 
AbbVie Inc    NYSE ABBV   is scheduled to release results on Jan 26  The company has an Earnings ESP of  1 30  and a Zacks Rank  3  You can see

198625,420141,JNJ,Stair climbing wheelchair offers alternative to lifts and ramps,news,By Jim Drury An electric wheelchair that can climb most stairs  including spiral staircases  has been developed by Zurich based students  The Scalevo Wheelchair can mount one stair per second and was designed by 10 students at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology  ETH Zurich  and the Zurich University of the Arts  When being used on normal flat ground it balances on two wheels like a Segway and allows users to turn on the spot in order to quickly change direction  Two rubber tracks mounted to the bottom of the chair can be summoned at the press of a button to allow the user to climb stairs   According to Carlos Gomes  of ETH Zurich   we have two main wheels  two large wheels to drive around on the flat ground in a balancing mode like a Segway  And then we have two rubber tracks which we can extend to the angle of the stairs and let the wheelchair be always upright on every angle on the stairs   Colleague Miro Voellmy said the rubber tracks make the system entirely safe  even if stairs are uneven or cracked   Tracks are excellent for this use case because they have a very large footprint  which makes it near impossible to tilt  and they are also very smooth so it doesn t feel like you re driving up stairs  so it just feels like you re driving up a ramp because they re so flat and they adapt to the stair profile  So it doesn t matter if the stair is wooden or metal or glass  the tracks they grip and there s no danger of slipping   said Voellmy  Scalevo ascends the stairs backwards  When it reaches a set of stairs  the user presses a button to lower the tracks to the ground and its rubber grips hook onto the steps above to propel the chair and its occupant upwards  As it reaches the top a smaller pair of support wheels descend to prevent the wheelchair from toppling over   By traveling backwards the user can see what is below them  while a small video device similar to those used as reverse parking cameras in cars is fitted on Scalevo s arm  allowing them to see where they are going   The great thing is that everything on this wheelchair is automated   said Voellmy   If I want to climb the stairs I can just drive up to them  turn around  press one button and all I have to do is control the velocity I want to drive at  The alignment on the stairs  the leveling of the wheelchair driver  is automated and he can control it  he can view the back with a back facing camera  and have a full  safe  driving experience    The designers believe that  if adopted widely  their technology could negate the necessity for access ramps and in house stair lifts  while wheelchair users could have the option of avoiding out of the way lifts   It was built very compact  so it s not much wider than a classic manual wheelchair and it can still go under tables  you can go through narrow doors and use it indoors without any hassle  so it s extremely compact in comparison to different wheelchairs and it s very easy to use   said Voellmy  Their prototype was built in ten months and has been subjected to a series of tests  According to Gomes   we tested the wheelchair on several staircases  even on a spiral staircase  because we can move the tracks independently and all kinds of staircases we are able to drive  on  like from 34 to 17  I think  degrees  And this is almost every stair  You can drive everywhere   Previous stair climbing wheelchairs have failed to make the grade  Six years ago the iBot  devised by Johnson   Johnson  N JNJ  product was discontinued  regarded as expensive  and requiring users to have use of at least one arm and some upper body control  according to the Huffington Post  Scalevo s makers believe that when it eventually comes to market  their stair climbing wheelchair will not be much more expensive than traditional wheelchairs   Scalevo is also taking part in the 2016 Cybathlon  an ETH organized championship for pilots with disabilities using advanced assistive devices    OLUSSCIENCE Reuters US Online Report Science News 20151016T111940 0000,2015-10-16,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/general-news/stair-climbing-wheelchair-offers-alternative-to-lifts-and-ramps-366511,366511

198642,420158,JNJ,Pfizer s Second Biosimilar Of Remicade Receives FDA Approval,opinion,"Pfizer Inc    NYSE PFE   announced that the FDA has approved Ixifi its second biosimilar version of Johnson   Johnson s   NYSE JNJ   blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis   RA   drug  Remicade  infliximab   Notably  Ixifi is a chimeric human murine monoclonal antibody against tumor necrosis factor 
Ixifi received the nod for all approved indications of Remicade including RA  ulcerative colitis  plaque psoriasis  psoriatic arthritis  ankylosing spondylitis and Crohn s disease 
Shares of Pfizer have risen 12 8  so far this year  underperforming the  s rally of 17 7  

The approval was based on an encouraging data from phase III study  REFLECTIONS B537 02  A biologics license application was filed with the FDA in April 
Notably  in February 2016  Pfizer had divested the rights to development  commercialization and manufacturing of Ixifi in the European Economic Area   EEA   to Novartis  generic arm  Sandoz  However  Pfizer retains the commercialization and manufacturing rights to Ixifi in all countries outside the EEA 
We remind investors that Pfizer s first biosimilar product to Remicade  Inflectra  was launched last November in the United States  The company has exclusive commercialization rights to Inflectra in the United States and on certain other territories 
In September  Pfizer filed a lawsuit in a U S  district court alleging that J J is resorting to unfair practices to prevent the sale of Inflectra  available at a Wholesale Acquisition Cost  which is 19  lower than J J s referenced product 
Pfizer alleged in a complaint filed in the U S  District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania that J J has entered into biosimilar exclusion contracts with U S  insurers  These contracts boost insurers not to cover Inflectra  thus making it difficult to access by patients and protecting its referenced product 
Pfizer also claimed that anticompetitive contracts with discounts were offered to hospitals on purchase of Remicade on condition that they do not buy the biosimilar versions  Pfizer claims that these unfair practices benefit sales of J J s referenced product  a key revenue generator for the latter 
Pfizer is evaluating 13 biosimilar molecules in various stages of development  Biosimilar products in late stage development include biosimilar versions of Roche s   OTC RHHBY   Rituxan and Avastin and AbbVie s   NYSE ABBV   Humira  A biosimilar version of Herceptin is under review in the United States and the EU  In Europe  Pfizer markets Nivestim  biosimilar versions of Amgen s Neupogen and Retacrit as well as biosimilar versions of Amgen s Epogen Pfizer  Inc  Price

198649,420165,JNJ,How Will U S  Tax Reform Impact Pharma Biotech Industry ,opinion,"Tax reform has been grabbing headlines since the election campaign last year  However  the plan has been modified quite a few times  With a Congressional vote expected this week to move the tax reform bill forward  let s revisit some aspects of the bill and their impact on the biotech pharma industry 
Corporate Tax Cut
The bill in its current form proposes to cut the tax rate for corporates from 35  to 20   Although it is higher than the originally proposed 15   a 15 point cut will also help companies to save a considerable amount in tax payment in the United States The bill also proposes a full exemption on future dividend income from a company s foreign subsidiaries 
Currently  if foreign income is repatriated  it is taxed at 35  with a full credit of the local levies  However  the change will allow foreign subsidiaries to send the cash back to the parent company after just paying local taxes 
This will leave some extra cash in the hands of these companies to fund their capital expenditures  acquisitions and share buybacks among others  The lower tax rate and inflow of foreign income may lead to a rise in mergers   acquisitions  M A   which have been relatively low so far in 2017  Pharma sector acquisitions so far this year include Johnson   Johnson s   NYSE JNJ   buyout of Actellion and Gilead Sciences  Inc  s   NASDAQ GILD   takeover of Kite Pharma 
Minimum Tax on Foreign Earnings
While the bill cuts tax rates and removes tax on dividends from foreign subsidiaries  it proposes to implement  minimum tax  on foreign incomes  Under the current tax plan  the companies can defer tax payment by parking its foreign profits in the host country  However  if minimum tax is imposed  there will be no deferral route to skip taxes  The companies will have to pay taxes  difference of minimum tax   local taxes  every year  which will increase the tax bill of U S  based companies 
This proposed tax may improve the competitiveness of foreign pharma companies like Swiss giants AstraZeneca   NYSE AZN   and Novartis   NYSE NVS   against their U S  based counterparts 
However  the rate of this tax has yet to be decided 
Cash Repatriation Window
The current tax plan allows multinational companies to keep their foreign cash in the host country and thereby defer tax liability in the United States  However  the proposed minimum tax will stop the deferral system  The companies that have hoarded cash in low tax countries will be allowed to repatriate at a much lower rate 
This move will also increase domestic cash for the companies  The biotech companies may utilize the extra cash to fund their clinical studies or make a strategic acquisition to strengthen their portfolio 
Deductions
The tax reform proposes to expense capital expenditure excluding costs for structures like plants and warehouses in the current year rather than deferring it over 5 15 years as allowed currently  The large pharma companies areexpected to have a huge pile of cash available with them upon a potential tax reform 
Any acquisition or setting up of a manufacturing facility will help the companies to lower the tax bill in the near term  However  the reform will partially limit the deduction of interest on debt in tax calculation  The deduction limit is yet to be set 
Moreover  presently the companies can claim a tax credit for half of the research cost related to development of drugs for rare diseases  This credit may get eliminated if the reform passes  This will hurt the small biotech companies  which could have recouped some of their development costs 
Although the Senate budget committee has voted the bill for a full vote of the house  many are still sceptical about the tax reform  Many still believe that this will add to the country s fiscal deficit  Some also argue that lower federal revenues  a result of lower taxes will strain healthcare funds 
Moreover  healthcare costs are expected to increase in the future as the United States will see an increase in the number of aged people  which will further dent healthcare funds  Congress is still divided on the impact of the tax reform over the long term 
Investor Alert  Breakthroughs Pending
A medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization  Billions of dollars in research have poured into it  Companies are already generating substantial revenue  and even more wondrous products are in the pipeline

198654,420170,JNJ, Slower Than Expected ,news,"By    

The U S  Food   Drug Administration is on track to approve a new drug by Sandoz  marking the first time a so called biosimilar has made it through the agency s accelerated approval process  The drug compound  known as filgrastim  is meant to boost the immune systems of cancer patients by helping to make white blood cells  Its imminent government consent represents a promising step for drugmakers that have long been banned from selling biosimilars in the U S  while marketing them freely in Europe    The FDA approval of a filgrastim biosimilar represents a milestone   says Joshua Cohen  a researcher who specializes in drug development at Tufts University  Getting the FDA s go ahead  however  may be the easy part for Sandoz  The company s next big test will be to push doctors to prescribe its drug  patients to take it  and insurance companies to pay for it  a task that hasn t proven easy in Europe  While certain remedies have found success in specific countries   and the drug Sandoz is pushing has achieved a 30 percent market share in Europe  according to the company   overall adoption has been  slower than expected   as Cohen states in a recent study on biosimilars in the U S  Cohen says that s partly because European doctors and patients have been largely reluctant to switch due to unfamiliarity and safety concerns  Nearly a quarter of doctors there could not describe or have never heard of biosimilars  according to a 2014 survey of 470 doctors across Europe  Pharmaceutical companies with plans to bring their own biosimiliars to market are watching closely  Biosimilars are so named for their similarity to biologics  which are derived directly from living organisms as modified proteins  sugars or nucleic acids  The drugs include treatments for cancer and autoimmune diseases as well as vaccines  blood  allergy shots and gene therapies  Worldwide  biologics made up a  170 billion industry in 2013 and rank among some of the top selling drugs in America  But many are coming up on their due date  IMS Health estimates that  64 billion worth of drugs classified as biologics will be off patent by 2015 in the U S  and Europe  leaving them open to competition if other companies can make a fair approximation of the original    By mimicking biologics at a lower price  biosimilars should bring financial relief for patients and insurance companies  Last year  the RAND Corporation estimated that biosimilars could save patients and insurance companies in the U S   44 2 billion by 2024   The biosimilar  because it s a very close copy of the original  is a very good substitute for patents to take if the patient is in a setting where the cost might matter   says Fiona Scott Morton  an economist at Yale University  In addition to Sandoz  at least three other companies have filed drug applications for biosimilars through the FDA  Celltrion has applied for approval of a monoclonal antibody  which treats rheumatoid arthritis and could rival Remicade  a product of Johnson   Johnson s Janssen Biotech with a patent set to expire in September 2018  Earlier this month  an advisory committee unanimously recommended Sandoz s drug  which would be marketed as Zarxio  for FDA approval  A final decision is still pending and expected by May if the FDA is to meet its goal for speedy approvals of biosimilars  Just because a drug is approved  however  does not mean it will be endorsed by insurance companies  stored on site by hospitals or prescribed to patients by their doctors  Cohen says that the uptake of biosimilars in Europe has been  a bit disappointing  since countries there began approving them in 2006  There are now 17 such medicines available in European markets  several of which are expected to make their way to the U S  in the coming years  Dr  Phillip Cole  head of the pharmacology department at Johns Hopkins University  says it may take time for doctors to feel completely comfortable with the safety of biosimilars  The complexity and size of the molecules in biologics cannot be replicated exactly  so biosimilars vary slightly from the original drugs on which they are based    I think that it will be important  once we start having these used in large numbers of patients  to continue to follow them in post market surveillance where we ensure that there isn t really a differential in the level of side effect   he says   Another reason doctors and patients may not have been so eager to switch is that cost savings for biosimilars are not quite as significant as for generics because that complexity also drives up manufacturing costs   Standard generics are typically 80 to 90 percent cheaper than the major brands   Scott Morton says  Cost savings in Europe have averaged about 25 percent but Cohen expects savings to be even greater in the U S  In Europe  state run health systems have largely failed to provide incentives to entice doctors and hospitals to prescribe biosimilars according to Cohen  Scott Morton suggests there may still be logistical hurdles since biologics can sometimes require delicate handling   It s not clear that a doctor who treats people on several different insurance plans wants to hold several different biosimilars in his or her fridge   she says  Still  Cohen is more optimistic about the industry s promise in the U S  Sales of biosimilars doubled worldwide from  6 4 billion in 2006 to  12 4 billion in 2012  I expect payers to push harder than their European counterparts for biosimilar uptake   he says  by perhaps instating a lower cost for patients to pay as compared with a biologic  In a review of survey results from 277 physicians who attended a cancer conference in 2011  Cohen also learned that 62 percent of U S  physicians had at least moderate interest in prescribing a biosimilar to their patients  He also thinks professional organizations will revise their clinical guidelines to recommend biosimilars to doctors  Cohen expects to see more U S  applications for biosimilars in the near future   I expect other filgrastim products  such as the pegfilgrastim  originator is Neulasta  to be approved soon   in 2015 or 2016   he says

198667,420183,JNJ,U S  tightens Ebola monitoring for West African visitors,news,"By Bill Berkrot NEW YORK  Reuters    The United States imposed new constraints on Wednesday on people entering the country from three nations at the center of West Africa s Ebola epidemic  mandating that they report their temperature daily and stay in touch with health authorities 
President Barack Obama expressed cautious optimism about the situation in the United States after meeting with his Ebola response coordinator  Ron Klain  and other top officials on Klain s first day on the job since being named on Friday 
The U S  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention s new restrictions on travelers arriving from Liberia  Sierra Leone and Guinea marked the latest precautions put in place by the Obama administration to stop the spread of the virus  The steps stopped short of a ban on travelers from those countries demanded by some lawmakers 
Health authorities and the public have been on alert for Ebola since late September when a Liberian visiting Dallas  Texas became the first person diagnosed with the virus in the United States  Two nurses who cared for him were also infected 
The CDC said that  beginning on Monday  travelers from the three countries will be told to check in with health officials every day and report their temperatures and any Ebola symptoms for 21 days  the period of incubation for the virus 
The travelers will be required to provide emails  phone numbers and addresses for themselves and for a friend or relative in the United States covering the 21 days  and the information will be shared with local health authorities 
The travelers also will be required to coordinate with local public health officials if they intend to travel within the United States  If a traveler does not report in  local health officials will take immediate steps to find the person 
CDC Director Dr  Tom Frieden told reporters the active monitoring program will remain in place until the outbreak in West Africa is over  The U N  World Health Organization s latest figures on Wednesday showed at least 4 877 people out of 9 936 confirmed  probable and suspected cases have died in the outbreak  the worst on record 
 These new measures I m announcing today will give additional levels of safety so that people who develop symptoms of Ebola are isolated early in the course of their illness   Frieden said   That will reduce the chance that Ebola will spread from an ill person through close contact and to healthcare workers  
Beginning Wednesday  travelers from Liberia  Sierra Leone or Guinea were being funneled through one of five major U S  airports conducting increased screening for the virus 
Six states account for nearly 70 percent of all travelers arriving from the affected countries  New York  Pennsylvania  Maryland  Virginia  New Jersey and Georgia  The new monitoring will begin in those states first and will be expanded to other states 
The CDC said the monitoring program affects anyone coming back from the region  including CDC employees and journalists  It said when affected travelers enter one of the five airports they will receive a care kit that contains a tracking log  a pictorial description of symptoms  a thermometer  instructions on how to monitor their temperature and information on what to do if they experience symptoms 
Liberian Thomas Eric Duncan  who died on Oct  8 and nurses Nina Pham and Amber Vinson of Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital  are the only cases detected in the country  Pham s condition was last upgraded on Tuesday to good from fair at a hospital in Bethesda  Maryland 
Vinson s family said in a statement Wednesday that officials at the CDC and Emory University Hospital in Atlanta  where she is being treated   are no longer able to detect virus in her body  
OBAMA SEES PROGRESS
Speaking in the White House Oval Office with Klain sitting on a couch beside him  Obama said the CDC would continue to put in place further measures to prevent the spread of Ebola as needed 
 A number of things make us cautiously more optimistic about the situation here in the United States   Obama said  noting that dozens of people who interacted with Duncan did not get Ebola 
Obama said officials were working to ensure that problems that arose with Ebola protocols at the Dallas hospital do not occur again  He expressed confidence that any further Ebola patients would get first class treatment and said officials would make sure hospitals are prepared and would take the right precautions 
The White House said Obama spoke by phone with staff at Texas Presbyterian Hospital  to thank them for their courage and perseverance in dealing with the first cases of Ebola to appear in the United States  
Human testing of a second  investigational  Ebola vaccine has begun at the U S  National Institutes of Health s Clinical Center in Maryland  officials said 
The vaccine was developed at the Public Health Agency of Canada s National Microbiology Laboratory and licensed to NewLink Genetics Corp through its wholly owned subsidiary BioProtection Systems  both based in Ames  Iowa  the NIH said 
Testing on a first potential vaccine began last month  and initial results were expected by year s end 
NBC freelance cameraman Ashoka Mukpo  an American who contracted Ebola while working in West Africa  is free of the virus and was discharged on Wednesday from a special unit at Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha  the hospital said 
 I feel profoundly blessed to be alive  and in the same breath aware of the global inequalities that allowed me to be flown to an American hospital when so many Liberians die alone with minimal care   Mukpo said in a statement 

The 1 year old King Charles Spaniel belonging to Pham has tested free of the virus  the city of Dallas said

198668,420184,JNJ,Drugmakers may need indemnity for fast tracked Ebola vaccines,news,"By Ben Hirschler and Stephanie Nebehay LONDON GENEVA  Reuters    Drugmakers are looking for some kind of indemnity from governments or multilateral agencies against possible losses or claims arising from the widespread emergency use of new Ebola vaccines in Africa 
While the issue will not delay the industry s work to accelerate production and clinical testing of three experimental vaccines  it is likely to be discussed at a high level meeting in Geneva on Thursday 
World Health Organization  WHO  Director General Margaret Chan will chair the meeting  which includes industry executives  representatives from countries including those affected by Ebola  drug regulators and funders 
GlaxoSmithKline  L GSK  Chief Executive Andrew Witty said a system of indemnity made sense given the unique situation in which companies are being urged by the WHO to fast track the supply of novel vaccines in a matter of months rather than years 
There is currently no proven vaccine against Ebola and drug companies have been wary in the past of investing in the area  since the commercial opportunity is small  Potential losses or claims arising from the use of new vaccines would represent an additional hurdle 
Many drug companies are now discussing ways to help out with production  including some like Pfizer  N PFE  that are not directly involved in Ebola vaccine development 
Witty said indemnity was not a concern for the early phase of testing  when thousands of doses are expected to be given to frontline healthcare workers as part of a clinical trial program in January  but it would be needed when vaccines were rushed into much more widespread use 
 I think it is reasonable that there should be some level of indemnification because the vaccine is essentially being used in an emergency situation before we ve all had the chance to confirm its absolute profile   he told BBC radio 
 That s a situation where we would look for some kind of indemnification  either from governments or from multilateral agencies  
Brian Greenwood  a professor of clinical tropical medicine at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine  agrees that drug companies should not have to shoulder all the risk   There would have to be some sort of guarantee   he told Reuters 
MANUFACTURING CAPACITY
Leading drugmakers say they are ready to work together to speed up the supply of Ebola vaccines 
Johnson   Johnson  N JNJ  research head Paul Stoffels  who hopes to produce more than 1 million doses of an Ebola vaccine next year  said he was discussing collaboration with both GSK and other companies such as Pfizer  which has significant capacity to make a variety of biotech drugs and vaccines 
 We are looking at capabilities for biological production to upscale further   Stoffels said in Geneva 
The meeting is set to discuss ways to streamline the vaccine supply process and ensure there are adequate financial resources 
 WHO is organizing this meeting to discuss how to access vaccines when they are proven safe and how to finance them   a spokesman for the United Nations agency said 
Europe is also set to provide 200 million euros   250 million  of funding to develop new Ebola vaccines  as well as drugs and diagnostic tests  sources said  An announcement on the European move is now expected for next week 
 We are now in a situation where we are desperate and we are looking for solutions   Yvette Stevens  Sierra Leone ambassador to the U N  in Geneva  told Reuters 
GSK currently has the most advanced vaccine  the first doses of which are expected to be ready for use late this year  while clinical trials on a second vaccine from NewLink Genetics  O NLNK  have just started and J J will begin testing a third one in January 

 This is an unprecedented pace of development  We are literally doing in maybe five or six months what would normally take five or six years   Witty said   I ve already ordered five production lines to allow us to expand production

198669,420185,JNJ,Exclusive  Scientists tell U S    find recipe for Ebola cure in survivors  blood,news,"By Sharon Begley
NEW YORK  Reuters    A group of scientists including three Nobel laureates in medicine has proposed that U S  health officials chart a new path to developing Ebola drugs and vaccines by harnessing antibodies produced by survivors of the deadly outbreak     
The proposal builds on the use of  convalescent serum   or survivors  blood  which has been given to at least four U S  Ebola patients who then recovered from the virus  It is based on an approach called passive immunization  which has been used since the 19th century to treat diseases such as diphtheria but has been largely surpassed by vaccination 
The scientists propose using new genetic and other technologies to find hundreds or thousands of different Ebola antibodies  determine their genetic recipe  grow them in commercial quantities and combine them into a single treatment analogous to the multi drug cocktails that treat HIV AIDS 
That contrasts with current drug development  which focuses on finding one molecule  or a small number  to defeat the Ebola virus that has killed nearly 5 000 people in West Africa and infected thousands more since March 
Nobel laureates David Baltimore  an expert in the molecular biology of the immune system  James Watson  co discoverer of the double helix that is DNA  and Jim Simons  who founded hedge fund Renaissance Technologies and was a pioneer in the quant revolution on Wall Street  are among the advocates of the idea  It was outlined in a letter that was reviewed by Reuters 
The proposal was sent to officials at the Department of Health and Human Services  including the Food and Drug Administration  to lawmakers and to biotech companies  They have not responded  said geneticist Michael Wigler of Cold Spring Harbor Lab  who wrote and gathered signatures for the position paper  The recipients did not respond to Reuters  requests for comment or said they had no comment 
The scientists urged government leadership without offering a specific development or production plan  and it is not clear whether the idea would offer a faster track to success than current efforts 
 Government agencies  commercial manufacturers and perhaps philanthropy  must work together to form a research and development infrastructure capable of producing therapeutic antibodies  Wigler said in an interview 
Although there is no proof that blood from survivors helps Ebola patients survive  it is known that patients recover when their own blood produces enough antibodies to stop the virus 
 
OLD PROCESS
Antibodies are proteins produced by the immune system to fight bacteria  viruses  and other invaders  from colds to measles  Giving antibodies to infected people would offer their immune systems a head start in fighting Ebola  the theory goes 
If the antibodies in survivors  blood is genetically sequenced  they would provide a recipe for treatments  which could be produced with technologies already used to manufacture antibodies that target cancer or rheumatoid arthritis  the scientists said 
 It would cost less than  1 million to get the genetic sequences of the antibodies from people who have recovered  and then we would have an armamentarium of hundreds or even thousands of antibodies   Wigler said 
He speculated that the idea has not gained traction before because  academics are trained to overlook the obvious   The approach would be difficult  and  many people in this day and age are afraid to risk failure   he said 
Ebola experts were cautious about the possibility that hundreds of anti Ebola antibodies would prevent or cure infections 
Studies have shown that some antibodies that neutralize Ebola virus in test tubes don t protect infected lab animals  said Dr  Thomas Geisbert of the University of Texas Medical Branch  who is working on Ebola vaccines  He also questioned whether the proposal would save time  given the need to test any antibody cocktail in both lab animals and human volunteers 
One of the most promising experimental treatments  Mapp Biopharmaceutical s ZMapp  consists of three different antibodies produced by mice infected with Ebola  Initial research was published in 2000  but it took until this summer for a study to show that ZMapp cured Ebola infected lab monkeys 
GlaxoSmithKline Plc  L GSK  and Johnson   Johnson  N JNJ  are among the drugmakers working on an Ebola vaccine  Both declined to comment on whether the antibodies proposal might be effective against Ebola 
Wigler acknowledges that none of those who have signed on to the proposal are experts on Ebola  Nor do they know how long it might take to develop a production line  get regulatory approval  and test the antibodies

LESSON FROM DIPHTHERIA
European researchers separately are planning to test whether Ebola survivors  serum can cure patients  starting this month  But relying on transfusions of survivors  blood for those antibodies is a daunting task in West Africa  given the need to screen it for other diseases and ensure health workers aren t exposed during the collection or infusion process 
By contrast   it takes a very short time  to produce countless copies of antibody genes  said molecular biologist Michel Nussenzweig of the Rockefeller University  an expert on the immune system who was not involved in the Ebola proposal   Hundreds are not a problem  this has been automated   he said  However  he questioned whether hundreds would be necessary to fight Ebola 
Wigler s answer  the Ebola virus is mutating  That might thwart an three antibody cocktail like ZMapp  he said  but it is highly unlikely that the targets of hundreds of antibodies would all mutate  A diversity of antibodies  mimics the body s own defenses and could overcome mutations in the virus that may develop   he said 
Multiple antibodies is what finally worked against HIV  which causes AIDS and  like the Ebola virus  mutates rapidly 

 We should make sure we learn from HIV to take our best shot at Ebola   Nobelist Baltimore said in an interview

198670,420186,JNJ,What Lies In Store For Pharma ETFs ,opinion,"As we head toward the end of 2017  the pharma sector continues to perform well  representing a contrast to 2016 when the sector was under immense pressure due to the drug pricing issue  The sector was also weighed down by a significantly lower number of FDA approvals last year and was hit by some high profile R D failures as well as mixed results  slower than expected new product launches and increasing competition 
Pharma stocks have fared better this year with the NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index gaining 16  year to date  Factors like new product sales ramp up  R D success and innovation  strong results  a higher number of FDA approvals and continued strong performance from legacy products should help sustain the recovery  Importantly  investors are now more comfortable with the drug pricing issue and are now focusing more on the fundamentals of the sector  Tax reforms and cash repatriation are other factors that should support the sector s performance   Read   
M As Yet to Pick Pace
The year started off with expectations that M A activity would pick up  but this did not happen  Although several small deals were announced  big ticket M A activity was more or less limited  Major M A news this year in the pharma sector was Johnson   Johnson s acquisition of Actelion for  30 billion  Apart from this  a few bolt on deals were announced by other companies 
Although several big companies remain interested in striking M A deals  high valuations remain a major deterrent with companies remaining wary of bidding wars leading to over priced deals 
Meanwhile  in licensing deals continue to be popular with several big companies tying up with smaller and mid sized players with promising mid to late stage pipeline candidates or interesting technology  Companies developing immunotherapies are highly sought after   Read 
Divestment  Streamlining   Restructuring
Several pharma companies are also streamlining operations by divesting non core business segments and restructuring  Companies like UCB  Novartis  Teva  Sanofi  PA SASY   Valeant  Glaxo and AstraZeneca have all been a part of this trend  Meanwhile  Pfizer  which has already divested several of its business segments  is currently looking at strategic options for its Consumer Healthcare business  The monetization of non core assets allows these companies to focus on their key areas of expertise  Moreover  the sale proceeds are utilized for reinvestment in the pipeline  debt repayment and for returning value to shareholders in the form of share buybacks and dividends 
Restructuring activities are also gaining momentum as large companies look to cut costs and streamline operations  Most of these companies are re evaluating their pipelines and discontinuing programs with an unfavorable risk benefit profile 
New Product Sales Should Ramp Up
Sales of products that gained approval over the last two years  as well as line and label extensions  should ramp up and boost growth  Recent entrants like Novartis  psoriasis treatment Cosentyx and Pfizer s cancer treatment Ibrance have already achieved blockbuster status and are key contributors to the top line 
Meanwhile  things are looking up on the regulatory front with the FDA already approving a higher number of drugs so far in 2017 compared to the whole of 2016  Moreover  with the passing of the 21st Century Cures Act  expectations are that there will be more innovation in the sector followed by a surge in new drug approvals 
Pharma companies continue to work on bringing innovative new treatments to market  and there could be significant catalysts in the coming quarters in the form of important new product approvals as well as major data read outs especially in key therapeutic areas like immuno oncology  Alzheimer s  central nervous system disorders  and immunology inflammation   Read   
Key approvals this year include Novartis s Kymriah  the first gene therapy in the United States   Lilly s Verzenio  advanced or metastatic breast cancer   J J s Tremfya  moderate to severe plaque psoriasis   Regeneron Sanofi s Kevzara  rheumatoid arthritis   Roche s multiple sclerosis treatment  Ocrevus  and Regeneron and Sanofi s eczema treatment  Dupixent  among others  Quite a few of these drugs have blockbuster potential 
Pricing Pressure   Competition Remain Headwinds
While the drug pricing issue no longer remains a major headwind  it will nevertheless remain a headline risk until the administration comes out with a policy for controlling drug prices  Moreover  with increasing competition in the market and the entry of innovative treatments  pricing pressure is expected to hit sales 
Another challenge being faced by the sector is the recent entry of biosimilar competition in the United States  While a relatively new area  the market for biosimilars is huge and highly lucrative with several blockbuster biologics including Humira and Lantus slated to lose patent protection by 2020 
Many companies are also facing a slowdown in sales of mature products in their portfolios  At the same time  new product sales are yet to pick up significantly  Many of these companies are also facing loss of patent protection  which means generics or biosimilars  as the case may be  could enter the market soon and lead to price erosion 
Pharma ETFs in Focus
Highlighted below are some pharma ETFs   ETFs present a low cost and convenient way to get a diversified exposure to the sector

ADS   which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 57 cents  Core earnings declined 17  year over year at constant exchange rates  CER   Lower product sales and gross margins and higher SG A costs hurt profits in the quarter Total revenue rose 10  at CER to  6 23 billion in the reported quarter  Revenues also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  5 75 billion  Revenues  however  gained mainly from the  997 million payment from Merck   NYSE MRK   for the oncology collaboration the companies announced in July to jointly commercialize and develop Lynparza selumetinib Meanwhile  product sales declined in the quarter due to generic competition facing some legacy products Key growth platforms  representing 66  of total revenues  were up 6  in the quarter at CER  Among the key growth platforms  Emerging Markets  New Cardiovascular   Metabolic Diseases  CVMD   New Oncology and Japan performed well in the quarter  However  Respiratory sales declined 2  in the reported quarter All growth rates mentioned below are on a year over year basis and at CER Product Sales DeclineProduct sales declined 2  in the quarter to  4 88 billion due to lower sales in the United States as well as Europe  which offset strong performance in emerging markets and in China Crestor sales declined 14  to  580 million with sales in the United States and Europe down due to the entry of multiple generic versions of the drug in the market Seroquel XR sales declined 68  to  62 million due to competition from generic launches In the quarter  Onglyza sales declined 25  to  127 million due to competitive pressure in the DPP 4 class Symbicort sales were down 4  in the quarter to  668 million due to lower sales in the United States and Europe  U S  sales declined in the due to continued pricing pressure from managed care access within the ICS LABA class and also competition from other class like LAMA LABA combination medicines Nexium recorded sales of  469 million  down 7   However  some legacy

sales of  4 million in the quarter  less than  3 million in the second quarter as the LAMA LABA class grew more slowly than anticipated PD L1 inhibitor Imfinzi  launched for second line bladder cancer in the United States in May  did not generate any sales in the third quarter against  1 million in the second quarter  A regulatory application seeking label expansion of Imfinzi to treat an earlier stage of lung cancer was granted priority review by the FDA last month Imfinzi is a key candidate in the company s immuno oncology pipeline which is beingevaluated for multiple cancers  either alone or in combination with other regimens  Last month  AstraZeneca expanded its clinical trial collaboration with Incyte   NASDAQ INCY   to evaluate Incyte s investigational selective IDO1 enzyme inhibitor  epacadostat  in combination with Imfinzi  compared to Imfinzi alone in early lung cancer Regional PerformanceProduct sales declined 10  to  1 39 billion  primarily due to generic

Morgan Stanley is confident it will  and predicts growth of around 5 percent  Bridgewater also expects a  gradual acceleration   which could strengthen the economic recovery   But the danger is that it fails to pick up enough   A more historically normal cyclical pickup  something in excess of 8 percent annually  simply looks unrealistic   Morgan Stanley said     Editing by Will Waterman ",2014-08-06,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/corporate-america's-'abc'-policy---anything-but-capex-301236,301236
198676,420192,JNJ,Scientists grapple with ethics in rush to release Ebola vaccines,news,"By Kate Kelland LONDON  Reuters    Normally it takes years to prove a new vaccine is both safe and effective before it can be used in the field  But with hundreds of people dying a day in the worst ever outbreak of Ebola  there is no time to wait 
In an effort to save lives  health authorities are determined to roll out potential vaccines within months  dispensing with some of the usual testing  and raising unprecedented ethical and practical questions 
 Nobody knows yet how we will do it  There are lots of tough real world deployment issues and nobody has the full answers yet   said Adrian Hill  who is conducting safety trials on healthy volunteers of an experimental Ebola shot developed by GlaxoSmithKline 
Hill  a professor and director at the Jenner Institute at Britain s University of Oxford  says that if his results show no adverse side effects  GSK s new shot could used in people in West Africa by the end of this year 
Even if a drug is shown to be safe  it takes longer to prove it is effective   time that is simply not available when cases of Ebola infection are doubling every few weeks and projected by the World Health Organization to reach 20 000 by November 
Among questions that scientists are grappling with  should an unproven vaccine be given to everybody  or just a few  Should it be offered to healthcare workers first  The young before the old  Should it be used first in Liberia where Ebola is spreading fastest  or Guinea where it is closer to being under control 
Should people be told to assume it will protect them from Ebola  Or should they take all the protective measures they would if they hadn t been vaccinated  And if so  how will anyone know whether the vaccine works 
GSK is one of several drug firms that have either started or announced plans for human trials of candidate Ebola vaccines  Others include Johnson   Johnson  NewLink  Inovio Pharmaceuticals and Profectus Biosciences 
The WHO says it hopes to see small scale use of the first experimental Ebola vaccines in the West Africa outbreak by January next year 
It has convened vaccine specialists  epidemiologists  pharmaceutical companies and ethicists  for a meeting on Monday and Tuesday to discuss the moral and practical issues 
 Normally safety is the absolutely paramount thing when you re developing a new vaccine  but this time we re going to have to take more risks   said Brian Greenwood  a professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine who will take part in the WHO led meeting 
 Quite how we do that  and what risks we take  hasn t really been thought through yet  That s what people are trying to figure out  
TWO THINGS AT THE SAME TIME
The chaos caused by the epidemic itself makes it even more difficult to deploy and track use of a new vaccine  said Hill 
 You re trying to do two things at the same time  you re trying to evaluate a vaccine and deploy it   when normally you would evaluate the vaccine first  by doing a randomized double blind controlled trial  and then you d deploy it if it was shown to be safe and effective  
Because Ebola virus is so deadly  those who receive a trial vaccine must be told to take all other precautions and protect themselves fully  This could make it harder for researchers to decipher whether the protective clothing and safety protocols  or the new vaccine  is what kept them safe 
Normally researchers testing a vaccine would give some volunteers a placebo  or dummy  to create a  control  group to compare against those who get the real drug  That seems unthinkable in a situation where disease with a death rate of up to 90 percent is raging through villages 
 Would it be ethical to do a trial where some people don t get the vaccine because they are in the control group  Most people think it wouldn t be   especially if you have reasonable evidence that the vaccine might work   said Hill 
Jeremy Farrar  an infectious diseases expert and director of the Wellcome Trust medical charity  said limited supplies of any candidate vaccine could result in a form of natural control group being formed anyway  Researchers can compare populations where the vaccine is available with those where it isn t 
GSK has said it is aiming to have 10 000 doses of its experimental shot by the end of the year  while Canada has given 800 vials of the NewLink candidate vaccine to the WHO  expected to yield at least 1 500 doses 
Most experts interviewed by Reuters favor the idea of the first doses going to frontline healthcare workers  since their exposure to risk is so high  Researchers could then compare infection rates among health workers who receive the vaccine to those working in regions still waiting for it 
Peter Piot  a co discoverer of the Ebola virus in 1976 and now director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said that however complicated the ethics  reverting to the traditional years long process of testing vaccines  and withholding them from West Africa until then  is not an option 

 It may be that without a vaccine  we can t really stop this epidemic   he said

diversified J J s revenues to the PAH category However  sales of Invokana Invokamet declined 19 2  due to higher managed care discounting  Importantly  sales of the blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug Remicade  marketed in partnership with Merck   Co   Inc    NYSE MRK    declined 7 6  in the quarter with U S  sales declining 1 3  and international sales declining 6 9  due to biosimilar competition  In this regard  we would like to mention that Pfizer  Inc    NYSE PFE   filed a lawsuit in a U S  district court recently  In the lawsuit  Pfizer alleged J J of resorting to unfair practices to prevent sale of Inflectra   Pfizer s biosimilar version of Remicade   that was launched in the United States in November last year J J s Pharma segment achieved some clinical milestones during the quarter including label expansions in the United States for pulmonary arterial hypertension  PAH  drug  Tracleer for pediatric use and Imbruvica for chronic graft versus host disease  GVHD    the drug s first indication outside of cancer  J J markets Imbruvica in partnership with AbbVie  Inc    NYSE ABBV   At the call  the company also mentioned that it will not file global regulatory applications for rheumatoid arthritis candidate  sirukumab  We remind investors that last month  J J received a complete response letter  CRL  from the FDA for sirukumab for want of additional safety data   Medical Devices segment sales came in at  6 6 billion  up 7 1  from the year ago period  It included an operational increase of 6 6  and positive currency movement of 0 5   Sales gained mainly from the inclusion of Abbott Medical Optics acquisition  which added 5 2  to operational sales growth  Excluding the impact of all acquisitions and divestitures  on an operational basis  worldwide sales increased 1 2  Domestic market sales rose 4 6  year over year to  3 19 billion  International market sales increased 9 6   operational increase of 8 6   year over year to  3 41 billion Operational growth was driven by wound closure products in the General Surgery business  electrophysiology products in the Cardiovascular business and Acuvue contact lenses in the Vision Care business  which made up for a weaker sales performance in the Diabetes Care unitThe Consumer segment recorded revenues of  3 36 billion in the reported quarter  up 2 9  year over year operational increase of 1 6    Foreign currency movement positively impacted sales in the segment by 1 3   Sales in the domestic market declined 0 5  from the year ago period to  1 29 billion Slower growth in baby care products due to competitive pressure was partially offset by growth in beauty and over the counter products and international smoking cessation aids Meanwhile  the international segment recorded an

sales surprise after almost a year  Higher sales in the pharmaceutical segment as well as positive contribution from the Actelion deal pulled up the top line in the quarter  The Actelion acquisition added an impressive 7 9  to operational sales growth in the quarter Though quite a few key products in J J s portfolio like Remicade and Concerta are facing generic competition  we believe that new

198699,420215,JNJ,Will Gilead   AbbVie Benefit From Merck s Decision To Drop Two HCV Programs ,opinion,Late last week  Merck   NYSE MRK   announced its decision to discontinue the development of a couple of candidates in its hepatitis C virus   HCV   program   MK 3682B  grazoprevir ruzasvir  uprifosbuvir  and MK 3682C  ruzasvir uprifosbuvir   The company s decision was based on a review of available phase II efficacy data and the growing competition in the HCV market  Merck itself has a marketed product in the HCV market in the form of Zepatier  elbasvir and grazoprevir  which brought in sales of  895 million in the first six months of 2017  including a  40 million favorable adjustment to rebate accruals due to mix of business   While Merck will continue to work on expanding Zepatier s utilization across the world  uptake will be impacted by the ongoing decline in overall patient volumes in many markets and increased competition Gilead and AbbVie in HCV SpotlightMerck s announcement has now put the spotlight firmly on Gilead Sciences   NASDAQ GILD   and AbbVie   NYSE ABBV    two key players in this market Gilead is the undisputed leader in the HCV market with its HCV products bringing in sales of  5 4 billion in the first half of 2017  The company revolutionized the treatment paradigm in the HCV market with the introduction of Sovaldi by cutting down the duration of treatment to as few as 12 weeks instead of the prior standard of care of up to 48 weeks  Moreover  the need for peg interferon injections  which come with several side effects  was reduced or eliminated completely Gilead launched Harvoni next  the first once daily single tablet regimen for the treatment of the most prevalent HCV genotype in the United States  This was followed by the launch of Epclusa  the first all oral  pan genotypic  single tablet regimen for the treatment of adults with genotype 1 6 chronic HCV infection  This year  Gilead gained approval for yet another HCV treatment  Vosevi Although Gilead ruled the HCV market for quite a few years  sales are declining given intense pricing pressure  growing competition  pricing scrutiny and a declining patient population  The approval of newer HCV products has resulted in a rapid increase in the number of patients who were treated and cured followed by a decline in the number of patients seeking care and being able to access HCV treatment  Gilead expects HCV net product sales in the range of  8 5 billion to  9 5 billion in 2017  announced with Q2 results   representing quite a drop from last year s HCV product sales of  14 8 billion Meanwhile  AbbVie s HCV products include Mavyret  glecaprevir pibrentasivr   Viekira Pak  ombitasvir  paritaprevir and ritonavir tablets co packaged with dasabuvir tablets  and Viekira XR  dasabuvir  ombitasvir  paritaprevir and ritonavir   While Mavyret was approved recently  Viekira sales were  488 million in the first half of 2017  Mavyret  the company s next generation HCV offering  should be a meaningful contributor to sales from 2018 Other HCV drugs include Bristol Myers Squibb Company s   NYSE BMY   Daklinza  daclastavir  and Janssen Therapeutics s Olysio  simeprevir  We remind investors that Merck is not the only company to have taken the decision to halt the development of HCV candidates  Last month  Johnson   Johnson   NYSE JNJ   had announced its decision to terminate a collaboration agreement with Achillion Pharmaceuticals   NASDAQ ACHN   for HCV J J s Janssen Pharmaceuticals said that it would be discontinuing the development of the investigational HCV treatment regimen JNJ 4178  a combination of three direct acting antivirals  AL 335  odalasvir and simeprevir With both Merck and J J dropping their investigational HCV treatments  Gilead and AbbVie should benefit from the lack of additional competition entering the market  at least in the near term  While the companies will continue to face challenges like declining patient volume and intense pricing pressure  the lack of additional entrants in the market should slow down the rate of decline in sales Gilead has been working on expanding the HCV market by encouraging baby boomers to get tested  According to the company  there has been an 80  increase in HCV antibody screening by baby boomers since the start of this initiative  Increased testing has led to an increase in diagnosis with about 190 000 people being newly diagnosed with HCV in 2016  up 32  from 2015  This represents a significant opportunity for the existing players in the HCV market Both Gilead and AbbVie are Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stocks   you can see  Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single

198700,420216,JNJ,Here s What s Has Happened In The HCV Space Lately,opinion,"Hepatitis C is an infectious disease caused by the hepatitis C virus  HCV  that primarily affects the liver  Gilead Sciences Inc    NASDAQ GILD   markets blockbuster HCV drugs  Sovaldi and Harvoni  while other well known names in this market are AbbVie Inc  s   NYSE ABBV   Viekira Pak  Bristol Myers    NYSE BMY   Daklinza and Johnson   Johnson s   NYSE JNJ   Olysio 
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  CDC   about 3 2 million people in the United States are living with chronic hepatitis C infection while many remain unaware of being infected  There are about 17 000 new hepatitis C cases each year in the United States  many of which go unreported Considering these numbers  it is not a surprise that quite a few pharma and biotech companies are working on bringing new  improved  shorter duration HCV treatments to the market  The market is thus getting crowded and seeing increased pricing pressure   
A lot has happened in the HCV space of late   
In September 2017  Gilead Sciences  Sovaldi received approval in China  as a component of a combination antiviral treatment regimen  It is the first Gilead HCV drug to be approved in China   
Meanwhile  Gilead s single tablet regimen  STR  of Sovaldi  velpatasvir and voxilaprevir  Vosevi received approval in the United States  EU and Canada in July August  Vosevi became the first once daily STR available as a salvage therapy for patients infected with HCV genotype 1 6 who have failed prior treatment with DAA regimens including NS5A inhibitors 
Gilead s shares have outperformed the industry year to date  The stock has rallied 16 6  compared with the s gain of 14 5  in the same time frame  The stock carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  
 

Meanwhile  AbbVie s 8 week  pan genotypic  ribavirin free  once daily HCV treatment  Mavyret Maviret  gained approval in the United States  EU and Canada in the past couple of months  Mavyret  AbbVie s next generation HCV program  is a combination of glecaprevir  a potent protease inhibitor and pibrentasvir  a NS5A inhibitor  Maviret has the potential to rejuvenate growth in the HCV franchise  According to AbbVie  Mavyret may be used in up to 95  of HCV patients  depending on the stage of liver disease and prior treatment history 
Abbvie s shares have outperformed the industry year to date  The stock has rallied 44  compared with the  s gain of 17 9  in the same time frame  The stock carries a Zacks Rank  3 

However  last week  pharmaceutical giant Merck   NYSE MRK   announced that it is discontinuing further development of two of its next generation hepatitis C  HCV  programs   MK 3682B  grazoprevir ruzasvir  uprifosbuvir  and MK 3682C  ruzasvir uprifosbuvir   The company made this decision based on review of available phase II efficacy data and a heavily crowded HCV market 
Merck s shares have underperformed the industry year to date  The stock has gained 9 7  compared with the  s gain of 17 9  in the same time frame  The stock carries a Zacks Rank  3 

Besides Merck  another giant Johnson   Johnson also discontinued the development of its investigational HCV treatment regimen JNJ 4178  a combination of three direct acting antivirals  AL 335  odalasvir and simeprevir  The company took this decision considering that there are several highly effective therapies available for this indication 
Johnson   Johnson s shares have underperformed the industry year to date  The stock has gained 15 6  compared with the  s gain of 17 9  in the same time frame  The stock carries a Zacks Rank  3 

It is believed that the discontinuation of Merck and J J s combination HCV regimens should act in favor of Gilead and AbbVie  Gilead and AbbVie should benefit from the lack of additional competition entering the market  at least in the near term  However  the companies will continue to face challenges in the form of declining patient volume and intense pricing pressure  The lack of additional entrants in the market should also slow down the rate of decline in sales

According to my elliott wave view there are high chances 5 waves from 109  area are complete  So a pull back towards 128 122  is justified 

Zooming out we get an even worrisome picture as a bigger 5 wave pattern could already be complete as well  

With bearish divergence signs from the RSI and a 5 wave pattern most probably complete  we might be standing at a major top with a major reversal coming  So bulls should be very careful this is not an opportunity to take profits for bulls but an opportunity in the short side  I will be opening short positions once we break my support levels with stops at the highs 
Conclusion
 JNJ US could be at the very early stages of a big decline as an impulse wave pattern since the lows of 2015 might be complete  Bulls need to be very cautious  Could the negative verdict from the Talc cancer case be the first among the 5 500 cases the company faces and loses    This would be a terrible blow for the company and the stock market price will soon reflect the worries  fears and the concern this result creates

198758,420274,JNJ,AbbVie Inc s   ABBV  Q2 Earnings  Disappointment In Store ,opinion,"AbbVie Inc    NYSE ABBV   is scheduled to release second quarter 2017 earnings  before the opening bell on Jul 28 
AbbVie s shares have rallied 18 2  so far this year  while the  has recorded an increase of 13 2  

Last quarter  the company delivered a positive surprise of 1 59   We note that AbbVie s earnings history is a mixed bag as the pharmaceuticals company delivered positive surprises in the two of the last four quarters but recorded in line earnings in the other two  The average earnings beat for the last four quarters is 1 65  AbbVie Inc  Price and EPS Surprise

   Let s see how things are shaping up for the company this quarter 
Factors to Consider
At the first quarter 2017 conference call  management revealed that it expects second quarter 2017 earnings in the range of  1 39  1 41 per share  Revenues are expected to grow between 7  and 8  on a reported basis  Currency headwinds are expected to hurt revenues by 1  
The company s key drug  Humira  is likely to remain the main growth driver in the second quarter  Increasing awareness  favorable clinical data  additional indications and expansion into new markets are expected to help the product continue making significant contributions to the top line  This quarter  AbbVie also expects Humira sales growth in the U S  in the mid to high teens range while internationally  Humira sales are expected to rise in a mid single digit range on an operational basis 
Though Humira is doing well  the company is concerned about the product s long term prospects owing to the potential biosimilar competition 
Another area of focus is the performance of Imbruvica  added to AbbVie s portfolio following its May 2015 acquisition of Pharmacyclics  The drug recorded strong sales since past few quarters  a trend that we expect to continue  Imbruvica has multi billion dollar potential and the company is looking to expand the drug s label for solid tumors and autoimmune diseases 
The company expects the Imbruvica sales growth in the U S  to approach 35  in the second quarter 
Although Imbruvica has huge commercial potential  investors should know that revenues from it will be shared with Johnson   Johnson   NYSE JNJ    which has a collaboration agreement with Pharmacyclics 
Other drugs like Duopa and Creon are also expected to continue to perform well in the soon to be reported quarter 
However  Abbvie s Hepatitis C virus  HCV  treatment  Viekira  will continue to be adversely impacted by an intense pricing and competitive pressure in the HCV market 
Notably  last month  the company announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use  CHMP  recommended a marketing approval of its investigational  hepatitis C virus  HCV  combo regimen of glecaprevir pibrentasvir  G P   The candidate will be marketed by the trade name of Maviret 
A decision from the European Commission is expected in the third quarter of 2017  An approval will definitely provide the company with a stronger presence against the competitive dynamics in the HCV market 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that AbbVie is likely to beat on earnings this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here  as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP for AbbVie is  0 71  as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at  1 39 per share and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands higher at  1 40  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Zacks Rank  Though AbbVie s Zacks Rank  3 increases the predictive power of the ESP  its  0 71  Earnings ESP makes the surprise prediction difficult 
We caution against the Sell rated stocks   4 or 5  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
Stocks That Warrant a Look
Here are some better ranked health care stocks that you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter 
Novo Nordisk  CO NOVOb  A S   NYSE NVO   is scheduled to release its results on Aug 9  The company has an Earnings ESP of  3 57  and a Zacks Rank  2  You can see  
Pfizer Inc    NYSE PFE    scheduled to release its results on Aug 1  has an Earnings ESP of  1 54  and a Zacks Rank  3 
Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars  
Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge 
With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply  one company stands out as the  1 stock to buy according to Zacks research

Importantly  sales of the blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug Remicade  marketed in partnership with Merck   Co   Inc    NYSE MRK    declined 14  in the quarter with U S  sales declining 13 9  and international sales declining 5 6  due to biosimilar competition  In this regard  we would like to mention that Pfizer Inc    NYSE PFE   launched its Inflectra injection  a biosimilar version of Remicade in the U S  late last November  This did not have any significant impact on Remicade sales in the past two quarters  Management is expected to comment on the impact of the biosimilar on second quarter sales at the conference call J J s Pharma segment achieved some clinical milestones during the quarter  These included the FDA approval for Darzalex to be used in combination with Celgene Corporation s   NASDAQ CELG   Pomalyst  pomalidomide  and dexamethasone for the third line treatment of multiple myeloma  Importantly  last week  J J announced FDA approval for its pipeline candidate guselkumab for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis  The drug will be marketed by the trade name of Tremfya Meanwhile  last month J J completed its previously announced  30

rose 6 1  year over year to  3 23 billion  International market sales increased 3 9   operational increase of 5 8   year over year to  3 5 billion Operational growth was driven by the Advanced Surgery

Consumer segment recorded revenues of  3 48 billion in the reported quarter  up 1 7  year over year operational increase of 2 3    Foreign currency movement negatively impacted sales in the segment by

looks optimistic about a better sales performance in the second half  Chief executive officer  Alex Gorsky said that J J s sales growth will accelerate in the second half of the year Importantly  sales in the Medical Device segment are picking up  which made up for lower sales in the international Consumer and U S  Pharmaceutical segments in the quarter  Sales in J J s domestic Pharma segment have decelerated this year as key growth drivers have slowed down due to competition  Quite a few products in its portfolio like Remicade and Concerta are facing generic competition  However  we

  Price to Earnings 
Price to Earnings
 P E is a valuation ratio of a company s EPS compared to its current share price  Generally speaking  a high P E means the market is bullish on a stock  but it can also signal that a stock is overpriced  What we look for is a stock trading below its industry average  This means we can get a better deal on a stock compared to its peers   P E   The average price to earnings ratio of the pharmaceuticals industry is 113 93  And Johnson   Johnson s ratio comes in at 20 92  It s trading at a better value than many of its competitors 
  Debt to Equity 
Debt to Equity
Debt to equity measures a company s liabilities compared to its stockholders  equity  The ratio measures a company s financial leverage  In general  a high debt to equity ratio means a company has been aggressively financing its growth with debt  As with P E  we want to see where a company stands compared to its peers since some industries are more capital intensive than others   The debt to equity ratio for Johnson   Johnson stock is 46 02   That s below the pharmaceuticals industry average of 57 48   The company is less leveraged 
  Free Cash Flow per Share Growth 
Free cash flow  FCF  per share growth helps determine a company s financial flexibility  It compares free cash flow to the total number of shares outstanding  At IU  we look for companies that are growing their cash flow year over year  In general  if a company is growing its FCF  it will be able to pay down debt  buy back stock  pay out more in dividends and or invest money back into the business to help boost growth   Johnson   Johnson s FCF has been lower than that of its competitors over the last year  That s not good for investors  In general  if a company is growing its FCF  it will be able to pay down debt  buy back stock  pay out more in dividends and or invest money back into the business to help boost growth  It s one of our most important fundamental factors 
  Profit Margins   The profit margin of Johnson   Johnson comes in at 24 89  today  And generally  the higher  the better  We also like to see this margin above that of its competitors  Johnson   Johnson s profit margin is above the pharmaceuticals average of 11 75   So that s a positive indicator for investors 
  Return on Equity   Return on equity tells us how much profit a company produces with the money shareholders invest  The ROE for Johnson   Johnson is 23 09   and that s above its industry average ROE of 17 77  
Johnson   Johnson stock passes four of our six key metrics today  That s why our Investment U Stock Grader rates it as a Buy With Caution ",2017-07-16,Investment U,https://www.investing.com/analysis/should-you-buy-johnson---johnson-stock-before-earnings-200201337,200201337

198799,420315,JNJ,Top Ranked Health Care ETFs To Buy Now,opinion,After many twists and turns  the healthcare sector is once again hogging investors  attention  This is especially true as strong momentum has started to build up in the space  pushing many stocks to multi year highs The optimism comes especially from the shift in investors  sentiment to defensive sectors like healthcare  which generally outperform during periods of low growth and high uncertainty  The latest spate of disappointing data points to slow and steady economic growth while geopolitical tensions are still looming Added to the strength is the release of Senate Republicans  healthcare bill to replace Obamacare  The legislation aims to eliminate taxes on the industry  curb Medicaid funding  reshape subsidies to cover low income people under private insurance  and offer provisions to stabilize insurance exchanges set up under former president Barack Obama s 2010 healthcare law  Additionally  the surge in Clovis Oncology   NASDAQ CLVS   following its positive cancer drug data for Rubraca spread bullishness in the overall sector  read    Further  the efforts of Trump s administration to ease the drug pricing issue  expedite new drug approvals and enact reforms to free cash held overseas for tax reason by large U S  pharmaceutical companies are driving the rally in the stocks  Moreover  the sector is poised to benefit from other encouraging industry trends including hopes of increased M A activity  an accelerated pace of innovation  promising drug launches  growing importance of biosimilars  cost cutting efforts  an aging population  expanding insurance coverage  growing middle class  an insatiable demand for new drugs  and ever increasing health care spending Given the encouraging

PTGX Technical Analysis

PTGX opened trading yesterday at  12 28 which was up from the previous day s trading close of  9 22  equivalent to a 49  increase  PTGX closed trading yesterday at  11 82  Taking a look at the daily chart we can see the last time PTGX traded above these levels we have to go back to April 5th when it traded at  12 38 
Taking a closer look at the daily chart we can see that before the spike up PTGX had been in an overall downward trend dating back to December 5  2016 when it traded at  26 24  PTGX has a float of 7 03 million shares and traded 124 38 times the normal daily trading volume on Tuesday 
For day trading purposes  I would like to see PTGX open trading on Wednesday above  11 25 and if it does I would be looking to take a long position at the bell  My stop loss would be  0 30 from my entry position fearing anything more than that and the stock would start to fill in the gap up

198839,420355,JNJ,Integra LifeSciences  IART  Q1 Earnings  A Beat In Store ,opinion,We expect Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corporation   NASDAQ IART   to beat expectations when it reports its first quarter 2017 results  after market close on Apr 26 Last quarter  the company s earnings met the Zacks Consensus Estimate  In fact  in the last four quarters  Integra s earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate at an average of 3 02   Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement Why a Likely Positive Surprise Our proven model shows that Integra is likely to beat earnings because it has the perfect combination of two key ingredients Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corporation Price and EPS Surprise    Zacks ESP   Integra has an  of  7 50  as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 43 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is at 40 cents  A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise   You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Zacks Rank  Integra currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Note that stocks with Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates Conversely  we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions The combination of Integra s Zacks Rank  3 and  7 50  ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat What is Driving the Better Than Expected Earnings Management has adopted a 3 pillar strategy to optimize  execute and accelerate growth  Integra aims to expand economies of scale in the wake of escalating operating expenses  Also  the company aims to expand through inorganic means through profitable integration of new products and businesses and also organically In line with the core growth strategy  Integra is on a buyout spree  Also  post the fourth quarter of 2016  the company launched several regenerative products such as CUSA Clarity ultrasonic tissue ablation platform and Titan Press Fit Reverse Shoulder for Fracture  The company also announced full commercial availability of its Cadence Total Ankle System  a new ankle prosthesis developed in partnership with four world leading foot and ankle surgeons  Management is hopeful that synergies from these new products will be reflected in the first quarter s top line results We are also encouraged by Integra s consistent growth at its Specialty Surgical Solution segment on account of its core expertise in neurosurgery  The segment experienced strong 7  revenue growth in the previously reported fourth quarter 2016  Management is also investing substantially in the segment to drive growth  We expect the strong top line uptrend to continue in the upcoming first quarter as well The company s decision to acquire Codman Neurosurgery  from Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ   and Derma Sciences have already boosted the market sentiment  We believe  post completion  these strategic buyouts should bolster Integra s business further within Specialty Surgical space Meanwhile  Integra issued a fiscal 2017 guidance  The company currently projects 2017 revenues in the range of  1 12 billion to  1 14 billion  representing growth of 12 5  to 15 5  and organic sales growth between 7  and 8 5   For the first quarter of 2017  revenues are expected in the band of  252 million to  256 million  representing 5  to 6  organic growth On the flip side  in the last three months  Integra has been trading below the Zacks categorized  sub industry  The stock lost 3 5   wider than the 1 2  decline of the broader industry  Factors such as rising operating expenses and pre closing costs related to the Codman Neurosurgery acquisition are believed to have had a negative impact on Integra s share price  Also  currency fluctuation and intense competition are major headwinds that are likely to linger Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other companies you may consider as our model shows that they also have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in the upcoming quarter Galectin Therapautics  Inc    NASDAQ GALT   has an Earnings ESP of  13 33  and a Zacks Rank  2  You can see Hill Rom Holdings Inc   NYSE HRC   has an Earnings ESP of  1 27  and a

198857,420373,JNJ,S P 500 Weekly Earnings Update  The Treasury Market Was Busy This Week ,opinion,"The big news this week was the Treasury market and the rise in yields  but more on that in a minute 
With 488 companies having reported Q4  16 earnings already  there is little left to know  and instead we look forward 
Thomson Reuters data by the numbers  Source  This Week in Earnings dated 3 3 17   

Forward 4 Quarter estimate   131 22 vs last week s  131 43
P E ratio  18 x 
PEG ratio  2 1 x 
S P 500 earnings yield  5 51  vs last week s 5 55 
Year over year growth of the forward estimate   8 49  vs last week s  8 41 

It is always welcome to see the  forward growth rate   last bullet  tick higher each week  and this week the forward growth rate increased again 
However  the big news this week was the rise in Treasury yields  as the 10 year Treasury jumped 17 basis points from 2 32  last Friday to 2 49  as of Friday  March 3  17 
17 bp s is a sizable increase in yield and it came as the probability on a fed funds rate increase from 50 to 75 bp s rose from 33 early last week  pre Dudley s speech  to 90  as of Friday 
No surprise that the sharpest increase in the 10 Year Treasury occurred the week of the Presidential election as it rose from 1 78  to 2 12  or a whopping 34 basis points 
The high for this move since November 8th is 2 60   which occurred mid December  16 
All the technicians are watching 2 60    2 62  and then 3 02  which was the 2013 high tick and the highest 10 year yield in the last 9 years 
Both the 1 Year and 2 Year Treasuries traded to 7   8 years highs this week  highs not seen since November  2008 
Analysis   Conclusion  Higher interest rates have a habit of putting a wet blanket on rising stock prices  however  that wasn t true in 2013  when the S P 500 rose 32  and the 10 year Treasury yield rose from 2  to 3   The momentum trade might see some heavy sledding if rates rise rapidly  but rising interest rates are also a sign that the US economy is returning to a more  normal  environment

198886,420402,JNJ,S P 500 Rallies To Its Cycle Top,opinion,"VIX declined to its lowest point in 2 months on Monday  while the VIX ETFs appear to have bottomed on Tuesday If this is correct  then we may see the VIX and its ETFs rally for the next three weeks  The next important milestones are the Flag trendline near 22 50 and Cycle Top resistance at 24 27 where a long term breakout may occur and the Cyclical uptrend may begin in earnest The media is panning VIX  claiming it no longer signals danger in the markets 
 Bloomberg  Rest in peace  VIX  You re no longer the fear gauge for global markets 
The Bank for International Settlements has found a better barometer to capture the nervousness that starts as a slight reduction in global banks  leverage  is magnified by European lenders as a dollar squeeze in Asian supply chains  and reverberates around the world as a financial tightness felt by everyone 
Everyone  except the Chicago Board Options Exchange s Volatility Index 
S P 500 rallies to its Cycle Top 

SPX rallied to challenge its Cycle Top Resistance at 2215 55 and slightly exceeded its Fibonacci 61 8  measure of Wave  3  at 2208 67  It may venture higher next week  but either the Cycle Top resistance or trendline resistance at 2225 00 may prevail  Point 5 of the Broadening Topmay be complete or nearly so 
 WSJ  U S  stocks notched fresh records  capping a week when the Dow Jones Industrial Average breached 19000 for the first time 
It is the third consecutive week of gains for stocks as investors have bet on expectations for reduced corporate taxation and regulation and greater infrastructure spending  Thanks to these past three weeks  the Dow Jones Industrials are on track to end the year with 9 9  gains  which would mark their best annual finish since 2013 

 Nothing is stopping the market at this point   said Jonathan Corpina  senior managing partner at Meridian Equity Partners 

The NDX rally is blocked by its Cycle Top 

NDX has been unable to better its October 25 high at 4911 76  causing a non confirmation among the major indices  A decline beneath Intermediate term support at 4810 74 confirms a new sell signal  It may be imprudent to be long beyond this point 
 ZeroHedge  Another month  and the pain for the hedge fund industry just keeps getting more intense 
According to the latest Evestment report  investors redeemed an estimated net  14 2 billion from hedge funds in October  Year to date  there has been a net  77 0 billion removed from the industry  October s outflow was the fourth month of redemptions in the last five and seventh in 2016  Due to the breadth of products experiencing outflows  and the persistence of redemptions outweighing new allocations  it is clear the industry is experiencing a crisis  like wave of negative investor sentiment 
One almost wonders how much higher the market can keep rising with redemption requests flooding countless back offices  We hope to find out soon 
High Yield Bond Index also falls short of its Cycle Top 

The High Yield Bond Index used its weekly Intermediate term support at 159 83 as a springboard to challenge its prior high at 162 79  Should it succeed  it may then rally to its Cycle Top resistance at 164 03 A failure at either level may produce a sharp decline to mid Cycle support at 145 72 
 WSJ  Count the junk bond market among those sending relatively optimistic signs about a Donald Trump administration 
Prices are dropping  and money has been flowing out of high yield bond funds  But risk premiums haven t risen  and companies are still issuing bonds suggesting that a market renowned for picking up early signs of economic stress retains a benign outlook on the U S  economy 
On Tuesday  Weatherford International PLC sold  540 million of bonds  40 million more than initially expected  The same day  the oil field services company was assigned a lowly triple C rating by Fitch Ratings  a four notch downgrade from its previous rating 
USB finally ready to bounce 

The Long Bond took a breather from its decline this week  There is a high probability of a rally that may last the next three weeks that may challenge weekly mid Cycle resistance at 158 23 However critical supports have been broken and there is room for more downside to come  A panic may propel USB to its 35 year trendline at 137 30 
 ZeroHedge  The long end of the US Treasury curve rallied on the week  for the first time since Trump s win  with 30 Year yields ending down almost 3bps  as a last minute panic bid hit stocks and bonds at the early market close  and despite the exuberance in US bank stocks  the yield curve continues to collapse   
At the cash equity close today  bonds and stocks were suddenly both bid    with 30Y back at 3 00 
The Euro retests the Cup with Handle 

The Euro has been challenging the Lip of its inverted Cup with Handle formation this week  It achieved a probable Master Cycle low on Wednesday and may be due for a three week retracement  Since the Broadening Wedge trendline has already been broken we should expect to see its target coming into view early next year 
 ZeroHedge  A reasonable question that many Europeans might ask would be whether it is not perhaps time to review priorities 
Perhaps the time has come to look at whether it remains worth it  in terms of the potential loss of human life  to remain party to the 1961 Convention  which would prohibit a country from stripping a returning ISIS fighter of his citizenship in order to prevent him from entering the country 
The terrorist as poor  traumatized victim who needs help seems to be a recurring theme among European politicians  But what about the rights of the poor  traumatized citizens who elected these politicians 
Euro Stoxx 50 has another inside week 

The Euro Stoxx 50 Index bounced from its Intermediate term support at 3019 79  but only managed to make another inside week The Cycles Model suggests the period of relative strength may end next week  The Index may have been able to resist making a sell signal so far  but that may change should that support be violated with new lows 
 Bloomberg  European shares closed at a one month high  capping their longest streak of weekly gains since July 
The Stoxx Europe 600 Index rose 0 2 percent at the close  taking its advance for the week to 0 9 percent  The number of its shares changing hands was about 40 percent lower than the 30 day average  with U S  markets closing early following yesterday s Thanksgiving holiday  Actelion Ltd  SIX ATLN   led a rally in health care shares  surging 18 percent after confirming that Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  has approached the Swiss drug maker about a potential takeover 
European shares have rebounded 4 2 percent from a low on Nov  4 on bets that Donald Trump s administration will lead to increased infrastructure spending  A related rally in copper prices pushed European miners to their highest prices since June 2015 on Thursday  While the Stoxx 600 has been trading in a tight range  its longer term average level is getting close to crossing above its shorter term mean 
The Yen completes a long retracement 

The Yen may have completed its longest decline in two years after three weeks of solid declines  The expected turn in the Yen may have finally arrived today  about two weeks later than indicated by the Model  We may see up to four weeks of Cyclical strength ahead The decline does not negate the Cup with Handle formation 
 Bloomberg  The dollar posted its biggest three week gain versus the yen since 1995 as traders view a U S  interest rate increase next month as a certainty 
The greenback has surged about 10 percent since Nov  4 to an eight month high against the Japanese currency  Expectations that President elect Donald Trump will implement policies to spur inflation and growth drove U S  Treasury yields to their highest in a year  underpinning demand for the dollar and strengthening the case for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates  Minutes of the central bank s November meeting this week showed officials said the labor market has tightened  with some indicating a rate hike should happen in December 
The Nikkei 225 rallies to new retracement highs 

The Nikkei rallied to a new retracement high after breaking through mid cycle resistance last week nearly reaching a 60  retracement of the 2015 decline It appears to have a few more days of Cyclical strength in which it may meet its 61 8  Fibonacci retracement  However  the reversal may be sharp and without warning  Should the Head   Shoulders neckline be broken  a panic decline may ensue 
 Reuters  Japan s Nikkei share average rose for a seventh straight session on Friday after U S  shares soared and the dollar jumped further against the yen  lifting prospects for better corporate earnings 
The Nikkei rose 0 6 percent to 18 438 97 points by mid morning  extending its longest winning streak since November 2015 
For the week  the benchmark index is poised to rise 2 8 percent 
US Dollar Index reaches its Cycle Top 

USD rallied toward its cycle Top resistance at 102 00  reaching 101 97 before reversing today  Current support is at 100 60  A decline beneath that level may cause a rapid move from bullish to bearish as traders find themselves wrong footed 
 ZeroHedge  Having soared to fresh 13 year highs in a quiet overnight session on thin liquidity due to the US Thanksgiving holiday  which sent the USD JPY just shy of 114 and the Yuan to 6 96  the dollar pared back its weekly advance with modest profit taking after traders wondered if the rally has gotten  too stretched  
 Expectations of rises in U S  inflation and interest rates have driven the greenback to a gain of more than 6 percent in October and November combined  its strongest performance over a similar period since its rally in early 2015  Most investors expect those gains to continue  but a combination of the Thanksgiving break in the United States  market participants  need to process corporate flows at the end of the month and a raft of risks in the first half of December all speak for cashing in some of those gains now 
Gold declines to its Broadening Top trendline 

Gold declined to the lower trendline of its Orthodox Broadening Top formation  However  the decline may not be over  yet The Cycles Model suggests possibly another two weeks of decline  which agrees with the Broadening Top pattern which calls for a continued decline to the vicinity of 1150 00 Nonetheless  it may be time to be on guard for a reversal pattern
 Bloomberg  Gold pared a third weekly drop as the dollar halted a rally that sent bullion prices to a nine month low and pushed silver into a bear market 
Bullion s first gain in four days cut this week s loss to 2 percent  Prices have tumbled as strong economic data and the prospect of more spending after Donald Trump s U S  election win boosted bets for higher interest rates  Investors are selling out of gold backed funds at the fastest pace in three years 
The metal rebounded on Friday as the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index retreated from a recent high  Gold s decline earlier stalled at  1 171 18 an ounce  which is near a 61 8 percent retracement of the rally from December to July  The Fibonacci figure is used by some traders and analysts to determine support levels 
Crude Oil retraces to mid Cycle resistance 

Crude bounced from its Intermediate term support at 46 06 to challenge mid Cycle resistance at 48 81  where it peaked on Wednesday The cycles Model suggests a decline may be imminent  while a significant low may be reached in approximately 3 weeks There is now the probability of a decline that may test the February low  After 6 months of being range bound  traders may not have seen this decline coming 
 Reuters  U S  crude fell nearly 4 percent on Friday  dragged down by uncertainty over whether the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries will reach an output deal  after Saudi Arabia said it will not attend talks on Monday with non OPEC producers to discuss supply cuts 
Brent crude futures settled at  47 24 a barrel  down  1 76 or 3 59 percent  U S  crude futures settled down  1 90 a barrel at  46 06  a 3 96 percent decline  Prices continued to decline in post settlement trading  dropping as low as  45 88 a barrel 
Shanghai Composite challenges mid Cycle resistance 

The Shanghai Index challenged mid Cycle resistance at 3269 00 today  making nearly a 60  retracement of its early 2016 decline Its cyclical strength is waning and a reversal from this resistance may lead to an inevitable breakdown The fractal Model suggests the Shanghai is due for another 1 000 point drop  possibly starting next week  The next Master Cycle low may be due in early January 
 ZeroHedge  Over the weekend we reported that as Obama was speaking at the APEC summit in Peru  hoping to salvage his global trade legacy  the TPP  China s President Xi Jinping officially called for the launch of the Free Trade Area of Asia Pacific for  institutional guarantee of open economy   a move many had expected would take place as China was eager to fill in the void left by the US in any trans Pacific trade treaty As we previously reported  in his speech in Lima  Xi Jinping sought to position himself as a leader in global commerce  vowing to support trade  The attendees signaled  deepening economic integration and opposing trade protectionism   the Foreign Ministry spokesman said on Tuesday Then  overnight  China got a present when Trump announced in a brief video statement that his first executive order upon becoming president would be to remove the US from the TPP  That s all Beijing needed to hear and this morning China said it hoped to conclude an Asia wide trade pact as soon as possible  in what the WSJ dubbed was  a sign of Beijing s intent to broaden its regional influence amid the apparent collapse of the U S  backed Trans Pacific Partnership  
The Banking Index reaches the trendline of its Orthodox Broadening Top 

BKX surged to the upper trendline of its Orthodox Broadening Top at 87 00 today This may well be the terminal push as the Cycles Model suggests the period of strength ends on Monday  Once broken  we may expect this three year pattern to unwind very quickly 
   Shares in US banks have surged since Donald Trump won the US election  It is in expectation of the president elect s proposed bonfire of what he believes are rules and regulations that hamper business 
But in banking  many of those rules were put in place after the last financial crisis in the hope of preventing a future meltdown 
Now Neel Kashkari  president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis is proposing an alternative that may be more in line with Donald Trump s way of thinking 
He believes that banks should be forced to massively increase their capital reserves   the amount of cash they are obliged to keep in hand for the day when everything goes wrong at once 
   The long end of the US Treasury curve rallied on the week  for the first time since Trump s win  with 30Y yields ending down almost 3bps  as a last minute panic bid hit stocks and bonds at the early market close  and despite the exuberance in US bank stocks  the yield curve continues to collapse   
At the cash equity close today  bonds and stocks were suddenly both bid    with 30Y back at 3 00 
   Back in the summer we wrote about an IMF report that flagged Deutsche Bank  DE DBKGn  as the  most important net contributor to systemic risks    Those who read our site frequently were likely not terribly surprised by the IMF s conclusion 
Among the G SIBs  Deutsche Bank appears to be the most important net contributor to systemic risks  followed by HSBC and Credit Suisse  SIX CSGN   In turn  Commerzbank  DE CBKG   while an important player in Germany  does not appear to be a contributor to systemic risks globally  In general  Commerzbank tends to be the recipient of inward spillover from U S  and European G SIBs  The relative importance of Deutsche Bank underscores the importance of risk management  intense supervision of G SIBs and the close monitoring of their cross border exposures  as well as rapidly completing capacity to implement the new resolution regime 
That said  we suspect the latest ranking of global systemically important banks  G SIBs  by the Financial Stability Board may be a bit more surprising to our readers  among others  as it features two of America s largest banks right at the very top 
   If everything is so awesome  with a growth inflation miracle just around the corner  then why is the US treasury yield curve collapsing in a dismal growth outlook implying manner 
Following the knee jerk spike on the election  5s30s have crashed to 6 week lows   
Nowhere is this decoupling from reality narrative more obvious than in the banks as NIM is a spread not an absolute

3 Biotech Stocks to Add as M A Hopes Rise

	2016 has not been a great year for mergers and acquisitions  M As  in the pharma and biotech sector although some headline deals like the Pfizer Medivation and the Teva Actavis Generics acquisitions were completed this year  While expectations were high that this year too  the pharma and biotech sector would see lots of M A activity that did not happen  with the focus being mostly on small bolt on acquisitions and licensing deals and agreements 

Will a Trump Presidency Trigger More M A Deals for Biotechs 
	Although it may be too early to speculate  there is a lot of chatter about a possible increase in M As in the pharma and biotech sector now that Donald Trump is President elect 
	Basically  the Trump victory is being viewed as a positive for the biotech and pharma sector  There are several reasons for this  the foremost being the drug pricing issue  The general view is that a Hillary Clinton win would have been a negative for pharma and biotech stocks given her stand on rising drug prices and her plans to address the excessive price hikes of treatments that have been available for years and to lower drug prices for all Americans  With Clinton s frequent rhetoric regarding drug prices  biotech and pharma stocks have been under intense pressure for more than a year 
	Trump  on the other hand  has not been so vocal about drug pricing though he did call for price transparency from all healthcare providers and drug re importation  Not just that  his pro business stand is also expected to benefit the sector  Major biotech and pharma companies should gain from Trump s proposed tax plan and proposal to repatriate corporate profits held offshore at a one time tax rate of 10  
	With focus on drug pricing expected to subside and given the possibility of repatriation of funds  hopes are up that M A activity will pick up with companies like Pfizer  NYSE PFE   Merck  NYSE MRK   Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  expected to take the lead  Big companies with deep pockets often look to replenish and boost their pipelines as well as portfolios by acquiring companies with innovative pipelines and technology Stock Picks
	Here we highlight 3 companies that have often been considered attractive take over targets and have a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy  ARIAD Pharmaceuticals Inc    NASDAQ          Cambridge  MA based ARIAD focuses on bringing innovative treatments for rare cancers to market  ARIAD  which already has a marketed product  Iclusig  in its portfolio  could well become a two product firm as early as 2017 if it gains FDA approval for brigatinib in April  Meanwhile  Iclusig s growth should be driven by new patient starts  extended treatment duration and label expansion  ARIAD s product portfolio  potential brigatinib approval and its next wave of discovery and development programs such as AP32788 and the immuno oncology program make it an attractive acquisition target  The Zacks Rank  2 stock has a solid earnings track record having surpassed expectations in each of the last three quarters 

ARIAD PHARMA Price and Consensus

   

Incyte Corporation   NASDAQ          Wilmington  DE based Incyte has two marketed products in its portfolio and a strong pipeline  Flagship product  Jakafi   a JAK1 JAK2 inhibitor   looks well positioned for growth and is expected to bring in sales of  850    855 million in 2016  Moreover  with Gilead presenting mixed results on its experimental JAK inhibitor  momelotinib  the competitive threat for Jakafi seems to have gone down considerably  Incyte  a Zacks Rank  2 stock  has a robust pipeline as well with a focus on the highly sought after immuno oncology space  Jakafi s strong performance along with the company s pipeline makes Incyte an attractive acquisition target 

INCYTE CORP Price and Consensus

   

Exelixis  Inc    NASDAQ          South San Francisco  CA based Exelixis is also focused on bringing cancer treatments to market  Approved products include Cabometyx  advanced kidney cancer   Cometriq  certain forms of thyroid cancer  and Cotellic  advanced melanoma   Exelixis  earnings track record is good having surpassed expectations in three of the last four quarters  Cabometyx is experiencing rapid and broad uptake in the market with label expansion opportunities leaving room for upside  The Zacks Rank  2 stock has quite a few pipeline catalysts lined up for the coming quarters  You can see   

EXELIXIS INC Price and Consensus

   

	The three companies discussed above are not the only ones with acquisition potential  Several other companies are often viewed as acquisition targets  The bottom line is that companies with innovative technologies and pipelines are highly sought after with niche disease areas like nonalcoholic steatohepatitis  NASH   immuno oncology  multiple sclerosis and hepatitis C virus  HCV  in demand  Treatments for orphan diseases are also in demand Zacks  Best Investment Ideas for Long Term Profit

198906,420422,JNJ,Aduro  ADRO  Stock Down On Wider than Expected Q3 Loss,opinion,"Aduro BioTech  Inc    NASDAQ ADRO   reported third quarter 2016 loss of 54 cents per share  wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 49 cents  The company had reported earnings of a penny in the year ago quarter  Aduro s shares were down almost 8  since the release of its third quarter 2016 results Since Aduro does not have any approved product in its portfolio yet  the company s top line solely comprises collaboration  license and grant revenues Quarterly revenues plunged 80 2  year over year to  3 79 million  The top line deterioration was mainly due to the full recognition of upfront license fee from Johnson   Johnson s   NYSE JNJ   Janssen Biotech  Inc  in 2015  Revenues were also below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 94 million 
We note that Aduro has exclusive research and license agreements with Janssen for the development and commercialization of candidates in the LADD platform  including ADU 741  GVAX for prostate cancer  and ADU 214  Under these agreements  Aduro has granted Janssen exclusive rights to develop and commercialize the LADD candidates for the treatment of prostate and lung cancers 
Research and development expenses escalated 61 2  to  19 million mainly due to licensing fees related to the company s STING technology platform and additional personnel related costs including stock based compensation  partially offset by a decline in contract manufacturing and clinical trial expenses for the pancreatic cancer program 
General and administrative expenses were  8 6 million  up approximately 24  year over year  The increase was primarily due to higher personnel related costs  including stock based compensation  and the expansion of its office and laboratory facilities 
In Oct 2016  Aduro announced that studies evaluating its LADD based agents have been placed on a partial clinical hold and new patient enrollment has been halted  The hold was placed after a blood culture sample taken from an indwelling port of a metastatic pancreatic cancer patient tested positive for Listeria 
Aduro is currently working with the FDA to lift the partial hold so that new patient enrollment in the LADD studies can resume 
We expect investor focus to remain on further updates by the company

	Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 17 major stocks  including Johnson   Johnson  NYSE      Wells Fargo  NYSE      Facebook  NASDAQ     and Qualcomm  NASDAQ      

Johnson   Johnson   shares have bucked the broader healthcare slump this year and are up almost 12  year to date  While the company is faced with a number of headwinds like unfavorable currency movements  increased competition from generics  pricing pressures and an uncertain global macroeconomic backdrop  the analyst believes that JNJ s diversified business model  deep product pipeline  lack of cyclicality and financial strength position it for continued momentum going forward  We saw this in the company s Q3 earnings report when it beat on the top  and bottom lines and provided favorable outlook  The analyst expects these trends to continue in the coming periods as well   You can     

Wells Fargo   has long maintained a reputation for disciplined and reliable operations and an attractive retail banking franchise  Recent quarterly results showing strong growth in loans and deposits reconfirm the bank s inherent strengths  but they have been totally offset lately by the sales practices controversy that has already cost the well regarded CEO his position  The new management team is making all the right moves and further downside risks in the stock may be low at this stage  the stock is already down more than  16  year to date vs  a roughly 2  decline for the peer banks   but it will likely take a while for clouds to fully lifted   You can  

Facebook shares have lagged following the company s quarterly report when it came out with blowout numbers for the September period  but appeared cautious on future growth prospects  These near term challenges notwithstanding  Facebook s status as a Technology powerhouse with an enviable future earnings potential remains unchanged  Driving this is the company s huge user and advertiser base  higher engagement levels along with monetization opportunities presented by the Instagram  Oculus  Messenger and WhatsApp properties   You can  

Qualcomm   shares have surged nearly 34  year to date  Qualcomm  which reported strong fourth quarter fiscal 2016 results  has entered into an agreement to buy Netherlands based chipset giant NXP Semiconductors  The analyst likes this deal since the combined entity is likely to generate annual revenues of over  30 billion position itself as a strong player in the next generation mobile chipset segment  However  regulatory proceedings against Qualcomm are a major headwind   You can

5 Stocks for World Mental Health Day

World Mental Health Day is observed every year on Oct 10    this year  the theme is  psychological first aid   which covers both psychological and social support  According to information provided by the National Alliance on Mental Illness  about one in five adults in the U S  or 43 8 million people experience mental illness in a given year and approximately 1 in 25 adults in the U S  or 10 million people experience a serious mental illness in a given year that substantially interferes with or limits one or more major life activities 

Given these statistics  it is not surprising that several pharma and biotech companies are involved in developing and selling drugs that target mental health disorders which include a wide range of conditions like attention deficit hyperactivity disorder  ADHD   anxiety disorders  bipolar disorder  depression  eating disorders and schizophrenia among others 
	The market potential for drugs targeting mental health disorders is huge  In fact  due to the social stigma and ignorance associated with such conditions  a large part of the market remains untapped as people don t seek treatment or are unaware of their symptoms 

5 Stocks to Consider
	Ahead of World Mental Health Day  let us look at some of the companies which are actively pursuing the development of treatments for various types of mental illnesses 
	To guide investors to the right picks  we highlight 5 stocks that carry a favorable Zacks Rank   Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy  or  3  Hold   You can see   
	The Zacks Rank is a reliable tool that helps you to trade with confidence regardless of your trading style and risk tolerance  To learn more about how you can use this proven system for market beating gains  visit  
	First on our list is Zacks Rank  1 stock GW Pharmaceuticals plc  NASDAQ      which is working on the development of plant derived cannabinoid therapeutics  The company s proprietary cannabinoid product platform targets a broad range of disease areas including schizophrenia which affects about 1 1  of the adult population in the U S   as per the National Institute of Mental Health  While GW Pharma has been more in the news for its progress with the development of Epidiolex  childhood onset epilepsy   the company has an experimental schizophrenia treatment in its pipeline   GWP42003  GW Pharma has completed a mid stage study on the candidate which demonstrated positive proof of concept  The candidate showed notable anti psychotic effects as well as demonstrated the ability to reduce the characteristic movement disorders induced by currently available anti psychotic agents  Shares of this UK based stock  which has been witnessing positive estimate revisions  are up 94 4  year to date  YTD  

Shire plc   NASDAQ      is well known for its ADHD offerings including Vyvanse  Adderall XR and Intuniv even though some of these products are facing generic competition  The company s neuroscience division delivered sales of  2 5 billion in 2015 and continues to perform well driven by its strong presence in the ADHD market  Shire is working on developing new treatment options for the growing adult ADHD market  The company expects to re submit its regulatory filing for SHP465 in the U S  and is hoping to gain approval in the second quarter of 2017 followed by product launch in the second half of 2017  The company believes that SHP465 has the potential to address a segment of the adult ADHD market that still has unmet needs for non residual control  Shire s share of the U S  ADHD prescription market in Dec 2015 was 16 7   compared to 16 2  in Dec 2014  
	Shire also has a presence in the binge eating disorder  BED  market with Vyvanse being approved for the treatment of moderate to severe BED in adults  According to information provided by Shire  BED is the most common eating disorder in the U S   affecting about 2 8 million adults  Shire  a Zacks Rank  3 stock  has a strong earnings track record with the company beating expectations in each of the last four quarters with an average surprise of 8 41

	Meanwhile  one of the most promising candidates in J J s pipeline is esketamine  an investigational antidepressant medication with blockbuster potential  Esketamine recently got breakthrough therapy designation from the FDA for major depressive disorder with imminent risk for suicide  According to the National Institute of Mental Health  in 2015 about 16 1 million adults in the U S  had at least one major depressive episode in the past year  FDA approval would make esketamine one of the first new approaches to treat major depressive disorder in the last 50 years  Esketamine has breakthrough therapy designation for treatment resistant depression as well

198942,420458,JNJ,Time To Buy More Johnson   Johnson Stock,opinion,"There are plenty of investors that are afraid right now  Whether they fear the impact of the election or a Fed move on interest rates or something else it has led to a lot of money sitting on the sidelines  As a market technician this bearish sentiment with prices at all time highs is a very bullish signal  Yes I said BULLISH 
So with all that dry powder lying around what should investors do  Well one could buy more powder  like Johnson s Baby powder  Or better yet  buy Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ   stock  The chart is compelling for this 
After a long shallow pullback from June 2014 until October 2015  Johnson   Johnson started to move higher  Not a sharp steep move up but a slow steady run higher  That lasted until July this year when it started to digest its move up  Now it looks like the digestion is done and it is ready for the next leg higher 
The chart above shows weekly movement to the upside  It also shows the RSI reversing back higher  That is a bullish sign  And the stock has gone from selling to accumulation again  How far will it go  One view would be to place an AB CD pattern on the chart which gives a target to about 148 over the next 6 months  A move over 125 would give strong confirmation  Keep a tight stop or small size until then

198952,420468,JNJ,Johnson   Johnson On Track Ror Rally,opinion,"Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  started a downward trend just as the month of August started  This significant stock price movement pushed shares lower over the past 6 weeks  The multinational company started to regain its strength earlier in the month of September after retracing almost all of the gains in the aftermath of Britain s exit from the European Union 
After the last two days of positive price movement  the decline may have finally come to an end  placing Johnson   Johnson on track for a new bullish trend 
During the Brexit selling wave  the JNJ stock incurred very little damage  In fact  on the 27th of June when the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the session with a loss of 260 points  the company s stock closed in 0 8 percent higher  In the following day  the JNJ stock hit fresh 2016 highs as a buying wave which spanned 4 days resulted in an exceptional breakout  The shares of the multinational firm moved steadily to the upside until the middle of July as the  126 level was hit 
Johnson   Johnson stalled at this area and after hovering just below this strong resistance for 2 and a half weeks  a significant decline started  Now that this phase seems to have ended  market players will be rewarded with very low risk entry opportunity 
The narrow basing action which took place over the previous two weeks has confirmed the  117 level as a strong support level  This region includes the June 28 breakout and the low for September 
In the near term  bulls should regard JNJ stock as a low risk buy between the  117 and  119 levels  We believe that a close below the  116 mark would signal that more basing will be required before the decline from the July high has run its course 
The  121 region will offer a significant hurdle  but once this area is completely broken out  the JNJ stock should have sufficient momentum to surpass its 50 day moving average ",2016-09-26,TradingBanks,https://www.investing.com/analysis/johnson---johnson-on-track-ror-rally-200155575,200155575

198966,420482,JNJ,Pfizer  PFE  Breast Cancer Drug Ibrance Wins CHMP Backing ,opinion,"Pfizer Inc    NYSE PFE   came up with a couple of announcements related to its breast cancer drug  Ibrance and PF 06438179  a biosimilar version of Johnson   Johnson s   NYSE JNJ   blockbuster drug  Remicade  infliximab  
Ibrance a Step Closer to EU Approval
Pfizer announced that the European Medicines Agency s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use  CHMP  has rendered a positive opinion in favor of the approval of the company s marketing authorization for Ibrance  Ibrance is under review in the EU for the treatment of women with hormone receptor positive  human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative  HR  HER2   locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer  The CHMP has indicated that Ibrance is to be used in combination with an aromatase inhibitor as well as in combination with Faslodex  fulvestrant  in women who have received prior endocrine therapy 
The favorable opinion of the CHMP will now be reviewed by the European Commission  EC   With the CHMP in favor of approving Ibrance  we believe chances of gaining EU approval are high  A decision should be out by year end 
Approval would make Ibrance the first CDK 4 6 inhibitor to be approved by the EC 
We note that Ibrance is already approved in the U S  for the treatment of HR  HER2  advanced or metastatic breast cancer in combination with Novartis AG s   NYSE NVS   Femara  letrozole  as initial endocrine based therapy in postmenopausal women or Faslodex in women with disease progression following endocrine therapy  The indication in combination with Femara was cleared in the U S  under accelerated approval 
Ibrance has received broad patient and physician acceptance with an encouraging feedback  and the company plans to continue to build momentum in the U S  by penetrating all lines of therapy  The drug has recorded sales of  942 million in the first half of 2016 since its launch in Feb 2015 
Approval in the EU would boost the commercial potential of the drug significantly  Meanwhile  Pfizer is also working on expanding Ibrance s label by targeting different segments of breast cancer patients 
Biosimilar Remicade Hits Phase III Primary Endpoint
Pfizer announced positive top line data from a phase III confirmatory study   REFLECTIONS B537 02 on PF 06438179  infliximab Pfizer   The multi national  randomized  double blind  two arm  parallel group phase III study evaluated the efficacy  safety  and immunogenicity of PF 06438179  against Remicade in combination with methotrexate when administered intravenously for the treatment of patients with moderate to severely active rheumatoid arthritis  RA  who have had an inadequate response to methotrexate therapy 
The study hit the primary endpoint and showed that PF 06438179 demonstrated similar efficacy to Remicade as measured by the American College of Rheumatology 20 response at Week 14 of study treatment 
PF 06438179 is presently in development for all currently approved indications of Remicade  We note that Pfizer had divested in Feb 2016 the rights to the development  commercialization and manufacture of PF 06438179 in the European Economic Area  EEA  to Novartis  generic arm  Sandoz  Pfizer  on the other hand  retains the commercialization and manufacturing rights to PF 06438179 in all countries outside the EEA 
We remind investors that Celltrion Inc  s biosimilar version of Remicade  Inflectra  infliximab dyyb   had gained FDA approval earlier this year in April  Pfizer has exclusive commercialization rights to Inflectra in the U S  and certain other territories

198984,420500,JNJ,Merck Offers Value and Steady Dividend Growth,opinion,"Merck  NYSE MRK  is a  that has paid a consistent dividend since 1970 and has grown its dividend at a 1 8  annual rate over the last 10 years 
They have been able to continually pay a dividend during difficult times thanks to a   attractive operating margins  and reliable free cash flow generation 
This is the type of consistency I like to see for investments I consider for our Conservative Retirees dividend portfolio 
Currently  the business looks attractive with a nearly 3  dividend yield and optionality for additional dividend increases  however  with many large pharmaceutical companies struggling with billion dollar revenue drugs  patent protection expiring  should investors continue to count on Merck s dividend stability Business OverviewMerck has an extremely long company history which dates back to a German apothecary shop in the 17th century  However  they trace their roots in the United States only back to the late 1800s where they were established to be a chemical supplier for their German parent  Today  they operate the business primarily through two main categories  Pharmaceuticals  88  of sales  and Animal Health  8 4  of sales  
The Pharmaceuticals business discovers  develops  and produces therapeutic and preventive agents for the treatment of human disorders  Merck s target markets include cardiovascular  diabetes  general medicine and women s health  hepatitis  HIV  acute care  immunology  oncology  respiratory  and vaccines 
In 2015  their top 10 therapeutics accounted for around 47  of total sales and included 9 different billion dollar drugs  The largest therapeutics include Januvia  treatment of type 2 diabetes   Zetia  cholesterol   Janumet  type 2 diabetes   Gardasil Gardasil 9  HPV   and Remicade  inflammatory diseases  
The Animal Health business discovers  develops  and produces products for livestock  poultry  companion animals  and aquaculture  Their products range from antibiotics for use in cattle and swine to a chewable tablet that kills fleas and ticks in dogs to vaccines against bacterial diseases in fish 
Overall  Merck is one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world by market capitalization  only behind Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ   Novartis AG  NYSE NVS   and Pfizer  NYSE PFE   Compared to these competitors  Merck had sales of over  39 billion in 2015 versus  70 1 billion at Johnson   Johnson   49 4B at Novartis  and  48 9B at Pfizer Business AnalysisThe business model for a multinational pharmaceutical company comes down to investing in R D  patenting new therapeutics  and then using manufacturing and distribution scale to get the products to market 
The cost to bring a drug to market after years of research  development  and clinical trials is astronomical  Some estimates now put the total cost at over  2 billion dollars  However  once a company gets a new product to market  they enjoy years of monopoly status with a recession resistant product 
This leads to a relatively stable margin and revenue structure over time  which is exactly what individuals living off dividends in retirement like to see in their investments 
Source  Simply Safe Dividends
These industry characteristics illustrate that Merck isn t going anywhere anytime soon  However  conditions aren t always stable for drug producers Key RisksMerck has gone through a very difficult period of time as they have faced patent expirations in many of their blockbuster drugs and settled a multibillion dollar lawsuit over the painkiller Vioxx 
Merck s sales peaked in 2011 at over  48 billion and have declined to  39 5 billion in 2015  The company has executed a couple of divestitures over this time that have contributed to the sales decline 
However  even if these transactions are adjusted out  organic growth has still been negative  This is further illustrated by total employee count decreasing over this period from 86 000 to 68 000 
The declining sales are a result of the well publicized  patent cliff  that many of the major pharmaceutical giants recently faced 
Also  Merck has had some major setbacks in their pipeline over the last few years  They dropped plans for approval of cardiovascular drug Tredaptive in the U S  and pulled out of markets where it had already been approved 
Another example is Odanacatib  which was an osteoporosis drug that underwent many delays over safety questions  Neither of these once promising drugs is meaningful to Merck today 
Furthermore  a number of their current billion dollar revenue drugs  including Januvia  Isentress  Gardasil  Remicade  Zetia  Vytorin  and Nasonex  have either recently come off patent or have patents expiring over the next few years 
Clearly  the pipeline setbacks and outlook for many of their key drugs should be a cause of concern for investors 
However  even with all of its challenges  not everything is going wrong at Merck  They appear to be through the worst of their patent cliff and still are able to spend nearly  7 billion per year on research and development  which has led to some promising new products 
Also  the company has improved the effectiveness of their R D spend by targeting unmet areas of specialty care such as diabetes and cancer  rather than primary care 
In addition  Merck has a few levers to pull that can extend the patent window of some of their key drugs  They can work to hold later granted patents on processes and intermediates related to the most efficient manufacturing method of the active ingredient  Additionally  they can generate unique compositions and formulations that could push out expiration dates for some treatment options 
With all that said  the most promising new therapeutic is Keytruda  According to Merck  Keytruda can treat different cancers including melanoma or lung cancer or head and neck cancer by working with the immune system 
The share of these markets Keytruda can capture got a boost when Bristol Myers Squibb s Opdivo failed in a lung cancer trial earlier this month  which sent Bristol Myers Squibb s stock price down 18  
Kaytruda is addressing huge markets  and it is widely expected for the drug to increase sales from the current annualized rate of roughly  1 billion to be a multibillion dollar therapeutic Dividend Analysis  MerckWe analyze 25  years of dividend data and 10  years of fundamental data to understand the safety and growth prospects of a dividend 
Dividend Safety ScoreOur Safety Score answers the question   Is the current dividend payment safe   We look at factors such as current and historical EPS and FCF payout ratios  debt levels  free cash flow generation  industry cyclicality  ROIC trends  and more  Scores of 50 are average  75 or higher is very good  and 25 or lower is considered weak 
Merck s dividend is very safe with a Dividend Safety Score of 69  The company s strong score is driven by Merck s stable business model and relatively modest free cash flow payout ratio of 46  
Analysts are projecting future diluted earnings per share of  3 75   4 05  and  4 43 in 2017  2018  and 2019  respectively  This forecast implies low  to mid single digit earnings growth and a safe payout ratio below 50  
Merck s dividend safety is also helped by the company s consistent free cash flow generation  which is needed to sustainably pay and grow dividends 
As seen below  Merck has generated positive free cash flow for more than a decade Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Most of Merck s products are non discretionary purchases as well  Pharmaceuticals are needed regardless of how the economy is doing  which helped Merck report a sales decline of just 1  in 2008 
The company s balance sheet is also very supportive of the dividend  Merck maintains investment grade credit ratings from the major agencies  reflecting the company s strong market position  diverse revenue mix  healthy profit margins  and consistent cash flow generation 
Merck has  11 8 billion in cash compared to  23 6 billion in debt  The company could retire all of its debt using cash on hand and just 1 5 years of earnings before interest and taxes  EBIT  
Overall  Merck s dividend payment is very safe  The company s payout ratio is healthy  cash flow generation is excellent  the balance sheet is reasonably flexible  and earnings are expected to continue growing at a moderate pace 
Dividend Growth ScoreOur Growth Score answers the question   How fast is the dividend likely to grow   It considers many of the same fundamental factors as the Safety Score but places more weight on growth centric metrics like sales and earnings growth and payout ratios  Scores of 50 are average  75 or higher is very good  and 25 or lower is considered weak 
Merck s Dividend Growth Score is only 35  This low score shouldn t be a surprise considering the patent cliff the company faced and hiccups with the product pipeline 
Merck has paid a consistent dividend since initiating it in 1970  Nonetheless  the company is not adividend aristocrat because they have not been a consistent dividend grower 
In fact  Merck held its quarterly dividend constant at 38 cents per share from September 2004 through September 2011  Furthermore  they do not have as good of a dividend growth track record as some of the other global pharmaceutical giants 
Merck has grown their dividend at a 10 year CAGR of only 1 8   5 year CAGR of 3 6   and 3 year CAGR of 2 3  

This is well below Johnson   Johnson  which has grown their dividend at an 8 7  10 year CAGR  5 year CAGR of 6 9   and 3 year CAGR of 7 1   During the same time periods Pfizer has grown their dividend at 4   9 2   and 8 4  per year  respectively 
During the first quarter of 2016  the board of directors at Merck elected to maintain the same quarterly dividend of 46 cents per share that they paid in the fourth quarter of 2015 
Historically  the fourth quarter is when the company decides whether or not to increase the dividend  In the fourth quarter of 2015  they elected to increase the dividend by roughly 2  
Overall  we would expect Merck to continue to increase the dividend at a low single digit rate  which should keep up with inflation  I don t expect any significant increases in the free cash flow payout ratio  which has consistently been around 50  for the last decade Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Thus  future increases in the dividend will have to come from earnings and cash flow growth  which is a function of introducing new therapeutics and managing the decline of off patent drugs 
As of now  major risks to the dividend are more likely to come from lawsuits  recalls  and lack of successful new product introductions than anything to do with the economy or business model ValuationMerck s stock currently trades at 17x forward earnings estimates and offers a dividend yield of 3   which is somewhat below the stock s five year average dividend yield of 3 65  
Assuming the company the company continues growing earnings at a low  to mid single digit rate  the stock appears to offer total annual return potential of 7 10  and looks reasonably priced today ConclusionMerck is a large cap dividend stock that appears to be a good investment to consider for investors looking to add more yield to their portfolio 
The company has a solid balance sheet  a recession resistant business model  generates consistent free cash flow  a reasonable forward P E ratio of 17x  and has paid a consistent dividend since 1970 
However  outside of introducing a number of major blockbuster drugs to the market  Merck is unlikely to grow it dividend much in excess of inflation over the next few years 
Investors looking for a true dividend growth name that could grow to have a high yield on cost someday should pass on the company ",2016-08-24,Brian Bollinger,https://www.investing.com/analysis/merck-offers-value-and-steady-dividend-growth-200149760,200149760

199019,420535,JNJ,Roche  RHHBY  Misses On Q2 Revenues  New Launches In Focus ,opinion,"Roche Holding  SIX ROG    OTC RHHBY   reported sales of  12 1 billion  CHF11 7 billion  in the second quarter of 2016  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  12 9 billion 
In the first half of 2016  however  sales were up 6  year over year in local currency  Growth was primarily driven by pharmaceutical sales in the U S  and strong demand for immunodiagnostic products 
The company reports results under two divisions  Pharmaceuticals and Diagnostics  All growth rates mentioned below are on a year over year basis and at constant exchange rates 
First Half 2016 Results in Detail 
Sales at the Pharmaceuticals division increased 4  to CHF19 5 billion on the back of strong demand for oncology and immunology medicines  Sales of the HER2 breast cancer franchise   10   were driven by robust demand for Herceptin  Perjeta and Kadcyla  Herceptin sales grew 5  on the back of higher demand due to a longer duration of treatment in combination with Perjeta 
Sales of Perjeta were strong in both Europe and the U S  driven mainly by uptake in the neoadjuvant setting and continually strong growth in the metastatic setting  Kadcyla sales increased on account of demand in the international region and Europe 
Sales of Avastin were up 4  due to increased demand in international markets  especially China where sales grew on improved access in the lung cancer setting  Robust sales of Rituxan MabThera   4   also contributed significantly to the top line 
Sales of the immunology franchise were driven by strong uptake of Esbriet   51   and increased sales of Actemra RoActemra   17   and Xolair   19   The new subcutaneous formulation of Actemra  along with its use as a single agent  fueled sales  Demand was strong for Alecensa which was recently launched in the U S  for a specific type of lung cancer 
However  sales of Pegasys   49   were hurt by competition from a new generation of treatments  while Valcyte Cymevene   14   and Xeloda   12   suffered due to generic competition 
Revenues at the Diagnostics division were CHF5 6 billion  up 6  driven by solid performance of the professional diagnostics   9   unit  which was in turn  propelled by the immunodiagnostics business   14    Tissue diagnostics   12   and Molecular Diagnostics   8   also performed impressively  However  sales of diabetes care decreased due to pricing pressure in the U S 
2016 Outlook
Roche continues to expect sales to increase in the low to mid single digits  The company expects core earnings to grow at a higher rate than sales  Roche intends to increase its dividend further in 2016 
 ROCHE HLDG LTD Price and EPS Surprise
   Pipeline Update
Roche made strong pipeline progress in the first half of 2016  The FDA granted accelerated approval to Venclexta for a specific form of leukemia in the U S  The drug was developed in collaboration with AbbVie   NYSE ABBV    The FDA also granted accelerated approval to immunotherapy drug  Tecentriq  for bladder cancer 
The subcutaneous formulation of MabThera Rituxan received approval in the EU for chronic lymphocytic leukemia in May  In Jun 2016  the European Commission approved Gazyva for the second line treatment of follicular lymphoma  Meanwhile  the combination of Avastin and Tarceva received approval in Europe for the treatment of patients with a specific type of lung cancer 
Also  the marketing applications for Ocrevus for both relapsing and progressive multiple sclerosis is under review in the U S  and EU  The PDUFA date in the U S  is Dec 28  2016  Results from the largest trial in giant cell arteritis  GCA  showed that Actemra RoActemra effectively sustained remission through one year as compared to a 6  or 12 month steroid only regimen in patients with newly diagnosed and relapsing GCA 
Roche also presented positive data on Tecentriq in the treatment of previously treated lung cancer  Moreover  the company revealed encouraging results on the drug in combination with chemotherapy  targeted anti cancer medicines and other cancer immunotherapy agents in several tumor types from various trials 
However  Roche suffered a setback when the phase III study on Gazyva in previously untreated diffuse large B cell lymphoma did not meet its primary goal of extending the time patients live without disease progression 
Our Take
Roche currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Sales in the second quarter fell short of estimates  The company is making efforts to broaden its portfolio outside the oncology space into immunology  New drug approvals such as those of Tecentriq  Cotellic and Alecensa also boosted sales 
However  headwinds in the form of generic competition for Xeloda and Valcyte may continue to hurt sales  Going forward  we expect investors to focus on new drug approvals  as the top line could be marred by the entry of biosimilars  expected in the second half of 2017 in Europe  for key drugs like MabThera and Herceptin

199041,420557,JNJ,Novartis  NVS  Tops Q2 Earnings   Sales  Expenses To Grow,opinion,Novartis AG   NYSE NVS   reported second quarter 2016 core earnings of  1 23 per share  On an adjusted basis  earnings were  1 22 per share beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 18 Revenues also declined 2  to  12 5 billion but were above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  12 1 billion All growth rates mentioned below are on a year over year basis and at constant exchange rates The Quarter in DetailNovartis operates under three divisions  Innovative Medicines  Pharmaceuticals   Alcon and Generics  Sandoz  The Innovative Medicines  pharmaceuticals  division recorded sales of  8 4 billion  down 1   Generic competition for Gleevec and pricing negatively impacted sales  Growth Products  Gilenya  Tasigna  Tafinlar   Mekinist  Jakavi and Promacta Revolade  increased 23  to  3 8 billion  and comprised 45  of net division sales The Alcon division recorded sales of  1 5 billion  down 1   Surgical sales were down as the strong performance of cataract consumables was more than offset by weak sales of intraocular lenses  IOLs   Vision care sales were flat as growth in contact lenses offset the decline in contact lens care In a bid to revamp its beleaguered Alcon business  Novartis has moved its ophthalmic pharmaceuticals business to the pharmaceuticals division Sales at the Sandoz division  Novartis  generic arm  were  2 6 billion  as volume growth was offset by price erosion  Sales of Biopharmaceuticals surged 11  to  249 million 2016 Outlook ReiteratedNovartis expects net sales to be broadly in line with the 2015 levels  Growth products are expected to offset the impact of generic competition  primarily Gleevec   In a bid to boost Entresto sales  Novartis decided to significantly increase spending in the second half of 2016 to create a primary care field force in the U S  and improve medical support for the drug  Consequently  additional spending on Entresto and generic erosion of Gleevec will lead to a decline in operating income  Moreover  unfavorable currency movement will hurt sales by 3  in 2016  For the third quarter  sales and earnings will be down 1  and 2   respectively  due to foreign exchange fluctuations   Pipeline UpdateNovartis  pipeline progress in the reported quarter was encouraging  Afinitor was approved in the EU for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic  well differentiated nonfunctional neuroendocrine tumors of gastrointestinal or lung origin in adults with progressive disease  The FDA approved an expanded label for Xolair to include children aged 6 to 11 years with moderate to severely persistent asthma Additionally  Entresto obtained a strong Class I recommendation in both the U S  and the EU as per the heart failure treatment guidelines  These guidelines establish Entresto as the standard of care for symptomatic patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction  HFrEF   Novartis has also entered into collaboration and licensing agreement with Xencor  Inc    NASDAQ XNCR   to add bispecific antibodies to its growing immuno oncology portfolio Moreover  an independent Data Monitoring Committee recommended stopping the phase III trial on LEE011 early as a pre planned interim analysis showed that the candidate was able to meet the primary endpoint in postmenopausal women who had received no prior therapy for their HR  HER2  advanced breast cancer  Novartis also presented  encouraging data on Cosentyx  while the three year follow up results of a phase III study on the Tafinlar Mekinist combination showed a survival benefit in patients with BRAF V600E K  advanced melanoma on combination therapy versus Tafinlar monotherapy On the other hand  the ENESTfreedom trial on Tasigna for the treatment of Ph CML patients did not meet the primary endpoint Meanwhile  Sandoz continues to strengthen its biosimilars portfolio and pipeline  The biosimilar versions of Enbrel and MabThera showed pharmacokinetic bioequivalence to their reference products  The FDA advisory committee has recommended the approval of biosimilar of Enbrel for five indications of the reference product  However  Sandoz received a complete response letter from the FDA for Neulasta biosimilar and the company is working with the agency to resolve the issues  The company is planning to file for two more biosimilars in 2016 NOVARTIS AG ADR Price and EPS Surprise   Our TakeNovartis  second quarter 2016 results were encouraging with the company beating both top  and bottom line estimates  Novartis has been facing challenging conditions for the past few quarters  Nevertheless  uptake of newly launched products  Cosentyx  should be able to offset the impact of entry of generics for Gleevec as well as weakness in Alcon  Moreover  the company is working to boost Entresto sales  We are also impressed by the company s efforts to strengthen its biosimilars portfolio Novartis currently carries a Zacks

199050,420566,JNJ,Roche s Gazyva Fails In Phase III B cell Lymphoma Study,opinion,"Roche Holding  SIX ROG  AG   OTC RHHBY   announced disappointing results from the phase III study  GOYA  on Gazyva for previously untreated diffuse large B cell lymphoma  DLBCL  
The global phase III  open label  multicenter  randomized  two arm study examined the efficacy and safety of the combination of Gazyva and CHOP chemotherapy  G CHOP  against Rituxan plus CHOP chemotherapy  R CHOP  
The trial failed to meet the primary endpoint of a reduction in the risk of disease worsening or death  progression free survival  compared to Rituxan plus R CHOP  Adverse events were consistent in both arms ROCHE HLDG LTD Price and EPS Surprise
   The results were a setback for the company as previous trials had showed that Gazyva helped people with previously untreated follicular lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia live longer without their disease worsening  compared to Rituxan  when combined with chemotherapy 
Results were disappointing also because DLBCL is the most common subtype of non Hodgkin lymphoma  NHL  
Gazyva is already approved in combination with chlorambucil for the treatment of previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia  In Feb 2016  the FDA expanded the label of Gazyva in combination with bendamustine followed by Gazyva alone to include the treatment of follicular lymphoma in patients who did not respond to a Rituxan containing regimen  or whose follicular lymphoma returned after such a treatment  Last month  it was approved as Gazyvaro in the EU for the same indication 
Roche s hematology portfolio boasts approved drugs like MabThera Rituxan  Gazyva Gazyvaro  Tecentriq  atezolizumab  and Venclexta  as well as an encouraging pipeline comprising candidates like polatuzumab vedotin RG7596 and a small molecule antagonist of MDM2  idasanutlin RG7388

199056,420572,JNJ,JNJ VS  PFE  Which Is The Better Large Cap Pharma Stock  ,opinion,"With market caps in the triple digit billions  Johnson   Johnson   NYSE JNJ   and Pfizer Inc    NYSE PFE   are two large cap pharmaceutical stocks that many investors like to keep in their portfolio for their relative stability  Large cap stocks tend to be go to picks for investors  as they tend to be less volatile than most other stocks  They also tend to offer solid dividend payments that help to limit downside risk  in addition to providing income to investors 
JNJ and PFE are both Zacks Rank  2  Buy  stocks  and the Large Cap Pharmaceutical Industry is currently ranked 26th out of 265 industries by Zacks  placing it in the top 10  of all industries  While they share the same Zacks Rank and operate in the same strong industry  the stocks differ from each other in what they can offer to investors 
Johnson   Johnson  JNJ 
Johnson   Johnson is engaged in the research and development  manufacture  and sale of a range of products in the healthcare field  The company operates in three segments  Consumer  Pharmaceuticals  and Medical Devices and Diagnostics  JNJ is a long term  proven winner  as the company raised its dividend every year since 1961  a 54 year streak  and has produced a return of 175  just since 2005 
As mentioned the company is a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  stock currently  and also has a Momentum Style Score of an A for the recent success the stock has seen  The company is up nearly 20  thus far in 2016  and dating back 52 weeks JNJ has a price change of nearly 23   The trend upwards could continue too with JNJ s growth projections 
JNJ is projected to see its sales hit  71 64 billion this year  which would represent year over year growth of 2 23   and sales in 2017 are projected to grow another 4 53   The company s earnings are also projected for solid growth  with projected EPS growth of 6 40  this year  and another 6 08  of growth projected for next year 
Johnson   Johnson has long been a well performing blue chip stock  and is likely to continue to do so moving forward  With a forward PE ratio of 18 63 and a dividend yield of 2 60  that is likely to grow given the company s history  JNJ offers solid value to income and value investors  as well as being attractive to momentum investors given its run of success 
Pfizer Inc   PFE 
Pfizer Inc  is a research based  global pharmaceutical company that discovers  develops  manufactures  and markets medicines for humans and animals  The company s diversified global healthcare portfolio includes human  biologic and small molecule medicines and vaccines  as well as nutritional products and healthcare products 
Pfizer too is a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  stock currently  and offers investors good bang for their buck with a B Value Style Score  This Style Score can be attributed to a low PE ratio of 14 72  an earnings yield of 6 85   and a cash to price ratio of 10 81  The company also offers a solid dividend yield of 3 32   making it attractive as an income and value investment 
Shares of PFE are up more than 12  year to date  and could be poised to finish the year even higher thanks to its projected growth in sales and earnings  The company has current year projected sales growth of 7 74   in addition to projected EPS growth of 11 57   PFE s current year earnings estimate has soared from recent analyst revision activity  jumping from  2 28 90 days ago to the current estimate of  2 45 
With a solid dividend yield  PFE offers income for investors and some protection against downside risk in the recent volatile market  The company has a positive growth outlook too  and its solid value provides investors with an interesting investment opportunity 
Bottom Line
Armed with a high Zacks Rank  investors should consider both stocks  Both offer a solid dividend payment  though PFE s is higher  for those looking for income  and each stock has other positives behind it  JNJ is a strong performer thus far this year and has proven over a long period of time that is a stable  growing stock  both in regards to its share price and its dividend payment 
PFE is more of an income and value play for investors  with a higher dividend yield and lower PE ratio  Both stocks look strong at the moment  and it is really up to investors to choose between the two on which attributes they tend to look for when making their stock picks ",2016-07-11,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/jnj-vs.-pfe:-which-is-the-better-large-cap-pharma-stock-200141087,200141087
199057,420573,JNJ,Shire s  SHPG  Dry Eye Disease Drug Xiidra Gets FDA Nod,opinion,"Shire plc   NASDAQ SHPG   received a major boost when the FDA approved its ophthalmology drug Xiidra  lifitegrast ophthalmic solution  5   a twice daily eye drop solution indicated for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease  DED  in adults 
Per the company  Xiidra is the only prescription eye drop indicated for the treatment of both signs and symptoms of this condition  Approximately 16 million adults in the U S  are diagnosed with dry eye disease  underscoring significant need for treatments in this field  Shire expects to launch the drug in the third quarter of 2016 
However  the road to Xiidra s approval has been bumpy  In Oct 2015  the FDA issued a complete response letter to the company s new drug application  NDA  for the drug  The agency had requested for an additional clinical study to support the company s NDA SHIRE PLC ADR Price
   Thereafter  Shire announced positive top line results from a phase III study  OPUS 3  The study met both the primary and secondary endpoints  It compared Xiidra to placebo administered twice daily for 84 days in patients suffering from DED  who have a recent history of artificial tear use within 30 days of study entry and an eye dryness score of 40 
The study also evaluated the safety and tolerability of the drug based on the occurrence of treatment emergent adverse events  The safety and tolerability profile of the drug was consistent with results from previous studies  Consequently  Shire resubmitted the NDA with the new data in Jan 2016 
Our Take
We note that Shire has a solid presence in the rare disease markets  The approval of Xiidra will enable the company to build a strong ophthalmology franchise as well  The DED market represents significant potential 
The company has a deep pipeline in ophthalmology comprising early   mid  and late stage candidates gained through organic growth and strategic acquisitions  Over the last three years  the company has made several acquisitions  including those of Foresight Biotherapeutics  SARcode Bioscience  Premacure AB and Bikam Pharmaceuticals  These transactions added key early   mid  and late stage candidates to Shire s ophthalmic pipeline  
We remind investors that Shire s ophthalmic pipeline currently includes candidates for infectious conjunctivitis  retinopathy of prematurity  autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa and glaucoma

199058,420574,JNJ,Sucampo To Stop Developing Cobiprostone For Oral Mucositis,opinion,"Sucampo Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ SCMP   announced that it will discontinue the development of its pipeline candidate  cobiprostone 
The candidate was being developed for the prevention of oral mucositis  The decision to discontinue was taken on the basis of the results of a prespecified futility analysis of a phase II study  The study evaluated an oral spray formulation of cobiprostone for the prevention of oral mucositis in patients who are undergoing radio chemotherapy for head and neck cancers 
The futility analysis showed that the clinical benefit of cobiprostone was insufficient to support the continuation of the study  However  there were no safety concerns and the safety profile was consistent with the previous studies 
In Apr 2016  Sucampo announced disappointing top line data from a phase IIa study on cobiprostone in patients with proton pump inhibitor  PPI  refractory non erosive reflux disease  NERD  or symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux disease  sGERD   Consequently  the company had to discontinue the development of cobiprostone for PPI refractory NERD sGERD 
Meanwhile  Sucampo will focus on other candidates in its pipeline   label expansion of Amitiza and its partnership with Cancer Prevention Pharmaceuticals for the phase III candidate for familial adenomatous polyposis  FAP   We remind investors that the company entered into an option and collaboration agreement with Cancer Prevention Pharmaceuticals in Jan 2016  whereby the company was granted the sole option to acquire an exclusive license to commercialize CPP 1X sulindac combination product in North America  The product is currently in a phase III trial for the treatment of familial adenomatous polyposis  FAP  
We note that Amitiza is approved in the U S  for three gastrointestinal indications   chronic idiopathic constipation  CIC  in adults  irritable bowel syndrome with constipation  IBS C  in adult women and opioid induced constipation  OIC  in adults suffering from chronic non cancer related pain 
However  Sucampo is heavily dependent on Amitiza for growth and the company needs to deliver on its pipeline in order to reduce its dependence on a single product  Hence  any further delay in the development programs for candidates in its pipeline will adversely impact the prospects of the company

199064,420580,JNJ,Novartis  Systemic Mastocytosis Drug Positive In Phase II,opinion,"Novartis AG   NYSE NVS   announced that data from its phase II study  CPKC412D2201  on PKC412  midostaurin  was published in The New England Journal of Medicine 
The open label study enrolled adults  aged 18 years and above  who had the following subtypes of advanced systemic mastocytosis  SM  in the primary efficacy population   aggressive systemic mastocytosis  mast cell leukemia  and SM with an associated hematologic neoplasm  Patients enrolled in the trial received single agent oral administration of PKC412 until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity 
Data demonstrated an overall response rate of 60  in patients suffering from SM  Results showed a median overall survival of 28 7 months  along with improvements in both bone marrow mast cell burden and serum tryptase levels 
We note that the FDA has recently granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to PKC412 for the treatment of adults with newly diagnosed FLT3 mutated acute myeloid leukemia  AML   The candidate also enjoys Orphan Drug status in the EU and the U S  for both AML and mastocytosis 
Advanced SM is rare and has a poor prognosis  As per the European Journal of Hematology  there is currently no approved treatment for the majority of patients suffering from the disease  Hence  the successful development and commercialization of PKC412 will bode well for Novartis NOVARTIS AG ADR Price

The drug is now approved for the treatment of moderate to severely persistent asthma in children aged 6 to 11 years  who have had a positive skin test or in vitro reactivity to an airborne allergen  along with symptoms that are inadequately controlled with inhaled corticosteroids 
We note that the drug is already approved for the treatment of allergic asthma patients aged 12 years and older  Xolair is also approved for the treatment of chronic idiopathic urticaria  CIU  in patients aged 12 years and older  who continue to have hives that are not controlled by an H1 antihistamine treatment 
The latest label expansion to include the treatment of a younger group of children should further boost sales of the drug  As per the U S  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  asthma affects 6 3 million people under 18  or one in every 12 children in the U S  Out of this  approximately 60  have allergic asthma  As per estimates from the American Academy of Pediatrics  70  to 80  of school aged children with asthma also have allergies  This reflects significant need for treatments in this indication ROCHE HLDG LTD Price

199076,420592,JNJ,Tesaro Stock Up On Successful Phase III Ovarian Cancer Trial,opinion,"Shares of Tesaro  Inc    NASDAQ TSRO   surged 108  after the company announced that its phase III trial  NOVA  on oncology drug niraparib successfully achieved the primary endpoint of progression free survival  PFS  
The double blind  placebo controlled  international trial  n 500  was designed to define those patients who are most likely to benefit from niraparib  The trial evaluated niraparib in patients suffering from recurrent ovarian cancer who were in response to their most recent platinum based chemotherapy  The trial showed that niraparib significantly prolonged PFS compared to placebo among various cohorts   patients who are germline BRCA mutation carriers  patients who are not germline BRCA mutation  non gBRCAmut  carriers but who have homologous recombination deficient  HRD  tumors as determined by the Myriad myChoice HRD test  and overall in patients who are not germline BRCA mutation carriers  Hence  the trial demonstrates that a single  daily  oral dose of niraparib is much superior in prolonging PFS in women with recurrent ovarian cancer 
The company will present full results from the trial at the European Society for Medical Oncology  ESMO  congress in Oct 2016  The company also plans to submit its New Drug Application  NDA  and Marketing Authorization Application  MAA  on niraparib in the fourth quarter of 2016 
Nearly 22 000 women are diagnosed with ovarian cancer in the U S  every year  while 80  are diagnosed after the disease has become symptomatic and has progressed to a late stage  Moreover  majority of the women who are diagnosed with advanced ovarian cancer are likely to experience a relapse of their disease 
This underscores the need for new treatment options to extend the time between the cycles of platinum based chemotherapy for these patients  As per the company  there is currently no approved therapy in the U S  for the maintenance treatment of patients with recurrent ovarian cancer following response to platinum  Hence  the successful phase III trial results bode well for Tesaro as a potential approval of niraparib will boost its portfolio TESARO INC Price and Consensus

We note that this is the tenth FDA approval for Humira in the U S  This approval comes after Humira gained approval in the EU last month for the treatment of non infectious intermediate  posterior and panuveitis in adults who have had an inadequate response to corticosteroids  in patients in need of corticosteroid sparing  or in whom corticosteroid treatment is inappropriate 
Humira is currently approved in the U S  for several indications including psoriatic arthritis  ankylosing spondylitis  moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis  polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis  Crohn s disease  CD   hidradenitis suppurativa  ulcerative colitis  and chronic plaque psoriasis  It is also approved for the treatment of moderate to severe CD in children six years of age and older 
We note that Humira enjoys orphan drug status in the U S  for the treatment of certain forms of uveitis  which affect a population of fewer than 200 000 patients  The orphan drug status should now make Humira eligible for seven years of market exclusivity for the treatment of adults with non infectious intermediate  posterior and panuveitis 
We note that Humira is the key growth driver at AbbVie  The drug recorded total sales of  14 billion in 2015  reflecting an 11 7  surge  Label expansion should boost the commercial potential of the drug

199078,420594,JNJ,Shire Stock Up Despite Mixed Data On Pipeline Candidate,opinion,"Shire plc   NASDAQ SHPG   announced disappointing results from a phase II study on pipeline candidate SHP607 
The multicenter  randomized  controlled study  ROPP 2008 01  compared experimental protein replacement  SHP607  to the standard neonatal care in 121 premature infants who were born at a gestational age of 23 weeks to 27 weeks plus 6 days  These patients were randomized at birth to receive either SHP607 or the standard neonatal care  and were treated until an equivalent gestational age of 30 weeks 
The study did not meet its primary endpoint of reducing the severity of retinopathy of prematurity  ROP   However  it demonstrated clinically relevant effects in the secondary endpoints related to the development of severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia  BPD   a chronic lung disease  and severe intraventricular hemorrhage  IVH    a type of brain injury 
Top line data from the study showed a 53  reduction in the incidence of severe BPD in all patients who received SHP607  as compared to untreated infants  The data also showed an 89  reduction in those who achieved the prespecified target drug exposure  The secondary endpoint of time to discharge from neonatal intensive care was  however  not met 
As per the data provided by the company  approximately 28 000 infants are born extremely premature  before 28 weeks of gestation  in the U S  According to research  60  of extremely premature infants experience one or more severe complications related to prematurity  which include  IVH  grade  3   BPD  or ROP thereby underscoring the need for treatments for the same

199088,420604,JNJ,Identifying Opportunities In International Dividend ETFs,opinion,"When sorting through the list of available ETFs that offer high dividend yields  it s very obvious that investors favor U S  stocks  The overwhelming majority of assets are parked in funds with similar holdings such as AT T  NYSE T  and Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ   They also have low expenses  a high degree of daily liquidity  and have performed admirably when viewed over 3  5  and even 10 year time horizons 
There is not much to complain about in U S  focused high dividend ETFs other than the lofty valuations and slowly deteriorating yields  This has many investors becoming concerned that the current pace of income and capital appreciation will be unsustainable when viewed through a long term lens 
Those who have ridden through these cycles in the past may be ready to expand the scope of their investment focus in the months and years ahead  One option to consider are dividend ETFs with an international income emphasis  Many of these funds offer greater yields  more attractive valuations  or simply  
iShares International Select Dividend ETF  IDV 
IDV has one of the longest tenures and largest size in this category with over  2 7 billion in total assets  This exchange traded fund tracks 100 foreign stocks with an emphasis on high dividend yields  Top country allocations include the United Kingdom  Australia  and Canada  Developed markets make up the majority of this fund  which charges a net expense ratio of 0 50  and offers a 30 day SEC yield of 5 25  
For comparison purposes  the iShares Select Dividend ETF  DVY  sports a yield of 3 27   That means IDV offers a 60  higher dividend rate versus its U S  focused peer  Income from this ETF is paid on a quarterly basis as well 
Probably of greater importance to this discussion is the performance of IDV  which Barclays  LON BARC  lists on their website as  0 71  annualized  total return  over the last 5 years through May 31  2016  DVY has returned 12 68  annualized during that same time frame 

This gaping performance differential also helps explain why the P E ratio of the underlying stocks in DVY is 19 47 versus 13 74 for IDV  Put simply  international stocks are much cheaper than their domestic counterparts because they have lagged on the way higher 
SPDR S P International Dividend ETF  DWX 
Another comparable option to consider is DWX  which invests in a basket of 119 high dividend paying stocks outside the United States  This ETF has  944 million in total assets and charges an expense ratio of 0 45   The current 30 day SEC yield is 5 85  and dividends are also paid quarterly 
Some notable remarks about the DWX index is that included companies are screened for liquidity and market capitalization requirements  Constituents must also demonstrate positive 3 year earnings growth and profitability  Emerging market exposure is also capped at 15  during each annual rebalancing cycle 
It may appear from a casual glance that DWX and IDV have a similar number of holdings  yield  and expense ratio  However  these two funds do have noticeable variances in country exposure and stock selection criteria  This will likely lead to differing returns over various market cycles as their  
Vanguard International High Dividend Yield ETF  VYMI 
A relatively new fund in this category that I m excited about is VYMI  Not surprisingly  this ETF has one of the lowest expense ratios in the group at 0 30  and is supported by a broader index of 890 stocks  This means that VYMI is a much more suitable option for those looking to achieve extensive diversification in a single investment vehicle 
VYMI also has more exposure to Asia Pacific stocks with 20  of its portfolio and 16  dedicated to emerging markets  This makes for a highly differentiated portfolio offering versus the traditional model of more tightly grouped dividend paying indexes 
Vanguard has yet to post yield statistics for VYMI and the two initial dividends have been lumpy  It will be interesting to compare this offering versus its peers after a full year of distributions have been paid  My instinct is that this fund will have a modestly lower yield than IDV or DWX in conjunction with its larger number of holdings 
The Bottom Line
For   this gap in performance and fundamental valuations should not go unnoticed  The hard part is being able to determine when it will eventually narrow and having the patience or fortitude to capture that opportunity 
Further complicating the waters is the practical fear that international stocks have recently shown greater volatility and undiscernible trends versus U S  markets  There is no way to know whether international stocks will just gradually drift higher as U S  stocks stagnate or if it will take a more pronounced shock to global markets in order to induce a new momentum trade 
In my opinion  this opportunity is one that will likely offer forward looking investors a sizeable advantage in the years ahead

We are encouraged by the company s progress with tipifarnib  Per information provided by Kura in its press release  MDS is estimated to have an annual incidence of roughly 13 000 patients in the U S  and is usually associated with poor prognosis due to the low response rate to available treatment options

199101,420617,JNJ,Commercial Vehicle Group  Houlihan Lokey  Johnson   Johnson And Canadian Imperial Bank Of Commerce Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day ,opinion,"For Immediate Release

Chicago  IL   June 21  2016    highlights Commercial Vehicle Group    as the Bull of the Day and  Houlihan Lokey    as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ     and  Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce    

Here is a synopsis of all four stocks  

  

Commercial Vehicle Group    absolutely crushed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and is now benefiting from the  post earnings drift  higher  The stock is a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and today it is the Bull of the Day 

The Numbers

CVGI beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of  0 09 by  0 19 for a 211  positive earnings surprise  The topline was equally as strong with the company reporting revenues of  180M and that was  15M more than expected for a 9  positive revenue surprise 

As a result of the great performance Wall Street sent shares of CVGI higher by more than 19  in the session following the release 

Description

Commercial Vehicle Group sells various cab related products and systems for Trucks and busses Commercial Vehicle Group  Inc  was founded in 2000 and is headquartered in New Albany  Ohio 

Earnings History

The most recent beat was nice  not just because of its size but also because it ended a streak of three straight misses  The company had not topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate since the March 2015 quarter when an eight cent beat was good for a positive earnings surprise of 160  

Estimates

The thing about a huge beat like the most recent one is that it can really change the outlook  The Zacks Consensus Estimate was calling for a loss of  0 16 in April  but following the beat the number flipped to a gain  and a big one at that  We are now looking for a  0 13 gain and that is a huge  0 29 move 

The 2017 Zacks Consensus Estimate flipped from a loss of   011 to a gain of  0 15  Again  another big move there too  and that comes with even less visibility 

Valuation

The valuation is a little stiff for CVGI  37x forward PE is sort of big especially when the industry average is only 9 5x  The price to book multiple of 2 1x is just a little ahead of the 1 7x industry average  The price to sales multiple is the only stat that I tend to look at that shows this stock trading at a discount  CVGI trades at 0 2x price to sales multiple  while the industry average is 0 6x 

 

Houlihan Lokey    posted back to back misses of the Zacks Consensus Estimate  That alone will not make a stock the Bear of the Day  so let s figure out why the stock is now a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  and the Bear of the Day 

The Numbers

HLI missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 45 by  0 02 for a 4 4  negative earnings surprise in the most recent quarter 

Description

Houlihan Lokey is an independent investment bank with focus on mergers and acquisitions  financings  financial restructurings and financial advisory services 

Earnings History

Usually when a stock is the Bear of the Day  the earnings history is filled with misses  This is also the case for HLI  as there are two misses in the only three quarters that have been reported 

Estimates

Here is the real reason the stock is a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  and the Bear of the Day  The Zacks Consensus Estimate has fallen steadily over the last few months  The FY16 estimate stood at  1 84 in April but fell to  1 75 in May and has remained there throughout the month of June 

Next year has not seen any movement in the estimate that started as  2 02 in September of last year

199130,420646,JNJ,Bear Of The Day  AbbVie  ABBV ,opinion,"AbbVie  ABBV  was big in the news this week after Federal regulators agreed to review a key patent for the anti inflammatory drug Humira  knocking the stock down 3 5  on over three times the average volume of 9 million shares 

According to a story from Dow Jones on Tuesday by Anne Steele  the US Patent and Trademark Office s Patent Trial and Appeal Board took up a petition by hopeful rival Coherus BioSciences  CHRS  to look at AbbVie s patent on a Humira dosing regimen to treat rheumatoid arthritis 

But ABBV shares were already pushed into the cellar of the Zacks Rank before this news because of a slide in earnings estimates over the past 30 days  Full year 2106 profit projections fell from  5 00 to  4 77 and the 2017 consensus EPS estimate dropped from  5 99 to  5 73   

And that loss of earnings momentum is what makes ABBV today s Bear of the Day by virtue of its Zacks  5 Rank  Strong Sell   This simply means that relative to over 4 000 other stocks across all sectors  ABBV has poor prospects for a price advance because of the magnitude and agreement of negative EPS revisions from analysts 

The Coherus Challenge

Part of this action by analysts in the past month may have been in anticipation of the move by Federal patent authorities  Coherus management revealed at an investor conference in January that the company planned to file an application this year to market a biosimilar  generic  version of Humira 

On Tuesday  Coherus Chief Executive Denny Lanfear said they are  confident that this will lead to a final decision nullifying  the patent 

Shares Coherus shot up nearly 16  to  18 83 on very strong volume of 1 6 million shares  over five times their daily average 

AbbVie responded  we are confident in the validity of our patents and will vigorously defend them  

 Humira is protected by many patents covering all aspects of its manufacture  formulation and indications  and the patents are the result of AbbVie s investment in biologic innovation and the unique attributes of Humira   a spokesperson said 

According to the Dow Jones article by Anne Steele  Humira was the second best selling drug in the U S  in 2015 and is AbbVie s largest source of revenue 

AbbVie has also been preparing for this competitive battle by taking out about 70 patents for Humira  one of the largest patent portfolios ever assembled for a single drug  

Again from Steele   The drug s primary U S  patent is due to expire in December  but AbbVie says the additional patents should keep copycat versions of Humira off the U S  market until at least 2022  and possibly longer  

Bottom Line for ABBV  Watch the Zacks Rank

While this patent battle could actually become a multi year war  after today s big news the analysts may continue to revise ABBV estimates downward  And that could keep it in the basement of the Zacks Rank for a while 

So if you are looking at big Biopharma stocks right now  check out Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ   Pfizer  NYSE PFE   or Abbott Labs ABT   all with a Zacks  2 Rank  Buy

199142,420658,JNJ,Bonus Stock To Watch  Johnson   Johnson,opinion,"Here is your Bonus Idea with links to the full Top Ten 
Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  pulled back the first two weeks of the year and found a bottom when the price fell below the 200 day SMA  A quick run higher led to a pullback to a higher low  In mid February it started higher again and did not look back  Over the next two months it would rise 11  to a high at 114 in April  The last two days of that run saw a gap higher and some topping tails 
It has pulled back since then  ending Friday above that gap and printing a Hammer candle  a possible reversal  The pullback also has brought the price back into the Bollinger Bands   On close inspection the trend line that was resistance as it was rising before the gap up is now acting as support  a retest  The price is also close to the rising 20 day SMA that has acted as support since February 
The RSI is pulling back but in the bullish zone while the MACD is crossed down  These look for short term downside but can flip quickly  There is support lower at 111 50 and 111 followed by 109 50 and 108 before 105  Resistance above stands at 114  Short interest is low under 1   The company is expected to report earnings next on July 19th and the stock goes ex dividend May 20th 
The chart has clear levels to look for a reversal higher against and to confirm a continuation lower  Perhaps you have owned it for that run  or missed it and are lamenting it  Well time to dry up those tears and look for a way in 
Looking at the options chains this week sees the biggest open interest above at 113 on the Put side  The May options have very large open interest at the 110 strike  suggesting a possible pullback  June has a very large open interest at the 115 strike on the call side  This reads for a possible short term pullback to continue and then a move higher 
Johnson   Johnson
Trade Idea 1  Buy the stock on a move over 112 75 with a stop at the rising trend line or the 20 day SMA 
Trade Idea 2  Buy the stock with a May 112 110 Put Spread and selling a June 115 Covered Call  30 cents for the collar  
Trade Idea 3  Buy the May 112 110 1 2 Put Spread for 12 cents 
Trade Idea 4  Sell the May 110 112 Strangle for a  2 10 credit 
Trade 1 is a straight buy following a confirmed reversal  Trade 2 adds a collar for protection for a pullback to that large open interest in May at 110 and selling the covered call at the large open interest in June  Trade 3 is a way to buy the stock at 108 should it pullback to 110 at may Expiry  Trade 4 looks for the large open interest to draw the stock to 110 at Expiry  a pin  and possibly give an entry at 108 
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  This week s list contains the first five below to get you started early  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad Market Macro picture reviewed Friday which as the calendar turns to May sees the equity markets are looking worn out and in general better to the downside 
Elsewhere look for gold to continue its uptrend while crude oil moves higher as well  The US Dollar Index is on the cusp of a major breakdown while US Treasuries churn with a bias to break to the upside  The Shanghai Composite looks to continue to consolidate along with Emerging Markets but look for the latter to be biased to eventually break that consolidation higher 
Volatility looks to remain subdued but not at the lows keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETFs NYSE SPY  NYSE IWM and NASDAQ QQQ  despite the moves lower  Their charts are more mixed with the QQQ firmly heading lower  the SPY pulling back in its uptrend and the IWM stalling  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

199144,420660,JNJ,SPX  Peaked Earnings And Weak Price Trends,opinion,"I recently talked about the S P 500 s ongoing trading range 

First of all  it is worth noting that despite all of the recent excitement of the markets advance  it remains extremely confined in a sideways trading range  This can either be good or bad news 
The Good  Sideways consolidations during bullishly biased markets provides the ability to work off excesses built up during the previous advance to provide the  fuel  necessary for the next leg higher 
The Bad  However  sideways consolidations can also mark the end of the previous bullish advance and the beginning of a bearish decline 



How do we know the difference  Normally  fundamentals tell the story  When earnings are still rising  market consolidations tend to resume to the upside  However  declining earnings have historically marked market topping processes much as we see today 


Despite the roller coaster ride over the last 16 months  most of the major markets have made little or no progress  That is with the exception of the recent explosion in large cap  dividend paying companies  This  yield chase  puts investors into a tremendous amount of risk as historically such  investment crowding  tends to end badly 

The real problem is the mentality behind the crowding of investors into  yield stocks   
The Fed s zero interest policy has driven investors from normally more secure forms of income  bonds and money market funds  into equities in a quest to generate income  Furthermore  it is currently believed that dividend paying companies are  safer  than other areas of the market 
The problem for investors  as shown below  is that such beliefs tend to be wrong at the worst possible time  During the last recessionary driven sell off  dividend yielding stocks lost 51 4  of their value  It took two rounds of quantitative easing and three and one half years to get back to even  The problem is many investors dumped their stocks in 2008 and 2009 and failed to get back in until much later  In either case  years of an individual s saving and investment time horizon was lost 

During the next recessionary drag  several things will again happen  The first is that companies will cut dividends  as they are doing now  driving yields lower  This is shown in the chart below courtesy of Political Calculations 


For the first time since October 2015  the number of U S  firms that announced dividend cuts during a calendar month dropped below the level where we can be reasonably certain that at least part of the U S  economy is experiencing significant contraction 
But the bad news is that at 24 firms  the still elevated number of dividend cutting firms who communicated that they are experiencing economic distress during April 2016 indicates that the U S  economy is pretty far from being out of the woods 

Secondly  companies will cease  buying back shares  to boost bottom line EPS  which will take away a level of support for stock prices  Furthermore  the majority of these repurchases have been through debt accumulation  which is now back at peak levels  What could go wrong 

Finally  the lack of support will lead to falling stock prices  which will destroy years of dividend accumulation for investors  Ultimately  the  yield chase  will end  as it always does  with investors giving up on the idea of  owning stocks for the long run  in exchange for  I need to keep what bit of value I have left in my portfolio   
I agree with Jeff Gundlach s recent statement 

The riskiest things are now stocks and other investments perceived to be safe  One of the most popular categories in US investing are low volatility stock funds  But there is no such thing  If you think that a stock like Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  can t go down  you re wrong  And if people own funds that invest in stocks which they think are immune from decline and they start to decline  all hell breaks loose 

Market To Nowhere
Let s get back to the current market  As we enter May and the end of the seasonally strong period of the year  it is worth noting that the markets are still trading lower  However  during that time frame  the market has certainly experienced a sharp rise in volatility  which has left investors questioning the efficacy of their preferred investment strategies 
As you are well aware  I increased equity exposure in portfolios when the markets broke above 2080 moving above the downtrend resistance from the May highs  As I stated then  by the time that such a move occurs the market is overbought and requires some consolidation before attempting a push higher 
In the chart below  you will see the extreme overbought condition of the market currently and the current process of reduction  Importantly  the last time such extremes existed was in November of 2015 heading into the Fed rate hike  That hike led to a critical unwinding of positions at the beginning of this year  

Currently  I DO NOT BELIEVE the Fed will hike rates further at any point prior to the November election  With employment and inflation data now hitting the Fed s  targets  for  normalizing rates  the new  perma excuse   as coined by Danielle DiMartino Booth  for not hiking rates is now    global weakness   
As long as the Fed signals ongoing  accommodation  by not hiking rates  the markets will continue to hold on to the belief that  stocks are the only game in town  
This is a risky proposition at best as earnings and profits continue their normal reversion process which  just to remind you  is driven by  real  economic activity  Eventually  the current  fantasy  of stock prices will have to meet the  reality  of economic underpinnings 
The question is whether the Fed can successfully convince investors to remain in stocks  keeping prices elevated  long enough for the economy to complete a recessionary cycle and return to growth 
While it is has never happened before in history  could this be the first time that the Fed is able to  engineer  a  soft landing  scenario in the economy 
Anything is certainly possible  however  the probability is more akin to a 2000 or 2008 scenario as the decoupling of the markets from the economy is corrected 

As shown in the long term chart above  the ongoing current topping process is very similar to what has been seen previously  Earnings have peaked  price trends are weak and the  market to nowhere  has existed for 16 months  
Eventually  the sideways trading market will end  The only question will be the catalyst that pushes stock prices higher or sends investors panicking to the sidelines  
I suspect we will find out that answer much sooner than most expect 

The stock market is like a carousel  you can get on and off horses at any time    Ron Miller",2016-05-03,Lance Roberts,https://www.investing.com/analysis/spx:-peaked-earnings-and-weak-price-trends-200127604,200127604
199145,420661,JNJ, Pharma ETFs Outlook    Drug Pricing Issues Remain In Focus,opinion,"The pharma sector remains in the limelight thanks to the drug pricing controversy  The sector has been under a lot of pressure since Sep 2015 when Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton s  price gouging  tweet triggered a slide in healthcare stocks 

	While there have always been concerns regarding the pricing and affordability of prescription drugs  the issue is back in focus following a 5000  price hike implemented by Turing Pharmaceuticals for Daraprim  pyrimethamine  that was approved by the FDA way back in 1953 

	Other companies like Valeant are also under review for significantly hiking the prices of acquired drugs  According to the Oct 2015 Kaiser Health Tracking poll  affordability of prescription drugs remains at the top of the public s priority list for the President and Congress   focus should be on ensuring the affordability of high cost drugs to people who need them and taking steps to lower prescription drug prices 

	So drug companies may find it a bit difficult to justify their high prices by citing the years and funds that go into bringing new treatments to market and the need to invest in R D to bring additional treatments to market 

	In addition to the impact of the increasing political and media focus on high price tags for new drugs  other factors like oil prices  global terrorism and China are also weighing on the performance of the sector   Read   
M As to Continue  

	With the major price correction that has resulted in reasonable valuations  we could see several merger and acquisition  M As  agreements being announced as the year progresses  Meanwhile  small bolt on acquisitions will continue 

	However  with the Treasury Department coming out with new guidelines  tax inversion deals are once again losing popularity  The termination of the Pfizer Allergan merger agreement will act as a deterrent for deals of a similar nature 

	In licensing activities and collaborations for the development of pipeline candidates have also increased significantly  Several pharma companies are focusing on in licensing mid to late stage pipeline candidates that look promising  instead of developing a product from scratch  which involves a lot of funds and time  Small biotech companies are open to such deals    most of them find it challenging to raise cash  thereby making it difficult to survive and continue with the development of promising pipeline candidates  Therefore  it makes sense to seek deals with pharma companies sitting on huge piles of cash   Read   

	Therapeutic areas attracting a lot of interest include central nervous system disorders  hepatitis C virus  HCV  and immunology inflammation  Another highly lucrative area is immuno oncology  Major players in this field include Bristol Myers  AstraZeneca  Merck  NYSE MRK  and Roche 

	Another trend being witnessed is the divestment of non core business segments  Companies like Pfizer  UCB  Novartis  Glaxo and AstraZeneca have all been a part of this trend  The monetization of non core assets allows these companies to focus on their areas of expertise 

	Restructuring activities are also gaining momentum as large pharma companies are looking to cut costs and streamline their operations  Most of these companies are re evaluating their pipelines and discontinuing programs which do not have a favorable risk benefit profile  Swapping of businesses is another activity that could pick pace in 2016 
New Products Should Gain Traction

	Highly awaited new products that gained approval last year should contribute significantly to revenues  While 45 new molecular entities  NMEs  and Biologics License Applications  BLAs  were approved by the FDA last year  so far in 2016  the FDA has approved 5 NMEs and BLAs 

	Biosimilars are also a focus area  Pfizer s acquisition of Hospira  NYSE HSP  gives it a strong position in the biosimilars market  Companies like Merck and Novartis are involved in the development of biosimilars as well   in fact  Novartis  Sandoz was the first company to launch a biosimilar in the U S  
Pharma ETFs in Focus

	Highlighted below are some pharma ETFs   ETFs present a low cost and convenient way to get a diversified exposure to the sector

Conclusion

	While negative currency impact and pricing pressure remain headwinds  cost cutting  downsizing and new products should support growth  Increased pipeline visibility and appropriate utilization of cash should increase confidence in the sector

199156,420672,JNJ,Strong Earnings May Not Help Stocks,opinion,"Earnings Are Beating Estimates Like Crazy
In a not so surprising outcome  the number of companies beating earnings estimates currently is above the 12 quarter average  Via Zacks Research 

While growth remains problematic  actual results are turning out to be less bad relative to the low levels to which estimates had fallen ahead of this reporting cycle  More companies are coming out with positive surprises for both earnings as well as revenues 



Total earnings for the 209 S P 500 members that have reported results are down  5 5  from the same period last year on  1 6  lower revenues  with 75 6  beating EPS estimates and 56  coming ahead of top line expectations 

So  this is all good news and a reason to buy stocks  right  Not so fast 
The problem  as shown in the chart above  is that the pace of growth in earnings is far weaker than previous averages  Furthermore  while Wall Street will point to the  beat rate  as a reason why the current  bull market  is still intact  it has been a function of excessively low expectations 
The problem is that expectations for the second half of the year are still overly optimistic 


Many see the Q1 earnings season as the inflection point for corporate earnings  with the growth picture starting to improve from Q2 onwards and turning positive in the back half of the year  The relative more numerous positive surprises and the fewer negative revisions to current period estimates would support that view 

For profits to improve to such a degree in the second half of the year  such would suggest a resumption of economic growth both domestically and internationally  However  there is scant evidence currently that such is going to be the case given the ongoing drive to suppress interest rates and flood the financial system with liquidity  
As shown by the Economic Output Composite Index  Chasing Return But Still In Cash   economic growth is currently at levels more normally associated with recessions  The only previous anomaly was in 2012 as the combination of Central Bank interventions  a Japanese earthquake tsunami  a warm winter and falling energy prices all collided to drag forward consumption 

 The indicator uses a 6 month average to smooth out the month to month volatility caused by seasonal adjustment anomalies as we are currently witnessing  


Will the recent exceptionally warm winter  low energy prices  and Central Bank interventions once again be enough to stave off further economic weakness  We will have to wait and see 
Secondly  stock buybacks have been a major support of earnings reports over the last several quarters 
As top line revenue growth has remained mired in a slow growth state  along with the economy  bottom line earnings per share have skyrocketed due to ongoing cost cutting  wage suppression and share buybacks  Q1 is currently estimated to show the largest differential in Operating EPS  as compared non buyback adjusted Operating EPS  of  1 08 

What is interesting is when we take a look at the estimated Operating EPS for Q1 currently and compare that to the estimates for Q1 of 2016 in January of this year  Currently  Operating EPS for Q1 is expected to be  25 35 when in January it was estimated to be  28 05  If we back out  2 70 over estimation error  the current beat rate for earnings is actually ZERO 
But  of course  that takes all the fun out of the  beat the earnings estimates  game  doesn t it 
Warning In Today s GDP
Contributing Editor Michael Lebowitz  via 720 Global Research  penned the following Thursday morning 

In today s GDP release the Bureau of Economic Analysis  BEA  reported 0 50   annualized economic growth  a sharp departure from the 1 40  annualized growth of the prior quarter  
Economic growth is now running below a 1 00  annualized rate for the last two quarters and has been by and large trending lower for the last two years as graphed below 


Economists consider this quarter an anomaly as judged by their forecasts for a rebound in the second quarter  The current consensus projection for the second quarter ending June 30  2016  is 2 50   Despite a secular trend of slowing domestic economic growth and global economic weakness  few economists are predicting a recession this year  Then again  few have ever correctly forecast a recession   The graph below highlights the slowing secular trend in GDP growth and the series of cycles through which the U S  economy tends to move  Note that five of the last seven economic cycles have progressively peaked at lower levels  If the current cycle peaked in mid 2015  labeled  peak     a multi year decline in GDP growth is likely  The average decline in economic growth from peak to trough for the seven cycles has been  4 3   with  3 0  being the smallest decline  A 3 0  decrease from the current level of 2 3   implies that the U S  economy will have a three year period averaging  0 7  growth 

If economists are correct and economic growth in the second quarter remains true to forecasts  the economy will avoid a recession in the first half of the year  That said  we must consider that while economists foresee a pickup in economic activity  relying on their forecasts is dangerous   On February 14  2016  the Atlanta Federal Reserve was forecasting first quarter economic growth of 2 7   and a consensus of economists expected 2 1  growth  Based on today s GDP data  those forecasts were grossly off the mark  leaving one to question the integrity of second quarter forecasts 
Michael is correct  Importantly  however  will be the annual backward revisions to the data which will likely show that 2015 and 2016 economic growth was substantially weaker than current reports currently suggest  This was what was seen when 2012 growth rates were marked sharply downward as well  Of course  there is one main driver of recessions that we must now review 
Recessions Are Driven By The Market
As I penned previously 

Recessions don t cause bear markets  bear markets cause recessions 

George Soros once discussed the idea of  reflexivity  suggesting that 

Reflexivity sets up a feedback loop between market valuations and the so called fundamentals which are being valued  The feedback can be either positive or negative  Negative feedback brings market prices and the underlying reality closer together  In other words  negative feedback is self correcting  It can go on forever  and if the underlying reality remains unchanged  it may eventually lead to an equilibrium in which market prices accurately reflect the fundamentals 
By contrast  a positive feedback is self reinforcing  It cannot go on forever because eventually  market prices would become so far removed from reality that market participants would have to recognize them as unrealistic When that tipping point is reached  the process becomes self reinforcing in the opposite direction  That is how financial markets produce boom bust phenomena or bubbles  Bubbles are not the only manifestations of reflexivity  but they are the most spectacular 

This idea of reflexivity is important in understanding the relationship between market psychology and the ultimate outcome of the markets themselves  While the vast majority of the media and analysts continue to assert the markets are fine because there is currently  no signs of recession   it ignores the impact of the psychology of the participants 
Bear markets are a result of the switch of market psychology from  greed  to  fear  driven by an event that leads to a broad market  selling panic  that triggers a negative feedback loop in the market   reflexivity 
Recessions are coincident with market declines ONLY IN HINDSIGHT  The reason is due to the annual revisions to past economic data that only reveal the start and end of the recession after the fact   The chart below shows this effect  

Jeffrey Gundlach  head of Doubleline  recently made the same observation  stating 

We will be on watch for that  a recession  in the coming months  But it doesn t really matter  Recessions don t drive financial markets  It s the other way around  People are so focused on this  recession yes or no question   What really matters is that we are in a low nominal growth environment and global growth keeps getting marked down  It is going to be slower in 2016 than in 2015 

Here is the important point 

In a number of cases over the past century  a bear market in U S  stocks was well underway long before a recession had taken hold of the U S  economy  If you are waiting for the confirmation of a recession before taking actions to protect your investment portfolio  it will likely be far too late 

With valuations pushing extreme levels  economic growth extremely weak and markets now grossly exuberant based solely on  future hopes   such has been a toxic brew that has left investors wondering what went wrong 
As Gundlach summed up 

In the financial markets  80  of the time it s a coin flip  But the other 20  of the time you have very high confidence and it s not a coin flip  For instance  I don t think the stock market is a coin flip  Especially in the United States stocks are very expensive  particularly low volatility stocks 
The riskiest things are now stocks and other investments perceived to be safe  One of the most popular categories in US investing are low volatility stock funds  But there is no such thing  If you think that a stock like Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  can t go down  you re wrong  And if people own funds that invest in stocks which they think are immune from decline and they start to decline  all hell breaks loose 

Just some things to think about ",2016-04-28,Lance Roberts,https://www.investing.com/analysis/strong-earnings-may-not-help-stocks-200126794,200126794
199165,420681,JNJ,The Last 16 Times This Happened There Was A Recession,opinion,"Something has just happened that has signaled a recession every single time that it has occurred since World War I  16 times since 1919 there have been at least 8 month over month declines in industrial production during the preceding 12 month period  and in each of those 16 instances the U S  economy has plunged into recession  Now that it has happened again  will the U S  economy beat the odds and avoid a major economic downturn  I certainly wouldn t count on it  As I have written about   there are a whole host of other numbers that are screaming that a new recession is here  and global financial markets   It would take a miracle of epic proportions to pull us out of this tailspin  and yet there are many people out there that are absolutely convinced that it will happen 
John Hussman is not one of them  In his most recent weekly comment  he examined this stunning correlation between month over month declines in industrial production and recessions  To me  what Hussman has presented is  

Last week  following a long period of poor internals and weakening order surplus  we observed fresh declines in industrial production and retail sales  Industrial production has now also declined on a year over year basis  The weakness we presently observe is strongly associated with recession  The chart below  h t Jeff Wilson  plots the cumulative number of month over month declines in Industrial Production during the preceding 12 month period  in data since 1919  Recessions are shaded  The current total of 10  of a possible 12  month over month declines in Industrial Production has never been observed except in the context of a U S  recession  Historically  as Dick Van Patten would say  eight is enough 


After looking at that chart  is there anyone out there that still doubts that the U S  economy is in significant trouble 
Many estimates of U S  GDP growth for the fourth quarter of 2015 are already just a small fraction of one percent  It would not be a surprise at all to see a negative number posted once it is all said and done 
And of course more bad news for the economy just keeps pouring in  So far this week we have learned that the growth rate of federal withholding taxes   Johnson   Johnson  N JNJ  plans has announced that it is eliminating 3 000 jobs  and BP  L BP  has announced that it is eliminating 4 000 jobs 
Of course it is not exactly a surprise that BP is cutting jobs  At this point the entire energy industry is absolutely hemorrhaging workers  As I wrote about yesterday  130 000 good paying energy jobs have been lost in the United States since the beginning of last year 
But now we are seeing major firms outside the energy industry cutting payrolls  Even financial giants such as Morgan Stanley  N MS  are looking for ways to cut costs 

Morgan Stanley just announced fourth quarter earnings  and it is providing detail to investors on a cost saving plan called Project Streamline 
During a conference call  CEO James Gorman uttered a sentence that will most likely make the bank s staff shudder 
 Too many employees based in high cost centers are doing work that can sensibly be done in lower cost centers   he said 

The whole environment is changing 
When things start to get tough  big corporations start to get rid of people  We saw this back in 2008  and it is starting to happen again right now 
And just like last time around  we are going to see millions of Americans lose their jobs during the hard years that are ahead of us 
But thankfully for the moment there is a brief lull in the action  The  that has gripped the planet was calmed on Tuesday when China announced that their economy grew at a rate of 6 8 percent during the fourth quarter of 2015  This was right in line with expectations  and markets around the world responded positively to the news 
There is just one huge problem  Everyone knows that GDP figures coming out of China are essentially meaningless  If you believe that the Chinese economy actually grew at a 6 8 percent rate during the fourth quarter of 2015  then I have a bridge to sell you  Virtually every other number coming out of China over the past several months tells us that the Chinese economy is shrinking  and so that 6 8 percent figure is extremely questionable at best 
Do you want to know the last time the communist Chinese admitted to having a recession 
It was in 1976 
Over the past four decades  economic growth figures have become a source of great national pride for China  To admit that the economy is now imploding would bring great shame on the Chinese government and the nation as a whole  and so that must be avoided at all costs 
Yes  the numbers are fraudulent in the U S  too  According to John Williams of shadowstats com  if the U S  was actually using honest numbers the last recession  
But in China they take this to ridiculous extremes  The Chinese economy is fueled by exports  and Chinese exports have been down on a year over year basis for six months in a row  And the primary reason why commodity prices have been absolutely collapsing is because of the economic contraction in China 
Of course if China had released a GDP number that was honest  global markets would have crashed hard  So their lies are making everyone else feel a bit better for the moment  and every day of relative stability that we can enjoy from here on out is something to be thankful for 
As you read this article  markets all over Asia  Europe  South America and the Middle East   More than 30 percent of the market has been wiped out in Brazil and Hong Kong  more than 40 percent of the market has been wiped out in China and Italy  and about 50 percent of the market has been wiped out in Saudi Arabia 
We are already experiencing a major global financial crisis 
The only question remaining is how bad it will eventually become 
Let us hope for more days like this one that are relatively calm  But I wouldn t count on things turning around significantly any time soon  because the economic fundamentals are telling us that big trouble is ahead ",2016-01-20,Michael T.

199166,420682,JNJ,Johnson   Johnson  Earnings In Focus,opinion,"Johnson   Johnson  N JNJ  is one of the largest healthcare companies out there  Recently  the company reported earnings  and I have to say it was a bit of a mixed report  Nonetheless  I still have faith in the company  Today  we ll talk about what we saw from JNJ earnings  how the market reacted to the news  and what we can expect to see from Johnson   Johnson moving forward 
What We Saw From JNJ Earnings
As mentioned above  Johnson   Johnson recently released its earnings report  Unfortunately  the report sent a bit of a mixed signal  While earnings slightly beat expectations  revenue missed the mark  Here s what we saw from the report   
Earnings   For the quarter  it was expected that Johnson   Johnson would produce earnings per share in the amount of  1 42  However  the company actually reported earnings per share in the amount of  1 44  While earnings came in above expectations  the results were still a bit bitter  After all  this is the second quarter in a row that we saw earnings decline  Nonetheless  coming in ahead of expectations is always positive 
Revenue   While earnings came in ahead of expectations  top line revenue was unfortunately a miss  For the quarter  analysts expected to see JNJ generate revenue in the amount of  17 9 billion  However  the company actually produced slightly lower  reproting revenue in the amount of  17 8 billion 
Guidance   With earnings slightly beating expectations and revenue slightly missing  JNJ needed some positivity  Guidance is where this positivity was found  Analysts are currently expecting for Johnson   Johnson to produce full year earnings in the amount of  6 35 per share  However  the company released guidance  stating that it is expecting to generate between  6 43 and  6 58 in earnings per share throughout the year 2016 
How The Market Reacted To The News
When it comes to market movers  there are few that are as effective as earnings reports  However  in this particular case  earnings were a bit mixed  as a result  we ve seen mixed activity in the market  In fact  since JNJ reported its earnings  we ve seen relatively flat movement on the stock  Currently  9 42   JNJ is trading at  103 66 after a minor loss of 0 68  thus far today 
What We Can Expect To See Moving Forward
In all reality  I m not too concerned about the revenue miss  After all  earnings came in ahead of expectations and guidance proved to be positive  Not to mention  JNJ has a strong history of producing incredibly positive earnings reports  In fact  over the past 4 consecutive quarters  the company hasn t missed expectations once  Another thing worth mentioning here is the sheer size of the product offering at Johnson   Johnson  With an incredible list of products  great management  a strong team  and a history of strong earnings  I m expecting to see long run gains from JNJ ",2016-02-02,Joshua Rodriguez,https://www.investing.com/analysis/johnson---johnson:-earnings-in-focus-382899,382899

Johnson   Johnson  JNJ  stock price had a long run higher from June 2012 until topping in November 2014  Since then it pulled back slightly  but could not move away from 100  This is a common phenomenon  stocks or indexes holding for a long time around round numbers  Well it finally did move away  but not how investors had hoped  in August when it fell with the market  If you bought then  congratulations 

Since the bottom throughout September  it rose back to the 100 level  But it has been stuck there again  Or has it  Looking closely  the stock has formed a rising channel since the beginning of November  A third higher high following a second higher low  defining an uptrend  So what to do 
With the price at the top of the channel  there are two things for a future holder to look for  First  a break above the channel should be bought as it indicates a change of character and a move to the upside out of the long consolidation  Second  a failure to break the channel and move lower is an opportunity for a current investor to sell covered calls  and a future investor to sell Puts on the 100 Strike  at the bottom of the channel  for a potential entry

199170,420686,JNJ,The Tycoon Secret  Patience And Value,opinion,"There are numerous strategies tycoons use to build tremendous wealth  such as investing in emerging blue chips  But today  I m going to focus on a broader characteristic tycoons possess that any investor can use to expand their wealth 
And that characteristic is a patient and persistent attention to the price  Tycoons will wait as long as necessary for an attractive entry price point for high quality assets  whether it s a stock  bond  or property 
Now  the sharp pullback in a stock s price that would draw a tycoon s attention could be due to any of the following three reasons 
There could be a broad market blowout  as occurred during the 2008 2009 global financial crisis  Great names like Johnson   Johnson  N JNJ  fell 60  or more  giving investors a once in a lifetime opportunity 
A stock could be off due to company specific issue such as missing a critical earnings report  launching a new product that flops  or suffering a credit downgrade after missing an interest payment 
A country or region could be out of favor  pulling down all stocks irrespective of quality and performance 
No  3 is the case with a tycoon blue chip idea that I m covering today 
Opportunity in Southeast Asia
 is off about 20  across the board in 2015 
Why  The slowdown in China  a sharp pullback in commodity prices  fear that U S  interest rates will rise  all these factors are negatively affecting sentiment and crowding out the many positives that these countries offer 
Positives such as growth rates that are four times America s  geographic advantage at the heart of Asian trade and investment flows  a young and growing consumer middle class  and manufacturing wage rates below China s 
As the financial capital of Southeast Asia  my pick is Singapore s leading blue chip bank   the Development Bank of Singapore  DBSDY   better known as DBS 
DBS is the leading consumer bank in both Hong Kong and Singapore  with influence throughout the region through 200 branches in 50 cities 
Investing in strong banks to tap economic growth in a country or region is a simple and time tested strategy that can lower your risks  especially in emerging markets 
One of Sir John Templeton s favorite strategies in difficult markets  banks as proxies for gaining exposure to undervalued markets around the world is both conservative and smart 
Banks have exposure to a national or regional economy through their loans and services to both companies and individuals 
A pick up in economic growth leads to an increase in loan demand  higher levels of interest income  and lower levels of non performing loans  Assuming capable management and ample cash flow  this should lead to a jump in profitability and stock price 
DBS is trading at just 10 times trailing and forward earnings and right at book value  while the industry average is around 2 3 times book value  This is in spite of DBS  steady earnings growth of 10  and its impressive 40  net earnings margin  Moody s also recently upgraded the credit rating of Singapore s banking sector 
What s most important is that DBS is rapidly building up its low risk private banking and wealth management business just as wealthy Chinese assets are moving their capital offshore  Management is targeting a 40  increase in wealth management fees by 2020  and that may be conservative given the opportunities sitting right in front of the bank 
Indeed  wealth is piling up in Singapore faster than anywhere else in the world 
Investment assets in Singapore have surged an incredible 1 110  since 2000  If this rate continues  this city state will overtake Switzerland by 2020 
Could tiny Singapore truly beat powerhouses such as London  New York  and Zurich 
Despite these strengths  DBS has pulled back 24  so far this year  It also sports a rich 3 6  dividend yield 
Blend some tycoon blue chips like DBS with the old standbys  and watch your global portfolio grow in 2016

The German consumer price index fell 0 2  from a month earlier  compared to expectations for a decline of 0 1

WTI Oil
WTI fell sharply in early Asian trade on Wednesday  after U S  inventories showed a weekly buildup that far exceeded analyst expectations 
The American Petroleum Institute said late on Tuesday that U S  crude oil stockpiles rose by 4 6 million barrels to 457 8 million barrels in the week to September 25  Analysts polled by Reuters had expected an increase of only 102 000 barrels 
U S  crude is heading for a 9  decline this month  as the slump in commodities continues  amid deepening concerns over China s slowdown in economic growth

Word leaked today that the ECB is contemplating QE of  50 bln a month for at least a year  That  600 bln minimum total is 20  more than the market consensus of  500 bln  But as a Wall Street Journal article on the topic suggests  it could be  much more  
The Bank of Canada announced a surprise 25 bps rate cut this morning  dropping their benchmark overnight lending rate to 0 75   The plunge in oil prices is already negatively impacting the Canadian economy  reducing export revenue and energy sector investment  which is resulting in layoffs   The drop in oil prices is unambiguously negative for the Canadian economy   said BoC governor Stephen Poloz 
Today s release of the minutes from the Bank of England s January MPC meeting reveal a decidedly more dovish tone  The vote to hold rates steady at 0 5  was unanimous  meaning that hawks  McCafferty and Weale  had dropped their dissent and calls for tightening 
Last week  the Reserve Bank of India did a surprise rate cut  in advance of their February policy meeting  The RBI is attempting to reinvigorate a flagging economy and believes the drop in energy prices has reduced the inflation risk  giving them the leeway to ease 
Of course the big policy news from last week was the SNB s abandonment of the franc s ceiling against the euro  They also cut rates  deeper into negative territory in an effort to staunch inflows into the franc 
On Monday  the Danish central bank cut its deposit rate to  0 2   from  0 05   Nationalbank also reaffirmed its commitment to the krone s peg against the euro  Your safe haven flows are not welcome in Denmark either 
Meanwhile  we are to believe that the Fed is moving toward a rate hike  The Treasury market doesn t seem to believe it  as we ve seen yields come down sharply in recent weeks 
Typically  the prospects of ever easier monetary policy and liquidity  would hearten stock market investors  However  I think they may finally be catching on that the swing away from policy normalization is reflective of mounting growth and price risks

A big multinational like J J hedges their currency exposure  so things could have been much worse  given that the greenback rose more than 14  against a basket of currencies last year  However  there are certainly companies that sell overseas and don t hedge at all 
It seems terribly unlikely that the Fed will tighten  when the rest of the world s central banks are moving in the absolute opposite direction  The most hawkish scenario in my mind is that they hold pat  However  one has to wonder if the Fed might launch a counter offensive in the global currency war in order to provide some relief to U S  exporters

Technically  I see two triangles that have traced out a bearish shark harmonic  which completed about a week ago  The trigger for the bearish break came on September 25 and it has moved lower since  The shark pattern targets a retracement of the pattern by 61 8   That is  to 102 56  which is just below the 50  and 100 day SMA s  There may be a good area between 102 56 and 103 60 to start a position for the long term in the stock  As it falls  the RSI is at the edge of the bullish zone  If that area fails  the pattern calls for a full retracement to the 98 80 area at the 200 day SMA 
Keep in mind that some of the pain from the 102 50 to 98 80 area can also be buffeted by the 2 80  dividend yield  Perhaps a half position at 102 5 and then add October 102 100 1 2 Put Spreads for a credit to both protect the position and possibly add to it at 98

So which way is it going to break  I do not know  But I have a plan to trade it now anyway  When you see a tight consolidation in a stock for a long time with tightening Bollinger bands  it often foretells a move  This type of action can be played with options using a Straddle or Strangle  This is just a combination of a long put and a long call to participate in a move in either direction 
For Johnson   Johnson I like a January 23 Expiry 107 108 Strangle  offered at about  3 75 as i write   To make money the stock needs to move beyond either strike by the premium paid   3 75  by Expiry  so either lower that 103 25 or above 111 75  That maybe a comfortable range for you  But if it is too wide then look at selling shorted dated Strangles to recoup some cost and narrow the range where the trade becomes profitable  For example  selling a December 105 110 Strangle narrows the range by 40 cents  Even better  if the stock does not break that December Strangle range by Expiry  you can sell another Strangle in early January

199276,420792,JNJ,Johnson   Johnson  Becoming More Attractive Each Day,opinion,"Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ   which is one of my favorite long term stocks for income and dividend reinvesting investors  just dropped below the  100 00 per share level and is becoming more attractive each day 
This stock has been doing extremely well over the last few years and should continue to do so  The position has been a worthy buy when it s down and according to its recent trading history  it typically isn t down for long 
If you re a shareholder in this company or are considering a long term position  you ll want to take a look at the company s recently filed Securities and Exchange Commission  SEC  Form 10 Q  which was submitted August 1 
This quarterly SEC filing reveals much more information over and above a company s regular earnings press release  It gives a much better snapshot of a company s financial position  where the sales are  which divisions are the most profitable  and where the company sees its operations in the near future 
In Johnson   Johnson s recently filed Form 10 Q  the company s overall profitability  that is its net earnings as a percentage of total sales  leapt higher from 20 7  to 24 1  in the first half of this year compared to last 
This is a huge accomplishment for a company this large and a major reason why stockholders should feel so confident about increasing dividends in the future  along with more share buybacks 
The company s average common shares outstanding in the first half of 2014 dropped by approximately 3 3 million shares on a diluted basis compared to the same period last year 
Johnson   Johnson s two year stock chart is featured below 

Johnson   Johnson s most recent quarter was a standout  Within the numbers  U S  total sales charged ahead by 15  compared to the second quarter of 2013  sales to Europe advanced 8 2   This was led by a whopping 37  increase in U S  pharmaceutical sales  International pharmaceutical sales grew 6 8  comparatively 
The company s pharmaceutical segment produced a sea of double digit comparative gains  From oncology to immunology  Johnson   Johnson s pharmaceutical business is booming  and it s a big reason why earnings as a percentage of total sales are growing 
While all corporate disclosure is to be taken with a grain of salt  the company s management said that between 2003 and 2013  in the U S  market  the weighted average compound annual price increase for its prescription and over the counter drugs  as well as its hospital and professional products was actually below that of the Consumer Price Index  CPI  
Regardless  pharmaceuticals are the biggest contributor to sales and earnings and the company is on track to have another very good year  
Johnson   Johnson is a very good candidate for those investors able to participate in dividend reinvestment  Those dividends really add up over time  and there s nothing like owning more shares in a company at no additional cost to you as a shareholder 
If you bought Johnson   Johnson s shares in November of 2011  your simple rate of return to date would be approximately 59   But if you reinvested the dividends Johnson   Johnson paid over the same period  your return improves to approximately 74  and naturally  you own more shares over your original investment 
For a company with a long track record of increasing dividend payments to shareholders  a dividend reinvestment strategy with a stock like Johnson   Johnson should continue to produce excellent returns

199277,420793,JNJ,Is Johnson   Johnson s 2 Year Run Over ,opinion,"Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  had been consolidating in a box for over 2 years when it hit my radar in late 2011 here  It took a little longer to move out of that box but since then has had a spectacular run higher from the mid sixties to over 100  But  the run does not seem to be over  In fact there are signs that it may be going through another short term consolidation phase before the next leg higher 

The chart above shows that the move to 105 in June pulled back and retested the 100 level in July  The price held and is moving back higher  Will it get caught at the falling trend resistance  Maybe  It went ex dividend Friday though without much of a pullback  The momentum indicators are supportive of upside with a RSI rising and bullish and the MACD leveling after a pullback  and in positive territory  But a longer term trader or investor can deal with that by selling covered call options as it reverses to collect some premium  There is a natural stop just under 100  making the risk  3 less any premium sold  And how far can it go  The Measured Move out of the triangle it is making now would target 110 but the Point and Figure chart is carrying a price objective to at least 125  Who knew selling Band Aids  Listerine and Baby Powder could be so lucrative

199278,420794,JNJ,HQLA And Munis    The New Rules And Regulations,opinion,"High Quality Liquid Assets  HQLA  is a term that now applies to the implementation of the Liquidity Coverage Ratio  LCR  in the Basel III Rule  This highly technical mouthful of acronyms and rules specifically applies to banks  their liquidity requirements and the rules governing the securities in their investment portfolios  The targets of the new rules are the big banks 
According to an analysis by BMO Capital Markets   In general it will require banks with more than  250 billion in assets to hold enough HQLA to cover 100  of a projected 30 day cash outflow in a stressed scenario   BMO notes that banks holding over  50 billion will have to meet a  lighter version  of the requirements than will banks with over  250 billion  Small banks with under  50 billion are in a different category and are not considered by regulators to be systemically risky institutions  so the new rules do not apply to them 
What does all this have to do with municipal bonds 
The HQLA rules as defined by the Federal Reserve  Fed  for US banks have excluded municipal bonds from this category of securities that must meet the LCR  Corporate bonds  certain equities  conventional mortgages  federal agency securities  and U S  and other OECD sovereign debt are included 
Multiple issues arise for investors in the wake of the new rules  though readers must note that this is a fluid rulemaking determination and things may change  We will address some issues as we see them in this current and evolving regulatory structure 
It is important to note that investment grade corporate bonds have a default rate that is 36 times higher than the default rate on investment grade municipal bonds  This determination is based on information from Moody s and compiled on investment grade defaults from 1970 to 2013  In other words  the Fed has defined into the rule those corporate securities that have 36 times the default rate  historically speaking  of investment grade municipal bonds that the Fed has excluded from the rule 
To give an example  the bond of Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ   a corporation headquartered at Exit 9 of the NJ turnpike is included  but NJ Turnpike Authority debt is not  Both bonds are quite liquid and easily traded  and both are high grade ratings  Why the Fed made this decision  which would include JNJ and exclude NJ TPKE  is still not completely clear  There is discussion underway among market professionals who are attempting to get the Fed to change its view 
What the rule means for municipal bonds is that a support mechanism in the marketplace that would have facilitated the issuance of municipal debt is weakened by a new rule  As a result  it will cost municipal bond issuers more to achieve their financing  There are various estimates of how much more it will cost   these issuers are all guessing  The fact is that it will take time to determine exactly how banks will hold municipal debt in the future  after the market has adjusted the price or yield to make up for the difference made by the rule 
There is an area in which municipal bonds will be surely impacted  That is in the  bank qualified  smaller issues  BQ was an exception made in the Tax Reform Act of 1986 to facilitate the issuance of municipal debt by smaller issuers  Those bonds are not highly liquid and it would have made sense for the Fed to exclude them in a liquidity calculation  In most cases  the banks holding BQ debt are servicing local customers that are municipal entities and assisting them with financing  That is why the Tax Reform Act of 1986 provided special incentives for banks 
We now have a situation resulting from a change in a tax law incentive that had been in place for decades  The Fed has issued a rule that has offset or reduced that incentive  A tension between incentive and disincentive is at work in the small bank qualified issuer municipal bond market  In the United States  a large number of the 90 000 municipal bond issuers fall into in this BQ category  Their cost of financing will certainly rise by some amount 
Let s get to what the new HQLA rules mean for investors  In one way  this is good news  We are taking bond buyers  large banks  for instance  who traditionally participated in parts of a bond market  and removing some of those buyers or imposing a new cost on them  The impact raises tax free yields to offset the change 
Individual municipal bond investors will like this new rule because it results in a higher tax free interest rate for them  There is more prospective tax free income for owning municipal bonds  As attractive as municipal bonds may have been in the past  they will be even more attractive because a competing buyer  the larger banks  is being removed or reduced 
How this ultimately plays out in a  3 7 trillion US municipal bond market remains to be seen  We know the rule currently impacts municipal bond issuers in a negative way  At the present time  there is no indication that the rule is going to be changed 
In the US  at intermediate and long maturities  the tax arbitrage available in the income tax code for tax free bonds is minimally applicable  Market forces are pricing municipal bonds of long maturities at relative bargain rates  We see that today when we compare a long term  true AAA  highest grade  tax free bond with an equivalent long term US Treasury taxable obligation  When we do that  we find the interest rate paid on those tax free bonds in current market conditions is approximately the same as that paid on the taxable bond  In other words  market agents and forces are pricing the municipal bonds as if there is no income tax code  That makes no sense 
We also know that when we get to the shorter maturity end of the yield curve  we see the yield on tax free way below the taxable yield  In the shorter end the tax arbitrage is almost fully applied  In the middle of the yield curve  the tax arbitrage of the US income tax code is somewhat fully applied  while at the longest maturities it is virtually nonexistent in market pricing  So  as one goes from shorter to longer maturity  the tax arbitrage component diminishes  We think HQLA will only exacerbate this anomaly 
The bottom line of HQLA is that a change has occurred that will alter market pricing references by some amount  We do not know how much  HQLA rules will benefit the individual investor who selectively manages municipal bonds and chooses them skillfully  The individual investor will gain at the expense of the large banks  which will be adversely affected to some degree  Small banks are not affected  The details will be revealed as markets adjust to this new paradigm 
Meanwhile  there are still relative bargains in the tax free bond space  Investors who worry about rising rates can use hedging devices to dampen the volatility they would experience if and when rates eventually rise

199279,420795,JNJ,Merck  Chasing Down The  1 Billion Specialty Drug,opinion,"Pharmaceuticals Sector   Merck   Co   Inc 
Yesterday  Merck  NYSE MRK  closed just off the 52 week high  61 33  at 59 99  but it was not for lack of effort or headlines  Merck has been active in 2014 and seems to grab either a positive or negative headline every other day  Headlines go with the territory of being a major pharmaceutical provider in the 21st century  Between the FDA approval process and the numerous lawsuits facing the industry  it can be difficult to determine  
With Merck shares gaining 1 55 percent in the last 30 days and 24 54 percent this year  investors seem to be warming to MRK  The keys to pharmaceutical success remain research and the development of specialty pharmaceuticals  The challenges to release these new drugs is slowed by the FDA process but shares usually receive significant lifts when the FDA announces progress 
Challenges faced by Merck   Co   Inc  
Kenneth Frazier  Merck CEO since 2011  is the last in a long line of executives at Merck who mentored under former CEO and industry magnate P  Roy Vagelos  Before Vagelos retired in 1994  Merck achieved its greatest successes  The company was the biggest pharmaceutical on the planet  Before Frazier  an attorney by trade  took the reins  he met with his former boss and was charged to restore the company to greatness    Some of the mountains Merck has faced include the reality that since 2007  no single Merck drug has generated annual sales of more than  1 billion  Share prices have floundered and with the exception of a boost from the  41 billion acquisition of Schering Plough  performance has been stagnant  But  there is reason for optimism with a few positive releases from the FDA regarding new drugs from MRK 
Merck  which over the last 60 years has brought more new drugs to market than any of its competitors has slipped to fifth place with new approvals over the last 10 years  Once the biggest fish in the pharmaceutical pond  Merck has begun to look like a floundering provider  If research and new specialty drugs drive the truck  Merck has been losing ground and fast  On April 29  2014  Merck s 1st quarter results showed a year over year decline of 3 8 percent as sales slumped to  10 3 billion  The downturn was  to patent expirations and an unfavorable foreign exchange rate 
In early May  Merck  the sale of its consumer care business to Bayer for  14 2 billion in cash  This transaction took place at a time when pharmaceuticals were scurrying to stay ahead of expiring patents and seemed to solidify Merck 
Of late  the news has been more favorable for Merck and investors are responding in kind  Despite a September 9 report that a judge in Pennsylvania refused to dismiss two lawsuits regarding the  of the company s proprietary vaccine for mumps prevention  new announcements from the FDA appear promising 
On September 2  2014  a new survey from Axxiom Consulting reported that more than half of global sales for animal health products  feed and diagnostics were generated in the Kansas City Animal Health Corridor  where Merck is a major player   The corridor generated more than  88 2 billion in sales last year and Merck has benefited from this market 
Reasons for Optimism on Merck
Capital Cube s news releases include an important announcement made September 4th when the FDA announced  as the first cancer drug in the US to treat melanoma  The drug is to be taken in 2 mg hg does every three weeks as a treatment for unresectable or metastatic melanoma  The drug is hailed as a major breakthrough in the fight against cancer and should be a big winner for Merck  On September 5th  the news broke that the cost of Keytruda will be  12 500 per patient per month  At  150 000 per year per patient  Merck may have some  but cost has a way of responding to market conditions 
Also on September 4th  Merck received more good news from the FDA when the company s  as a Qualified Infectious Disease Product  QIDP  on the FDA s Fast Track Status  Under the Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now Act  GAIN   this urinary tract drug could get to market and be in use on an expedited basis  Phase 3 research will commence in 2015  Relebactam has passed Phase 2 testing with outstanding results and is sure to be a huge seller when coming to market  One of these drugs could be the  1 billion specialty drug Merck s recent portfolio has lacked 
On September 8  2014   of 61 33 or 37 percent above the 52 week low of 44 62  The Capital Cube news trail also points out that on September 10th Merck had made  resolving the manufacturing problem that disrupted the flow of the BCG vaccine  Merck received a request from the FDA to step up shipments of the drug after a manufacturing slowdown at the Sanofi  NYSE SNY  Pasteur facility  Over the last two years  Merck manufacture of BCG has increased by 100 percent 
On the development side  Merck is positioned to rebound and investors seem to be responding to the recent good news  However  Merck s inconsistent performance from dividends to sales to weaker than expected margins might dim enthusiasm  As Capital Cube notes  over the last five years  the dividend quality trend has been solid for 4 years but subpar for one year  This does not compare favorably with Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ   a company with much stronger growth expectations than Merck 
But  one of MRK s biggest challenges is in restoring investor confidence in its products and its business operations  If we compare Capital Cube s assessment of MRK s sustainability of returns to JNJ  we can see that MRK has a long way to go 
CEO Frazier has strengthened company reserves over the last 12 months and MRK is in a good position with leverage and liquidity  The company appears not to be entertaining any mergers or acquisitions at this time so growth will be dependent on the new releases  a stronger position in the animal health industry and continued production of BCG  When the two new specialty drugs come to market  investors would like to be holding MRK

program is VK0612  a first in class  orally available drug candidate entering a Phase 2b clinical trial for type 2 diabetes  one of the largest global healthcare challenges today  Preliminary clinical data suggest VK0612 has the potential to provide substantial glucose lowering effects  with an attractive safety and convenience profile compared with existing type 2 diabetes therapies    VKTX s second clinical program is VK5211  an orally available drug candidate entering a Phase 2 clinical trial for the treatment of cancer cachexia  a complex disease characterized by an uncontrolled decline in muscle mass    VK5211 is a non steroidal selective androgen receptor modulator  or SARM  A SARM is designed to selectively interact with a subset of receptors that have a normal physiologic role of interacting with naturally occurring hormones called androgens    Broad activation of androgen receptors with drugs  such as exogenous testosterone  can stimulate muscle growth but often results in unwanted side effects  such as prostate growth  hair growth and acne    VK5211 is expected to selectively produce the therapeutic benefits of testosterone in muscle tissue  with improved safety  tolerability and patient acceptance  VKTX expects to commence Phase 2 clinical trials for both VK0612 and VK5211 in early 2015 and to complete the clinical trials in 2016    Three pre clinical

receptor beta  or TR   agonist for lipid disorders such as dyslipidemia and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis  or NASH  VKTX expects to file an investigational new drug application  or IND  and commence clinical trials for this program in 2015    VK0612 is a potent  selective inhibitor of fructose 1 6 bisphosphatase  or FBPase  an enzyme that plays an important role in endogenous glucose production  or the synthesis of glucose by the body  VKTX believes the inhibition of FBPase provides an attractive approach to controlling blood glucose levels in patients with diabetes  VK0612 has demonstrated potent glucose lowering effects in diabetic animal models    Clinical trials have shown that VK0612 is safe  well tolerated and leads to significant glucose lowering effects in patients with type 2 diabetes  VKTX intends to commence a Phase 2b clinical trial of VK0612 in approximately 500 patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes  defined as having baseline fasting plasma glucose  or FPG  levels greater than or equal to 180 mg dL  VKTX expects to commence the clinical trial in early 2015 and to complete the clinical trial in 2016    Dividend Policy No dividends are planned

licenses from Ligand    VKTX plans to file additional patent applications in the U S   E U  and other foreign jurisdictions on its clinical and preclinical programs    Competition The key competitive factors affecting the success of VK0612  if approved  are likely to be its efficacy  safety  tolerability  frequency and route of administration  convenience and price  and the level of branded and generic competition and the availability of coverage and reimbursement from government and other third party payors    In the U S   there are a variety of currently marketed oral type 2 diabetes

199305,420821,JNJ,J J  Buy Side Sees More Growth,opinion,"Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  is set to report FQ1 2014 earnings before the market opens on Tuesday  April 15th   Johnson   Johnson is one of the largest medical device  pharmaceutical  and packaged consumer goods companies in the world  Over the past year JNJ has beaten expectations from both Wall Street and the buy side 4 quarters in a row  This quarter Wall Street is expecting JNJ to keep expanding and report 3  year over year EPS growth as well as a 2 6  increase in yoy sales  Here s what investors expect JNJ to report on Tuesday 
The information below is derived from data submitted to the Estimize com platform by a set of Buy Side and Independent analyst contributors 

The current Wall Street consensus expectation is for Johnson   Johnson to report  1 48 EPS and  17 955B revenue while the current Estimize com consensus from 22 Buy Side and Independent contributing analysts is  1 49 EPS and  18 051B in revenue  This quarter the buy side as represented by the Estimize com community is expecting Johnson   Johnson to beat the Wall Street consensus on both EPS and revenue by a small margin 
Over the past 6 quarters the consensus from Estimize com has been more accurate than Wall Street in forecasting JNJ s EPS every time and has been more accurate in forecasting revenue 5 times  By tapping into a wider range of contributors including hedge fund analysts  asset managers  independent research shops  students  and non professional investors Estimize has created a data set that is more accurate than Wall Street up to 69 5  of the time  but more importantly it does a better job of representing the market s actual expectations  It has been confirmed by Deutsche Bank Quant  Research and an independent academic study from Rice University that stock prices tend to react with a more strongly associated degree to the expectation benchmark from Estimize than from the Wall Street consensus 
The magnitude of the difference between the Wall Street and Estimize consensus numbers often identifies opportunities to take advantage of expectations that may not have been priced into the market  In this case we are seeing a small to moderate differential between the two groups  EPS expectations 

The distribution of estimates published by analysts on the Estimize com platform range from  1 45 to  1 53 EPS and from  17 900B to  18 594B in revenues  This quarter we re seeing a wider distribution of estimates on Johnson   Johnson  especially on revenue 
The size of the distribution of estimates relative to previous quarters often signals whether or not the market is confident that it has priced in the expected earnings already  A wider distribution of estimates signaling less agreement in the market  which could mean greater volatility post earnings 
 
Over the past 4 months the Wall Street EPS consensus both started and ended the period at  1 48 while the Estimize consensus also remained flat at  1 49  Meanwhile the Wall Street revenue consensus declined from  18 039B to  17 955B while the Estimize forecast rose to a high of  18 179B before falling to  18 051B  Timeliness is correlated with accuracy and downward analyst revenue revisions at the end of the quarter are often a bearish indicator  Although the Estimize revenue consensus was falling going into the report  there is still a moderate differential between the two groups  sales projections 
The analyst with the highest estimate confidence rating this quarter is bonefishr who projects  1 50 EPS and  18 112B in revenue  bonefishr is ranked v among over 4 000 contributing analysts  Over the past 2 years bonefishr has been more accurate than Wall Street in forecasting EPS and revenue 75  and 50  of the time respectively throughout only 4 estimates  Estimate confidence ratings are calculated through algorithms developed by deep quantitative research which looks at correlations between analyst track records and tendencies as they relate to future accuracy  In this case bonefishr is making a bullish call expecting JNJ to beat the Street s expectations on both EPS and revenue 
In 2013 JNJ beat analyst expectations in each quarter and the stock rose 29 1  on the year  This quarter contributing analysts on the Estimize com platform expect Johnson   Johnson to continue the trend and beat the Wall Street consensus by 1c per share on earnings and  96 million in sales

199315,420831,JNJ,Is Dividend Machine Johnson   Johnson Still A Buy ,opinion,"Medical and consumer products giant Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  made a big splash this week by agreeing to sell its Ortho Clinical Diagnostics business to The Carlyle Group  NASDAQ CG   The diagnostics business  which JNJ founded in 1937  makes blood tests that screen for disease and contributed about 2 6  of JNJ s revenue last year 
Carlyle was certainly enthusiastic about the deal     We have been focused on the diagnostics industry for many years given its attractive growth prospects  driven by the crucial role it plays in health care decision making  
I understand Carlyle s rationale for the acquisition  The aging of America gives massive tailwinds to virtually the entire medical sector  and blood testing would seem far safer and less subject to political meddling or Medicare and insurance cuts than  say  cutting edge medical devices or prescription pharmaceuticals 
But I m left scratching my head as to why Johnson   Johnson would want to part with this business 
It s not like Johnson   Johnson needs the money  The company has no net debt  and about 10  of the market cap of JNJ stock is cash in the bank 
J J didn t release much in the way of details as to its motivation for selling  My best guess is that  as a relatively small unit responsible for a tiny sliver of JNJ s revenues  management thought it would make sense to focus its energies on the business lines that have the biggest impact on the income statement  pharmaceuticals  medical devices and consumer products 
To put these product lines in perspective  JNJ operates the eighth largest pharmaceuticals business and the sixth largest biotechnology business in the world  Its medical devices and diagnostics business is the largest in the world  and its consumer health products business   which sells everything from Band Aid bandages to Neutrogena skin care products   is the sixth largest consumer healthcare business in the world 
Suffice it to say  JNJ is a big player in every business line it chooses to enter 
What to Do With JNJ Stock
With Johnson   Johnson in the news   and with JNJ stock continuing its march to  100 per share   is JNJ stock a buy 
Johnson   Johnson is a 128 year old company that has raised its dividend for 51 consecutive years and counting  It s also one of only four American companies that sports a AAA rated credit rating  JNJ is the very definition of a high quality  blue chip stock 
Let s take a look at the numbers 
JNJ stock isn t particularly cheap  trading at 20 times trailing earnings and 16 times expected forward earnings  But then  given JNJ s quality and stability  this is a stock that should and generally does trade at a slight premium to the broader market  JNJ stock sported a much higher multiple for most of the past 15 years  Figure 1  

And while its dividend yield  at 2 7   is lower than the average of recent years  Figure 2   it s still high by the company s standards and significantly higher than the market average  It s also about in line with the current 10 year Treasury yield 

So  is JNJ a buy  I think it is  but only with the right expectations going into it 
For instance  I own JNJ shares in a handful of dividend focused portfolios  and I continue to reinvest my dividends  I consider Johnson   Johnson a great core dividend stock 
But I wouldn t buy JNJ expecting it to massively outperform the market at current prices  At JNJ s current price  you re paying a premium for quality  and that s OK  But I would probably wait for a modest 10  15  pullback before making any major new purchases

199331,420847,JNJ,What Investors Should Know About The Coming Retrenchment,opinion,There are lots of companies but very few stocks I like in this stock market  because stocks have already gone up in value so tremendously    Countless large caps provided excellent returns this year  and many of them are old brands that still offer meaningful dividend yields  What s transpired with the equity market this year has been truly amazing and practically  I don t think the run is over just yet    Cracker Barrel Old Country Store  Inc   CBRL  has a 52 week trading range of  60 07 to  118 44 and a forward price to earnings  P E  ratio of 18 46  according to Thomson Reuters  And guess where the stock is now right at its all time record high  up approximately 84   not including dividends  since this time last year  All this from a mature restaurant brand    Johnson   Johnson  JNJ   one of my key benchmark stocks and the kind of company that s welcome in any long term equity market portfolio  has had a really good year  Its capital appreciation is reminiscent of its performance in the late 90s    Many blue chips trade similarly to Cracker Barrel and Johnson   Johnson  they go through long periods of consolidation providing minimal capital gains  and then they explode in trading action  typically associated with technology stocks  So with the huge price moves  the case for a major retrenchment correction consolidation in the equity market is very solid  But there needs to be a catalyst for this to happen  The equity market is overbought and looking tired  but there is still a strong willingness on the part of institutional investors to buy on the right news I don t think the catalyst for a correction will be corporate led  Balance sheets continue to grow stronger and  generally speaking  the sense that I got from the last couple of earnings seasons is that business conditions and corporate outlooks are improving going into 2014 A geopolitical event could certainly be a catalyst for an equity market correction  but this can t be predicted Equity markets have a tendency to require a big reason for a change in trend  The most powerful force in stocks is monetary policy  but the Street already expects quantitative easing to be tapered  While there will be pressure on interest rates by the marketplace  the central bank continues to chime that the Fed funds rate will be staying put for the foreseeable future So what s left is the potential for non central bank policymakers to act  or not to act  in a manner that wreaks havoc with equity market confidence once again  The political stalemate regarding the debt ceiling is a perfect example  Given current information  I think the next major retrenchment in the equity market will be a buying opportunity  and I m still of the view that investors can stick to the market s existing winners in large caps  The big  brand name companies have the pricing power and economies of scale to accelerate earnings and dividend payments quickly on any uptick in business conditions Disclaimer  There is no magic formula to getting rich  Success in investment vehicles with the best prospects for price appreciation can only be achieved through proper and rigorous research and analysis  The opinions in this e newsletter are just that  opinions of the authors  Information contained herein  while believed to be correct  is not guaranteed as accurate  Warning  Investing often involves high risks and you can lose a lot of money  Please do not invest with money you cannot afford to lose ,2013-11-29,Mitchell Clark,https://www.investing.com/analysis/what-investors-should-know-about-the-coming-retrenchment-193782,193782
199332,420848,JNJ, Pharma And Biotech Stock Outlook  December 2013,opinion,With 2013 coming to an end  the worst of the patent cliff faced by the pharmaceutical sector is over  Major blockbuster drugs like Merck s  MRK  Singulair  Pfizer s  PFE  Lipitor  Forest Laboratories   FRX  Lexapro  Sanofi Bristol Myers Squibbs   SNY   BMY  Plavix and Eli Lilly s  LLY  Zyprexa representing combined branded sales worth more than  15 billion in lost patent protection over the last couple of years  However  the effect of the genericization of these products was felt mostly in 2012  While the industry won t be completely free from genericization  the major patent expiries are over and done with    Several companies which had been struggling to post growth in the face of genericization over the past few years should see accelerated growth in 2014  New products should start contributing significantly to results and increased pipeline visibility and appropriate utilization of cash should increase confidence in the sector  Some products that are slated to lose patent protection later this year and next year include AstraZeneca s  AZN  Nexium could also start facing generics from 2014 in the U S   where sales were  2 2 billion in 2012 Collaborations  Acquisitions and Restructuring The pharma sector witnessed major merger and acquisitions  M A  activity over the last couple of years  The trend continued this year and going forward  we expect small bolt on acquisitions to continue  In licensing activities and collaborations for the development of pipeline candidates have also increased significantly  Several pharma companies are focusing on in licensing mid to late stage pipeline candidates that look promising  instead of developing a product from scratch  which involves a lot of funds and time  Small biotech companies are open to in licensing activities and collaborations  Most of these companies find it challenging to raise cash  thereby making it difficult for them to survive and continue with the development of promising pipeline candidates  Therefore  it makes sense for them to seek deals with pharma companies that are sitting on huge piles of cash  We recommend biotech stocks that have attractive pipeline candidates or technology that can be used for the development of novel therapeutics  Therapeutic areas which could see a lot of in licensing activity include oncology  central nervous system disorders  diabetes and immunology inflammation  The hepatitis C virus  HCV  market is also attracting a lot of attention  Some recent acquisitions deals include Shire s  SHPG  upcoming acquisition of ViroPharma  VPHMt   Salix s upcoming acquisition of Santarus  SNTS  as well as the acquisition of Optimer Pharmaceuticals and Trius Therapeutics by Cubist Pharmaceuticals  CBST   Elan  ELN  is also on track to be acquired by Perrigo Company  PRGO  by year s end  Another trend that we are seeing in recent months is the divestment of non core business segments  Pfizer sold its Capsugel unit and its Nutrition business in Aug 2011 and Nov 2012  respectively  Pfizer then spun off its animal health business into a new company  Zoetis  ZTS   Meanwhile  GlaxoSmithKline  GSK  divested certain non core brands from its Consumer Healthcare segment  In Aug 2011  AstraZeneca sold its Astra Tech business to DENTSPLY  XRAY     The monetization of non core assets will allow the pharma biotech companies to focus on their areas of expertise  Abbott Labs  ABT  split into two separate publicly traded companies  while one company deals in diversified medical products  the other  AbbVie  ABBV   is focusing on research based pharmaceuticals  Johnson   Johnson  JNJ  also announced its plans to explore strategic alternatives for its ortho clinical diagnostics business  including a possible divestiture  Vertex  VRTX  monetized its Incivo related royalties    Vertex can use the cash generated from this deal for its cystic fibrosis program  Restructuring activities are also gaining momentum as large pharma companies are looking to cut costs and streamline their operations  Most of these companies are re evaluating their pipelines and discontinuing programs which do not have a favorable risk benefit profile  Some of the companies that announced restructuring plans include Merck  Novartis  NVS   Eli Lilly  Shire and Sanofi Emerging Markets and Biosimilars Another trend seen in the pharmaceutical sector is a focus on emerging markets  Companies like Mylan  MYL   Pfizer  Merck  Eli Lilly  Glaxo and Sanofi are all looking to expand their presence in India  China  Brazil and other emerging markets  Until recently  most of the commercialization efforts were focused on the U S  market    the largest pharmaceutical market    along with Europe and Japan  Emerging markets are slowly and steadily gaining more importance  and several companies are now shifting their focus to these areas  However  while higher demand for medicines  government initiatives for healthcare  new patient population and increasing use of generics should help drive demand  we point out that emerging markets are also not immune from genericization  Moreover  investigations into bribery charges in China could put a lid on near term growth  Meanwhile  growth in Europe will continue to be pressurized by austerity and cost containment measures  We are also seeing several companies entering into deals for the development of biosimilars  generic versions of biologics  Companies like Merck  Amgen  Biogen  BIIB   and Actavis  ACT  are all targeting the highly lucrative biosimilars market 3Q Earnings All companies falling under the Medical sector have reported third quarter 2013 results  While earnings beat and revenue beat ratios  percentage of companies coming out with positive surprises  were pretty impressive  growth ratios were modest  Third quarter results were characterized by currency headwinds especially in Japan as well as a slowdown in China where bribery investigations remained in the headlines  Third quarter 2013 earnings  beat ratio  was 74 5  while the revenue  beat ratio  was 51 0   Total earnings for this sector were up 0 2   compared to the 1 5  decline recorded in the second quarter of 2013  Total revenues moved up 5 8  in the quarter versus 2 4  growth in the second quarter of 2013  Looking at the consensus earnings expectations for the fourth quarter  earnings are expected to decline 3 5   Tough challenges for some companies  negative currency movement and a few patent expiries will affect fourth quarter growth  With the year coming to an end  several companies maintained or narrowed their guidance ranges  Overall  2013 earnings are expected to grow 0 6  Focus on New Products 2012 saw the FDA approving 35 novel medicines including the following  Most of these products have been performing well so far in 2013  Stivarga  Kalydeco  Xtandi and Kyprolis  especially  represent strong commercial potential  So far in 2013  quite a few important products have gained approval including Biogen s oral multiple sclerosis drug Tecfidera  Johnson   Johnson s type II diabetes drug Invokana  Merck s Liptruzet  cholesterol   Forest s Fetzima  major depressive disorder   Pharmacyclics  PCYC  Johnson   Johnson s Imbruvica  mantle cell lymphoma  and Roche s  RHHBY  Gazyva  chronic lymphocytic leukemia   Biogen s Tecfidera is off to a strong start with sales surpassing expectations by a wide margin  Upcoming events include FDA advisory panel reviews of the biologic licensing application  BLA  for Bristol Myers Squibbs  metreleptin  rare forms of lipodystrophy  and dapagliflozin  type II diabetes   and Merck s Grastek  a Timothy grass pollen extract tablet for sublingual use   All these reviews are scheduled to take place in the Dec 11   12 timeframe  A response on the approval status of Auxilium Pharma s  AUXL  Xiaflex for Peyronie s and Gilead s sofosbuvir  chronic HCV infection  in the U S  should also be out in December Zacks Industry Rank Within the Zacks Industry classification  pharma and biotech are broadly grouped into the Medical sector  one of 16 Zacks sectors  and further sub divided into four industries at the expanded level  large cap pharma  med biomed gene  med drugs and med generic drugs  We rank all the 260 plus industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each industry  To learn more  visit  About Zacks Industry Rank  As a point of reference  the outlook for industries with Zacks Industry Rank  88 and lower is  Positive   between  89 and  176 is  Neutral  and  177 and higher is  Negative   The Zacks Industry Rank for large cap pharma is  95  med biomed gene is  77  med drugs is  66  while the med generic drugs is  40  Analyzing the Zacks Industry Rank for different medical segments  it is obvious that the outlook is Positive for med drugs  med biomed gene and med generic drugs and Neutral for large cap pharma stocks OPPORTUNITIES The outlook for the pharma sector has improved significantly with the Zacks Industry Rank moving up from  195 to  95 over the past few months  While several companies will continue to face challenges like EU austerity measures and genericization  the pharma industry is out of the worst of the genericization phase    Many companies which had faced generic headwinds in the last couple of years should continue to see a sustained improvement in results as we move into 2014  Cost cutting  downsizing  streamlining of the pipeline  growth in emerging markets and new product launches should support growth  Among large cap pharma stocks  Bayer  BAYRY   a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  stock  looks well positioned with several new products    Eylea  Stivarga and Xarelto    in its portfolio  These products represent significant commercial potential Forest Labs  FRX   another Zacks Rank  2 stock  is doing well with first half fiscal 2014 results beating expectations  The company has launched several new products over the past few quarters and continues to work on expanding its pipeline  This company also raised its earning guidance for fiscal 2014 Shire  SHPG   Analyst Report   a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  stock  looks well positioned for growth with the company expanding its product portfolio and pipeline through the upcoming acquisition of ViroPharma  We are positive on Johnson   Johnson  JNJ  even though the company currently holds a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   The company has performed well so far this year and the momentum should continue  Johnson   Johnson upped its 2013 earnings guidance again after announcing third quarter results    The company has been trying to offset the declining sales of some of its important products by bringing in new products through in licensing deals and acquisitions  We believe the diversity and strength of the company s underlying businesses will continue to provide strong growth in future  In the biotech space  we are positive on Biogen  BIIB   Tecfidera  the company s recently launched oral multiple sclerosis drug  is off to a strong start with the product delivering sales of  478 million since its launch in early April  While Tecfidera has gained the top spot in the oral multiple sclerosis market in the U S   Avonex and Tysabri should continue contributing significantly to sales  Tecfidera should gain EU approval shortly  Biogen is also progressing with its hemophilia pipeline  Biogen is another company that raised its 2013 guidance again this year  We are also positive on Amgen  AMGN   Amgen should be able to deliver on its long term strategy based on expansion in key markets  launch of new manufacturing technologies  and pipeline development  Enbrel should continue performing well  Amgen s late stage pipeline is also moving along  While Amgen is a Zacks Rank  2 stock  Biogen is a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock  Gilead  a Zacks Rank  3 stock  continues to do well in the HIV segment and is also progressing with its HCV pipeline Medivation  MDVN   a Zacks Rank  2 company  should continue delivering with its prostate cancer therapy  Xtandi  performing well  Based on the data we have seen so far  we believe Xtandi has blockbuster potential  It is currently in several studies including for the pre chemo setting  Expansion into the pre chemo setting would be a major positive for Medivation Vanda Pharmaceuticals  Inc   VNDA   Snapshot Report  also looks well positioned with the company receiving a positive feedback from the FDA regarding insomnia candidate  tasimelteon  The FDA s advisory panel voted resoundingly in favor of approving the candidate for the treatment of Non 24 Hour Disorder in the totally blind  While the FDA is not required to follow the advice of its advisory panel  it usually does so  A response from the agency should be out by Jan 31  2014  Vanda is a Zacks Rank  1

199334,420850,JNJ,MedTech Industry Update  Restructuring  Mergers And Market Expansion,opinion,We are on the verge of the Q4 earnings season and it is once again time to review the players in the worldwide medical devices market  For the U S  medical device industry  spending cuts and higher taxes have been a big issue lately  The industry faced sequestration related spending cuts to the U S  federal budget and the 2 3  medical device excise tax  Unfortunately  this is not the end of the story  This year  more spending cuts are scheduled to take place which will last through 2021  The sequestration which resulted in a 5 5  cut in the National Institutes of Health s  NIH  fiscal 2013 budget resulted in 640 fewer grants in 2013    The NIH was not the sole victim of federal budget austerities  In 2013  under the sequester  there was a 5  cut in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention s budget  another 5  cut to the U S  Food and Drug Administration s fund and a 2  cut in Medicare funding that included cut in payments to hospitals  physicians  other medical providers  Medicare Advantage insurance companies and Part D prescription drug plans  Unless repealed or replaced  NIH apprehends sequestration to take a worse shape in 2014 leading to serious consequences like delaying progress in medical breakthroughs  deterioration in job creation and tempering of economic growth  An NBC news article recently noted that many new researchers  who were trained with the U S  taxpayer s money  may have to move to Europe and Asia where government funding for medical research is on the rise  On top of these  the Obamacare s medical device excise tax is taking a heavy toll on the MedTech sector  hurting pricing decisions of companies and subjecting them to tremendous margin pressure  The small and the medium sized players in the sector  comprising about 80  of the industry  are the worst hit by this public policy  The devastating 2 3  excise tax  effective Jan 2013   which is imposed on the sale price instead of net profit  amounts to a stupendous sum  wiping out almost a quarter of the profit at the med instrument owners  Conversely  the big players are trying every means to change their business model and cost structure to accommodate the excise tax  They are undertaking various restructuring initiatives to counter costs incurred from the implementation of the new tax  Restructuring especially to offset the effect of the excise tax has already been adopted by key players  such as  Boston Scientific Corporation  BSX   Medtronic Inc   MDT   St  Jude Medical  Inc   STJ   Stryker Corporation  SYK   Zimmer Holdings  ZMH  and Quest Diagnostics  DGX   The companies are also trying to focus on strategic mergers and acquisitions  M A   emerging market expansion or are reducing operations in order to weather the tax burden   M A Activities As mentioned above  MedTech M A is expected to continue unabated in 2014  Wary of an uncertain economy  MedTech giants have resorted to the acquisition route to harness their strength and diversify offerings  The most noteworthy move in recent times was the Irish medical device maker Covidien plc  s  COV   860 million deal in December to acquire Israel based diagnostic products maker Given Imaging  GIVN  in order to get a share of the  3 billion gastrointestinal  GI  market  The acquisition is expected to be completed by Mar 31  2014  Stryker Corporation was also in the headlines last month with its  1 65 billion acquisition of robotic assisted surgery developer MAKO Surgical Corp  Stryker is excited about inheriting MAKO s robotic technology as the company believes it has long term potential for human joint reconstruction  Last month  HeartWare International  HTWR  acquired CircuLite  Inc     developer of the SYNERGY Circulatory Support System for a cash and stock deal amounting to  350 million  This accentuates the company s focus on advanced heart failure treatment    In November  Wright Medical Group  Inc   WMGI  succeeded in its efforts to expand its direct sales and international distribution network in France by completing the acquisition of French orthopedic extremities company Biotech International  The acquisition has added Biotech s extremity product portfolio that will boost WMGI s global Extremities business growth  In continuity of its strategic investment plans  Henry Schein  Inc   HSIC  acquired a 60  stake in BioHorizons  a U S  based manufacturer of advanced dental implants with sales of  115 million  The acquisition of BioHorizons marks Henry Schein s foray into the global implant market  which is estimated to touch  4 2 billion by 2016  Combined together  the U S and Canadian markets alone have a potential of  1 5 billion in 2016  up from  1 billion in 2012 CareFusion Corp   CFN  announced in November that it has signed a  500 million agreement to acquire Vital Signs  a division of GE Healthcare  for  500 million  The acquisition will not only expand its Specialty Disposables business under the Procedural Solutions segment internationally but establish it as a leader in the  3 billion market for respiratory and anesthesia consumables  There have been many more M As in the MedTech space  Boston Scientific Corporation recently closed the acquisition of Bard EP  the electrophysiology business of C R  Bard  Inc   BCR   The deal  valued at  275 million  is a step forward to strengthening the company s foothold in the  2 5 billion global electrophysiology market  In October  St  Jude Medical acquired world s first and only leadless pacemaker manufacturer Nanostim  Inc  for  123 5 million  St  Jude utilized an exclusive option  obtained on May 3  2011  when it had entered into a partnership agreement with the then privately held company  In September  Kinetic Concepts formed a trinity with LifeCell Corp  and Systagenix to develop a diversified wound care  biologics and regenerative medicine company with more than  2 billion in sales  At the end of September  Baxter International    closed its  3 9 billion deal to acquire Gambro AB  a Sweden based privately owned renal products company  The deal is expected to strengthen the company s role in the hemodialysis market  A notable move made in recent times was the MedTech giant Medtronic Inc  s strategic shift from being a device manufacturer to a provider of broader healthcare services and solutions with meaningful clinical and economic value for hospitals  physicians  patients and payers  As an opening move  in August  the company acquired privately held Cardiocom  a provider of integrated telehealth and patient services for chronic disease management  for  200 million  Also worth mentioning is the mega  13 6 billion takeover agreement by Thermo Fisher Scientific  TMO  to acquire its major peer Life Technologies Corporation  LIFE   This is the biggest ever deal for Thermo Fisher which will inevitably strengthen the company s global foothold and commercial reach  With the approval of LIFE s stockholders and the European Commission in favor of the deal  the acquisition is expected to close in early 2014    In August  C  R  Bard entered into a  200 million definitive acquisition deal to purchase a leading developer and supplier of plant based hemostatic agents  Medafor  Inc  The acquisition will help Bard gain access to a proprietary technology platform and expand its global footprint  It will boost the company s surgical specialties portfolio  particularly surgical hemostats  in its Davol subsidiary  Also  Quest Diagnostics  acquisition of ConVerge Diagnostic Services  LLC from Water Street Healthcare Partners in October was part of the five point strategy announced by the company in 2012  ConVerge Diagnostic was the fourth laboratory acquisition of Quest Diagnostics in 2013 following the acquisitions of UMass Memorial Medical Center s clinical and anatomic pathology outreach laboratory businesses  Jan 2013   the toxicology and clinical laboratory business from Concentra  a subsidiary of Humana  Inc  HUM   May 2013  and the acquisition of lab related clinical outreach service operations of California based Dignity Health  Jun 2013   In June  to strengthen its contraceptive portfolio  drug and pesticide maker Bayer    acquired the contraceptive device maker Conceptus Inc  for approximately  1 1 billion in cash  This acquisition has added the Essure permanent  non surgical  birth control system to Bayer s product portfolio   In the light of the discussion above  we see no slowing down of M A deals in the MedTech space in the first half of 2014    We also expect a significant pickup in in licensing activities and collaborations for the development of pipeline candidates  Several MedTech majors struggling in their core businesses are looking to explore potential emerging therapies through collaborations and alliances  Divestments With the medical device excise tax in force  leading to further contraction in profit margins  we have been observing a lot of divestments of late  particularly of non core business segments  Divestment  specifically to offset the tax  has already been announced by key players like Johnson   Johnson  JNJ   Medtronic and Quest Diagnostics  We expect this trend to continue into 2014  MedTech giant Johnson   Johnson  after its  1 billion acquisition of privately held  pharmaceutical discovery and development company  Aragon Pharmaceuticals  Inc  is currently looking for opportunities to sell or spin off its Ortho Clinical Diagnostics business  Last August  Medtronic handed over its interventional device Pioneer Plus re entry catheter product line to Volcano Corporation  VOLC   Quest Diagnostics has also been focusing on areas with high potential  such as  gene based esoteric testing for cancer  cardiovascular disease  infectious disease and neurological disorders  As a part of this strategy  in November  it divested the Enterix colorectal cancer screening test business to Clinical Genomics Technologies Pty Ltd    In July  the company sold its rights to royalties from the commercialization of the Imbruvica to Royalty Pharma  the industry leader in acquiring royalty interests in marketed and late stage biopharmaceutical products  for  485 million in cash  Earlier  in April  the company completed the divestiture of the HemoCue diagnostics products business Kimberly Clark Corporation  KMB  on the other hand is working on a potential tax free spin off of the company s health care business   This spin off would create a stand alone  publicly traded health care company with  1 6 billion in annual net sales with a significant presence in both surgical and infection prevention products and in the medical devices market  Wright Medical expects to close the sale of its OrthoRecon unit to MicroPort Medical B V   a subsidiary of MicroPort Scientific Corporation  by the end of January this year  Novartis  NVS  has also entered into a definitive agreement to divest its blood transfusion diagnostics unit to Spain based Grifols for  1 675 billion  The divestment is expected to be completed by the first half of 2014  Last October  GE Healthcare sold off its Centricity Laboratory Division to Cirdan Ultra  a subsidiary of Ireland based Cirdan Imaging Limited  In 2013  to focus on its high margin Medical Devices and Medical Supplies businesses  healthcare products maker Covidien  COV  divested its pharmaceuticals business Mallinckrodt plc  MNK   Last January  Abbott Laboratories separated its research based pharmaceuticals business by creating a new company  AbbVie  ABBV   to allow the two separate entities to focus on their core areas of expertise Emerging Markets Although the U S  still holds the leading position with almost one third of the global market share  a gradual slowing down of the established markets due to several prevailing headwinds are forcing MedTech companies to move beyond their comfort zone  Currently with the growth rate remaining at low single digits in developed markets like the U S   Europe and Japan  large cap medical device makers are looking to invest more in the high growth emerging markets  Accordingly  emerging economies like Brazil  Russia  India and China   collectively known as BRICs   as well as Turkey  Mexico  Malaysia  South Africa  South Korea and the Czech Republic are fast coming up in the medical devices space  These emerging economies are seeing an increasing uptake in medical devices due largely to growing medical awareness and economic prosperity  Urbanization is taking place at a massive rate in most of these regions with people entering the middle class and demanding better health care  An aging population  increasing wealth  government focus on healthcare infrastructure and expansion of medical insurance coverage make these markets a happy hunting ground for global medical device players  Expansion in emerging markets  especially those with double digit annual growth rates  represents one of the best potential avenues for growth in 2014 and beyond  Companies like Abbott  Medtronic  Boston Scientific  Edwards Lifescience  EW   Thermo Fisher Scientific  Life Technologies  Smith and Nephew  SNN  and many more are all vying to expand their presence in BRIC and other emerging markets  These companies are also looking to establish their manufacturing facilities abroad  Abbott continues to lead the trend with about 40  of sales coming from emerging markets  The company expects this contribution to increase to 50  by 2015  Johnson   Johnson with almost 25  of sales derived from the emerging markets is currently working to increase its presence in this region    The company has already set up manufacturing and R D centers in Brazil  China and India  The Guangzhou Bioseal Biotech deal marked the company s first MedTech acquisition in China  The company is expected to expand further in China on the back of the Synthes acquisition Becton  Dickinson and Company  BDX  with about 23  of revenues coming from the emerging markets is currently promoting its product lines in HIV monitoring  Diabetes Care and TB Diagnostics  Baxter on the other hand  given the possibilities rife in these regions  is working hard at expansion  20  of the company s worldwide sales came from this segment in the third quarter of 2013  Medtronic  with emerging market exposure of 12   continues to record double digit growth in emerging markets  accounting for half of its overall growth  The adoption of its implantable cardioverter defibrillators  ICDs  and pacers in the emerging markets continues to improve  Moreover  commercialization of new products should accelerate sales growth in these regions  Management is targeting 20  of its revenues from emerging markets over the long term with mid teens growth for the current fiscal  According to the company  the premium segments in China and India alone include a population of more than 380 million  leading to  5 billion of annual sales opportunity  Boston Scientific is also aiming to increase its below average market share in the  700 million combined drug eluting stent market in China and India  which is growing sharply at 20   The company plans to invest  150 million in China over the next five years to build a local manufacturing operation  Stryker  with its acquisition of China based Trauson Medical  is expected to grow market share in the value oriented orthopedic segment in the developing nations  In November  orthopedic major  Smith   Nephew acquired the assets of its Brazilian distributor  Pr  Cirurgia Especializada  PCE   PCE has been associated with the company for the last 30 years and has distributed its sports medicine  orthopedic reconstruction and trauma offerings in Brazil    The company is also venturing into India and Turkey  In May 2013  the company announced an agreement to take over Adler Mediequip Private Limited and with it  the brands and assets of Sushrut Surgicals Private Limited  a leader in mid tier  orthopedic trauma products for the Indian market  Last July  the company decided to acquire certain assets of its Turkish distributor Plato Grup  The acquisition will promote distribution of Smith   Nephew s orthopedic reconstruction  trauma and sports medicine products in Turkey  Thermo Fisher is also expanding its presence in the emerging markets  It expects to garner 25  of total revenues from the high growth Asia Pacific region and emerging markets by 2016  up from 19  in 2011  According to the company  China with its rapid industrialization  increasing focus on healthcare  new BioPharma R D centers and government sponsored research has robust growth potential  Brazil is also gaining momentum with growth rate of more than 20   On the other hand  key growth drivers in India include outsourcing of clinical packaging and logistics by Pharma and Biotech companies  growing Biotech and food   beverage industries  and introduction of environmental regulations to address air quality issues in the wake of rapid industrialization  Among the BRIC members  Brazil is currently the largest healthcare market in Latin America  covering almost one fourth of the population  Though India has one of the largest and fastest growing healthcare markets in the world  it is considered to have the least developed healthcare infrastructure and spends relatively little in this area  In order to reverse the trend  during the 12th Plan  2012 2017   the Indian government planned to spend 2 5  of its GDP  up from 1 2  earlier  on health care and raise it to at least 3  by 2022    Other Issues at Work Apart from the medical device excise tax and sequestration  other issues faced by the MedTech industry include pricing concerns  hospital admission and procedural volume pressure  Medicare reimbursement issues and regulatory overhang  While the debt crisis in Europe remains unresolved  economies throughout the world are trying to come to terms with myriad challenges  Consequently  procedural volumes in the U S  have been hit by a high unemployment rate  which has resulted in the expiry of health insurance as well as a decline in enrollment in private health plans  Governments across several European countries have taken up measures to curb spending on devices  which is taking a toll on utilization  Volume headwind is likely to linger as unemployment continues to influence procedure deferrals  Last but not least  the highly regulated U S  medical device industry is constrained by stringent and complex procedures  leading to approval delays  This sometimes demotivates companies  deterring them from investing in product development  According to a report based on a survey of over 200 medical technology companies  FDA Impact on U S  Medical Technology Innovation   the FDA takes a significantly longer time to review compared to its European counterpart Zacks Industry Rank Within the Zacks Industry classification  MedTech is broadly grouped into the Medical sector  one of 16 Zacks sectors  and further sub divided into four industries at

big three medical device players   Medtronic  Boston Scientific and St  Jude   are striving to gain share in the ICD market through new product launches  The companies are also exploring fresh avenues of growth beyond the mature pacemaker and ICD markets    With gradual stability in the ICD market  these players should be able to revive their top line  Also  better pipeline visibility and appropriate utilization of cash should increase confidence in the medical device sector  The better than expected ICD performance from the trio indicates a revival in the worldwide ICD market The Cooper Companies Inc     represents a value proposition based on factors such as margin expansion  acquisitions  product line expansion and geographical reach as well as share buybacks  On the other hand  we are positive about multiple initiatives taken by Boston Scientific to expand electrophysiology  EP  division  St  Jude is also doing well with its growing Atrial Fibrillation products

I would say that given current earnings and expectations for 2014  the stock market is at least slightly if not fully overvalued at present  With the expectation of very modest earnings growth in the third quarter and little in the way of sales growth  especially among large cap companies   recent stock market strength has been an expansion of valuations only  This is why I m so cautious near term and why October could be a wild ride for share prices  It is quite likely that market leaders that did well in the first two quarters of this year will continue to do so  These are the Johnson   Johnson s  JNJ  of the equity market universe these are the companies that have been well bid by institutional investors 
The health of large corporations continues to be robust  But if their earnings can t outperform or sales growth is nonexistent  then the last carrot attracting shareholders is increased dividends I think we re going to get a lot of news related to new share buyback programs and increasing dividends for the simple reason that companies won t be able to beat consensus earnings in the third quarter Or at best  they will produce results similar to the second quarter  when most corporations were not able to beat consensus on both revenues and adjusted earnings These are the makings of the next recession in 2014  Rising interest rates  continued lackluster revenue and earnings growth from companies  and mediocrity in other mature economies can certainly tip the GDP scale I am therefore very cautious on the near term outlook for stocks  and I do believe that the marketplace will continue to stick with its existing winners  These are the companies that can deliver on revenue and earnings expectations with rising dividends  It s a blue chip market  and in a slow growth environment  the big brand name companies are what you want to stick with Disclaimer  There is no magic formula to getting rich  Success in investment vehicles with the best prospects for price appreciation can only be achieved through proper and rigorous research and analysis  The opinions in this e newsletter are just that  opinions of the authors  Information contained herein  while believed to be correct  is not guaranteed as accurate  Warning  Investing often involves high risks and you can lose a lot of money  Please do not invest with money you cannot afford to lose ",2013-09-25,Mitchell Clark,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/with-q3-earnings-expectations-falling,-where-to-invest-now-185190",185190
199352,420868,JNJ,Looking For Rising Dividend Income  Stick With Existing Winners,opinion,Third quarter earnings season continues this week  with a number of companies set to report in the next few days  the stock market s attention should finally be on corporate earnings  And while earnings expectations are being reduced  the positive disposition to the Dow Jones Transportation Average remains  The index has trended higher compared to many blue chips  which have been in consolidation for some time now  Many component companies of the index are trading at or near their 52 week highs  With this trend  there is still some resilience to this stock market  even with a backdrop of reduced earnings outlooks  What is noteworthy in this regard is the NASDAQ Composite Index  which remains right at its 52 week high and is creeping closer to its all time record high set in 2000  Countless technology and biotechnology stocks continue to push to new highs  It s a near term bullish stock market indicator in an environment of declining expectations  And declining expectations are why the action in the NASDAQ is so worrisome  The stock market s been stretched for some time now  with previous leadership from blue chips and small cap companies  The recent outperformance in the NASDAQ Composite the component companies of which are far more risky than blue chips is itself a telling indicator  But while the stock market has been due for a correction for months now  the action in the Dow Jones transportation stocks  as well as the technology sector  is evidence of the continued resilience in equities  Recognizing that there are very few instances of optimal buying opportunities in this stock market  I m still very reticent to be a buyer in a market that s nearing its all time high on what is looking to be anemic earnings growth  There s nothing wrong with building cash positions at this time  Of course  secure dividend paying securities are still going to be in demand in a stock market that s actually starved of genuine economic growth  For investors considering new positions in this stock market  I m a fan of sticking with existing winners  These are blue chip dividend paying stocks like Johnson   Johnson  JNJ   The Procter   Gamble Company  PG   PepsiCo  Inc   PEP   and The Walt Disney Company   DIS  all large  brand name companies that have meaningful dividend yields and aren t overly stretched in terms of valuation I m also a fan of domestic energy and storage stocks  select restaurant stocks  and select transportation companies  But the reality is that economic conditions slowed in the third quarter and financial results should reflect this  There s no urgency to buy this stock market  I expect the market to sell off shortly ,2013-10-17,Mitchell Clark,https://www.investing.com/analysis/looking-for-rising-dividend-income-stick-with-existing-winners-188464,188464
199353,420869,JNJ,My Six Favorite Growing Dividend Payers,opinion,"The stock market typically reacts quite positively when a company beats Wall Street consensus  But in a considerable number of cases  a company s share price after earnings bounce isn t really warranted  considering the run up in anticipation Many stocks go up in value after beating expectations  but many numbers this quarter actually reveal a contraction in business conditions Western Digital Corporation  WDC  is the Irvine  California based maker of hard drives and solid state hybrid drives for desktops and personal computers  PCs   The company beat the Street on earnings  but the company s numbers actually represented a decline from the comparable quarter last year The company said that in its most recent quarter  fiscal 2014 first quarter   sales dropped six percent to  3 8 billion  earnings fell to  495 million  or  2 05 per share  compared to  519 million  or  2 06 per share  in the same period a year ago  and adjusted earnings came in at  2 12  while Wall Street was looking for a consensus of  2 05 Naturally  the position moved higher on the stock market  The company did experience an improved gross margin  but it wasn t a good quarter  The stock is up about 70  so far this year to an all time record high There are countless other stories similar to Western s  and investors have to be very careful with this so called outperformance by Wall Street standards  Business conditions are not improving for a lot of companies  Earnings are slightly improving  but only through continued pressure on costs and a slight improvement in pricing Of course  the monetary backdrop continues to be very supportive for stocks as we know  The S P 500 Index has broken out of what looked like the perfect head and shoulders pattern  It s still an ominous looking chart  but the breakout pattern is significant  It s as if the index is returning to its modern era mean  The S P 500 s 35 year chart is featured below 
Investment risk is always high with equities  but there are very few alternative investment classes with interest rates sitting so low  especially for those investors who rely on dividend income  Given the monetary situation and the expectation that the Federal Reserve will continue to be highly supportive to equities  this is very much a market that can still tick higher  But there is absolutely no need to chase stocks  or play the momentum gain  especially with companies that aren t actually growing  Wall Street s expectations for a company are both useful and irrelevant at the same time  Stocks didn t advance this year on the expectation of better growth rates of revenues and earnings  the marketplace just went all in with the Federal Reserve s grand attempt at reflation  For investors  I like existing winners that pay growing dividends in an era of very slow real corporate growth  Companies like NIKE  Inc   NKE   Johnson   Johnson  JNJ   PepsiCo  Inc   PEP   Canadian National Railway Company  CNI   E  I  du Pont de Nemours and Company  DD   and Colgate Palmolive Company  CL  are just a few examples of growing dividend payers with excellent long term track records of wealth creation   See  Equity Market Super Stock Adding Up to Solid Returns    And energy is not to be excluded as a great income provider  It s one of the economic bright spots with staying power for the rest of this decade  If a company beats the Street  that s great  But when it beats the Street without actually growing comparatively  it s not worth chasing

199359,420875,JNJ,Johnson   Johnson  Delivers The Goods  Again,opinion,In what can only be described as another excellent quarter of performance and growth  Johnson   Johnson  JNJ  once again beat Wall Street consensus with its earnings  The company defied the odds and posted genuine business growth not just domestically  but abroad as well  Similar to its first quarter performance  the company seems to be on a bit of a roll Johnson   Johnson reported revenues of  17 9 billion for the second quarter of 2013  a solid increase of 8 5  over the comparable quarter in 2012  Domestic sales grew eight percent  which was expected  the surprise was in the company s international sales  which grew 11 8  in total  with a negative currency impact of 2 8  for a net growth of nine percent  This growth measure includes acquisitions and divestitures  excluding those  global operational sales growth was 5 6  Global pharmaceutical revenues were  7 0 billion in the second quarter for a net gain of 11 7  comparatively  Domestic pharmaceutical sales grew 9 1  Johnson   Johnson s operational top line growth really is solid  considering today s economically challenged global economy  The company appears to be in the right businesses at the right time  at least according to the numbers On the stock market  Johnson   Johnson s shares have soared as the marketplace chases the safest  dividend paying stocks that are actually able to generate real economic growth The company s stock chart is featured below  Earnings were  3 8 billion  including a gain on sale and an after tax gain   and diluted earnings per share  EPS  were  1 33  handedly beating Wall Street estimates  Not only did Johnson   Johnson s numbers beat consensus  but the company also increased its full year 2013 guidance  The company raised its earnings forecast to a range of  5 40  5 47 a share excluding items  At the beginning of the year  Johnson   Johnson forecast earnings between  5 35 and  5 45 a share  Speaking of beginnings  Johnson   Johnson s share price is up a whopping  20 00 a share  not including dividends  since the beginning of the year  The company is now worth a quarter of a trillion dollars  which is truly amazing for such a mature brand  Johnson   Johnson exemplifies the kind of stock that institutional investors want to own in this kind of market  The company has diversified operations  so there are good prospects for dividend increases going forward  and there s a lot of safety in what this company is selling  Revenues and earnings growth  while not robust  were still very impressive for a company of this size The company really hasn t done much on the stock market over the last seven years until recently  when all of a sudden it did  But that is how so many large cap  blue chip companies trade  periods of nonperformance are met with increasing dividends followed by a comparatively short breakout representing the majority of the position s capital gains over a period of time  The opportunity cost of not being in the position while it is experiencing its breakout capital gains is significant  Johnson   Johnson serves to illustrate that great businesses tend to remain just that great and that long term ownership with dividend reinvestment is an excellent way to generate meaningful investment returns  Without question  this company is due for a stock market correction  Disclaimer  There is no magic formula to getting rich  Success in investment vehicles with the best prospects for price appreciation can only be achieved through proper and rigorous research and analysis  The opinions in this e newsletter are just that  opinions of the authors  Information contained herein  while believed to be correct  is not guaranteed as accurate  Warning  Investing often involves high risks and you can lose a lot of money  Please do not invest with money you cannot afford to lose ,2013-07-19,Mitchell Clark,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/johnson---johnson:-delivers-the-goods,-again-176130",176130
199360,420876,JNJ,S P 500 Lapping Weakest 2012 Earnings Growth In Q3  13 ,opinion,Q3  12  earnings growth for the S P 500 was just 0 1   the lowest year over year growth for the S P 500 since the 2nd quarter of 2009  In my opinion  Q3  12 really marked the end of the huge productivity boom off the 2008   2009 recession  and was the transition quarter  as the S P 500 started to shift from productivity driven earnings growth to organic and revenue generated earnings growth  According to ThomsonReuters   This Week in Earnings  the forward 4 quarter estimate for the S P 500 slipped this past week to  115 96  from last week s  116 14  The P E ratio on the forward estimate is 14 7 x  as of the market close on Friday  August 2nd  The S P 500 earnings yield is 6 78   The year over year growth rate of the forward estimate has risen to 7 14   the highest growth rate in the last year  and about even with what Factset thinks is the  average  4 year growth rate of S P 500 earnings at 7   In fact  it was the first week of August in 2012  that saw the slowest year over year growth rate for the forward estimate at just 1 08  on August 3rd  2012  With 384 S P 500 companies having reported Q2  13 earnings  the y y growth rate has risen to 4 3   versus the 2 9  as of July 1  and revenue growth has ticked up to 2 1   So far there is nothing unusual about Q2  13 s earnings save for the gigantic contribution of the Financial sector   28 5  y y earnings growth when a still robust but far lower 17 5  was expected on July 1  Basic Materials as a sector is still getting crushed  Metals and Mining stocks are the worst subsector of the sector  Per FactSet  Metals and Mining earnings growth is down 59  year over year  One interesting technical item to note  despite horrid 2nd quarters by Alcoa  AA   Freeport  FCX   and US Steel  X   the stocks have NOT made new lows below their June  early July prints  At just 3  of the S P 500 by market cap  Basic Materials are not a big influence on the index  but I do like to watch these heavily pessimistic  very cheap valuations  for opportunity  How do Q3  13 and Q4  13 look from an earnings perspective    The expected Q3  13 earnings growth rate has fallen 2 5  from July 1 to 6 0  y y growth from 8 5   Part of that sharp drop is Telecom  which is down from an expected 17 3  to 9 1   ThomsonReuters told me that Sprint  S  has been removed from the S P 500  At the rate analyst s are cutting estimates  Q3  13 should come in at  1    2  expected growth by early October  which is how the last 4 quarters have tracked  The expected Q4  13 earnings growth has fallen 13  on July 1 to 11 6   Again  Telecom is down from an expected earnings growth rate in Q4  13 of 47 8  to 20 8   Financial sector estimates continue to be a Rock of Gibraltar for both quarters  with slightly upward revisions  Basic Materials  Telecom and Utilities stocks each represent about 3  of the S P 500  by market cap  Owning Financial s  18  of S P 500 by market cap   Technology  18  of S P 500   and Industrial s  10  of S P 500  gets you about 46  exposure to the S P 500  Healthcare was the best performing sector in both July  13 and year to date  with the sector being 7 09  and 27 90  per Bespoke s data  Interesting that Pfizer  PFE   Merck  MRK  and Amgen  AMGN  haven t made new highs in a while  AMGN hit its  115 high in the 3rd week of April  MRK hit  50 in early June  and PFE s  31 high was all the way back in the 3rd week of April  Only Johnson   Johnson  JNJ  keeps chugging along  JNJ s chart looks a lot like Home Depot s  HD  did in 2012  JNJ is up 36  year to date as of Friday  which is just capital gain  Healthcare is 13  of the S P 500 and we are probably underweight the sector  with closer to a 10  weight in client accounts  The fact is  long term average earnings growth is just now returning to  average  and is actually a little below average currently  S P 500 earnings growth SHOULD continue to improve  Municipal closed end funds  we will be out with charts on Sunday and Monday  with technical commentary on a few positions from Gary Morrow  but we ve added the Nuveen Municipal Value  NUV  closed end fund to client accounts in the last week  as well as the Blackrock Muni Enhanced  MEN  closed end fund to get both yield and technical support for clients taxable bond portfolios  We will save the fundamental write up for the blog specific post  but we are finding a whole lot of muni closed end funds at weekly oversold readings on our charts  What I do worry about is meaningful tax reform  which reduces or eliminates the favored tax exemption of municipal bonds for individual investors  given Congress  and the President s penchant for screwing the wealthy investor AND trying to boost tax revenue  BUT the catch is that current muni yields on some of these funds  rival the current investment grade bond yield  which if you ve followed muni s for a while  means muni yields are trading at 100  of investment grade corporates  which is truly cheap  If we used taxable equivalent yields on the muni CEF s  the muni market is approaching yields closer to taxable high yield or 7  8   even as high as 10   These tax exempt yields discount a lot of potential trouble with an 8  to 10  taxable equivalent yield  Some of these closed end funds could start to see  cross over buying   which means that they could get bought in IRA and tax deferred accounts simply for absolute yield purposes  I know I ve thought about it for some large IRA and Foundation accounts we manage  which are tax advantaged already  Selling mutual bond and fixed income funds  part of the above interest in closed end funds is that we are in the process of selling all of our taxable and municipal bond funds and moving more towards individual bonds  closed end fund s and ETF s  Part of the strategy or methodology is that with the undefined maturity  mutual funds could very likely struggle with redemptions in the next few years  and we are looking more to trade for shorter time period  s and to generate  absolute return  within client fixed income and balanced accounts to minimize loss  and maximize total return  I think the bond markets of the next few years will be very different from the 2010   2013 market  where you simply bought mutual funds of various duration and credit spectrums and then sat on them for a while  We sold some more Friday  August 2nd  as we tried to catch a Treasury rally  Treasuries saw a little rally on Friday on the weaker jobs report  I thought Rick Santelli  the CME CNBC reported that covers Treasuries  currencies and such from Chicago  made a very astute point  The June payroll report in realy July  which was stronger than expcected  saw 10 year Treasury yields spike 24 bp s  or 3 4ths of a point  The rally Friday  August 2nd on the weaker July jobs report was just a 1 2 point  Per Rick  the Treasury risk reward remains skewed toward higher rates  It is only a matter of time before technical levels get trashed in my opinion  We are still long a little iShares Barclays 7 10 Year Treasury ETF  IEF  and iShares Barclays 20  Year Treasury Bond ETF  TLT  for an off season trade in August  We could end up selling at a loss  too  Facebook  FB  was our best July  13 performer  So glad we stayed with the stock  afterit on the blog a few times  Stock was up 48  in July  13 and jumped to our  2 position on appreciation alone  My budy  Ryan Detrick out of Schaeffer s in Cincinnati   how the Russell 2000  RUT  needs to take out 1 060  Key level   Closed Friday at 1059 86  We are keeping it short and sweet this week  The S P 500 remains overbought and August is typically a weak period for stock returns  but we could have seen our correction in June  We are still overweight Financials in client equity accounts   3 of top 5 positions  which has been the case for a while   with Consumer Discretionary and Retail in the Top 10 too  The inverse Treasury is a large position in balanced  and fixed income accounts  We are long Japan ETF s and like the Treasury ETF s IEF and TLT for a counter trade in what could be a blah and slow August  13  We have a found a couple of oversold stocks due for a trading bounce  so check back on the blog Monday or Tuesday ,2013-08-04,Brian

199361,420877,JNJ,Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities,opinion,This report is one of a series on the adjustments we make to convert GAAP data to economic earnings  Reported earnings don t tell the whole story of a company s profits  They are based on  rules designed for debt investors  not equity investors  and are manipulated by companies to manage earnings  Only economic earnings provide a complete and unadulterated measure of profitability  Converting GAAP data into economic earnings should be part of every investor s diligence process  Performing detailed analysis of footnotes and the MD A is part of fulfilling fiduciary responsibilities  We ve performed unrivalled due diligence on 5 500 10 Ks every year for the past decade  Deferred tax assets  DTAs  arise when reported income on a financial statement is less than taxable income  DTAs are  in a sense  like pre paid taxes and represent expected reductions of future reported taxes  Deferred tax liabilities  DTLs   on the other hand  arise when reported income is greater than taxable income  DTLs represent the expected amount of additional reported taxes to be paid  These items are a result of differences between GAAP accrual accounting and tax policy  Examples of DTAs include  product warranty reserves  tax loss carry forwards  and future pension and postretirement benefit payments  Examples of DTLs include  accelerated depreciation payments and nondeductible intangibles  DTAs artificially raise reported assets and do not help generate operating profit while DTLs are like a source of interest free financing  We remove the impact of DTAs and DTLs from our calculation of invested capital to ensure the more accurate measure of a firm s return on invested capital  ROIC   We subtract all DTAs from invested capital  We include all DTLs in invested capital  When we calculate a firm s implied value in our DCF model  we subtract any net DTLs  DTLs minus DTAs  as they are real cash obligations on future cash flows  DTAs and DTLs are disclosed in two ways  They are either explicitly presented as DTAs and DTLs or hidden in other line items on the balance sheet  in which case investors have to dig through the footnotes to find them  Johnson   Johnson  JNJ  had over  7 6 billion in deferred tax assets adjusted out of invested capital for 2012  This deferred tax asset is mostly due to future employee benefit obligations that have been recorded but not paid  and that have not yet been taxed  Without this adjustment  JNJ s invested capital would have been over  108 billion  but taking this adjustment into account brings JNJ s invested capital down to  100 billion  Figure 1 shows the five companies with the largest gross value of deferred tax assets and liabilities adjusted out of invested capital for 2012 Figure 1  Companies Most Affected By Deferred Tax Assets and LiabilitiesSources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings However  these companies are far from the only ones affected by deferred tax assets and liabilities  In the last fiscal year  DTA and DTL adjustments occurred 3075 times for 1980 different companies  Our database contains over 28460 DTA and DTL adjustments for a total adjustment value of  2 6 trillion out of invested capital and  4 9 billion back into invested capital  Though the removal of DTAs DTLs can lower raise invested capital and boost depress ROIC  this does not always mean the company s stock will earn a favorable rating  For instance  Ford  F  still has only a 3 star or Neutral rating despite its  15 billion in adjustments out of invested capital  Likewise  PartnerRe  PRE  still earns a 5 star Very Attractive rating despite having  300 million adjusted back into invested capital  In other cases  however  DTAs DTLs can artificially depress boost invested capital and make a stock look over undervalued  Case in point  General Motors  GM  had a total of  37 billion in deferred tax liabilities in 2012  or 25  of its total assets  This huge sum was primarily due to operating loss and tax credit carry forwards from the years of losses GM racked up before its bankruptcy  Now that GM expects to make money again  it is expecting to realize these losses as tax benefits on its new income  GM s net DTAs were disclosed on its balance sheet  but investors would need to go to   deep in the financial footnotes  to uncover the value and details of the company s short and long term DTLs  On GM s balance sheet  these hidden DTLs are simply lumped in with  other liabilities   Including GM s net DTAs in its invested capital would have raised the company s average invested capital from  69 billion to over  106 billion  However  removing the value of these assets gives a truer representation of the capital GM currently has on hand to generate a profit  Without the adjustments  GM s ROIC would be under 4   but adding back the amount of the DTAs gives GM an ROIC of 6   While this boost in ROIC elevates GM above the bottom quintile of all companies I cover  GM s high share price of   36 makes the stock too risky to receive above a 2 star Dangerous rating  Still  this example shows how due diligence can make a substantial difference when calculating a firm s invested capital  Andr  Rouillard contributed to this report Disclosure  David Trainer and Andr  Rouillard receive no compensation to write

199362,420878,JNJ,Economic Data Support Taking Some Profits Off the Table,opinion,A stock market strategist who I trust and respect is advocating that investors take some money off the table and book profits from U S  equities  His view is that  with declining earnings expectations for the bottom half of the year combined with mostly zero top line growth  the likelihood of reduced monetary stimulus and lackluster global growth do not warrant a rising stock market  The market s expectation for an improving U S  economy is already priced into share prices  But while this market strategist makes a very good case for taking profits in U S  blue chips  there still isn t anywhere else for most investors to go other than the stock market  This gentleman thinks that a rising cash position is warranted and that the cash can then be put to work in the next correction and or recession  Cash in the bank is always a good thing  but there is an  opportunity cost  to not being in the stock market s best positions  From my own perspective  I find it difficult taking profits in blue chips like Johnson   Johnson  JNJ  with a current price to earnings ratio of around 20 and a 2 9  dividend yield  With an earnings plus dividend growth rate of approximately 10  over the next 12 months  JNJ to me is a big  Hold   And there are many other blue chips that I wouldn t sell either  even though they have done extremely well on the stock market recently Realistically  I come back to the old adage that it usually doesn t pay to fight the Fed  With a change in monetary policy somewhat likely this September  the Fed s actions will be the catalyst for correction  even though the stock market s been due for a correction for months now The perception of certainty is a Wall Street staple  and that s what the central bank has provided to date  Monetary policy  at least in the near term trading action  always overrides the marketplace s real financial metrics  Second quarter earnings and revenue growth among blue chips was mediocre  at best There has been  however  a continued resiliency in the stock market this entire year  and the market s strength  even in the face of weak news  is difficult to trade against I m certainly an advocate for creating lists of good companies that would be worth accumulating when they are down  Given the current information  however  I wouldn t be selling the market s best performing blue chips in anticipation of the future With investor sentiment interwoven with the next Fed meeting in a little over a month  I expect stocks to basically move sideways  save for a shock  The argument for lightening up on U S  equities makes total sense with declining earnings expectations  yet the one thing that the market strategist I mentioned above is not quantifying is investor sentiment itself This is still a market that wants to bid stocks  regardless of a mediocre outlook  There is also some asset rotation taking place  as some investors move out of bonds  The resiliency continues Disclaimer  There is no magic formula to getting rich  Success in investment vehicles with the best prospects for price appreciation can only be achieved through proper and rigorous research and analysis  The opinions in this e newsletter are just that  opinions of the authors  Information contained herein  while believed to be correct  is not guaranteed as accurate  Warning  Investing often involves high risks and you can lose a lot of money  Please do not invest with money you cannot afford to lose ,2013-08-14,Mitchell Clark,https://www.investing.com/analysis/economic-data-support-taking-some-profits-off-the-table-179568,179568

199364,420880,JNJ,Will A Return To Normalized Interest Rates Halt Economic Growth ,opinion,I really don t expect the stock market to come apart unless there s some sort of shock  Why  Because many blue chips are trading right around their historical valuations at this time  And with equities in consolidation mode until the next meeting of the Federal Reserve in September  there is not a lot of new action to take  I have to admit that the stock market is holding up extremely well in the face of declining earnings expectations  Given the anemic rate of growth in the U S  economy  the next recession is a real possibility within the next 18 months  The catalyst for a technical recession could be rising interest rates that  as we know  have been artificially low for a long time now  But there are other pressures in the marketplace  too  The spot price of oil is surprisingly strong  given the economic outlook  Some precious metals have also been ticking higher recently  But while there is price inflation in the general economy  it doesn t show in the headline numbers and it isn t translating into new spending by corporations   Many companies experienced revenue growth in the second quarter solely due to increased prices for their products  not increased volume   Corporations and individuals continue to be highly conservative with their spending  This is a positive development as corporate and individual balance sheets improve  but it doesn t help a consumption based economy  I continue to believe that this year s stock market winners will remain that way  Institutional investors want reliability in earnings results  and they want the dividends that blue chips provide  There is not a lot of reliable growth out there  so when a company like Johnson   Johnson  JNJ  generates eight percent top line growth in one quarter  the stock market loads up  You can tell by the most recent numbers that corporations have pretty much exhausted their abilities to grow their bottom lines on cost control alone  Meaningful revenue growth is a must if earnings are to grow at a rate greater than inflation going forward  So all in all  the stock market is a big hold  but there are clouds on the horizon  Dividend income remains a top priority as far as I m concerned  it s probably the greatest certainty that a stock market investor has in the current environment  Interest rates are too low and the marketplace is chomping at the bit to see the entire yield curve move upward  And while it s correct to have the Federal Reserve out of the bond market  a return to a more normal interest rate environment may turn out to be the catalyst for even slower growth The cycle will play itself out  and there s no reason to be in a rush to consider new positions in this stock market  I wouldn t be adding to existing blue chips  rather  I d be keeping any new monies in cash for the time being  I really don t expect anything significant from the stock market until the next Fed meeting Disclaimer  There is no magic formula to getting rich  Success in investment vehicles with the best prospects for price appreciation can only be achieved through proper and rigorous research and analysis  The opinions in this e newsletter are just that  opinions of the authors  Information contained herein  while believed to be correct  is not guaranteed as accurate  Warning  Investing often involves high risks and you can lose a lot of money  Please do not invest with money you cannot afford to lose ,2013-08-22,Mitchell Clark,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-a-return-to-normalized-interest-rates-halt-economic-growth-180624,180624
199388,420904,JNJ,Whic Is The Larger Bubble  The S P 500 Index Or U S  Treasuries ,opinion,Over the past week  we ve had a plethora of companies reporting earnings and are moving through the 1st Quarter earnings season at a rapid pace  Thus far  earnings have been far from exciting and have made the previous 2013 forward earnings estimates laughable The only way we get to the proposed valuations is through multiple expansion which is simply going to require the Federal Reserve to continue to pump  85 billion into Treasury s and MBS securities each month  I am confident they will comply There are a few analysts out there who are discussing the potential bubble forming in equities and other risk assets as Bernanke s plan is working to the extent that asset prices are rising  However  even fewer analysts are pointing out that both retail and institutional money is constantly chasing yield at this point Simply take a look at the 2013 price action in high yield dividend paying stocks  high yield bonds  preferred stocks  and master limited partnerships  It is safe to say that a bubble has formed not just in equities  but in various fixed investments as well  Consider the following chart of the S P 500 Index  SPX  shown as the dotted trendline and Johnson   Johnson  JNJ  shown as the solid black line Obviously from looking at the chart above  JNJ has outperformed the S P 500 Index year to date  Has JNJ suddenly become a growth giant  Is it all about earnings growth and or forward earnings potential or anticipated growth  Or is the rally in JNJ really about the fact that Johnson   Johnson has a long history of paying strong  rising dividends  I am sure there are plenty of sell side analysts who will tell you that JNJ is going to  100   share in the future for a variety of macro or quantitative reasons  The sell side analysts will tell you the economy is strengthening or that large cap multinational companies are seeing strengthening fundamentals and earnings growth  They are called the sell side for a reason  they want to sell you stock  Furthermore  my favorite recent discussion is about future earnings projections and the new strength that we are going to see in earnings  The following chart was posted at  and originally came from Standard   Poors  The chart below illustrates the trailing 12 month operating earnings per share of S P 500 companies  Based on the above data  how is the stock market fundamentally sound when earnings are collapsing  I guess the Federal Reserve is going to print profits for the S P 500 companies  Actually earnings are irrelevant when central banks all over the world including the Federal Reserve are juicing the markets with a sea of liquidity and where multiple expansion trumps real earnings or value Furthermore  these same central banks are openly purchasing equities and allocating sizable portions of their balance sheets to stocks  Several central banks around the world have more than 10  of their reserves allocated to stocks at this point in time  The world is long risk and money is still flowing into bonds at the same time  Simply look at the recent price action in Treasury s for the past few weeks or note the strength in municipal bonds in aggregate since mid March This brings me to my final point  For the past several years  bonds and stocks in the United States have rallied together  U S  Treasuries and domestic equities have been trending higher for more than three years as shown below  The S P 500 is shown as the dotted line and the 30 Year Treasury Bond Price Index is the black solid line It is without question that both the S P 500 Index and the 30 Year Treasury Bond have been trending higher for the past 3 years overall  Both underlying assets have produced strong gains during the same period of time  Now this brings me to my final question for readers to ponder  If both the S P 500 Index and the 30 Year Treasury Bond can rally together  what happens if they sell off together The answer to that question is the real problem  Many sell side analysts and economists ignore the bubble that the Federal Reserve has created in equity valuations  The bubble continues to be fueled by the monstrous liquidity injections that they have conducted beginning with the original quantitative easing  However  what is even less acknowledged by the sell side is the massive artificial bullish valuations that have been created in the bond market Long dated Treasuries are being purchased by the Federal Reserve to artificially hold down interest rates  This ongoing practice is causing a separate bubble to form in fixed income investments  So now we have a bubble in equities and long dated treasuries forming and the sell side continues to trumpet that higher prices are likely  Ultimately the sell side may be right in short to intermediate time frame  but the end game has a finality that few want to consider When these bubbles finally pop as all excessively valued assets do  the result is going to devastate financial markets  It may be in 6 months or it may be in 10 years  but history will not be thwarted  The central banks can try to outsmart history  but they will ultimately fail Disclaimer  This material should not be considered investment advice  J W  Jones is not a registered investment advisor  Under no circumstances should

199389,420905,JNJ,Tired Bull Market,opinion,Not much seems able to restrain the strength of the bull market in U S  equities  On a year to date basis the S P 500 Index is up 15 43   The advance has finally drawn investors into equity mutual funds as reflected in positive equity mutual fund flows the first three months of the year The positive market results continue to keep the S P 500 Index in a positive uptrend channel that began in the middle of November of last year  Aside from the fact that company fundamentals and valuations look reasonable  or at least not overvalued  higher equity prices could continue to unfold  However  we have noted in several recent posts the rotation that has occurred of late out of the more defensive sectors into the more cyclical ones Because of the significant amount of artificial stimulus being pumped into the global economy by most central banks around the world  we believe investors need to have a heightened focus on the underlying technical aspects of the market in order to gain insight into potential market turning points  No one technical indicator is the panacea that will predict the market s future direction  One indicator useful to evaluate for the market and or individual stocks is the   This index is a variation of the Relative Strength Index  RSI   The  website provides the following definition of MFI   The Money Flow Index  MFI  is an oscillator that uses both price and volume to measure buying and selling pressure  Created by Gene Quong and Avrum Soudack  MFI is also known as volume weighted RSI  MFI starts with the typical price for each period  Money flow is positive when the typical price rises  buying pressure  and negative when the typical price declines  selling pressure   A ratio of positive and negative money flow is then plugged into an RSI formula to create an oscillator that moves between zero and one hundred  As a momentum oscillator tied to volume  the Money Flow Index  MFI  is best suited to identify reversals and price extremes with a variety of signals   The Money Flow Index is a rather unique indicator that combines momentum and volume with an RSI formula  RSI momentum generally favors the bulls when the indicator is above 50 and the bears when below 50  Even though MFI is considered a volume weighted RSI  using the centerline to determine a bullish or bearish bias does not work as well  Instead  MFI is better suited to identify potential reversals with overbought oversold levels  bullish bearish divergences and bullish bearish failure swings  emphasis added   As with all indicators  MFI should not be used by itself  A pure momentum oscillator  such as RSI  or pattern analysis can be combined with MFI to increase signal robustness   As the below charts display  the weekly chart of the market and the MFI are showing divergence  A weekly time period is used in order to smooth out the potential day to day market variations  On the daily chart  the MFI trend is positive  however  the index recently rose above the overbought area of 80 on the chart  Also  market volume has been in a steady decline since late 2011 and has not picked up in spite of positive equity fund flows as noted in the first chart in this post  As with any indicator  no single one is the perfect market predictor  As an example  the  and is based on the money flow concept as well  As the   this indicator has given off false signals as well  At HORAN  we do remain positive on the market  but believe some consolidation could occur and would be healthy for the performance potential through the balance of the year  Our focus has been to reduce or sell some of the holdings in the defensive sectors and build or add to positions in the more cyclically exposed sectors that have underperformed this year  and over the last year for that matter  One stock we trimmed recently was Johnson   Johnson  JNJ   We trimmed the holding for more than technical reasons  but   it does show some potential stock weakness ahead when looking at just the MFI ,2013-05-13,Blog of HORAN Capital Advisors,https://www.investing.com/analysis/tired-bull-market-166603,166603

199397,420913,JNJ,A Pill For Every Ill  Big Pharma SWOT Analysis ,opinion,Every industry has its ups and downs  and many have been riding on the crest of the success wave for so many years that they ve all but forgotten what it means to take stock of the situation and regroup their efforts to address the future  The housing industry was forced to go through that phase over the last few years  Will it be pharmaceuticals that face the next big crisis  Is there a crisis in the first place  or is it exaggerated  And more importantly  what are the opportunities for big pharma to recoup the billions of dollars lost over the patent cliff  Exploring the Strengths  Weaknesses  Opportunities and Threats  SWOT  of a particular situation has always helped put things in perspective  The ship may still be afloat but it s taking on water at a tremendous rate  hopefully  we can derive a clear picture of major pharma companies struggling to keep their bodies out of the water StrengthsMarket Dominance   Market dominance is probably their key global advantage  Big pharma has so many millions of doctors all over the world eating out of their hands that they won t think twice about crushing the competition any way they can  This isn t a colorful description of their dominant position   it s merely calling it a spade  Why have so many flagship drugs been doing so well the past few years  Could it be that the  incentive  programs offered to doctors to prescribe one brand over another competitor has something to do with it  While it wouldn t be proper to make accusations  everyone is free to have an opinion  But unlike opinions  doctors don t help pharma companies achieve their targets for free  There s the first spade Eradicate  They drive the medical profession in whatever direction they want  Treatment is more profitable than curing  so that s the direction they ve always taken doctors in  Insider after insider will tell you that this is true  Most doctors know this  but because it s profitable for them too  the majority won t squeal on big pharma  Theoretically  there should be fewer diseases today than there were 200 years ago because disease can t possibly proliferate faster than the speed of research  Or can it  Consider this statistic  There have been eight attempts at eradicating diseases in the last 200 or so years  Only one has been successful   Smallpox   in terms of human diseases  Why  Could it be because pharma hasn t driven their research in that direction  Of course  there is government intervention required to implement eradication programs  but where are the drugs for it  But credit is due where credit is due   there are zero cases of polio in the U S   Europe and China  Merck and GlaxoSmithKline have done their part in donating medicines  ivermectin and albendazole  respectively  for treating lymphatic filariasis  Pfizer  Eli Lilly and Johnson and Johnson have all spent millions pursuing treatments for Alzheimer s   until investor pressure made them back down  There s your second spade Its Money Honey   Their third strength lies in their monetary power  The amount of money they have for research  acquisitions and everything else has come from their first strength of dominance  With that money  they rule the pharma roost  They may not be able to control drug legislation or regulation  but they can certainly decide what they send for approval   and that decision is primarily made to improve their bottom line  this strength is not derived from their altruistic motives to cure the world of disease  but to profit from it   and handsomely  At the end of the day  money is what matters to a company  and this is something they have managed to accrue brilliantly  This is the reason there are fewer new drugs coming out of their labs   variations on existing  approved  ones are much cheaper to produce and put on the market  as are same drugs profiled for new indications  called drug repositioning  With the use of monetary muscle  they are also able to fill gaps in their drug portfolios by acquiring smaller companies  this is something that smaller companies are also looking at now as an investment avenue The Brand   The fourth pillar of the major players in this industry is their reputation  While this may be an intangible quality  for a drug company it s a matter of patient confidence in the efficacy of their medicines  This is something that has withstood erosion for the most part despite controversy with drug trials and product roll backs  But reputation isn t as intangible as most people think  A 2012 study by APCO Worldwide showed that a single percentage point increase in an average company s reputation could account for a 3 33  growth in sales  Naturally  for a large pharma brand that might be considerably less  but it still equates to millions of dollars  if not billions  Though big pharma s reputation has come under the scanner many times over the last few decades  there has never been any doubt as to the efficacy of the drugs they put out regularly  Their practices may be subject to criticism  but their financial performance is a direct measure of the success of their products WeaknessesThis is where we explore the nerve points of big pharma  the areas where they need more focus  essentially  the things they haven t accomplished with their strengths  or the conditions that have come about despite them Complacency  The first weak point of any big corporation is complacency  While this is not by far a universal phenomenon  the trend in the drug industry that has led to weakened drug pipelines in recent years shows that many top pharma companies have been riding the crest of waves generated by their top selling patented formulations  Pfizer s Lipitor may have made headlines  but several other drugs have and will come under the patent axe in the years between 2010 and 2015  The fact remains that these patent losses have left them in compromising positions  specifically but not limited to the issue of neuroscience research in European markets  Despite their monetary clout and resource rich culture  they have not been able to address this adequately  However  as we will see later in this piece  this opens up several opportunities for filling the revenue gaps left by the patent cliff You Really Know the FDA  The second weak point is their lack of control over regulatory approvals  especially in the United States  It takes about 15 years and  1 1 7 billion  2002 data  to conduct research  test and then submit a New Molecular Entity  NME  for approval as a branded drug  even at that stage  only 3 out of 10 drugs ever make it to the market and cover their cost of development and marketing  With stats like this  it is no wonder that the pipelines are running on fumes  The high risk undertaking of drug development is one of the main reasons that new and revolutionary drugs are few and far between  There are currently 1002 prescription drugs that have FDA approval  Pfizer has 30 FDA approved drugs  Merck has 24  Abbot Labs  17  AstraZeneca  19  Many of them have approved drugs that were developed in collaboration with each other or other third party pharma companies  But the weakness lies in the fact that phase 3 clinical trials have much fewer drugs than before  as far as big pharma is concerned  Here is where another opportunity will present itself down the road   acquisition of smaller companies such as Spectrum Pharmaceuticals  SPPI   which has two successful cancer drugs on the market  Zevalin and Fusilev  and 10 in the pipeline  The poor performance of drugs in phases 2 and 3 have also contributed to considerable losses  Briston Myers Squibb reported a pretax impairment charge of  1 8 billion on BMS 986094  a Hepatitis C drug  Eli Lilly announced the halt of phase 3 trials for mGlu2 3  a schizophrenia drug  and solanezumab for Alzheimer s  Such losses weigh heavily on their bottom line  leading to a reticence on the part of big pharma to undertake R D on innovative drugs Niche or Diverse  The third weakness stems from too much diversity  Big pharma s firepower  as defined by Ernst   Young in its recent report  has been used to diversify extensively in previous years  and big pharma is now in a state of dilution that is affecting its core operations  Luckily  most of them have realized this and have started divesting their interests in these other entities   not only to create cash but to make sure that their focus goes back to their R D capabilities  Pfizer has already made two major divestitures  and is considering two more   infant nutrition and animal health  However  this is still a weak point with many companies who  like Pfizer  are now looking for buyers for various non core units Ratings by Companies that didn t have a clue about the great financial crisis  The fourth weak point is the threat from ratings companies like Moody  AstraZeneca and other European pharma companies are already facing possible credit downgrades for their massive share buyback exercises  and Moody pegged the repurchase over cash flow excess for the Anglo Swedish company at  2 billion for 2012  A credit rating downgrade would impact their  cost of capital   making it harder for them to boost investor confidence despite promises of future profits

199410,420926,JNJ,Ampio Stays Calm Ahead Of Further Developments,opinion,The last year has been very volatile for the diversified drug developer  Ampio Pharmaceuticals  AMPE   AMPE was trading as low as  2 54 in May 2012 due to extreme weakness in the broader market brought about by macroeconomic concerns  Soon after  specifically in early July 2012   the stock was trading as high as  6 25 after an overly optimistic article about the company was published on the financial site Seeking Alpha While that rally was brought down by a public stock offering  what can infer from that price action is that the market doesn t really have a well defined opinion on Ampio s prospects  At least for now  AMPE has found a comfortable medium just above  4 00 per share as investors await further developments Currently  Ampio has four pharmaceutical products in development for various indications and three diagnostic products on the side  Their furthest developed product is Zertane  which is an oral tablet that is designed to prevent premature ejaculation  PE   Surveys indicated that this is the most common sexual dysfunction in men  occurring in about 1 3 of the global male population  While there is no question that the PE market is enormous and lucrative  Zertane has some major hurdles One of the biggest issues for Zertane is its path to US approval  The phase III studies done in Europe will not be valid for an NDA  so two additional phase III trials will have to be performed  as described in the June 20  2012 meeting with the FDA   After all that work  Ampio will also have to compete with the current leading in PE in the United States   Priligy  dapoxetine   which is commercialized by Johnson   Johnson  JNJ   On the bright side  Zertane is a 505 b  2  submission which allows the drug to use clinical data from other formulations of tramadol  its active ingredient  for its approval process  This would make Zertane s approval very rapid given the right conditions Investors should also note that Zertane will have better luck with approval abroad  The company is hoping to have the drug approved in Australia this year  based on trials conducted there  It should also be a smoother process to reach the European market  as well as other nations  Sexual health drugs have generally been disastrous investments in the past  Biosante Pharmaceuticals  BPAX  comes to mind  as does the infamous  female Viagra  developed by Boehringer Ingelheim  Still  Ampio does have two other products also being submitted under 505 b  2  which could result in surprisingly rapid approval Optina is an interesting drug being developed for diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular edema  which targets a common side effect of diabetes  Diabetes  as you may know  has enormous prevalence in the United States  recent estimates come in at 25 8 million Americans   The size of the market for diabetes treatment is estimated to be close to  92 billion  so Optina s potential is certainly there since there are no good daily medications for diabetic retinopathy at this point  Vasaloc is another 505 b  2  drug that will target diabetic nephropathy  another problem induced by diabetes The one treatment that is being developed as a new molecule rather than a reformulation of sorts is Ampion   a non steroidal treatment for diseases that induce inflammation  Arthritis is one example that would be could be highly profitable for the company Note that while Ampion is produced by humans naturally the company was able to obtain commercial rights due to the molecule s discovery and patent protection by Ampio s Chief Scientific Officer Dr  David Bar Or Since Ampio s pipeline contains compounds that have already been extensively tested for safety in the past  barring Ampion  which is produced in the body naturally anyway   the focus should be on the efficacy demonstrated in future clinical trials as measured by endpoints  Expectations regarding future clinical trials and a degree of optimism over Zertane s eventual launch should keep the stock stable for the time being  I d imagine that those who are long the stock are in it  or should be in it  for the long run ,2013-01-09,Myriad Equity,https://www.investing.com/analysis/ampio-stays-calm-ahead-of-further-developments-150160,150160
199420,420936,JNJ,Think Corporates Are A Safe Haven  Think Again,opinion,Yields on some corporate bonds are trading below their U S  Treasury counterparts suggesting dwindling credit risk in the bond market according to the Wall Street Journal  In the article     the authors wrote that it is a sign that  investors perceive them as a safer bet   Furthermore  they wrote that some market observers think that this could be the  beginning of a new era for debt markets  which means that companies will have lower rates than their home country  In all of my years as an institutional fixed income portfolio manager  nothing surprises me  What we are seeing is not a signal of a  new era  for the corporate bond market but a case of too many people chasing too few assets  Companies rated  AAA  like Johnson   Johnson  JNJ  and Exxon Mobil  XOM  are without a doubt  safe companies  From what I can see  they are worthy of their ratings or at the very least  show a low probability of default  That probability drops even further when you account for the maturity of the bonds  To borrow part of a phrase made popular by our friends at   if given a long enough time frame  a company s survival rate drops to zero and the default probability increases  Shrink that time frame by way of the bond s maturity  and the default probability falls with it  As we all know  this should lead to a drop in the yield or more precisely the credit spread or yield differential between the two short maturity bonds  Having said this  it is not surprising that yields on these highly rated companies converge with their U S  Treasury counterparts on this part of the yield curve  If I had to quantify it  I would say that their default probability given their rating is just a tad above zero  For most people and in the grand scheme of things  it is pretty close to nil which partly explains the low level of yields  But to infer that a company is  safer  over a sovereign is just plain wrong  When it comes down to it  default risk is determined by the borrower s ability to pay off that debt  A corporation s ability is determined by revenues and profits which is completely contingent on demand from its client base  If a client likes a company s product  they will buy more which means increasing revenue and cash flow where they can service their debt with ease  Hence  a company s solvency and likelihood of default is at the mercy of its client base s wills and desires for their product  In other words  they are price takers in determining their likelihood of default  For the U S  government  their ability to pay off that debt is determined by their ability to tax  While higher taxes may upset some people  their ability to do so is ultimately up to the government  This includes taxing individuals and corporations like Johnson   Johnson and Exxon  Furthermore  the U S  Government is not a country like Greece that is facing a debt problem since the U S  controls its own currency  This suggests that for the U S   the  printing press  is a means to service its debt  So  if you rule out a complete collapse of the country s way of life  the conditions for a true default are completely left to the U S  Government  In this context  they are price makers  Does that mean that the U S  cannot have a technical default where the timely repayment of principal and interest on their debt is compromised  The answer is no  Does that mean that if there is a technical default on the U S   is debt on U S  corporations a better bet  The answer to this is an even bigger NO  If there is a technical default  the markets would see equities tank  and that would lead to wider corporate spreads  Of course spreads would widen more than others depending on the credit quality  In any case  most corporate bond would be negatively affected by rising risks and volatility spurred by a U S  Treasury default  In the case of these short dated corporates trading on top of Treasuries  it is difficult to determine exactly what is driving this  Let s face it  The markets are driven by people who in turn  are motivated by a variety of factors  To be able to accurately determine the cause of the convergence of these corporate bonds with Treasuries is to intimately know the objectives of bond investors that focus in this space  A great example of the variety of factors is that you can have bond managers who both believe that yields will head higher but position their portfolio differently  A total return manager of a hedge fund or ETF will sell their holdings and go to cash  Here they are maximizing return and taking on risk  Another manager who manages both equities and bonds may do the opposite and buy bonds after the initial selloff since their current positions fell in market value  This discipline in rebalancing to maintain a fixed allocation to bonds takes precedence over a portfolio manager s view on higher interest rates  The process over price gain determines their actions  A portfolio manager of an insurance company may not even flinch despite their bearish outlook simply because their liabilities dictate their portfolio positioning  Here  risk control over price gain dictates their actions  That said  my guess is that money market bond investors who are flush with cash are driving up the price of these corporates simply because they have nowhere else to go  As we mentioned before in our post  The Federal Reserve Does Not Care If Treasury Rates are Higher   the Federal Reserve s latest Quantitative Easing program is a huge driver of demand  The Fed s purchases of Mortgage Backed Securities  after all is said and done  will undoubtedly overwhelm the amount of new issuance for most taxable bonds which may result in a net supply of zero or perhaps even negative  A money market bond investor who needs to buy but is having a hard time finding bonds will pay up so he can stay fully invested  In addition  the European Debt Crisis and the potential of contagion to the financial sector may drive away money market players from investing in European banks  commercial paper programs  This may lead investors to seek their returns elsewhere and drive up the price in limited supply securities like the aforementioned short dated corporate bonds  Whatever the case may be  what we are seeing should look familiar since long time bond investors will know that we have traveled down this path before where the incremental yield between safer and riskier bonds compresses  Prior to the Long Term Capital Market debacle back in the late 1990s  an investor could own Merrill Lynch 5 Year bonds with a  AA  rating at 60 basis points over Treasuries while pick up an additional  miniscule 5 basis points to go to the bottom end of the investment grade scale by buying Lehman Brothers 5 Year bonds  Back in 2006  bond investors could buy so called  AAA  subprime bonds for 25 to 30 basis points over LIBOR  Credit spreads were tight simply because investors were desperate for return and needed bonds  Carry was king  and the objective of remaining fully invested over risk control determined their actions  As we all know from the financial crisis  the spread on these instruments did not stay at that level for very long  Common sense and experience tells me to not read into short dated corporates trading below U S  Treasuries  Corporate issuers are not safer than U S  Treasuries and the market is not about to embark on a  new era   Also  this isn t a sign that the default probability of U S  Treasuries is increasing because of the country s budget problems  In fact  I would look to a falling dollar if that is indeed the case  Furthermore  if I were an owner of said corporate bonds  I would sell JNJ and XOM bonds and buy U S  Treasuries  Yields may trade below Treasuries and this may continue going forward given the Fed s influence on demand  However  the upside should be limited while it is just a matter of time before corporate spreads widen  As illustrated by the two examples  it has happened before and will happen again and is far from anything new  The fact that history repeats itself in some form or another where corporate spreads widen is probably the safest of bet of them all Disclaimer  The above content is provided for educational and informational purposes only  does not constitute a

199437,420953,JNJ,Medivation Building Value On Prostate Cancer Prospects And Takeover Spec,opinion,Medivation  MDVN  is a single drug drug developer that has been on an absolute tear since it released extremely positive results for its prostate cancer drug Enzalutamide  formerly known as MDV3100  in November 2011  Since the data was released  Medivation is up over 430  and continues to make new highs with a very stable uptrend  For the most part  investors are more focused on estimating the market potential for Enzalutamide rather than the efficacy of its mechanism of action  which has been demonstrated quite well in the phase III AFFIRM trials   Competing drugs that have already hit the prostate cancer market are being watched closely to determine the actual revenue potential for Enzalutamide  Denderon s  DNDN  PROVENGE  an FDA approved drug that was poised to be a blockbuster  is generating roughly  82 million per quarter in sales  Johnson   Johnson s  JNJ  ZYTIGA is generating about  232 million per quarter in sales  Judging by the market cap of Medivation of about  3 5 billion  investors are really expecting Enzalutamide to not only dominate the prostate cancer drug market but penetrate the breast cancer drug market later on as well  which is something the company is working on with its phase I trial    Although Medivation has become a lot more expensive as more and more investors pile into this very promising play on the prostate cancer drug market  Enzalutamide MDV3100 could bring MDVN to a higher market cap based solely on takeover speculation which is attracting attention from the big players  Even if Enzalutamide s greatness in prostate cancer has been priced in at this point  the drug and company might be worth a lot more than the market cap suggests  Checking the   one can note that a potential catalyst for the stock is on the horizon  specifically on July 23rd  2012   This is the date that the FDA will respond to the NDA submitted for Enzalutamide  and either grant it a standard 10 month review or priority review of 6 months  which is what we are expecting   Expect Medivation to draw additional attention after a likely priority review by the FDA  leading up to the final decision which will most likely end up being on November 21st 2012  Traders who are interested in MDVN might try riding the sheer excitement over this drug and the takeover speculation  which has been supported by an extremely nice chart  Things are likely to pick up as summer ends and market activity picks up too ,2012-07-20,Myriad Equity,https://www.investing.com/analysis/medivation-building-value-on-prostate-cancer-prospects-and-takeover-spec-130252,130252
199438,420954,JNJ,Dendreon s Provenge Needs To Pull Itself Together Soon,opinion,Dendreon  DNDN   a big name in the prostate cancer world  is struggling to heavily market the drug PROVENGE   much to the dismay of its shareholders  DNDN was trading around  38 share a year ago  but have fallen more than 80  as a double whammy of underwhelming sales data and very narrow profit margins brought the company into negative EPS territory  For the most part  this is not something that is expected by the market after a company with a highly anticipated game changing drug gets an FDA approval  which happened in April 2010  The bulk of the  80  drop occurred on August 3rd 2011  when Dendreon unveiled second quarter results  It wasn t only the underwhelming revenue and weak earnings that upset the shareholders  but the company s guidance on PROVENGE   Included in the report is an explanation for the dynamics of the PROVENGE launch  with major blame being put on knowledge of the problems regarding the reimbursement program  Physicians would be required to keep enormous lines of credit  not surprising given the  93 000 cost of PROVENGE  per full patient treatment  This is a very annoying problem that has kept smaller oncology centers away from the drug To fight the problem  Dendreon has begun to issue Q codes that expedite the process immensely  Almost a year later  we are still seeing revenue growth  The bigger problem is that it s simply not enough to bring the company into profitability  and Dendreon s  seemingly  permanent drop in outlook is causing major negativity amongst the analysts Last quarter we saw PROVENGE  sales of approximately  82 million  Although this is set to grow into the future  the earnings generated from the drug are underwhelming  At a profit margin of approximately 27   PROVENGE is not nearly as profitable to distribute as we may have originally thought  It s true that the manufacturing process is extreme complex  and will require time to refine  in terms of cost reduction   but the bottom line is that improvements are necessary to the company s survive In a financially based analysis of Dendreon  I found that PROVENGE s quarterly sales would have to reach approximately  340 000 000  with a much higher 40  profit margin  just for Dendreon to break even in terms of revenue versus total expenses  This far exceeds the sales of Johnson   Johnson s  JNJ  Zytiga  which enjoys a far better marketing environment The takeaway is that Dendreon is in a very difficult situation as a company  Even if roughly  5 billion was blown off the market cap of DNDN since mid 2011  this is not so much a value play as it is a very long bet on an improvement in the drug s marketing prospects  We will see in future quarters whether or not PROVENGE can ever bring Dendreon into profitability though  so this is a company you might want to keep your eye on in the event that we see a miracle ,2012-07-25,Myriad Equity,https://www.investing.com/analysis/dendreon’s-provenge-needs-to-pull-itself-together-soon-130733,130733
