110542,332057,IONS,5 Reasons 2020 Will Be a Big Year for Ionis Pharmaceuticals,news,"Investing in biotech stocks can seem like a speculative gamble on binary outcomes  sort of like buying lottery tickets  Fortunately  there are some mid cap biotechs actually making a profit and that have development pipelines stocked with drug candidates that could produce big winners  giving patient investors the opportunity for gains while riding out the occasional disappointment 
One such stock is Ionis Pharmaceuticals  NASDAQ IONS   The company is pioneering an approach called RNA antisense  which can be used to block the production of disease causing proteins  It s taken the company years to perfect the technology and to solve the problem of getting the drug to the targeted tissues in sufficient concentration to be therapeutic without causing side effects  But now  the company is over that hurdle and is rapidly building a portfolio of drugs to treat a wide range of diseases 
The performance of Ionis  stock was underwhelming in 2019  mostly because investors were concerned about future sales of the company s first big drug success  But here are five reasons why 2020 could be different 

1  Portfolio growth and profitability
Growing revenue from Ionis  portfolio and its research and development alliances have allowed the company to beat expectations every quarter in 2019  This growth spurred the company to raise full year guidance for both the top and bottom lines when it reported third quarter results  The company guided to non GAAP earnings of more than  300 million on revenue of  1 billion for 2019 
Much of the company s money is coming from sales of blockbuster rare disease drug Spinraza  a partnership with Biogen  NASDAQ BIIB   Analysts are concerned about competition for the drug  but it s still going strong  with sales up over 25  year to date to  212 million 
Sales of Ionis  other two approved drugs  Waylivra and Tegsedi  are just starting to ramp up as well  generating  29 million in revenue in the first three quarters of 2019  The company also earns license fees and milestone payments from its many partnership agreements as it makes progress advancing its pipeline  a total of  377 million year to date  which is up 67  from the year before 
2  A growing network of alliances
Ionis has formed an impressive set of partnerships for the development and marketing of its drugs  In October  the company s subsidiary Akcea  NASDAQ AKCA  announced it inked a deal with Pfizer  NYSE PFE  to advance AKCEA ANGPTL3 LRx  a drug that has the potential to treat large populations of patients with type 2 diabetes  high levels of blood triglycerides  and non alcoholic fatty liver disease  NASH   That agreement earned Ionis a  125 million payment in the fourth quarter and makes it eligible for  1 3 billion in milestone payments  plus double digit royalties  Besides Biogen and Pfizer  Ionis also has deals with Novartis  NYSE NVS   GlaxoSmithKline  NYSE GSK   Roche  OTC RHHBY   AstraZeneca  NYSE AZN   and Bayer  OTC BAYRY  
To investors  these deals are confirmation of the significance of the company s RNA antisense technology  And to the company s business  there are some important benefits  Partnering with market leaders in various diseases means the company can see a rapid ramp up of sales without having to invest in a sales force 
The milestone payments give the company plenty of resources to invest in its pipeline and technology  as well as generating plenty of cash  Ionis has  2 2 billion of cash on its balance sheet and announced its first ever share buyback program last quarter  CEO Stanley Crooke said recently that the company will make some investments aimed at strengthening its antisense technology platform  in the coming months   hinting that an acquisition may be in the works 
3  More drugs moving to late stage trials
Ionis has five drugs in phase 3 trials  and any positive results from those could provide an impetus for the share price in 2020  But the company also has 19 drugs in phase 2 clinical trials  four in phase 1  and 18 in preclinical studies  News of success from these programs could trickle in all year long  Results from six phase 2 studies are expected in the next few months 
Many of the drug candidates in the pipeline are aimed at evolving the company beyond rare diseases to treatments for common disorders that affect millions of patients  Currently in phase 2 testing are drugs to treat Alzheimer s disease  Parkinson s disease  amyotrophic lateral sclerosis  ALS  or Lou Gehrig s disease   hypertension  prostate cancer  and hepatitis B 
4  Platform advances
While Ionis works to get drug candidates through the testing and approval process  it s also improving the technology platform itself  in ways that can be applied broadly across the pipeline 
The most important advancement in recent years is called ligand conjugated antisense  LICA   This breakthrough is a chemical change to its antisense molecules that makes them attracted to specific tissues in the body  increasing their potency by 30 times  which makes it more effective while diminishing side effects  Ionis currently has LICA technology that targets the liver and 16 pipeline drugs that use it  It s working on other LICA formulations to target other tissues  such as the pancreas  and any progress on that front will open up new drug possibilities and could give a boost to the stock this year 
Ionis scientists also think that  unlike most other biologic drugs  antisense drugs can be formulated for delivery using other routes besides injection  The company believes it s on the verge of developing an oral antisense medicine  which would be a significant breakthrough  It s also demonstrated the feasibility of aerosol delivery to treat lung diseases 
5  The stock price doesn t reflect the progress
Despite the growing momentum of the company s sales  the advancement of its portfolio  and the endorsement of its approach by some major drug companies  the stock hasn t really budged much  The stock was up only 12  in 2019  a year when the iShares NASDAQ Biotechnology ETF  NASDAQ IBB  gained 25   and Ionis shares are selling for 28  below their 52 week high 
Investors may be focused on near term risks to Spinraza  and if they are  they re overlooking the rest of the story of the company  I think it s likely the news flow during 2020 will change the narrative  and that today s price is a good entry point for investors looking for long term growth  Shares sell for less than nine times sales  which is not at all expensive compared to other biotech stocks  many of which have no sales or profit at all ",2020-01-16,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pitif,2060979

110656,332171,IONS,4 Scorching Hot Momentum Stocks To Beat The Market ,opinion,It has been two decades since academics zeroed in on what we today call the  momentum effect  in stock markets  Momentum is basically the tendency of winning stocks  i e  stocks that have outperformed the market in recent times  to keep winning and losing stocks to keep losing It is based on the idea that once a stock establishes a trend  it is more likely to continue in that direction instead of moving against the drift  Unlike the hugely followed Value or Growth styles  this strategy has barely anything to do with the fundamentals of a company  and instead works with the human penchant to extrapolate current trends into the future At the core  momentum investing calls for investors to  Buy High  Sell Higher  Why Does Momentum Strategy Work There is a simple reason behind this  It works because we are humans There s a whole laundry list of behavioral biases that most investors exhibit  and these emotional responses and mistakes are the very reason that momentum strategy works  For instance  we all know of investors who are afraid to book losses  and hence hold on to losing stocks for too long  hoping that they will spring back to their original prices  On the other hand  investors sell their winners way too early Furthermore  investors initially tend to under react to news  events or data releases  However  once things become clear  they tend to go with the flow and overreact  causing dramatic price reactions These behavioral problems extend trends and thus open up huge opportunities for momentum players  So basically  it s a way to profit from the general human tendency to extrapolate current trends into the future Momentum investing is based on that gap in time that exists before the mean reversion occurs  i e  before prices become rational again Momentum versus Other StylesIt is worth reflecting over how the momentum strategy compares with other styles of investing over time  Recent research indicates that the size premium for small cap stocks has shrunk dramatically since the 1980s and value premium has declined radically since the 1990s  Academics are of the opinion that once research on factor premiums  like size and value  becomes known to public  the investment world catches on and the premium gradually erodes However  unlike other investment styles  momentum premium has stood the test of time  remaining remarkably robust ever since it was identified by financial academics in the 1990s Chase the AlphaMomentum strategies have been known to be alpha generative over long periods of time and across markets  So obviously  this strategy is quite tricky to implement  as detecting these trends is no child s play Here  we have created a strategy that will help investors get in on these fast movers and make handsome gains  Our screen will help you take advantage of both long term price momentum and a short term pullback in price  which will reflect

110680,332195,IONS,Isis Phamaceuticals changes name to distance itself from terrorist group,news,"Investing com    ISIS Pharmaceuticals Inc  O ISIS  announced on Friday that it has switched its title to Ionis Pharmaceuticals in an apparent attempt to differentiate itself with the terrorist group from the Islamic State  which shared an acronym with its former company name 
Ionis Pharmaceuticals  which is based in Carlsbad  California outside of San Diego  initially considered the name change last month in the wake of the Paris  terrorist attacks which claimed the lives of at least 120 citizens  Days later  the terrorist cell claimed responsibility for a series of bombings and mass shooting which engulfed the capital of France in arguably the most publicized act of violence since the September 11th tragedy in 2001 
On December 2  a married couple opened fire at a holiday party in San Bernardino  Calif  killing 14 workers and injuring 22 others  While ISIS reportedly claimed to play a role in the attack  the FBI said on Wednesday that it has still been unable to establish a direct link to the organization 
Founded in 1989  Ionis Pharmaceuticals specializes in RNA targeted drug discovery and development focused on advancing drugs for patients with severe and rare diseases  Carlsbad is located approximately 80 miles southwest of San Bernardino 
The Southern California biotech company is named after Isis  the Egyptian goddess of health  marriage and wisdom who was first worshipped in Egyptian religion in third century B C  Her worship later spread to the Ancient Roman empire  as well as a number of denominations of Greco Roman culture 
 Our goal is to create medicines that will save patients  lives  and we are proud to be at the forefront of creating innovative medicines   said Lynne Parshall  chief operating officer at Ionis Pharmaceuticals   We decided to change our company name because  when people see or hear our name  we want them to think about the life saving medicines we are developing  
A day earlier  Ionis announced the initiation of an investigator sponsored  open label Phase 2 study evaluating patients with wild type Transthyretin Amyloidosis  TTR   known commonly as Senile Systemic Amyloidosis  SSA   While Transthyretin Amyloidosis is a slowly progressive condition characterized by the buildup of amyloid proteins in the body s organs and tissues  a patient s heart is typically the dominant site of involvement  The presence of amyloidosis can disrupt normal cellular processes and tissue functioning  Unlike familial TTR associated forms of amyloid  ATTR   which feature TTR gene mutations and amyloid forming TTR mutant proteins  SSA is a late onset disease that is acquired  not inherited  according to the Boston University Amyloidosis Center 
Ionis  treatment involves the evaluation of its IONS TTRRxx therapy in approximately 50 patients with TTR Amyloidosis  who demonstrated evidence of suffering from cardiac disease  The effects of Ionis Pharmaceuticals  therapy will be measured by cardiac imaging at 6  12 and 18 months  the company said in a statement 
 We have demonstrated that  IONS TTRRx   given as one  once a week  self administered  at home injection  can robustly reduce TTR levels in patients with both the polyneuropathy and cardiomyopathy forms of the disease  and we have preliminary evidence of disease stabilization in patients with TTR related cardiomyopathy   said Brett Monia  Ph D   senior vice president of drug discovery and franchise leader for oncology and rare diseases at Ionis Pharmaceuticals
During the third quarter  Ionis reported Pro Forma Net Income of  25 million a marked increase from the same quarter in 2014  In conjunction with the corporate name change  the company will trade on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the new ticker symbol IONS  The new ticker symbol will become effective at the open of the market on Tuesday

Ionis said that all five of these instances happened before enhanced monitoring was completely implemented  and that a review of the safety data is ongoing 
 We are grateful to the patients who participated in the NEURO TTR study  along with their families  the investigators and the broader TTR amyloidosis community  for their dedication  commitment and support  We share the collective sense of urgency to bring a new treatment to patients and their families facing this devastating disease   said Brett P  Monia  senior vice president of drug discovery and franchise leader for oncology and rare diseases at Ionis Pharmaceuticals

Inotersen is potentially a first in class and best in class candidate being developed for the treatment of all forms of transthyretin  or TTR  amyloidosis The 15 months study demonstrated that the patients who were treated with inotersen experienced a significant benefit compared with placebo in the modified Neuropathy Impairment Score  The study met both primary endpoints and statistically significant differences were also observed at both end points 
Despite meeting the primary endpoints  the shares of the company declined by about 6 75   This is because the data from the study made the investors anxious about the drug s safety  Notably  Ionis  share price has decreased 8 2  year to date against the Zacks classified  industry s gain of 7 2  

 
Additionally  the study had some serious side effects  The adverse effects were seen more commonly with inotersen than in the placebo  In fact  three study participants developed thrombocytopenia among which two patients recovered but one died from intracranial hemorrhage and another patient stopped taking Inotersen due to non serious thrombocytopenia Four other patients who were treated with inotersen stopped taking the treatment due to a renal observation  Two amongst those met a predefined renal stopping rule and two others experienced serious renal adverse events  one of whom experienced chronic renal insufficiency  One placebo treated patient also met a predefined renal stopping rule  All five serious adverse events occurred before enhanced monitoring was fully implemented Ionis stated that a review of the safety data is ongoing 
Currently  long term safety and efficacy data with inotersen are being collected in an open label extension of the phase III NEURO TTR study   Moreover  review of the full data package from the NEURO TTR study by Ionis and its partner GlaxoSmithKline plc   NYSE GSK   is ongoing and detailed results from the study will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting and submitted for publication in a peer reviewed medical journal

In the last reported quarter  the company recorded a positive earnings surprise of 1 33   Let s see how things are shaping up for the second quarter of 2016 
Factors Influencing This Quarter
Mylan s Generics segment has been performing well over the last few quarters and should continue its encouraging performance this quarter as well  Moreover  the company has seen quite a few generic launches over the past few quarters  This quarter was no exception 
Newly launched products should perform well and aid revenues while acquisitions should contribute meaningfully  thereby driving segmental growth  The company continues to expect generic pricing erosion in the low to mid  single digit range in 2016 Mylan s Specialty segment benefited in the first quarter from higher volumes of EpiPen and higher sales of Perforomist  The company expects to see continued volume growth in EpiPen throughout the year Meanwhile  Mylan has been undertaking prudent acquisitions and inking strategic deals to drive long term growth  During the quarter  Jun 2016   Mylan acquired the non sterile  topicals focused specialty and generics business of privately held Renaissance Acquisition Holdings in a deal worth about  1 billion  The Renaissance deal has given Mylan the right to a complementary portfolio of approximately 25 branded and generic topical products  an active pipeline of approximately 25 products  and an established U S  sales and marketing infrastructure targeting dermatologists 
Mylan also gained an integrated manufacturing and development platform and a leading topicals focused contract development and manufacturing organization  The transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to earnings Mylan has also received all regulatory clearances required to acquire the Swedish drug maker  Meda  which is a leading international specialty pharmaceutical company  Update on the transaction is expected shortly On the second quarter call  investor focus will be on the company s performance along with updates from the Meda deal

Let s see how things are shaping up for the company for this announcement 
Factors at Play This Quarter
In Apr 2016  Perrigo provided a dismal earnings guidance for 2016  which it reiterated at the time of announcing first quarter results  The company expects earnings in the range of  8 20 to  8 60 per share  Previously  it had guided earnings in the range of  9 50 to  9 80 per share  The company said that the cut in the earnings guidance was owing to a reduction in pricing expectations in the Rx Pharmaceuticals segment due to industry and competitive pressure in the sector 
Perrigo expects price erosion of approximately 6  for the remainder of the year at the Rx segment  Softness in pricing is due to several factors including increased focus from customers to capture supply chain productivity savings and low raw material commodity pricing  competition in specific products  and consolidation of certain customers  The company expects this softness to continue impacting its fundamentals through 2016  The company expects Rx segment to record net sales of approximately  1 2 billion in 2016 
The reduction was also due to a weaker performance expected within the Branded Consumer Healthcare  BCH  segment over the next three quarters as well as low expectations for consolidated new product launches  The company expects the BCH segment to record net sales of approximately  1 4 billion in 2016 
Perrigo lowered its net sales guidance for 2016 at the time of announcing first quarter results  It expects nets sales in the range of  5 6  5 9 billion  adjusted to reflect new product delays  in 2016  Previously  the company had guided net sales in the range of   5 9  6 2 billion  It anticipates greater than  300 million from new product launches in 2016  compared with the previous expectation of more than  400 million  primarily due to changes related to regulatory approvals for certain new products  and modified market share penetration assumptions and timing of new products in Europe 
The company expects the Consumer Healthcare segment to record net sales of approximately  2 65 billion in 2016  A delay in new product launches  along with softness in pricing in the segment  is expected to impact the segment s performance through 2016 
On the second quarter call  investor focus will be on the company s performance as well as that of its business segments 
Earnings Whispers 
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Perrigo is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  This is not the case here  as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is  2 00   This is because the Most Accurate estimate is currently at  1 96 per share  while the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands higher at  2 00 
Zacks Rank  Perrigo s Zacks Rank  3 increases the predictive power of the ESP but when combined with a negative ESP makes a surprise prediction difficult 
Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions PERRIGO CO PLC Price and EPS Surprise   Stocks That Warrant a Look

Such deals provide the company with funds in the form of technology access fees  and milestones and other payments  The company has been very active on striking new ECCs and expanding partnership with existing ones  This quarter was no different 
We believe the company will continue to recognize revenues from these sources in the second quarter of 2016 as well 
Intrexon expects 2016 to be a breakout year for the health sector  from the viewpoint of moving programs into the clinic  in addition to the three studies that are currently underway  Intrexon anticipates that up to seven investigational new drugs and clinical trial initiations with the company s existing ECC partners utilizing its technologies will take place in 2016  subject to FDA approval 
Focus will remain on the company s performance along with other developmental updates 
What Our Model Indicates
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Intrexon is likely to beat estimates this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy    2  Buy  or  3  Hold  to surpass estimates  That is not the case here  as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is at 0 00   This is because both the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at a loss of 23 cents per share 
Zacks Rank  Though Intrexon has a favorable Zacks Rank  2  an ESP of 0 00  makes a surprise prediction difficult 
Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions INTREXON CORP Price and EPS Surprise   Stocks that Warrant a Look
Here are some health care stocks that you may want to consider  as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter

110765,332280,IONS,Ionis Incurs Wider than Expected Loss In Q1  Stock Down,opinion,"Ionis Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ IONS   reported a loss of 52 cents per share in the first quarter of 2016  wider than the year ago loss of 14 cents and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 50 cents  The company s shares plunged 7 8  following the release of first quarter results 
Total revenues in the quarter plunged 41 1  year over year to  36 9 million  Revenues also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  39 9 million 
The Quarter in Detail
Research  development   patent expenses increased 25 6  year over year to almost  81 million  General   administrative expenses also increased 41 5  year over year to  10 6 million 
Ionis has made significant progress with its pipeline  While enrollment in a phase III study on volanesorsen in patients with familial chylomicronemia syndrome is complete with data anticipated in the first half of 2017  another phase III study in patients with familial partial lipodystrophy is well underway 
We note that Ionis has partnership programs with companies like Biogen Inc    NASDAQ BIIB   and GlaxoSmithKline plc   NYSE GSK   among others  Under its collaboration with Biogen  enrollment in a phase III study  CHERISH  on nusinersen for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy  SMA  in children is complete and enrollment in another phase III study  ENDEAR  in infants with SMA is expected to complete within the coming months  Data from both these studies are expected in the first half of 2017 
In addition to these phase III studies  nusinersen is being evaluated in several phase II studies for the same indication 
On the other hand  IONIS TTRRx is being developed in collaboration with Glaxo for all forms of transthyretin  TTR  amyloidosis  Data from a phase III study  NEURO TTR  on IONIS TTRRx in patients with familial amyloid polyneuropathy  FAP  is also expected in the first half of 2017 
Glaxo also plans to initiate a phase III study  CARDIO TTR  on IONIS TTRRx in patients with the cardiomyopathy form of TTR amyloidosis  The company is working closely with the FDA to get the study started  Additionally  Glaxo is planning to evaluate IONIS  TTRRx in an orphan study in patients with the familial form of TTR amyloidosis as well as the wild type form 
Positive data from studies on volanesorsen  nusinersen and IONIS TTRRx would allow the company to file for approval thereafter 
In a separate press release  Ionis announced that Kastle Therapeutics has acquired global rights to develop and commercialize Kynamro  mipomersen sodium   In the U S   Kynamro is approved for the treatment of patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia to reduce low density lipoprotein cholesterol  apolipoprotein B  total cholesterol and non high density lipoprotein cholesterol as an adjunct to lipid lowering medications and diet The deal with Kastle will see Ionis receiving up to  95 million  which includes an upfront payment of  15 million  a  10 million payment on the third anniversary of the deal and up to  70 million in sales milestones  Beginning 2017  Ionis will earn royalties on global sales of Kynamro in the mid to low teens  Additionally  Ionis will receive a 10  equity stake in Kastle s parent company   Meanwhile  Sanofi  PA SASY  Genzyme  the specialty care global business unit of Sanofi   NYSE SNY    will be eligible to receive a 3  royalty on sales of Kynamro and 3  of the cash payments Ionis receives from Kastle 2016 Guidance Intact
For 2016  Ionis continues to expect net operating loss in the low  60 million range and a cash balance of more than  600 million 
Our Take
Ionis  first quarter results were disappointing with the company reporting a wider than expected loss and revenues missing expectations  Nevertheless  Ionis  agreements with leading health care companies continue to validate its antisense technology and provide the company with funds in the form of upfront  milestone and other payments  We are also positive on the Kastle deal for Kynamro

110767,332282,IONS,Ionis Pharmaceuticals  IONS  Stock Surges 36  On Clinical Trial Success,opinion,"Shares of Ionis Pharmaceuticals   NASDAQ IONS   stock soared over 36  on Monday on news that the company s clinical drug trial for spinal muscular atrophy in infants was successful 
The Carlsbad  CA based firm is an RNA targeted drug discovery and development company which focuses on developing drugs for rare and severe diseases  The company had been working in tandem with partner Biogen   NASDAQ BIIB   to develop nusinersen  a drug meant to treat spinal muscular atrophy  SMA  in infants  It is a genetic condition that results in the loss of motor neurons in the brain and spine and eventually leads to paralysis 
Biogen and Ionisis stated that the trial met its goal of  a statistically significant improvement in the achievement of motor milestones compared to those who did not receive treatment   As per the deal that the companies had with each other  BIIB will pay IONS  75 million for the success and will take over  filing for approval and handling the marketing of the drug 
 We are hopeful that nusinersen  if approved  will make a meaningful difference in the lives of patients and families affected by SMA  We look forward to working with Biogen on completing the clinical program and preparing for what we hope is a positive regulatory review   said Ionis Chief Operating Officer B  Lynne Parshal 
According to Reuters  Ionis is eligible to receive royalties on any potential sales of nusinersen up to a certain percentage as well as up to  150 million in milestone payments 
Thirty days ago  Ionis had received downward earnings estimate revisions for both this quarter and fiscal year  Current quarter estimates stand at a loss of  0 56 per share  down from the previous   0 55 estimate  Current fiscal year estimates are down a cent as well to a loss of  1 60 per share 
Ionis Pharmaceuticals currently sits at a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   However  with today s news this could be subject to change  given that the rank is driven entirely by estimate revisions  With a potentially new source of revenue  pending FDA approval   IONS may see some upward estimates in the near future ",2016-08-01,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/ionis-pharmaceuticals-(ions)-stock-surges-36-on-clinical-trial-success-200145514,200145514
110778,332293,IONS,Will Endo  ENDP  Surprise This Earnings Season Again ,opinion,"Endo International plc   NASDAQ ENDP   is scheduled to report second quarter 2016 results on Aug 8  after the market closes  The company has been consistently beating earnings expectations  In fact  Endo s earnings surpassed expectations in each of the last four quarters  with an average positive surprise of 4 46  
In the last reported quarter  the company delivered a positive earnings surprise 2 86   Will Endo be able to surpass expectations this time around as well  Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors Likely to Impact Q2 Results   Headwinds   More
At the time of announcing its first quarter 2016 results  Endo provided a dismal guidance for 2016 due to several headwinds including greater than expected price erosion across the Generics sector  delays on regulatory actions related to certain Endo products and an earlier than expected generic entrant for Voltaren Gel 
The company expects revenues in the range of  3 87 billion to  4 03 billion  old guidance   4 32  4 52 billion  and earnings in the range of  4 50 to  4 80 per share  old guidance   5 85  6 20   The company expects approximately 46  of revenues and 39  of earnings to come in the first half of 2016 
However  it anticipates revenues and earnings to pick up in the second half of the year  driven by the launches in the Par portfolio and continued growth of Xiaflex and Belbuca  Gross margin is expected in the range of 59 60   old guidance  approximately 63 65    The company anticipates a disproportionately high erosion of gross margin against revenues  Overall  the reduction in earnings guidance reflects lowered revenue and gross margin expectations 
Endo continued to witness erosion in the Generics business in the first quarter of 2016 and also lowered its expectations for the segment due to a number of factors  Some of the factors include aggressive pricing actions undertaken by its competitors  rapid erosion in the pain segment due to continued market contraction  increased competitive capacity and pressure  and the recently issued CDC guidelines that will continue to put pressure on an already soft pain market among other factors 
The company anticipates low single digit growth in the business  compared with its previous expectations of mid teens growth 
Endo s Branded segment is also facing pressure due to additional competitive entrants as well as a continuous rise in the number of public policy and regulatory actions including the recent CDC guidelines related to opioid prescribing and use  Endo expects a mid to high teen decline at the segment in 2016 
The company also announced an accelerated restructuring of its Generics product and R D portfolio  as well as the manufacturing facility network  This initiative is expected to result in approximately  60 million in annualized net run rate savings by the fourth quarter of 2017  The company expects to see about  10 million in gross margin improvement this year  The restructuring will be complete by the third quarter of 2017 
On the second quarter call  investors will be keen to know about the company s performance along with that of its business segments  Whether the company will revise its guidance will be something that investors will be eagerly looking out for 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Endo is likely to beat earnings this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  This is not the case here  as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is at 0 00   This is because both the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 75 cents per share 
Zacks Rank  Endo currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  The stock s Zacks Rank  3 when combined with an ESP of 0 00  makes surprise prediction difficult 
Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions ENDO INTL PLC Price and EPS Surprise   Other Stocks That Warrant a Look
Here are some health care stocks that you may want to consider  as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter  These stocks carry a Zacks Rank  2 and are scheduled to report second quarter results on Aug 9

After the move up from 37 it is currently pausing in a bull flag under 65  which is what makes it interesting  The Measured Move would target 87 5  As it gathers energy for that move  the momentum indicators are supportive of a move higher  The RSI is strong in the bullish zone and the MACD has pulled back in the flag but has not crossed down  There is plenty of room to the upside in the Bollinger Bands  as well  Look for a break over 62 5 to confirm the move higher out of the flag and ride Isis higher ",2015-11-19,Gregory W.

110834,332349,IONS,ISIS Heats Up Ahead Of FDA Decision,opinion,Shares of ISIS Pharmaceuticals  ISIS  are beginning to heat up significantly in anticipation of the PDUFA action date of January 29  which could result in the FDA approval of the company s flagship product Kynamro  mipomersen   Kynarmo is an inhibitor of a protein known as apo B  which has proven to be useful for the LDL cholesterol in hypercholesterolemia patients  Leaving Past BehindISIS suffered from a bit of controversy in October 2012 due to certain concerns that were brought up by the advisory meeting that discussed the NDA  New Drug Application  submitted for Kynamro earlier that year  These included worries about the safety profile of the drug  specifically regarding lesions that were discovered in patients undergoing clinical testing in the drug as well as concerns over the toxicity of the drug  On the other hand  the drug has demonstrated statistically significant reductions in LDL cholesterol reduction  This resulted in a 9 6 vote in favor of FDA approval on October 18  which reflects the panel s uncertainty about the safety of the drug despite the demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia  CompetitionKynamro will be directly competing with Juxtapid  lomitapide   which is Aegerion Pharmaceuticals   AEGR  recently approved microsomal triglyceride transfer protein inhibitor for the reduction of patients  lipid levels  This included LDL cholesterol  as well as Kynamro s target apo B  Many investors believe that one of these drugs  success could equate to the other s failure  but the market is moving AEGR and ISIS in tandem  to some extent   The notion that there is more than enough room in the hyperlipidemia market for these two drugs seems to be helping this effect too Despite having the same target  Kynamro is quite unique  It s based on antisense technology  which is a newer field that could have interesting medical applications in coming years  ISIS pharmaceuticals itself is basing its pipeline on this new technology and its implications  In addition to Kynamro  the company is exploring antisense inhibitors for target proteins CRP  ApoCIII  and Factor XI as well The Upside To ApprovalKynamro s approval could mean quite a lot to ISIS investors  despite the fact that it was licensed to Genzyme Corporation  Although Genzyme has already paid  175 million for Kynamro through licensing fees  ISIS stands to generate additional milestone payment revenue from the drug after its potential approval  and might have other partnering opportunities due to Genzyme s equity in ISIS ISIS originally dropped from over  13 share to  9 share following as an initial reaction to the FDA advisory committee which discussed the drug last October and gave the 9 6 vote in favor of approval  The market seemed to think that the drug s chances of approval were slim due to the safety concerns surrounding the drug and the likely approval of competitor Aegerion s Juxtapid lomitapide  This notion seemed to persist until after the FDA approval of Juxtapid lomitapide at the end of 2012 The Short FlowISIS short interest continued to move up following the advisory committee meeting  with about 13 6 million shares sold short at the end of the year  This represented about 13 6  of float  We ve recently seen huge movement in ISIS towards the upside  bringing YTD gains to approximately 27  and sending shares above  13 again  I think that this was a combination of investor skepticism over the FDA advisory committee vote  optimism over Kynamro s likelihood of success at the end of the month  and also some short covering One can also note that call options on ISIS are quite bullish for February  which indicates quite a bit of interest from speculators who want to bet on an FDA approval that will induce a large rally in the stock  The bullish momentum is also building  as you can see by heavy trading volume in the last few days TargetGiven the situation  I don t think that  16 share or more would be unreasonable following an FDA approval  Although ISIS is already getting quite large in its valuation  currently at  1 34 billion  an approval for Kynamro could mean a lot for antisense drugs  and hence the rest of ISIS  pipeline ,2013-01-15,Myriad Equity,https://www.investing.com/analysis/isis-heats-up-ahead-of-fda-decision-150941,150941

110837,332352,IONS,These Stocks Are Ready To Be Shorted,opinion,"As with those listed on my Saturday post  here are positions that I intend to short     but at hopefully slightly better prices 
Series of lower highs along a descending trendline 
Topping pattern in formation on Mohawk Industries Inc  NYSE MHK    
I made a profit on my Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  puts  but I m waiting for a bounce now that this wedge is broken to have a second go around    
I wimped out on ISIS Pharmaceuticals Inc  NASDAQ ISIS   mainly because I had a fat profit and my paranoia about pharma companies still reigns strong  This might just keep plunging  leading me to kick myself
