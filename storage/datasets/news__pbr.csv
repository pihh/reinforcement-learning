93428,314943,PBR,4 New Risks Could Influence Oil Market Dynamics Going Forward,opinion,"Now that oil prices have fully recovered from the threat of escalating aggression between the U S  and Iran  here are four important issues that will influence oil prices and market dynamics in the near term and long term 
1  Brazil May Join OPEC In 2021Brazil s energy minister  Bento Albuquerque   that the nation is seriously considering joining OPEC in 2021 and will begin discussions during his upcoming visit to Saudi Arabia In July 

Apparently Brazilian oil producers expressed concerns about OPEC membership in 2020 because the decision would mean cutting oil production to comply with the OPEC  policy  Brazil seems optimistic that the production cuts will end by 2021 even though OPEC and Russia are actively working to extend the cuts set to expire in March through June 2020 and possibly through  

In November 2019 Brazil s oil output hit a record high of 3 million bpd  a level which would make the nation OPEC s fourth largest producer  after Saudi Arabia  Iraq and the UAE   While Brazil s oil production is dominated by the national corporation  Petrobras  NYSE PBR   there are also a number of independent Brazilian oil companies and foreign International Oil Companies  IOC  participating that would make joining OPEC challenging 
This obstacle stems from the fact that over 1 million bpd of the nation s oil output is not controlled by Petrobras  but is spread amongst at least 25 companies  many of whom develop oil concessions in conjunction with IOCs like Equinor  NYSE EQNR   BP  NYSE BP   Shell  NYSE RDSa  and  Chevron   NYSE CVX  
 
 
 

Adding to this issue  Brazil hopes to attract more foreign companies to develop its offshore oil resources  Its last offshore concession auction was  a flop  with many companies shunning the auction altogether  so the possibility that future production could be subject to OPEC quotas and production cuts would add another reason for foreign oil firms to steer clear from investing in Brazil s oil resources 
Brazil s president and energy minister may seek to join the oil cartel  and OPEC would certainly benefit from Brazil s membership  However  the potential pitfalls to Brazil s future oil production will likely outweigh any benefits 
2  Saudi  Kuwait To Restart Joint Oil ProductionSaudi Arabia and Kuwait share oil production along a swath of land and sea between the two countries called the Neutral Zone 

Production in this area has been halted since 2015  due to disputes between the nations  In December  Saudi Arabia and Kuwait finally signed an MOU  memorandum of understanding  to resolve these clashes and restart production  Kuwait s Assembly  to ratify the agreement with Saudi Arabia  eliminating yet another hurdle 

Production in the Neutral Zone  as soon as March 2020  Oil fields in the region have the potential to add as much as 500 000 bpd to the global market eventually 

However  even if the Neutral Zone does start pumping in a few months  don t expect full production anytime soon  According to Chevron  which co manages the onshore Neutral Zone s Wafra oil field with Kuwait Gulf Oil Co   full production from that field won t be back online for at least a year 
3  Coronavirus  Oil Demand Threat 
The coronavirus  a highly contagious respiratory ailment that has already infected hundreds of people in China  is drawing comparisons to the SARS outbreak in 2003  In late 2002 and early 2003  China s GDP fell by an estimated 0 5  to 2 0  because of that SARS outbreak 

That epidemic slowed air travel and caused jet fuel demand to drop significantly enough that China s overall oil demand was affected  Many analysts are using the SARS epidemic as a benchmark to anticipate the coronavirus s impact on China s oil demand  In anticipation of less fuel use in China  both Brent and WTI dropped by over 2  on Wednesday 






In fact  it is now being reported that Chinese authorities have shut down all bus and subway transportation in the capital city of Wuhan province  where the outbreak is centered  They have also reportedly  as of Thursday morning in China 

Important differences remain between the situation in 2003 and the current one that suggest oil demand may not be as adversely affected by coronavirus 
First  SARS was  killing about 10  of those infected  Coronavirus has led to pneumonia  which can be fatal  but media reports that the virus itself does not appear to be as deadly as SARS 

Second  China has been employing a different energy strategy for the last five plus years  importing more oil than it is consuming and sending a large portion to fill massive storage facilities  As a result  a drop in jet fuel and gasoline demand may not show up in China s total crude oil demand numbers if the country continues to import the same quantities and simply funnel unused crude into its massive storage facilities 
From China s perspective  a temporary drop in fuel consumption from its population is no reason not to continue to take advantage of low oil prices to stock up on crude 
4  Libya To Halt Oil ExportsThe conflict between General Khalifa Haftar  the head of the Libyan National Army rebel group and the UN recognized Libyan Government of National Accord  GNA  is now weighing on Libya s oil exports 

General Haftar  whose forces control access to much of Libya s oil production and export infrastructure has ordered all exports halted in order to exert pressure on the GNA  which receives all of the revenue from Libyan oil production  According to TankerTrackers com  Libya exports a little over 1 million bpd  mostly to Italy  Spain and Singapore 

When news of the stoppage  on Monday  the price of Brent jumped 1 8   but quickly came back down  So far  the Libyan national oil company has continued to pump oil  but it is being held in storage tanks rather than exported  Once the storage tanks fill up  the company will have no choice but to cut production  perhaps to a mere 72 000 bpd

93491,315006,PBR,Is Petroleo Brasileiro  PBR  A Good Pick For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value  One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Petroleo Brasileiro S A    Petrobras   NYSE PBR   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Petroleo Brasileiro has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 11 74  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 17 75  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Petroleo Brasileiro s current PE level puts it above its midpoint over the past five years  Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Oil and Energy sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 14 43  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers   We should also point out that Petroleo Brasileiro has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 9 30  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Petroleo Brasileiro stock in the near term too  P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings  Right now  Petroleo Brasileiro has a P S ratio of about 0 96  This is significantly lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 19 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years   If anything  PBR is near the higher end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of overvalued trading at least compared to historical norms  Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Petroleo Brasileiro currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Petroleo Brasileiro a solid choice for value investors    What About the Stock Overall Though Petroleo Brasileiro might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of D and a Momentum Score of A  This gives PBR a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores   Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current year has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days compared to two lower  while the full year 2020 estimate has seen one upward revision compared to one downward in the same time period  This has had a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current year consensus estimate has decreased by 3 8  in the past two months  while the full year 2020 estimate has risen by 7 9   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Petroleo Brasileiro S A   Petrobras Price and Consensus    This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term  Bottom Line Petroleo Brasileiro is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible line up of statistics on this front  A strong industry rank  among top 2  of more than 250 industries  further instils our confidence  In fact  over the past two years  the Zacks Oil and Gas   Integrated   Emerging Markets industry has clearly outperformed the market at large  as you can see below  However  a Zacks Rank  3 makes it hard to get too excited about this company overall So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Breakout Biotech Stocks with Triple Digit Profit PotentialThe biotech sector is projected to surge beyond  775 billion by 2024 as scientists develop treatments for thousands of diseases  They re also finding ways to edit the human genome to literally erase our vulnerability to these diseases  Zacks has just released Century of Biology  7 Biotech Stocks to Buy Right Now to help investors profit from 7 stocks poised for outperformance  Our recent biotech recommendations have produced gains of  98    119  and  164  in as little as 1 month  The stocks in this report could perform even better ,2019-05-16,Zacks Investment

93493,315008,PBR,Oil   Gas Stock Roundup  Deals From Chevron  Canadian Natural   TC Energy,opinion,It was a week where oil prices logged sharp losses and natural gas futures dropped to multi year lows On the news front  Chevron   NYSE CVX   moved closer to its goal of pulling out of UK exploration and production after selling bulk of its North Sea oil and gas assets to Israel s Delek group for  2 billion  Meanwhile  Canadian Natural Resources Limited   TSX CNQ   announced that it has decided to buy Devon Energy s   NYSE DVN   assets in Canada for C 3 8 billion Overall  it was a dismal week for the sector  West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude futures fell 8 8  to close at  53 50 per barrel  while natural gas prices moved down 6  for the week to finish at  2 454 per million Btu  MMBtu    See the last  Oil   Gas Stock Roundup  here   The U S  crude benchmark hit the lowest settlement level since Feb 12 following the U S  Energy Department s latest inventory release  The report showed that crude stockpiles recorded a significantly lower than expected weekly draw  while domestic production climbed back to record 12 3 million barrels a day On a further bearish note  analysts and industry watchers are worried over the worsening U S  China and U S  Mexico trade spats that could lead to a major slowdown in global economy and translate into weak demand for the commodity Natural gas prices also suffered after a government report showed a larger than expected increase in supplies  The bearish injection  which was also higher than the five year average  intensified a sell off that left the U S  benchmark with its lowest close in three years Recap of the Week s Most Important Stories1   In a bid to streamline portfolio  Chevron will divest bulk of North Sea assets in the United Kingdom to Israeli conglomerate Delek Group s subsidiary  Ithaca Energy  for about  2 billion  The move  which is in sync with Delek Group s and Chevron s long term objectives  is a win win transaction for both  While Delek Group seeks to become a global offshore oil gas powerhouse  Chevron is focused on revving up production and optimization of portfolio in high return U S  shale plays  especially the Permian Basin The deal brings Chevron much closer to its goal of withdrawing from the aging North Sea  in a bid to streamline portfolio  The move is part of Chevron s strategic review of global portfolio to determine the competitiveness of all its projects  The decision seems to be a prudent one  as extracting oil from North Sea is not so economical since production costs are much higher than returns  With North Sea accounting for just around 3  of production  the company had put most of its assets in the region for sale last year As it is  the company plans to jettison  15  20 billion worth of assets in the 2020 2022 time frame  in order to optimize portfolio and provide additional cash to investors   Read more  2   In a bid to further solidify its position on its home turf

93519,315034,PBR,Petrobras to pay  2 95 billion to settle U S  corruption lawsuit,news,"By Brendan Pierson NEW YORK  Reuters    Brazil s state controlled oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA  SA PETR4  on Wednesday agreed to pay  2 95 billion to settle a U S  class action corruption lawsuit  in what was said to be the biggest such payout in the United States by a foreign entity   Petrobras denied any wrongdoing in the deal  which was one of the largest securities class action settlements in U S  history  With the settlement  it will pay out more than six times what it has received so far under a Brazilian probe into bribery schemes that involved company executives and government officials   The settlement  smaller than many analysts anticipated  was an important milestone for the oil firm as it tries to emerge from the scandal that has entangled two former Brazilian presidents and dozens of the country s corporate executives  But the deal reduces chances the world s most indebted oil company will pay a dividend for 2017  much anticipated by investors who have not seen such a payment since 2014 when the scandal came to light  a source familiar with the matter said   For the last four years Brazil has been rocked by the so called Car Wash investigation into kickbacks from contractors to executives of state run companies and politicians in return for public projects   The settlement put an end to  extremely high uncertainty  about the company s potential liability  JPMorgan  NYSE JPM  said in a client note  adding that it had expected a figure above  5 billion  Analysts at Brazilian bank BTG Pactual said the market had expected a settlement of  5 billion to  10 billion   Petrobras preferred shares closed up nearly 0 91 percent to 16 70 reais  U S  traded shares  N PBR  rose 2 52 percent at  10 97  Moody s brushed off concerns about the impact of the fine on the company s balance sheet  noting it was expected to generate some  30 billion in cash this year and make capital investments of around  15 billion   Petrobras  liquidity position is adequate and the payment of the agreed class action settlement amount is not a material concern   it said    EXCELLENT RESULT  Jeremy Lieberman  an attorney for the investors  called the deal an  excellent result  and said it was the largest ever involving a foreign securities issuer in the United States  The deal came as the U S  Supreme Court was set to consider on Friday whether to hear Petrobras  appeal of a lower court decision certifying the case as a class action  Petrobras said it and the investors would ask the Supreme Court to put off considering the case while the settlement awaits approval  If the Supreme Court does take the case  it could delay its resolution for years  U S  District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan must still approve the accord  Investors had sued Petrobras after prosecutors in Brazil accused executives of accepting more than  2 billion in bribes over a decade  mainly from construction and engineering companies  In a securities filing on Wednesday  Petrobras claimed it was a victim and denied wrongdoing  adding that it has only recovered 1 475 billion reais   455 77 million  for itself from the Car Wash investigation   But its market value has plunged as its central role in the scheme continues to be unwound by investigators  Petrobras said it hoped the settlement would resolve all investor claims in the United States where 13 individual lawsuits remain open  following settlements in 20 other cases   Some claims involving non U S  based Petrobras securities purchased outside the United States also still remain  The deal came days after Brazil s securities regulator CVM formally accused eight former Petrobras executives of corruption  The accusations relate to possible irregularities in the contracting process for three drilling ships  according to a legal filing by the regulator last Friday   Among the accused in CVM s filing are former Petrobras Chief Executives Maria das Gracas Foster and Jose Sergio Gabrielli  Neither could be reached for comment  The largest securities fraud settlements in U S  history include  7 2 billion stemming from the collapse of Enron   6 2 billion over an accounting scandal at WorldCom and  3 2 billion over an accounting scandal at Tyco International  according to Stanford Law School s Securities Class Action Clearinghouse

reports on 16 major stocks  including NextEra Energy  T Mobile and Petrobras  These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today You can see Buy ranked NextEra Energy s shares have outperformed the Zacks Electric Power industry in the past year  gaining  18 6  vs  14   The Zacks analyst thinks NextEra Energy s investments to strengthen its infrastructure and ongoing capital projects  on completion  will help in serving the expanding customer base more efficiently The expansion of business through strategic acquisitions has positively impacted earnings  However  the company s nature of business is subject to complex and comprehensive federal  state and other regulations  Substantial investments are undertaken to ensure the safety of nuclear operations  That said  the risk of unplanned outages remains  which could derail its normal operations and impact profitability  You can   Shares of T Mobile have outperformed the Zacks National Wireless industry over the past year  gaining  11 7  vs   0 9   T Mobile has received shareholder approval for its merger with Sprint  This is a step forward in creating the New T Mobile through which the wireless carrier aims to bring robust competition to the 5G era The New T Mobile would have about 127 million customers and a strong closing balance sheet  The company has also collaborated with Ericsson  BS ERICAs  and Nokia  HE NOKIA  to accelerate the deployment of a nationwide 5G network  The Zacks analyst thinks T Mobile s network expansion strategy continues to be superior to its rivals However  a highly competitive and saturated U S  wireless market remains a major headwind  Intensifying competition could limit the company s ability to attract and retain customers and may adversely affect its operating results  T Mobile launched several low priced service plans which have enhanced revenues but not significantly improved the bottom line  You can   Petrobras  shares have outperformed the Zacks Emerging Markets Integrated Oil industry over the past three months  gaining  23 1  vs   15 5   While Petrobras recently reported weaker than expected Q4 earnings triggered by lower production  impairments and legal charges  results were strong overall In particular  Petrobras  upstream profit soared year over year thanks to steady commodity price recovery that lead to meaningful improvements in net income and EBITDA  The Zacks analyst thinks the largest oil company in South America also stands to benefit from Brazil s economic growth and huge pre salt oil reserves However  it was another quarter that production weakness clipped profits and cut into overall gains from rising oil prices  Moreover  the company s downstream business   consisting of the refining and marketing activities   suffered from weak oil products sales margins With the largest debt load in the oil industry  coupled with years of mismanagement and corruption  investors are advised to wait for a better entry point before buying shares  You can   Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Intuitive Keurig Dr Pepper and United Continental Is Your

dropped On the news front  upstream players Denbury Resources Inc    NYSE DNR   and Penn Virginia Corporation   NASDAQ PVAC   agreed to dissolve the strategic agreement that they entered into last October  Meanwhile  Murphy Oil Corporation   NYSE MUR   signed a deal to sell oil and gas assets in Malaysia Overall  it was a mixed week for the sector  While West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude futures edged up 0 4  to close at  59 04 per barrel  natural gas prices lost 1 5  to  2 753 per million Btu  MMBtu    See the last  Oil   Gas Stock Roundup  here   The U S  crude benchmark rallied to four month highs  after government data showed a large weekly decline on surging exports  Further to this  hefty draws in product inventories  gasoline and distillate  boosted bullish sentiment in the energy market  As it is  crude is being supported by the so called OPEC  deal that is cutting production by around 1 2 million barrels per day until the end of June  U S  sanctions against Venezuela and Iran also continue to tighten the commodity s fundamentals However  natural gas prices dropped on smaller than average decrease in supplies and forecasts of warmer weather  which might lead to the heating fuel s tepid demand Recap of the Week s Most Important Stories1     Denbury Resources and Penn Virginia s  1 7 billion acquisition deal has been called off via mutual agreement  For each Penn Virginia stock  Denbury was supposed to pay  25 86 in cash and 12 4 shares of its common stock  There will be no termination fee involved in the process  per the agreement Denbury made the merger agreement as Penn Virginia s Eagle Ford assets were expected to have a low breakeven point  which could have complemented its portfolio  The acquisition could have brought in opportunities of short cycle development to the company s medium cycle development assets  The combined entity was expected to have an enterprise value of  6 billion  Following the closure of the transaction  Denbury stockholders were expected to hold around 71  of the combined entity  However  opposition from shareholders of Penn Virginia  like Mangrove Partners  led to the termination Activist investment fund Mangrove Partners  a major shareholder of Penn Virginia  has been very vocal against the merger since the very beginning  Last year  it increased its active stake in Penn Virginia to 10 7  from 9 5  and called on the termination of the merger deal  which was expected to be closed in the first quarter of 2019   Read more  2     Murphy Oil announced that its subsidiary has entered into an agreement to sell two of its Malaysian assets in an all cash transaction worth  2 127 billion  The assets will be sold to PTT Exploration and Production Public Company Limited   PTTEP    In addition to the purchase price  PTTEP will also pay  100 million in a bonus payment contingent upon certain future exploratory drilling results prior to October 2020  Subject to required approval from different agencies  this transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2019 Murphy Oil intends to utilize the proceeds through share buyback  repayment of debts and investment  in order to expand its operation in oil focused domestic assets  Murphy Oil plans to invest  750 million of the proceeds to expand its operation in oil rich Eagle Ford Shale and the Gulf of Mexico  The Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company might opt for acquisitions or fund both deep water projects and U S  onshore opportunities You can see  In addition   750 million will be utilized to strengthen its balance sheet by

order to optimize the company s midstream operations in the western Marcellus and Utica basins  The  3 8 billion partnership incorporates Williams  Ohio Valley Midstream and Utica East Ohio Midstream systems Per the agreement  which is expected to be concluded within the next two quarters  CPPIB will acquire a 35  stake in the JV for around  1 34 billion  Williams is expected to retain the remaining interest in the partnership and act as the operator  Notably  the company acquired the remaining 38  stake in the Utica East Ohio Midstream from Momentum Midstream and included it in the JV s asset base  The midstream property processes and fractionates natural gas and natural gas liquids  NGLs  in the prolific Utica shale play Williams expects the formation of the JV to create cost synergies  and reduce operating and maintenance costs in the assets mentioned above  The move will create an opportunity for the company to invest in the Utica region in a more efficient manner and

development of Aspen in situ oil sands project amid pipeline crisis and market uncertainty in Canada  The integrated energy company gave a green signal to the C 2 6 billion project in November 2018 with intent to commence production by 2022  The Aspen project is likely to produce 75 000 barrels of oil per day as well as generate direct and provincial revenues of more than C 4 billion along with C 10 billion in royalties for Alberta The project is likely to be delayed by at least a year due to intervention by Alberta government along with other competitive issues  Notably  the project was sanctioned before the government of Alberta announced its production curtailment program in response to the widening crude price differentials  The province issued a mandate on Dec 2  2018 to remove 325 000 barrels of oil production per day from the market beginning in 2019 While the government s intervention narrowed the differentials  from  44 a barrel in December to near about  10 currently   the scenario is still uncertain amid the pipeline pinch  The delay of Enbridge s   Line 3 project along with the latest court rulings for TransCanada s Keystone XL pipeline is making it difficult for companies to balance output levels with pipeline capacity without mandated cuts   Read more  5     Petrobras   NYSE PBR    is reportedly set to receive around  10 billion from the Brazilian government to settle the  transfer of rights  dispute  The dispute basically relates to the oil producing zone offshore Brazil  known as the  transfer of rights  area  and dates back to 2010  Notably  in 2010  the government granted Petrobras the right to explore 5 billion barrels of oil and gas off the Brazilian coast  in return of additional shares in the company  The government s move was seen as an effort to maintain control in the state owned energy giant It was estimated thereafter that the  transfer of rights  area held recoverable resources comprising around 15 billion barrels of oil and gas  which was in excess of what Petrobras was entitled to produce under the 2010 deal Per latest updates  both the parties are close to reaching a final agreement  wherein Petrobras is likely to receive a compensation of around  10 billion from the government  Further  the Brazilian oil giant is likely to receive payments from third party bidders who are seeking to partner with it to develop deepwater oil projects  Hence  the companies bidding for the exploration of the area have to compensate Petrobras to the extent to which the latter has already invested in those blocs  Bloomberg projects Petrobras to receive an additional  9 billion from the companies  in addition to the payment it will be receiving from the government   Read more  Price PerformanceThe following table shows

93525,315040,PBR,Is Murphy Oil Mulling Further Asset Sales To Boost Portfolio ,opinion,"Just a few days after Murphy Oil Corporation   NYSE MUR   announced its intent to divest Malaysian assets  the company is reportedly eyeing to jettison further assets from its Asia Pacific portfolio  As we know  Murphy Oil s Malaysian business will be  to PTT Exploration and Production Public Company Limited   PTTEP   in an all cash transaction worth  2 1 billion  The company intends to use the proceeds from the same to repurchase shares  trim debt and focus on domestic assets 
Post the closure of the deal within second quarter 2019  the U S  oil producer will be holding foreign exploration assets in Australia  Brunei and Vietnam  The company is contemplating to offload non core assets in these regions  in a bid to streamline portfolio and deepen its focus on domestic holdings 
How Prudent is Murphy Oil s Divestment Plans 
The divestment plans are certainly in sync with the company s intention to expand operations in oil rich Eagle Ford Shale and the Gulf of Mexico  With Equinor   NYSE EQNR   and Pioneer Natural Resources   NYSE PXD   mulling the sale of their Eagle Ford acreage  Murphy Oil could well tap this opportunity to bolster its presence in the shale play  The company s divestment plans are likely to help it in boosting financials and enhancing investor friendly moves 
However  one thing that s worth noticing here is the fact that the Malaysian holdings of the firm attributed to revenues and profits of  854 2 million and  269 5 million  respectively  Further  it generated cash flows of  468 million  given modest capex requirement of  140 million  Since the Malaysian assets were a strong free cash flow generator for the company  we remain a little uncertain if Murphy will be able to meet its FCF target of more than  400 million 
The  other  holdings  in Australia  Vietnam and Brunei  resulted in a loss of  37 5 million in 2018 despite shelling out  88 million as capital expenditure  Hence  it seems judicious for the company to shed off these non core assets  and concentrate on deep water projects and U S  onshore opportunities    
Final Thoughts
We appreciate Murphy Oil s strategic JV with Petrobras   NYSE PBR   in the GoM late last year  increased focus on the production of more profitable domestic assets and cost saving initiatives  While we would also like to remain optimistic about Murphy Oil s divestment plans  whether the decision will actually be fruitful for the Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company totally depends upon the way it will reinvest the proceeds and the impact of the same in the coming periods  You can see

93526,315041,PBR,Petrobras Divestment Goals To Get Boost From  8 6B TAG Sale,opinion,"Forging ahead with its divestment goals  Petrobras   NYSE PBR   is set to offload 90  stake in its natural gas pipeline unit  Transportadora Associada de G s   TAG   to Engie SA led consortium for  8 6 billion  Markedly  this will be the largest ever single asset sale for the Brazilian energy giant  which has been making serious efforts to trim its huge debt burden 
Petrobras to Finally Sell TAG
Investors should note that Petrobras had first announced to jettison its TAG unit in 2017 to boost its financials and credit metrics  which were hugely impacted by the multi billion dollar Operation Carwash Scandal  However  in June 2018  the Brazilian Federal Court halted the sale of the pipeline  putting the company s divestment plans in jeopardy 
At that time  the court passed a ruling against the sale of TAG to France based Engie for  7 billion  due to discrepancies in Petrobras  way of advancing with the sale  It was believed that the sale was not publicized well enough to stimulate ample competition 
Nevertheless  the TAG divestment program got a new boost when the state held company reopened the pipeline unit s auction process  wherein new bids were allowed  In the final rounds of the bid  Engie in conjunction with Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec  a Canadian pension fund  presented the highest bid of  8 6 billion  outdoing Macquarie Group as well as a joint bid from EIG Global Energy Partners and Mubadala Development Co  Upon closure of the deal  Engie and Caisse will own 58 5  and 31 5  stakes in TAG  respectively 
TAG s gas pipeline system  spanning 4 500 kilometers  is primarily located in the north and northeast of Brazil  It can transport up to 74 7 million cubic feet per day  which is fully contracted through long term agreements with ship or pay clauses 
Deal Motives
The acquisition of TAG assets complements the business plans of Engie  which has been vending oil and coal assets of late to fuel investment in renewables  and gas and power  in hopes of generating better returns  France s leading supplier of natural gas  Engie   having the largest gas distribution network in Europe   aims at using its expertise to accelerate the development of TAG  which is likely to benefit from rising fuel demand in Brazil 
For Petrobras  the divestment is in sync with its aim to cut debt levels  Notably  while the company s net debt of  100 billion peaked in 2015  concentrated efforts to lower leverage  boost liquidity through operational efficiency and divest non core assets have helped Petrobras in deleveraging to a considerable extent  Its net debt declined to  69 4 billion in 2018  decreasing from  84 9 billion a year ago and  96 4 billion in 2016 
As it is  last month  Petrobras  CEO Branco stated his plans to sell around  10 billion of assets by April 2019  signaling the divestment of TAG assets  The finalization of the sale of TAG assets is likely to give a considerable boost to the financials of the company  which is also set to  around  10 billion from the Brazilian government for settlement of the  transfer of rights  dispute  Petrobras is also in talks with PetroReconcavo to jettison 34 oilfields in northeast Brazil 
As we know  Petrobras revved up its five year plan in March  and now intends to offload  26 9 billion through 2023  streamline portfolio and sharpen focus on other profitable segments for achieving top tier results  The firm is entering into various strategic partnerships with foreign oil giants to drive exploration momentum 
In this regard  the Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company has inked deals with major players like TOTAL S A    NYSE TOT    Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa  plc  and Equinor ASA   NYSE EQNR    You can see

Meanwhile  another independent upstream company Noble Energy   NYSE NBL   sanctioned the development of the Alen field off Equatorial Guinea    Overall  it was a mixed week for the sector  While West

against Venezuela and Iran also continue to tighten the commodity s fundamentals Further to this  Signs of stable demand  contrary to previous expectations of slowing consumption  boosted bullish sentiment in the energy market Meanwhile  natural gas prices were little changed even as the injection season began this past week with a bearish report that showed a larger than average increase in supplies Recap of the Week s Most Important Stories1     Concho Resources announced its decision to divest stake in Oryx Midstream to Stonepeak Infrastructure Partners  The transaction entails the sale of a 23 75  stake of Concho in the Oryx I gathering system that is owned by Oryx Midstream  a privately held energy player possessing key midstream assets like gathering and transportation system of crude in the prolific Permian  Concho is likely to get roughly  300 million upon closing of the agreement In view of the recent deal  Concho is expecting to bag  300 million  which is in addition to  157 million it received in February 2018 from recapitalization of Oryx  Hence  the current total consideration of  457 million is representing 10 times increment to the company s initial

the deal  the Zacks Rank  2  Buy  integrated energy super major will supply 500 000 tons of LNG annually to the Japanese utility firm  Tokyo Gas for a period of ten years starting April 2020 You can see  The deal is worthy of attention because of the usage of coal index pricing for the LNG contract unlike the usual oil indexation or natural gas benchmark Henry Hub  Markedly  this move marks the first time a Japanese firm will be using a coal based pricing formula for an LNG contract  While part of the supply will be based on coal indexation  the remaining will be priced off traditional oil and gas linked indexes The move of linking LNG contract to coal prices is more of a risk management strategy of Tokyo Gas  By diversifying its price exposure for LNG via coal indexation  the company will be able to better compete in its own power market that is dominated by coal  The deal allows Tokyo Gas to obtain a secured supply of LNG and stabilize the company s cost exposure   Read more  5

93547,315062,PBR,Refinery shares climb as Hurricane Harvey boosts gasoline prices,news,"Investing com   Shares of many oil refineries were rallying on Monday after Hurricane Harvey forced many refineries near the storm s path to shutdown 
According to CNN  some ten refineries closed  while CNBC noted that the closures could remove more than 1 million barrels per day in refining capacity just in the Houston and Galveston  Texas  areas 
Some of the closures include  Royal Dutch Shell s  LON RDSa  PLC ADR  NYSE RDSa  Deer Park refinery in Houston  with a crude oil capacity of 340 000 barrels per day  Petroleo Brasileiro Petrobras  SA ADR  NYSE PBR  facility in Pasadena  Texas  with a capacity of 110 000 barrels per day  and  Exxon Mobil  Corporation s  NYSE XOM  plant in Baytown  Texas  with a capacity of more than 560 000 barrels per day 
Even if the refineries escape major damages  infrastructure damages and flooding could make it impossible for workers to make it to the facilities  leaving them idle for days  or maybe even weeks 
Some of the companies whose shares are climbing on the news include HollyFrontier Corporation  NYSE HFC   PBF Energy Inc  NYSE PBF   and Andeavor  NYSE ANDV   Shell  Petrobras and Exxon s shares are lower   as are other oil producers and service companies due to weak oil prices 
Although oil prices were lower on Monday  gasoline futures surged  and this was boosting the refiners  It is likely that a mini gasoline price spike will continue and that will be positive for refiners  An important mention  however  is that the end of Labor Day weekend marks the start of the lower demand period for gasoline  and soon that may pull gasoline prices lower ",2017-08-28,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/refinery-company-shares-climb-as-hurricane-harvey-boosts-gasoline-prices-523091,523091

93596,315111,PBR,Petrobras  PBR  Q3 Earnings  Oil Surge To Offset Legal Costs ,opinion,Petr leo Brasileiro S A  or Petrobras   NYSE PBR   is set to release third quarter 2018 results on Nov 6  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to be reported quarter is pegged at a profit of 35 cents on revenues of  24 510 million Notably  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third quarter earnings has been revised 39 6  downward over the past 30 days  However  the consensus mark reflects a whopping increase of almost 1066  from the year ago quarter  Further  revenue estimates for the  quarter to be reportedcompare favourably with the year ago quarter s revenues of  22 700 million In the preceding three month period  the Rio de Janeiro headquartered integrated player delivered a positive earnings surprise of 41 94   Rising crude prices were primarily responsible for the outperformance  resulting in net quarterly profit of  2 794 million  which is the highest since 2011 Coming to earnings surprise history  Petrobras is on a firm footing  having surpassed earnings estimates in three of the trailing four quarters  delivering average positive surprise of 10 37   Investors are keeping their fingers crossed  in expectation of the energy giant beating earnings estimates this time around as well Petroleo Brasileiro S A   Petrobras Price and EPS Surprise   Let s take a look at the factors that are likely to impact Petrobras  performance in the to be reported quarter Factors Likely to Influence Upcoming ResultsAverage West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude prices were recorded at  70 98   68 06 and  70 23 per barrel in the month of July  August and September 2018  respectively  per data from the U S  Energy Information Administration  EIA   These prices were considerably higher than the year ago respective prices of  46 63   48 04 and  49 82  Notably  oil prices were fueled by concerns over U S  sanctions on Iran  OPEC s efforts to tighten the market and strong global demand Natural gas prices also fared well  following improving clean energy demand  The average monthly spot prices of the commodity for the respective months of third quarter 2018 were  2 83   2 96 and  3 00 per Million Btu  representing healthier prices than third quarter 2017 Favorable crude pricing environment during third quarter 2018 is likely to be beneficial for the company s upstream business As it is  we appreciate Petrobras  encouraging portfolio of investments  particularly in Brazil s pre salt reservoirs that lie below the Esp rito Santo  Campos and Santos basins in deep and ultra deep water  which are expected to drive production growth of the company  Notably  per its ambitious five year plans  the Brazilian oil giant intends to boost average production from an expected 2 7 million barrels of oil equivalent per day  Boe d  in 2018 to 3 55 million Boe d by 2022 However  while the company is taking initiatives to trim its leverage metrics  Petrobras is still burdened with a debt of around  74 billion  Also  one can t deny the fact that its involvement in the Operation Carwash scandal has been a major overhang for the company  In fact  in September  it agreed to pay a fine of  853 2 million to settle charges against it in the Carwash scandal  Notably  its third quarter 2018 financial statement will incorporate the  853 2 million settlement  which is likely to dent overall earnings  During the quarter  it also lost  622 million in a dispute against Vantage Drilling  which comes as another blow to the company While we believe that Petrobras will surely benefit from crude rally  costs related to lawsuits and scandals might limit the company s profit Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Petrobras is likely to beat earnings estimates in the to be reported quarter  as it has the right combination of two key ingredients  A stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  to be able to beat estimates  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our Earnings ESP  Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is 0 00   This is because the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are both pegged at 35 cents Zacks Rank  Petrobras currently holds a Zacks Rank  2  Though a Zacks Rank  2 increases the predictive power of ESP  the company s 0 00  ESP makes surprise prediction difficult We caution against Sell rated stocks  Zacks Ranks  4 and 5  going into the

per share  wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 19 cents due to lower international margins and increased expenses  However  the reported figure was narrower than the year ago adjusted loss of 42 cents per share due to strong performance from its U S  Drilling segment Quarterly revenues of  778 1 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  800 million on weak international segment sales  However  the top line was higher than the year ago level of  662 5 million  which can be attributed to higher total average rigs working  During the third quarter  the company ran an average of 225 5 rigs all over the world compared with 212 in the year ago quarter   Nabors Industries Ltd  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   SegmentsNabors  U S  Drilling segment generated quarterly operating revenues of  274 million  up from the year ago level of  222 7 million  The segment recorded operating income of  2 6 million  reflecting significant improvement from a loss of  53 5 million in the prior year period  This was mainly driven by an improvement in drilling performance in the Lower 48  accompanied by higher day rates and falling expenses Canadian Drilling segment revenues came in at  26 6 million in the quarter under review  recording an uptick from year ago figure of  18 1 million  Moreover  the segment s quarterly loss of  1 9 million was narrower than the operating loss of  7 5 million in the year ago quarter International Drilling segment s operations attributed to revenues of  377 1 million  which increased from the year ago quarter s  374 1 million  However  operating income fell to  25 7 million in the quarter under review from the year ago figure of  32 3 million due to the sale of jack ups  coupled with higher operational and reactivation costs that led to lower average margin per day Revenues at the Drilling Solutions segment increased to  60 9 million in third quarter 2018 from  37 5 million recorded in the year ago quarter  As such  the unit s operating income of  5 9 million in the year ago quarter improved to  9 5 million in the quarter under review  This can be attributed to higher activities across most of the segments  product lines and greater contribution from certain services of Tesco  LON TSCO  Revenues at the Rig Technologies segment increased to  63 6 million from the prior year level of  50 million  Moreover  the segment s loss narrowed to  4 1 million from the prior year quarter s  10 5 million  The segment s results were impacted by the synergies from the Tesco acquisition ExpensesTotal costs and expenses increased from

The company foresees the Drilling Solutions segment to generate adjusted EBITDA of more than  20 million through the fourth quarter  Moreover  capital expenditure for the full year of 2018 is expected

93645,315160,PBR,Workers Party deals drove rise and fall of OAS  Brazil builders,news,"By Guillermo Parra Bernal and Tatiana Bautzer SAO PAULO  Reuters    On Christmas Day 2014  in an empty S o Paulo office building  four senior executives at engineering firm Grupo OAS SA set in motion a corporate bankruptcy that is helping reshape Brazil Inc   Over the previous decade  Brazil s ruling Workers Party had built national champions using cheap state credit and contracts with state firms  Those policies transformed OAS into Brazil s fourth largest builder and made founder Cesar Mata Pires a billionaire   But OAS  chief executive Jos  Aldem rio Pinheiro had been arrested weeks before the meeting as part of a wide ranging judicial investigation into millions of dollars paid by engineering and building firms to politicians in return for contracts with state companies   Cut off from bank lending and new state deals once it was named in the  Operation Car Wash  investigation  OAS decided on Christmas Day to default on a  16 million interest payment  according to a person at the meeting  A request for bankruptcy protection ensued  and OAS became the first of Brazil s major engineering groups to launch a major downsizing plan  So far  the company has cut 30 000 jobs as it shed assets and reorganized its business to become less reliant on state money  executives say   The saga of OAS  restructuring highlights the way some of Brazil s engineering groups are having to reinvent the way they do business in the aftermath of Operation Car Wash  which laid bare a system of illegal favors between politicians and business elites    We can t afford any mistakes   OAS  chief financial officer  Josedir Barreto  said in an interview in May   We have to prove that we can do infrastructure work in a transparent and correct way    The probe has led to the jailing of several top politicians and business leaders  and accelerated President Dilma Rousseff s suspension from office   Rousseff  who has denied any wrongdoing  will stand trial in the Senate in August on charges of breaking budget rules  A new interim government has vowed to cut back state enterprises and subsidized loans to private companies   Brazil Inc s corporate fabric has also been radically changed by the investigation amid growing investor distrust and the worst recession in decades  Analysts say the fallout from the investigation accounted for about half the 3 8 percent economic contraction in Latin America s largest economy last year   More than 100 people  many from the companies built up as national champions and including Brazil s most powerful building tycoon  Marcelo Bahia Odebrecht  have been sentenced on corruption charges linked to kickback schemes  racketeering and money laundering   Prosecutors say  1 65 billion worth of bribe money has been recovered from offshore accounts in 36 countries  The Workers Party has since lost its grip on power and seen its popularity collapse   Most of the 31 building and engineering companies involved in the scandal have sought respite from creditors  dismissed workers or exited market segments as contracts dried up in the past 18 months   OAS is a case in point  Its court approved recovery plan has involved a slew of divestments  including the sale of sanitation firm Samar SA and the transfer of a 24 4 percent stake in concessions operator Invepar SA to creditors   Yet the reputational cost of the scandal has also put the brakes on other asset sales  according to bankers  lawyers and executives involved in the plan  OAS is seeking to sell assets including oil services firm OAS  leo e Gas SA  a stake in shipbuilder Enseada Industria Naval SA and three sports arenas  Bidders have turned increasingly wary of the legal consequences of a deal with OAS because of possible fines if the assets are found to be part of a corrupt deal  according to three advisors directly involved in the sale processes   Some of the deals OAS had with the government appeared to make more political than economic sense  and are haunting it now  For example  OAS is having trouble selling the three sports arenas  including one that it built for the 2014 World Cup soccer championship in a city that does not even have a first tier soccer team  As OAS seeks to get back to basics  a company source told Reuters it has won its first contract since Pinheiro s arrest   a small road project in the northeastern state of Bahia  where the company started 40 years ago    The expertise that these groups accumulated for years is their only way to rebuild their reputation once the dust settles   said Mauricio Canedo  a research fellow who specializes in industrial policy at Funda  o Getulio Vargas in Rio de Janeiro   GOVERNMENT PARTNER  The son of a wealthy cattle rancher in Bahia  Mata Pires  links to politicians were central to the growth of his company   Trained as an engineer  he founded OAS with two colleagues in 1976 to do sub contracting work for larger rival Odebrecht SA   the biggest of the builders involved in the probe   His big break came when he befriended Bahia s then governor Antonio Carlos Magalh es  marrying his daughter Tereza  Brazilians joked back then that OAS stood for  Obras Arranjadas pelo Sogro    or  Work Arranged by the Father In Law   Following the Workers Party s victory in the 2002 presidential election  OAS capitalized on then President Luiz In cio Lula da Silva s dream of transforming Brazil into an emerging market powerhouse   During Lula s and his successor Rousseff s stints in power  the Workers Party threw the weight of the state behind a group of handpicked conglomerates  OAS teamed up with three state led pension funds to create Invepar  tapping workers  savings and state loans to win airport and subway contracts  At the same time  OAS became one of Brazil s largest political campaign donors  alongside other building and engineering firms competing for state contracts  Grupo OAS reported donations of 83 million reais to politicians in the 2014 election  an 11 fold increase from 2006  official data showed   Prosecutors involved in the Car Wash probe say that part of those donations were kickbacks from inflated contracts with state firms  alongside an undetermined amount of undeclared funds that  under Brazilian law  are considered illegal campaign funding  OAS has denied the allegations  UNRAVELLING  Things began to unravel rapidly for OAS soon after Rousseff won re election in October 2014   The following month  federal police raided the company s headquarters  arresting CEO Pinheiro   the owner of 10 percent of OAS   on suspicion of bribery and money laundering   Investigators say Pinheiro ordered OAS to pay for the renovation of two leisure properties  one in the mountains near S o Paulo and another in a beach resort  that Lula secretly owned  Pinheiro and Lula have repeatedly denied the allegations and formal charges have not yet been filed   But Pinheiro was found guilty on separate charges of corrupting Petrobras executives  racketeering and money laundering  as were five other OAS directors   Pinheiro was sentenced last year by judge Sergio Moro to serve 16 years in prison  He and four directors appealed the sentences and are under house arrest  The other director has since died   By the time of Pinheiro s arrest in late 2014  OAS  fortunes were already declining as legal and financial problems multiplied   Revenue growth slowed and the company lost a net 3 5 billion reais that year as banks   scared off by the Car Wash probe   choked off access to credit  The Brazilian currency slumped  raising the cost of servicing dollar debts   Before filing for bankruptcy protection  OAS s debt reached the equivalent of 47 times annual operating earnings  the highest among Brazil s construction and engineering firms  Fitch Ratings data showed   At the Christmas Day meeting  executives Fabio Yonamine  Nathaniel Wendling  Elmar Varj o and Barreto agreed that missing the upcoming dollar debt payment and launching creditor talks would speed up an orderly reorganization  said the source present  According to the source  Yonamine said that without a plan to shed assets  OAS was done  Once they ended the meeting  they rang Mata Pires to inform him of the plan  the source said   Despite owning 90 percent of the company  Mata Pires had not made day to day management decisions at OAS for years and he does not face criminal charges under the Car Wash investigation  But his role was further eroded under the company s restructuring  bankers and lawyers familiar with the process said  He stayed on as chairman but creditors barred him and his sons  Cesar and Antonio Carlos  from having management posts in the company and from earning dividends   Mata Pires and his sons declined to comment   In early 2014  at the height of his success  Mata Pires was worth  1 6 billion  according to Forbes Magazine  Last year  he was dropped from the magazine s list of billionaires  OBSTACLES The group of executives now running OAS   which includes Varj o  Wendling and Barreto   faces key challenges  Among them  finding buyers for  white elephant  assets acquired during the boom years  and fixing the company s reputation   When Brazil won the right to host the 2014 World Cup  Lula pushed for the construction of 12 arenas across Brazil to increase the grandeur of the event and spread the economic benefits  OAS agreed to build the Arena das Dunas stadium in the coastal city of Natal even though executives knew the project would take years to generate adequate returns  said an executive who worked alongside OAS on the sport arena projects  Another decision to expand into shipbuilding  designed to help OAS pick up more contracts with Petr leo Brasileiro SA  SA PETR4   went wrong when oil prices crashed and the state company became the center of the Car Wash probe  OAS has been unable to find investors interested in

93655,315170,PBR,Petrobras  PBR  Q1 Earnings Buoyed By Rising Oil Prices,opinion,"Brazil s state run energy giant Petroleo Brasileiro S A   or Petrobras   NYSE PBR   announced first quarter net income of  2 145 million or 16 cents per share  compared with  1 417 million or 11 cents in the year earlier quarter  Earnings per ADR came in at 32 cents  1 ADR equivalent to 2 shares in the Brazilian market   well ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 19 cents 
Higher oil prices were primarily responsible for the outperformance  which helped Petrobras post its best quarterly earnings in five years 
Importantly  Petrobras generated free cash flows of  4 005 million for the quarter ended Mar 31   positive for the twelfth quarter in a row   reflecting operational improvement and lower investments 
However  free cash flows fell 3  from the year ago period due to the payment associated with a class action lawsuit  Moreover  adjusted EBITDA edged down 1  to  7 914 million 
The troubled national oil company s net operating revenues of  22 958 million was ahead of the year earlier sales of  21 737 million but was shy of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  25 751 million amid lower production 
Upstream
The Rio de Janeiro headquartered company s total oil and gas production during the first quarter reached 2 680 thousand oil equivalent barrels per day  MBOE d    80  liquids   down from 2 805 MBOE d in the same period of 2017  Compared with the first quarter of 2017  Brazilian oil and natural gas production   constituting 96  of the overall output   decreased 4  to 2 582 MBOE d 
However  the fall in production was more than offset by higher oil realizations  the result being a healthy improvement in Petrobras  upstream segment profit   from  2 067 million in the year earlier quarter to  3 556 million 
Specifically  the average sales price of oil in Brazil jumped 23  from the year earlier period to  62 27 per barrel 
Downstream
During the first quarter  Petrobras  downstream unit earned  1 291 million  down 27  from the year earlier quarter figure of  1 291 million  The underperformance reflects lower diesel and gasoline margins due to a rise in their input costs with increase in oil prices  plus lower domestic oil products sales volume 
Costs
During the quarter  Petrobras  general and administrative expenses stood at  660 million as against  733 million in the year ago period  Meanwhile  selling expenses rose by 68  to  1 273 million 
Capital Spending   Balance Sheet
During the three months ended Mar 31  2018  Petrobras  capital investments and expenditures totaled  3 067 million  lower than the  3 672 million incurred in the year ago period 
This allowed the world s most indebted oil company to trim its massive debt load  At the end of the quarter  the company had net debt of  81 447 million  decreasing from the  84 871 million as of Dec 31  2017  Net debt to capitalization ratio during the same period was approximately 49   down from 51  three months ago  Additionally  Petrobras finished the first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of  19 966 million 
Zacks Rank   Stock Picks
Petrobras currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   implying that it is expected to perform in line with the broader U S  equity market over the next one to three months 
Meanwhile  one can look at better ranked energy players like BP plc   NYSE BP    Wildhorse Resource Development   NYSE WRD   and CVR Refining  LP   NYSE CVRR    All are Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  stocks  You can see  
BP is one of the largest publicly traded oil and gas companies in the world  This London headquartered company s expected EPS growth rate for 3 to 5 years currently stands at 8 70   comparing favorably with the  growth rate of 5 50  
Wildhorse is a company focused on the acquisition  development  exploration and operation of unconventional  onshore oil and gas properties in the northeastern end of the Eagle Ford Play in South Texas  The 2018 Zacks Consensus Estimate for this Houston  TX based company is  1 67  representing some 288 4  earnings per share growth over 2017  Next year s average forecast is  2 19  pointing to another 31 4  growth 
CVR Refining is an independent downstream energy partnership with refining and associated logistics properties in the Midcontinent United States  Over 30 days  the Sugar Land  TX based company has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 and 2019 increase 61 2  and 29 2   to  2 08 and  1 68 per share  respectively

93656,315171,PBR,Oil   Gas Stock Roundup  Occidental  Cheniere   Petrobras  Earnings Impress,opinion,"It was a week where oil prices ended above  70 a barrel and natural gas futures got a lift from the U S  supply data 
On the news front  energy biggies Occidental Petroleum Corp    NYSE OXY    Cheniere Energy  Inc    NYSE LNG   and Petrobras   NYSE PBR   came up with strong earnings reports 
Overall  it was a good week for the sector  West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude futures gained about 1 4  to close at  70 70 per barrel  while natural gas prices rose some 3 5  to  2 806 per million Btu  MMBtu    See the last  Oil   Gas Stock Roundup  here   
The U S  oil benchmark hit a new three and a half year high last week on bullish EIA inventory numbers and a looming drop in Iranian crude exports 
The federal government s EIA report revealed that crude stockpiles recorded a fall of 2 2 million barrels  the first increase in three weeks  and significantly larger than expected  On a further bullish note  the report revealed that refined product inventories  gasoline and distillate  both dropped from their week earlier levels 
The commodity was also supported by President Trump s recent withdrawal from a nuclear deal with OPEC s third largest producer Iran and a pledge to reimpose sanctions on Tehran  The action has stoked worries about an expected cut in Iranian oil exports by around 1 million barrels per day from current levels and lead to a supply shortage in an already  tight  oil market 
Natural gas prices also moved northward last week following a smaller than expected increase in supplies  Stockpiles held in underground storage in the lower 48 states rose by 89 billion cubic feet  Bcf  for the week ended May 4  below the guidance  of 92 Bcf gain  as per the analysts surveyed by S P Global Platts  a leading independent commodities and energy data provider

29 6   The Zacks Rank  2  Buy  company s outperformance was owing to improvement in worldwide sales volume and realized price of oil and natural gas liquids  You can see  Occidental Petroleum s average daily net oil  liquids and gas production volume increased to 609 000 barrels of oil equivalents per day  BOE d  from 584 000 boe d reported in the year ago quarter  This increase could be attributed to increased drilling activity and well productivity in the Permian Resources region  Realized prices for crude oil in the first quarter increased 24 5  year over year to  61 04 per barrel worldwide  while realized NGL prices increased 17 4  Occidental Petroleum expects second quarter production to be in the range of 628 000 648 000 BOE d and Permian Resources production within 188 000 198 000 BOE d  The company expects 2018 production between 645 000 and 665 000 BOE d  up from the prior expected range of 640 000 665 000 BOE d  Occidental expects 2018 Permian Resources production in the range of 198 000 210 000 BOE d  up from the prior guidance of 195 000 209 000 BOE d   Read more  2     U S  gas exporter Cheniere Energy reported strong first quarter results on robust production

the company shipped 67 cargoes from Sabine Pass liquefied natural gas terminal in Louisiana  Total volumes lifted in the reported quarter were 244 trillion British thermal units Overall costs and expenses soared 79  to  1 495 million from the same quarter last year  The increase is mainly attributed to the higher cost of sales which jumped to  1 178 million compared with  624 million in the

93657,315172,PBR,PBR Down After Slashing Fuel Prices  More Downside Ahead,opinion,"Brazilian state led oil company Petroleo Brasileiro Petrobras  NYSE PBR  traded 13  lower on Thursday morning  after the company temporarily lowered diesel prices by 10  late on Wednesday 
Petrobras CEO Pedro Parente called the cuts  an exceptional measure   noting that they would remain in place for only 15 days  The decision  which is estimated to cost  96 million  may have been made in part to ensure delivery of this year s crop of soybeans  Policymakers are working on crafting a stable agreement with officials from the Brazilian Association of Truck Drivers 
The cuts follow as many as 300 000 truck drivers protesting the high fuel prices since Monday of this week  The drivers complained that fuel prices had increased 16  in the last 12 months  They protested in 17 provinces  sometimes setting up blockades on highways  Fuel costs represent 42  of the operating costs for the average Brazilian truck driver 
Looking at the PBR chart below  our analysis is that the price has broken but is still hovering around the low set at the beginning of its current market cycle  Once this happens  there is a risk that the stock will continue to fall for the remainder of the cycle  As such  our target is near  12 by sometime in August ",2018-05-24,Steve Miller,https://www.investing.com/analysis/pbr-down-13-after-slashing-fuel-prices--likely-more-downside-ahead-200319061,200319061
93658,315173,PBR,Emerging Markets  What Now ,opinion,"The Emerging Markets ended a 10 year bear market in Q1  16  as the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF  NYSE EEM   peaked in the  55 area in October  2007  the Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF  NYSE VWO peaked near  58 in November 2007  where both bottomed in Q1  16 near  30 per share 
It was the China yuan devaluation in the summer of 2015  and then the bottoming of crude oil near  29 per share in early  16 that drove the last downward spiral in the Emerging Market asset class 
Since that bottom in Q1  16  the EEM is up about 47  while the VWO is up 43   using Morningstar performance data   2017 was a monster year for both ETFs as both outperformed large cap Tech and Growth  generating mid 30  total returns for 2017 
In 2018 YTD as of late May  18  both the EEM and the VWO are flat in terms of returns  So what now  
The Emerging Market economies and I have tough time believing that China is an  emerging market  when it is currently the world s 2nd largest economy comprise roughly 15  of global GDP  Does that mean EM s should constitute 15  of a well diversified equity allocation within a client s account  Client s current EM weighting is roughly 3  to 7  of accounts  depending on the client  and that will likely be increased over time 
After the 1980 s and 1990 s bull market ended in the early 2000 s  investors saw a mad rush into everything that didn t work in the 1990 s like Emerging Markets  like commodities  like gold  like deep value  many of which were commodity names   and Emerging Markets performed very well for the period from 2001 through late 2007  certainly far better than the Tech heavy S P 500 
Essentially  growth  became value and value  growth  once the 1990 s bull market ended  and much of this was due to the emergence of China  And then EM s didn t  work well  from late 2007 through the first quarter  2016 
EM s were never owned for clients until Q1  16 to avoid making the same mistake with the EM s and the commodity names as was done with Tech and Financials in the late 1990 s 


Conclusion  the two charts above are the iShares MSCI Brazil Capped ETF  NYSE EWZ   and the EEM  Brazil was owned off the Q1  16 low since it was the poster child for anything that was crushed at that time including energy exposure  Petrobras  NYSE PBR  was one of the top holdings of the ETF  as well as some banks   weak currency  commodity based economy  not to mention a government that seems constantly under indictment  from Rousseff  to Lula to Temer 
The ETF has pulled back to long term support at the 200 week moving average  If readers are disposed to some risk with Emerging Markets  Brazil is in a lower risk buy area per the first chart from Gary Morrow   The EWZ hasn t yet been bought for any accounts but it could be by the end of June  
The EEM and VWO are pretty similar EM ETFs and I am hoping both pull back to the low  40 s to add to accounts 
The strong dollar is a reason given for the weakness in 2018  but the EM ETFs actually seem somewhat correlated to the S P 500 since the lows in Q1  16 
The while point of this post was to show that relative to the secular bull market in US equities which started in either March of 2009  with the lows near 670  or the new S P 500 all time high in April May  2013 the  Emerging Market  bull market is just 2 years old  Granted there is more risk within these economies  but the fact is the major 10 year lows just occurred in the first quarter  2016 ",2018-06-03,Brian Gilmartin,https://www.investing.com/analysis/emerging-markets--what-now--200321583,200321583
93659,315174,PBR,Petrobras  PBR  Thrown Into Disarray On CEO Parente s Exit ,opinion,"Petr leo Brasileiro S A  or Petrobras s   NYSE PBR   shares have declined more than 20  in the mid day trading to eventually close at  10 13  14 6  down  on Jun 1  after the company s CEO Pedro Parente stepped down from his position  Following his resignation  the Brazilian real also weakened against the dollar  sparking fear over the country s economy  The CEO s resignation came in the wake of the nationwide trucker strike in Brazil  which had strangled the country s economy for more than a week Why Did Parente Quit From 2011 to 2016  while Petrobras  policy to offer fuel subsidies to its consumers helped to keep Brazil s inflation in check  it also caused the company to bear severe losses and limit its long term prospects  However  with Parente taking charge as its CEO from May 2016  the subsidies got lifted and the company adopted new free market fuel policy that followed international markets closely  and helped Petrobras to operate more efficiently Though this market based fuel pricing policy helped the company restore its financial credibility and was appreciated by the investors  it was highly criticized by the truck drivers of late  especially in the light of the rising global oil prices  The global oil price rise led to an increase in the fuel prices in Brazil  creating discontent among the consumers 
This spurred a nation wide strike against the diesel prices by the lorry drivers in the country since May 21  2018  leading to huge disruption and major shortages of products from food to gasoline  The strike paralyzed the transportation and logistics of the country  creating serious problems for various services and industries In an attempt to resolve the truckers  strike in Brazil  the government intervened on May 23 to temporarily lower diesel prices at the pump by 10  along with freezing the prices for 60 days   Parente believed that the strike had challenged the implemented pricing policy  which is depicted in a statement during his resignation  Per the statement  his role  as CEO had stopped being positive and the government needed to consider alternatives to its pricing policy going forward  While the trucker representatives have consented to put an end to the strike  Petrobras  pricing policy is under immense scrutiny now and it s a wait and watch story whether or not the company will be allowed to resume its policy of benchmarking international oil prices Notably over the past two weeks  the company s shares have tumbled about 30   as the shareholders feared state intervention in the company s policies  which could put an end to the recent more profitable investor focused policies Parente Credited with Petrobras  TurnaroundParente took the help of Brazilian oil giant  Moody s in May 2016  which was grappling with huge debt levels  mismanagement and money laundering scandals  In Feb 2015  Petrobras lost its investment grade at Moody s due to severe corruption charges against the company 
Many of the company s officials were arrested as part of the Operation Car Wash investigation  The bribery scandal also resulted in the imprisonment of the former President of Brazil  Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva  In February 2016  the company was downgraded to the lowest speculative level With Parente taking over  he made laudable efforts to breathe new life to the company  leading Moody s to upgrade the company s ratings to B2 in October 2016  courtesy of debt refinancing transactions and disciplined operational management Parente focused on shifting the state controlled company s strategy away from the government interests  toward more free market policies and business oriented strategies  Parente s leadership helped the company adopt new profitable fuel pricing policy  allowing the market to decide on the prices of fuel  thus boosting the margins of the company Under the leadership of Parente  the world s most indebted oil company began making successful attempts to trim its debt load and achieve operational efficiencies  At the end of the first quarter of 2018  Petrobras  net debt stood at  81 447 million  depicting a significant decrease from  96 381 million as of Dec 31  2016  In fact  Petrobras generated free cash flow of  13 850 million last year   up 12  year over year   reflecting operational improvement and lower investments  Notably  in the last reported quarter  the company reported its highest quarterly profit in the last five years Parente s aggressive asset sale programs have also been much appreciated  The company s divestment program of  21 billion throughout 2017 2018 is expected to support debt reduction  His focus on Brazil s pre salt reservoirs to boost the production profile of the company boded well  During his tenure  Petrobras inked deals with major players like TOTAL S A    NYSE TOT    Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa  plc  and Statoil ASA   AX STO   to drive its exploration momentum His successful turnaround strategies helped the company reinvigorate  with its shares rising more than 71  in the past two years  outperforming the broader industry s rally of 56  

What Lies Ahead Ivan Monteiro will be serving as the interim CEO after Parente s resignation  Monteiro has been the CFO of Petrobras since 2015  supervising the company s successful debt reduction attempts  He had also led the initial public offering of the company s fuel distribution unit  Petrobras Distribuidora S A  that managed to raise  1 5 billion The departure of Parente has definitely raised speculations that the country may resort back to its old fuel pricing of subsidies that may again hamper the Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company s growth and economy   You can see

93682,315197,PBR,Brazil s Temer denies alleged link to Petrobras scandal,news,"By Lisandra Paraguassu BRASILIA  Reuters    Brazil s interim President Michel Temer denied on Wednesday allegations that he sought campaign funds for his party stemming from a graft scheme at state oil company Petrobras  SA PETR4   implicating him in the country s biggest ever corruption scandal  A plea deal by former Petrobras executive Sergio Machado  made public by the Supreme Court on Wednesday  said a campaign contribution requested by Temer was made legally by engineering group Queiroz Galvao but resulted from a kickback on contracts with Petrobras  The testimony is the first to link Temer to the Petrobras investigation  known as  Operation Car Wash   Dozens of executives and politicians have been jailed due to the probe into the scandal  which has added to Brazil s worst recession in decades   Temer s office denied that he had solicited illegal contributions from Machado  adding that he had always followed campaign finance laws  The allegations threatened to further unsettle Temer s month old  center right coalition  Two ministers already resigned after leaked recordings in Machado s plea bargain deal suggested they favored interfering in the investigation   News of the allegations overshadowed the announcement of a constitutional amendment to cap the growth of public spending for up to 20 years  a flagship economic initiative by the one month old Temer government and the most important fiscal policy shift in decades  Brazil s currency  BRBY  swung sharply  losing value against the dollar before recovering after the U S  Federal Reserve s decision to leave interest rates unchanged  Temer was vice president until May  when President Dilma Rousseff was suspended from office to face trial in the Senate on charges of breaking budget laws  Leaked testimony in recent weeks disclosed that Machado  a retired senator and former head of Petrobras  Transpetro shipping and natural gas transportation unit  told prosecutors Senate President Renan Calheiros and former Planning Minister Romero Juca planned to obstruct the investigation once Temer took office  The plea bargain documents made public on Wednesday revealed the first formal accusations against Temer himself  In particular  Machado s testimony describes a meeting with Temer at an air base in the capital Brasilia in late 2012  a tough period for the Sao Paulo mayoral campaign run by Gabriel Chalita of Temer s Brazilian Democratic Movement Party  PMDB    The context of the conversation made clear that what Michel Temer was arranging with  Machado  was for him to solicit illegal funds from companies that had contracts with Transpetro in the form of official donations   he said in signed testimony  The mounting accusations against Temer and his government have rattled his congressional coalition  threatening to shake loose key swing votes in the trial against Rousseff  which is expected to confirm her removal in mid August  As many as a dozen of the 55 senators who voted last month to put Rousseff on trial are now undecided  according to surveys by Brazilian media  If just a couple of them change sides  the Temer camp would lose the 54 votes it needs   two thirds of the 81 seat Senate   to convict Rousseff   The fact that Machado said Temer had asked for a legal donation reduces the damage of the allegations and should not impact voting in the impeachment trial  according to the ARKO Advice consultancy  which puts the odds of the Senate confirming Temer as president at 90 percent   It is extremely uncomfortable for Temer  but far from fatal  since the senators will be voting between Dilma and Temer  and in this comparison  Temer still beats Dilma   said Arko partner Lucas de Arag o  Brazil s political establishment is holding its breath as suspended House Speaker Eduardo Cunha  also of the PMDB  comes closer to losing his seat after a congressional ethics committee voted on Tuesday to oust him   If Cunha leaves office  he will lose the partial immunity enjoyed by elected politicians  allowing him to be prosecuted by lower courts in several corruption cases brought against him and opening the possibility of another blockbuster plea bargain  Machado said in the plea deal that during his tenure at Transpetro  the PMDB received some 100 million reais   29 million  in political kickbacks from Petrobras contractors

93683,315198,PBR,Brazil prosecutor calls talk about Odebrecht plea deal  bewildering ,news,"By Brad Brooks CURITIBA  Brazil  Reuters    For weeks  his possible earth shattering testimony in Brazil s biggest corruption scandal has been the talk of the nation  filling endless pages in newspapers and magazines  Breathless reports stated that Marcelo Odebrecht  the former chief executive of Latin America s largest construction firm  was on the cusp of turning state s witness  and he would deliver the biggest catch of all   a confession of funneling millions in illegal campaign donations to suspended President Dilma Rousseff  There is just one problem  said Carlos Lima  a lead prosecutor in the sprawling kickback probe at state run oil company Petrobras  SA PETR4   None of the above is true   Marcelo Odebrecht has never said a word to us  he has not spoken with a single prosecutor   Lima told Reuters from his office in the southern city of Curitiba   It s bewildering  these stories I m reading  saying that Marcelo has reached some deal with prosecutors  He s not even close   Rousseff  who has denied any wrongdoing  faces impeachment in a separate Senate trial for allegedly breaking budget rules to help win re election  She has not been accused of personal corruption  but Brazil s chief prosecutor has asked the Supreme Court for permission to investigate her for trying to obstruct the Petrobras probe   The two year graft investigation into Petrobras is the driving force behind Brazil s political turbulence  It has seen scores of top executives and politicians jailed amid allegations that billions were paid in bribes and stoked popular anger at Brazil s ruling class   At the center of it all lies Odebrecht  a firm that spans 15 divisions spread across two dozen countries and has 130 000 employees  It is responsible for most of the building behind the Olympics that will start this August in Rio de Janeiro  If the firm s executives decide to tell all  few doubt that little of the political establishment will be left standing  Many senior politicians were named in documents seized at the company s offices as apparently receiving bribes   Lima said he does not know who is responsible for all the false reports about Marcelo Odebrecht   I think it is from people who are trying to both help and hurt him  those who may be exposed by any testimony he might actually give    That significantly ratchets up the intrigue surrounding the once all powerful head of the Odebrecht firm  now serving over 19 years in jail on corruption convictions   Either someone is trying to force an accord on us  which simply will not work   Lima said   Or  even more duplicitous  somebody is releasing false information in the hope that it would destroy any accord  in the hope that Marcelo stays silent   A spokeswoman for the Odebrecht firm  who refused to say who is legally representing Marcelo Odebrecht  said in an email the company had no comment on Lima s remarks  Since his June 2015 arrest  the bespectacled  wiry Odebrecht  who turned his family s company into Brazil s largest employer and one of the top five private sector groups  has maintained a defiant stance   Before his conviction  he told a congressional panel that as a parent  he would be more upset with one of his children who tattled on the other  than the one who may have been up to mischief   indicating he would never be a rat  But last August  his father  Emilio  former head of the conglomerate  reportedly told his son to testify so the company could minimize its financial losses   Then in March  investigators said that in an Odebrecht raid they found a spreadsheet containing the names of over 300 public officials and others plus amounts of money paid to them  totaling tens of millions of dollars  It is not yet known how much of that may have been bribes or legal campaign contributions   On that news  the firm announced it was ready to cooperate with prosecutors   In addition to plea deals with individuals  federal prosecutors have separately signed five leniency deals with companies for lighter sentences in return for information  They have not identified the companies  but Odebrecht is not among them  Lima acknowledged that Odebrecht could possibly provide the most information  given the size of the company and its deep ties to politicians  But he also said it was not certain that any request for a leniency deal from Odebrecht would be approved  
 We have one space left  there is only one company remaining that will be awarded a leniency deal with us   he said   Maybe it s Odebrecht  maybe it s not  It depends entirely on who brings us new and substantiated information that we can use  ",2016-06-23,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/brazil-prosecutor-calls-talk-about-odebrecht-plea-deal-'bewildering'-410251,410251

93687,315202,PBR,Petrobras  PBR  To Report Q4 Earnings  What s In Store ,opinion,Petr leo Brasileiro S A  or Petrobras   NYSE PBR   is set to release fourth quarter 2017 results after the closing bell on Mar 20 In the preceding three month period  the Rio de Janeiro headquartered integrated player reported a negative earnings surprise of 80 00   Judicial contingency provisions  payments on account of a tax agreement with Brazil s government  weak domestic demand and lower margin at its downstream unit affected the Brazilian state run energy giant last quarter Petrobras has a mixed earnings surprise history  It has topped estimates in two of the last four quarters  However  the company posted an average positive earnings surprise of 23 16  in the aforesaid period  Petroleo Brasileiro S A   Petrobras Price and EPS Surprise     Which Way are Estimates Treading Let s look at the estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company before earnings release The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for the to be reported quarter has been revised downward by 13 cents over the last 30 days  It reflects a decline of almost 14 3  from the year ago quarter However  analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of  26 321 million for the quarter  up 23  from the prior year quarter Factors at PlayPrices of oil at the end of the fourth quarter were  60 46 per barrel  up about 12 5  and 19 6  year over year and sequentially  respectively  Improving energy landscape is attributed to tightening supplies  brighter demand outlook and OPEC deal extension talks  The upstream segment of the company is poised to benefit from recovering commodity prices Petrobras is likely to witness output gains on the back of its encouraging portfolio of investments  particularly in Brazil s pre salt reservoirs  In fact  Petrobras released an output update in January 2018  wherein it announced the production of 2 15 million barrels per day  bpd  of oil in 2017  higher than 2016 s volumes  Notably  in the pre salt layer  its average annual production witnessed a 26  year over year increase  driven by Santos Basin s Lapa and Lula fields  Further  its strategic partnership with foreign oil giants including TOTAL S A    NYSE TOT    Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa  plc  and Statoil  OL STL  ASA   NYSE STO   is expected to drive its exploration momentum The company s cost cut initiatives and aggressive divestment of non core holdings  in order to revive its financial health  also bode well However  while the company has been making serious efforts to trim its leverage metrics  one can t deny the fact that its involvement in the Operation Carwash scandal has been a major overhang for the company  which scarred its credit metrics and turned it into the world s most indebted oil company  Though the company s rating is gradually improving  it is still two levels away from the investment grade ratings Notably  in January 2018  Petrobras agreed to pay  2 95 billion to settle class action lawsuits filed by investors and put to rest one of the Brazil s most notorious cases of fraud  The settlement will be reflected in the company s fourth quarter 2017 results  putting a dent in the earnings As such  though we believe that the company will benefit from pricing and production gains  the huge payout relating to corruption charges  along with its massive debt are likely to play a spoilsport Earnings WhispersOur proven model too does not conclusively show that Petrobras will beat estimates this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  to be able to beat estimates  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our   That is not the case here as you will see below Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is  43 40   This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 10 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at 18 cents Zacks Rank  Petrobras carries a Zacks Rank  3  You can see   Though a Zacks Rank  3 increases the predictive power of ESP  the negative ESP makes a surprise prediction difficult Conversely  we caution against Sell rated stocks  Zacks Ranks  4 and 5  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions Breaking News  Cryptocurrencies Now Bigger than VisaThe total market cap of all cryptos recently surpassed  700 billion   more than a 3 800  increase in the previous 12 months  They re now bigger than Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS   Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  and even Visa  The new asset class may expand even more rapidly in

93705,315220,PBR,Brazil Senate debates impeachment trial as Rousseff s removal looms,news,"By Lisandra Paraguassu and Anthony Boadle BRASILIA  Reuters    The Supreme Court rebuffed a last ditch bid by President Dilma Rousseff to halt a vote in the Senate on Wednesday that is expected to put her on trial for breaking budget laws and end 13 years of leftist rule in Latin America s biggest country  If her opponents garner a simple majority in the 81 seat Senate in a session that will last late into the evening  Rousseff will be replaced on Thursday by Vice President Michel Temer as acting president for up to six months during the trial  There were signs Rousseff was preparing for defeat  she plans to dismiss all her cabinet and has given instructions that there should be no easy transition for a Temer government because she considers her impeachment illegal  presidential aides said   With a change of government imminent  Temer plans to swear in new ministers on Thursday afternoon  Senator Romero Juc   head of his Brazilian Democratic Movement Party  PMDB   told reporters   Rousseff  who has been in office since 2011  has seen her popularity crushed by Brazil s worst recession since the 1930s and a two year probe into a vast kickback scheme at state run oil company Petrobras  SA PETR4   The prospect of business friendly Temer taking power has driven Brazilian financial markets sharply higher this year  on hopes he could cut a massive fiscal deficit  restore investor confidence and return the economy to growth  The political crisis has deepened Brazil s recession and comes at a time when Brazil hoped to be shining on the world stage as it prepares to host the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro in August  A Supreme Court judge denied an injunction Rousseff sought on Tuesday to halt the Senate vote  Justice Teori Zavascki rejected as  legally implausible  the government s argument that impeachment was flawed because it was started out of revenge by the former speaker of the lower house  In a momentous session followed by many Brazilians live on television  each senator was given the chance to speak  A final vote could take place after midnight  11 p m  ET on Thursday   Brasilia based consultancy ARKO Advice projected that the upper chamber would vote 57 21 to try Rousseff  The figure amounted to 78 votes rather than 81 due to absences and abstentions  That would indicate Rousseff s opponents may already have the two thirds of the vote needed to convict her at the end of the trial and remove her definitively from office  If that happened  Temer would then fulfill the remainder of her mandate until elections in 2018  Rousseff  68  was chairwoman of Petrobras at the time when much of the graft occurred  but she has not been accused of corruption  She stands charged with manipulating government accounts to disguise the size of Brazil s fiscal deficit to allow her to boost public spending during her 2014 re election campaign  a practice employed by previous presidents   The president s plan to dismiss all her cabinet if and when the Senate suspends her will force Temer to hit the ground running  since he was counting on a gradual transition to a new cabinet  Two Rousseff aides said  however  that the dismissal of her cabinet would exclude Central Bank Governor Alexandre Tombini  and the current sports minister  who is scrambling to prepare for the Rio 2016 games   TIME FOR HER TO GO  Senate leader Renan Calheiros  of Temer s PMDB party  said he would not vote to remain neutral  But he was already using the past tense to refer to Rousseff s presidency    Temer needs the backing of Congress to carry out deep reforms  above all reform of the political system  if he becomes president   he told reporters   Opinion polls show an overwhelming majority of Brazilians want to see Rousseff impeached  But the surveys also indicate scant popular support for the 75 year old Temer   I voted for Dilma  I believe in her as a leader  but I also think she has done such a bad job that it is time for her to go   said Leticia Britto  a 23 year old business student from Sao Paulo  visiting Brasilia   The best way forward would be to call for new elections   Leaning toward a liberal economic policy  Temer has picked former central bank chief Henrique Meirelles to be finance minister and Itau Unibanco s chief economist Ilan Goldfajn as head of the central bank   Temer may enjoy a honeymoon with markets for some weeks  maybe months  but when investors come to realize that the fiscal results will not improve fast enough  then we could see some disappointment later this year   said Bruno Lavieri  an economist with consultancy 4E  in Sao Paulo  DENOUNCING A  COUP  Rousseff  the first woman to lead Brazil  has denied committing any crime that warrants impeachment charges  A former member of a Marxist guerilla group who was tortured during Brazil s 1964 1985 military dictatorship  she has called her impeachment a  coup  and vowed to fight the process until the last minute   I will not resign  that never crossed my mind   Rousseff said in a speech on Tuesday  to cheers from supporters  There are worries that the tense political situation may spark protests that could turn violent after anti impeachment protesters blocked roads with burning tires in several cities on Tuesday  Rousseff s Workers Party and labor unions have called for a national strike  Rousseff s stance that democracy is under attack has won sympathy among some of Brazil s leftist neighbors  The U S  government said it hoped the country pulls through the crisis   Brazil is under some scrutiny and under some pressure   White House spokesman Josh Earnest said in Washington   We continue to have confidence in the mature  durable democratic institutions in Brazil to withstand the challenge   Pope Francis  in his general audience on Wednesday at the Vatican  said he was praying for harmony and peace in this  time of difficulty  for Brazil  
The last time a Brazilian president was suspended from office was in 1992  when President Fernando Collor de Mello was placed on trial for corruption  He resigned from office shortly before he was found guilty by the Senate ",2016-05-11,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/brazil-senate-set-to-vote-on-rousseff-impeachment-401210,401210

93709,315224,PBR,Exclusive  Brazil s central bank closely monitoring nine banks   document,news,"By Marcela Ayres BRASILIA  Reuters    Brazil s central bank has placed nine banks under  special surveillance  and is closely monitoring the liquidity and stability of their operations  according to an undated internal bank document reviewed by Reuters   The document  labeled as a presentation prepared for a May 19 meeting of the central bank s financial stability committee  which coordinates regulation of the banking system  says the small banks under surveillance include Banif  Maxima  Ficsa  Gerador  Pottencial  BPN Brasil  Mercantil do Brasil  and Pan  SA BPAN4    The heightened scrutiny reflects regulators  concerns  outlined in the document  that excessive leverage  recurring losses  tough to sell assets or reputational risks could eventually threaten the lenders  stability   The list also includes BTG Pactual  SA BBTG11   Latin America s largest investment bank  which was plunged into turmoil by the arrest of its founder Andres Esteves in November in a corruption probe  Esteves has since been released and the bank has implemented a recovery program   The institutions under surveillance have little or no presence in the retail banking market and are focused instead on niche markets such as mortgages  payroll lending and mid cap corporate loans   Still  the close monitoring and  in some cases  limits on new lending and dividends  reflect regulators  determination to keep the Brazilian banking system well capitalized as the worst downturn in decades tightens credit and increases defaults   A spokesman for the central bank said in a statement that  due to secrecy rules and in line with its governance guidelines  the central bank will not make any public comments on the situation of financial institutions    The central bank spokesman declined to answer questions about the document reviewed by Reuters  Told of its contents  he said  without providing specifics  that the information was  incomplete  out of context and included elements that did not correspond to reality    Several banks named in the document confirmed they had been in touch with the central bank  addressing its concerns and strengthening their balance sheets through asset sales  improved lending practices or  in one instance  the sale of the bank  Other lenders declined to comment   Close surveillance by the central bank does not mean that a bank s solvency is in question  according to a former central bank official familiar with the surveillance regime  The regulatory presentation itself distinguishes between three ascending  levels of concern  color coded yellow  orange and red  without spelling out specific criteria for each category   The former central bank official  who spoke on the condition of anonymity  said that having more than  a half dozen  banks on the list was worrying   There are always banks under surveillance and you would expect the list to grow in an economic recession   the former official added   The chances of getting off the list easily also depend on the economy    Together  the nine institutions group just 2 6 percent of the loans in Brazil s financial system  according to December central bank data   Despite a contraction of 3 8 percent in Latin America s largest economy last year  Brazil s banking system has remained robust  The 130 banks in Brazil saw their return on equity rise to 15 4 percent last year  from 13 0 percent in 2014   While data shows non performing loans increasing this year  the average regulatory capital level for Brazilian banks stands at 16 3 percent  according to central bank data  comfortably above the global benchmark of 8 percent under Basel rules    UNDER CONTROL   The Brazilian unit of Madeira based bank Banif was the only bank in the document listed in the red category corresponding to the highest  level of concern   Portuguese authorities undertook a 2 2 billion euro bailout of its parent bank in December   Brazil s central bank stepped in to demand a recovery plan from Banif earlier this year after observing problems with its balance sheet  strain on its cash flow and a reliance on illiquid assets such as real estate  the presentation said   Banif told Reuters in a statement that its situation was  absolutely under control   with indicators inside regulatory norms and a restructuring process almost complete   The central bank report indicated three small banks   Maxima  Ficsa and Gerador   raised a secondary  level of concern   labeled orange in the presentation  A table in the document showed those were the only three banks under surveillance whose capital levels late last year fell short of the 11 percent minimum regulatory capital ratio established under Brazil s Basel regulations   The document also said that Maxima lent money without observing principles of  selectivity  liquidity and guarantees   but did not elaborate   In a statement to Reuters  Maxima said the central bank s questions about loans had been clarified and resolved  Maxima said its decision to focus exclusively on real estate lending in recent years has affected its results but its loan book was showing improvement and its Basel capital ratio improved to 12 79 percent in February   In the case of Gerador  the central bank document flagged  deteriorating equity  resulting in the violation of various operating limits    Gerador s Chairman Paulo Macedo told Reuters that shareholders had decided to sell the bank and were working transparently with the central bank so depositors did not suffer any losses   Brazilian lender Agiplan agreed to buy Gerador this month with plans to inject 80 million reais and rename it Banco Agiplan once the acquisition was approved by the central bank   FREEZING SALARIES  Ficsa was one of three banks in the document where the central bank had applied  preventive prudential measures   a term for regulators  discretionary limits on banking operations  which were not specified in Ficsa s case   Ficsa has been deleveraging since it suspended operations in 2012  the bank said in a statement  adding that its partners were  open to a possible opportunity to sell    The central bank also applied  preventive prudential measures  to Banif and BTG Pactual  including the suspension of executive pay raises  bonuses and dividends beyond minimum legal limits  according to the report  None of the three banks commented on the measures   BTG Pactual  along with Pan  Pottencial  Mercantil do Brasil and BPN Brasil  were covered under the lowest  level of concern  in the presentation   The report on BTG Pactual focused on withdrawals by investors after Esteves  arrest in a sweeping corruption probe stemming from state run oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA  SA PETR4    Esteves was released from house arrest in late April and has returned to Latin America s largest investment bank as a senior partner advising on strategic issues  BTG Pactual has been executing a plan to improve its liquidity  including the sale of credit portfolios and stakes in companies   
BTG Pactual and BPN declined to comment on the central bank surveillance described in the report  Pottencial did not respond to questions on the matter  Pan and Mercantil said their business models were solid  Mercantil added that its business was expanding  with plans to open 20 new branches this year ",2016-05-18,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/exclusive:-brazil's-central-bank-closely-monitoring-nine-banks---document-402912,402912

executives  Carlos Lima said the probe into corruption on projects for the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro in August was not limited to Porto Maravilha  or the  Marvelous Port   a regeneration of the city s waterfront that includes five high rises bearing the name of U S  property mogul and presidential candidate Donald Trump    There are more   Lima said in an interview in his office in the southern city of Curitiba on Monday   There are leniency agreements underway that talk about this  but until they are finalized we will not know how many  projects  for sure   Lima is a lead prosecutor on a task force that discovered a cartel of engineering firms siphoning kickbacks from state oil firm Petrobras  SA PETR4  to political parties  a scandal fuelling a crisis that could force President Dilma Rousseff from power  His comments were the clearest indication yet that the Olympics has become a focus of the two year old investigation  The corruption allegations are not expected to hinder work on infrastructure for the Games  which is nearly finished  but they do further cloud an event set to start in the middle of Brazil s worst political and economic crises in decades  The lower house of Brazil s Congress  many of whose members are themselves under investigation for corruption  voted on Sunday to impeach Rousseff on charges she manipulated budget accounts   If the Senate agrees to put her on trial  as seems likely  Rousseff will be suspended for up to six months and would be unlikely to return to power   Five engineering firms are building most of the 39 billion reais   11 billion  worth of venues and infrastructure needed for the Olympics  the first to be held in South America  All five are under investigation for price fixing at Petroleo Brasileiro SA  as Petrobras is formally known  Latin America s largest engineering conglomerate  Odebrecht SA  ODBES UL   which is at the center of the Petrobras scandal  is involved in over half of all Olympic projects by value  according to contracts reviewed by Reuters  Court files made public last month showed police uncovered documents from Odebrecht executives referencing 1 million reais in suspected bribes connected to the Porto Maravilha project and other kickbacks allegedly linked to a Rio metro line  More than 20 corporate developments are planned to revitalize Rio in the downtown Porto Maravilha area   the main legacy project of the Games   including hotels and the five Trump towers  They were announced in 2012 as the largest corporate development in any major emerging nation  Trump only sold naming rights and offered consulting on the high rise project  Lima said the investigation of Porto Maravilha  like other Olympic projects  was now under the jurisdiction of prosecutors in Brasilia   That is because they involve potential kickbacks to sitting politicians  who under Brazilian law can only be judged by the Brasilia based Supreme Court rather than Federal Judge Sergio Moro in Curitiba  The change in jurisdiction will likely slow the investigation  The Supreme Court has a backlog of some 50 politicians to investigate on charges that they received bribes  though Rousseff is not among them    We collaborate  we work together  but the pace of the 13th district is one thing  the Supreme Court is another   said Lima  The prosecutor s office in Brasilia declined to comment   POLITICIANS  WORLD CUP  OLYMPICS Moro and the Curitiba based prosecutors and police are famous across Brazil for swiftly and aggressively handling its largest ever corruption probe  Their investigation has ensnared dozens of top businessmen and was cited by many lawmakers who voted in favor of Rousseff being impeached  Plea bargains and leniency deals  relatively new legal tools in Brazil  have been key to cracking the case and helping investigators find hard evidence  However  defense lawyers and some independent analysts have criticized the use of lengthy pre trial detentions of dozens of suspects  Corruption allegations are now spreading to stadiums built for the 2014 World Cup and the Olympics  two events that were meant to showcase Brazil s rise as a modern global economic power  On March 22  the same day prosecutors publicly accused Odebrecht of graft involving World Cup stadiums and Porto Maravilha  the company said it would seek to collaborate with the investigation and aim for a leniency agreement and plea deals for its executives  The other four companies involved in much of the rest of the Olympic work are OAS SA  OAS UL   Andrade Gutierrez SA  Queiroz Galvao SA  and Carioca Christiani Nielsen Engenharia SA   Odebrecht  Andrade Gutierrez and Queiroz Galvao declined to comment  The other companies did not respond to requests for comment  Lima did not specify which company or companies had mentioned Olympic projects in testimony   The city of Rio de Janeiro is overseeing the bulk of the Olympic construction projects  though a few are financed by the federal or state government and Rio 2016  the local organizing committee  handles some non permanent structures like seating   Rio s city government said the contracts were mostly funded with private resources and that all bids were overseen by regulators  Rio 2016 referred Reuters to City Hall   The International Olympic Committee did not respond to request for comment

93742,315257,PBR,Brazil Supreme Court removes lower house speaker Cunha,news,"By Leonardo Goy and Anthony Boadle BRASILIA  Reuters    Brazil s Supreme Court removed the speaker of the lower house of Congress on Thursday on charges of obstructing a corruption investigation  days before an impeachment process that he engineered was expected to oust President Dilma Rousseff  The removal of Eduardo Cunha  a bitter rival of Rousseff and one of Brazil s most divisive public figures  was the latest in a series of political earthquakes in South America s largest country as it struggles with a sweeping corruption scandal and the worst recession in decades  The Supreme Court voted unanimously to approve a request by Brazil s top prosecutor to strip Cunha of his influential post for allegedly intimidating lawmakers and obstructing an investigation into accusations that he held undeclared bank accounts in Switzerland  Cunha said he would appeal  An evangelical Christian with strong support from the religious right in Congress  Cunha has for months fended off ethics committee hearings in the lower house about whether he lied about the accounts  using every trick in the procedural book  The bespectacled speaker with slicked back hair has remained unflappable  calmly denying prosecutors  accusations he had used the Swiss accounts to stash millions of dollars in bribe money  Cunha is the only sitting lawmaker so far officially charged by the Supreme Court with corruption in the sweeping kickbacks scandal focused on state oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA  commonly known as Petrobras  SA PETR4   Deputy speaker Waldir Maranhao  a member of the Progressive Party who is also being investigated in the Petrobras scandal  became acting head of the lower chamber with Cunha s suspension  As speaker  Cunha stood third in the line of presidential succession and would have become second if the Senate decides next week  as expected  to try Rousseff for alleged budget irregularities  If the Senate puts her on trial  as expected in a vote next Wednesday  she would be immediately suspended from office for up to six months during the trial and replaced by Michel Temer  her 75 year old vice president  Temer is already forming his cabinet  Cunha launched impeachment proceedings against Rousseff in December on charges she broke budget laws  His suspension could have helped Rousseff had it come earlier  Now  it could work against Rousseff by weakening her argument that she is being impeached by corrupt politicians  It may instead help Temer by eliminating a tainted ally with whom the new president would have had to negotiate legislation  A Temer government would desperately need to pass reforms to revive confidence in Brazil s ailing economy and plug a budget deficit that exceeded 10 percent of gross domestic product last year  Fitch Ratings downgraded Brazil s sovereign debt further into junk territory on Thursday  to BB with a negative outlook  citing a very challenging political environment   Temer could inherit the presidency because of a process started by Cunha   said Rafael Cortez  a political analyst with Tendencias  a consultancy in Sao Paulo   Any agreements they would have made could have looked like payback for enabling him to become president     FRANK UNDERWOOD  A wily backroom dealmaker  Cunha has been dubbed the Frank Underwood of Brazilian politics by the country s media  a reference to the ruthless president in  The House of Cards  television series   A familiar voice to many Brazilians as an evangelical radio commentator  Cunha has sparked protests with his plans to tighten abortion rules  More recently  details of lavish spending on foreign trips with his young wife  including classes at a top Miami tennis academy  stirred outrage in the midst of the deep recession   Cunha is accused of taking  5 million in bribes on contracts for two drill ships in the corruption scheme that engulfed Petrobras two years ago   Though Rousseff herself has not been accused of any wrongdoing directly related to the scandal  it has ensnared her allies and raised pressure for her ouster  The leftist president has been fighting for her political survival since the lower house commanded by Cunha voted on April 17 to charge her with manipulating government accounts  Her opponents say this allowed her to boost public spending before her 2014 re election  Rousseff denies any wrongdoing and has accused Temer of orchestrating a  coup  to end 13 years of Workers Party rule  She has accused Cunha of starting the impeachment proceedings against her because the Workers Party did not help him avoid the ethics probe   It s a clear abuse of power  He used his position for revenge   Rousseff said  Cunha said he hoped she will be convicted by the Senate   On Wednesday we will be able to say  better late than never  that Brazil will be free of the Workers Party   he told reporters  Should Temer become president  Senate leader Renan Calheiros  another politician who is under investigation for corruption  would become the next in line to lead the nation

93746,315261,PBR,Brazil s Rousseff makes final survival bid as Senate poised to oust her,news,"By Lisandra Paraguassu and Anthony Boadle BRASILIA  Reuters    Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff took her battle to survive impeachment to the country s Supreme Court on Tuesday  in a last ditch attempt to stay in office a day before the Senate will likely vote to put her on trial for breaking budget laws  Attorney General Eduardo Cardozo  the government s top lawyer  asked the Supreme Court to annul impeachment proceedings arguing they were politically motivated and had no legal basis   I will not resign  that never crossed my mind   Rousseff said in a speech to a conference hall full of women supporters who cheered when she vowed to keep fighting her removal from office  But the leftist leader appeared resigned to leaving the presidency after a Senate vote on Wednesday that is expected to suspend her  pending trial  In her office at the modernistic Planalto presidential palace in the capital  Brasilia  aides had already packed up her papers and cleared the shelves  The political crisis has erupted at a time when Brazil had planned to be shining on the world stage  as it prepares to host the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro in August  Earlier in the day  the acting speaker of the lower house of Congress  Waldir Maranhao  withdrew his controversial decision to annul last month s impeachment vote in the chamber  That meant Cardozo s appeal to the top court may be the president s best hope of stopping the process from moving forward  If a simple majority agrees to put her on trial  Rousseff will be suspended from office on Thursday  leaving Vice President Michel Temer in power for up to six months during her trial  If Rousseff were convicted and removed definitively  Temer would stay in the post until elections in 2018  With the prospect looming of an end to 13 years of rule by Rousseff s leftist Workers Party  PT   anti impeachment protesters blocked roads in Sao Paulo  Brasilia and other cities  snarling morning traffic  The PT and labor unions have called for a national strike to resist what they are calling a  coup  against democracy  The legality of Rousseff s imminent removal from office was questioned by the secretary general of the Organization of American States  Luis Almagro  who said he would seek the legal opinion of the Inter American Human Rights Court   Maranhao s surprise decision on Monday threw Brazilian markets into disarray and threatened to drag out a painful political crisis with a constitutional standoff that could end up at the Supreme Court  Brazil s currency  the real  strengthened 1 6 percent and the benchmark Bovespa stock index  BVSP  closed 4 percent higher  reflecting investor hopes that a more market friendly government will soon take over the recession hit country under Temer  who is forming a cabinet with pro business figures  Temer aides said on Tuesday that he will stick to plans to cut the number of government ministries to 22 from 32 to show his commitment to plugging a widening fiscal deficit that cost Brazil s its prized investment grade credit rating  THURSDAY HANDOVER POSSIBLE Senate President Renan Calheiros  a leader of Temer s PMDB party  disregarded Maranhao s annulment decision and said the Senate would press ahead with Wednesday s vote  It is expected to take place at about 8 p m  local time  7 p m  ET  after an all day session of speeches  Rousseff s opponents have more than the 41 votes needed to launch her trial in the upper chamber  and they are confident they can muster two thirds of the body s 81 senators  or 54  needed to unseat the unpopular president at the end of a trial  If she loses Wednesday s vote  Rousseff will be served notice by the Senate on Thursday  at which point the suspended president must vacate the presidential palace  But she can continue to live in the presidential residence during the trial  Temer would step in as interim president as soon as she is given notice  The impeachment process comes as Brazil is mired in its worst recession since the 1930s and shaken by the country s biggest ever corruption scandal  dominating Rousseff s second term in office   The impeachment process is unfolding as investigators pursue a separate  long running probe into a vast kickback scheme at state run oil company Petrobras  SA PETR4     Operation Carwash   which was named for its beginnings as a money laundering probe  has ensnared dozens of top politicians and jailed chief executives from Brazil s biggest construction firms for paying billions in bribes for bloated contracts

93747,315262,PBR,Oil   Gas Stock Roundup  MDR CBI Tie Up  STO s Oilfield Stake Buy   More,opinion,"It was a week where oil prices remained essentially unchanged but natural gas futures sunk to multi month lows On the news front  energy focused construction and engineering companies McDermott International Inc    NYSE MDR   and Chicago Bridge   Iron Company N V    NYSE CBI   agreed to merge in a  6 billion deal  while Norway s Statoil  OL STL  ASA   NYSE STO   bought a 25  interest in a large Brazilian oilfield from Petrobras   NYSE PBR   for up to  2 9 billion Overall  it was a dismal week

Oil   Gas Stock Roundup  here   The U S  oil benchmark recorded its third successive weekly decline  The major culprit was the steady trend of rising domestic oil production that continues to be the

93753,315268,PBR,Shell  Chevron And 3 Other Great Large Cap Energy Stocks,opinion,Building on its second annual gain in a row  oil prices witnessed a solid start to the New Year  While  the first week of 2018 saw U S  oil benchmark rally 1 7   expectation of another massive draw catapulted the commodity to a new three year high yesterday  To be precise  the front month West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude futures climbed 2   or  1 23  to end at  62 96 per barrel Tuesday   the highest settlement since December 2014 Reasons for Oil s SurgeSharp Inventory Drawdowns  Investors have pinned hopes of recovery over the recent U S  Energy Department s inventory releases that show multiple weeks of strong inventory draws in the domestic crude stockpiles   pointing to a slowdown in shale output  The nation s oil stockpiles have shrunk in 31 of the last 39 weeks and are down almost 109 million barrels since April Production Cut Deal Extension  One of the significant reasons why the U S  oil benchmark soared nearly 17  last quarter revolved around expectations that OPEC and other major producers will agree to expand their output cut deal beyond March  True to predictions  the coalition prolonged the current dynamic for another nine months to the end of 2018  The agreement  now renewed twice  keeps 1 8 million barrels a day  or 2  of global supply  off the market in an attempt to clear a supply glut Drop in OPEC Output  Meanwhile  the producer group pumped 32 5 million barrels daily in November  about 133 500 barrels a day less than their October output and the lowest level since May  The group s success in capping production has shrunk the huge global stockpiles of oil and supported prices Decline in Rig Count  Data showing the number of U S  oil rigs going down over the past few weeks also helped cement oil s gains  An early indicator of future crude volumes  rigs engaged in oil exploration and production in the U S  totaled 742 for the week ending Jan 5   down by seven from November and importantly  a sign of brake in shale oil production Geopolitical Concerns  Political turmoil in Iran  which has raised the specter of output disruption in OPEC s third biggest producer  was also a price driver Analysts Warn of Overheated MarketDespite the recent uptick in prices  some analysts  however  believe thee sustainability of these gains is highly uncertain Rising U S  Shale Output  Arguably  the biggest headwind is the steady climb in U S  shale production  Last month it rose to 9 8 million barrels per day  the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983  The breakthrough development in global oil markets over the last few years  the relentless increase in North American shale output has repeatedly undermined efforts by OPEC and other major producers  to  rebalance  the market and prop up prices Already at a financial equilibrium  the shale firms are starting to ramp up activity  Throughout the downturn  producers worked tirelessly to cut costs down to a bare minimum and look for innovative ways to churn out more oil from rock  And they managed to do just that by improving drilling techniques  With these efforts  many upstream companies have repositioned themselves to adapt to the new  low oil  reality and even thrive at those prices  In fact  shale output from the United States is expected to surge to a record 10 million barrels per day sometime this month  just behind top producers Russia and Saudi Arabia Poor Refining Margins in Asia  Another concern is the recent fall in Asian refining margins  Overall spreads have also been dragged lower amid abundant fuel supply and surging oil prices  The business of the downstream players is negatively correlated with crude prices  This is because the companies use oil as an input from which they derive refined petroleum products like gasoline  the prime transportation fuel in the U S  Hence  higher the oil price  lower will be their profits This decline in profitability might lead to depressed near term demand from Asian refiners and weigh on crude prices What Does the Future hold The uncertainty of oil prices means that the future direction of the commodity s movement is anybody s guess  While we cheer strong inventory draws in the U S   there are still a host of bearish factors that might induce oil s fall into the mid  40s and spell doom for investors On the contrary though  the commodity s push ahead towards  65  predictably  has had a positive effect on stocks in the sector  In particular  savvy investors might view the price bump as the impetus the stocks need after freefalling for three years  Undoubtedly  still a long way to go  but improving crude prices may have already primed certain oil producers and linked entities for upward momentum Play it SmartBut it s important to keep in mind that even in these tumultuous times  there are some stocks that stands out Amid the uncertainty  it is necessary that investors adopt a cautious approach  It is prudent to opt for large cap stocks  These have a market capitalization of over  10 billion  and also have further room for upside  These companies enjoy leading market positions  have a global footprint  strong cash positions and are large enough to stay strong even in the face of unfavorable events To guide investors to the right picks  we highlight 5 stocks that

93774,315289,PBR,Brazil s Rousseff scrambles for votes to avert impeachment,news,"By Marcela Ayres and Anthony Boadle BRASILIA  Reuters    Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff held last minute negotiations with wavering lawmakers on Saturday in an effort to secure crucial support the day before an impeachment vote that could lead to her removal from office  The political crisis has divided the country and turned into a bitter clash between the leftist leader and her centrist Vice President Michel Temer  who would take over if she is unseated  Rousseff canceled an appearance at an anti impeachment rally of union and left wing social activists led by former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva  her predecessor and founder of the ruling Workers  Party  Instead she met with lawmakers behind closed doors in a bid to obtain their vote or abstention on Sunday when the lower house of Congress votes on whether she should be impeached for breaking the country s budget laws  The talks indicated that Sunday s ballot may be tighter than expected as Rousseff seeks to swing the estimated two dozen additional votes she needs to prevent a two thirds majority in favor of impeachment in the 513 seat lower chamber  which her opponents need to push ahead with this process  A Temer aide said that Rousseff  with the help of Lula  who is still Brazil s most influential politician despite a graft probe  had managed to reverse a  handful  of votes but not alter the growing momentum for impeachment  In a rowdy marathon session of speeches that went through the night  opposition congressmen shouted   Out with the Workers  Party   Rousseff s supporters  meanwhile  called for the ouster of House Speaker Eduardo Cunha  her political archenemy who has sped up the impeachment process   Rousseff is fighting to survive a political firestorm fueled by Brazil s worst recession since the Great Depression of the 1930s and a spiraling corruption scandal centered on state oil company Petrobras  SA PETR4  that has reached her inner circle   The president s opponents want her dismissed from office on charges that she manipulated budget accounts to boost public spending to boost her 2014 re election  They also blame her for running Latin America s largest economy into the ground   In a video and a newspaper column  Rousseff   Brazil s first female president   strongly denied she had committed an impeachable crime and called the bid to oust her  the biggest legal and political fraud  in the country s history   We are facing the threat of a coup d  tat  a coup without guns that uses more destructive methods like fraud and lies to try to destroy a legitimately elected government   she wrote in the Folha de S Paulo newspaper s Saturday edition   Rousseff could become Brazil s first president to be impeached since 1992 when Fernando Collor de Mello resigned just before imminent impeachment for corruption  The current crisis is far deeper because he had few supporters while Rousseff has the backing of working class Brazilians who have seen their quality of live improve during 13 years of Workers  Party rule   If she loses and Temer takes over we will take to the streets  and we have the strength to stay there as long as necessary   said Marco Antonio Baratto  coordinator of the MST landless peasants movement  at a rally of several thousand Rousseff supporters camped out in the parking lot of Brasilia s football stadium   SUSPENSION in MAY A tired looking Lula  the labor leader who led Brazil as president from 2003 to 2010  addressed the rally briefly with a hoarse voice and said he had to rush back to the talks with lawmakers  If her impeachment is approved by the lower house  the Senate must then vote on whether to go ahead with putting Rousseff on trial for disobeying budget laws  If she loses that vote  which would likely take place on May 10 or 11  Rousseff would automatically be suspended and replaced by Temer   Temer  who would serve out Rousseff s term until 2018 if she is found guilty by the Senate  has little popular support  He would face a daunting task restoring confidence in a country where dozens of political leaders  including his close associates  are under investigation for corruption  Even if Rousseff wins Sunday s vote  her coalition has been left in tatters by the acrimonious impeachment process and analysts say her pledges to form a national unity government are unlikely to bear fruit in a bitterly divided country   A case before the Supreme Electoral Court concerning charges of illegal funding of her 2014 campaign could eventually lead to both Rousseff and Temer being dismissed from office and new elections called   In the video posted on social media on Friday  Rousseff warned that if she is toppled by the impeachment process  a Temer government would force Brazilians to make sacrifices as well as roll back social advances that have reduced poverty during 13 years of Workers  Party rule   The vice president  who has been preparing to form a new government aimed at restoring confidence and economic growth  replied on Twitter that the accusation that he will cut social programs for the poor was an  abject lie

93779,315294,PBR,Should Value Investors Pick Petroleo Brasileiro  PBR  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Petroleo Brasileiro S A    Petrobras   NYSE PBR   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Petroleo Brasileiro has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 18 4  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 21 1  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Petroleo Brasileiro s current PE ratio way above its midpoint  which is 8 5  over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 19 9  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Petroleo Brasileiro has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 15 3  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Petroleo Brasileiro s stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Petroleo Brasileiro has a P S ratio of about 0 5  This is substantially lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 4 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is somewhat below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Petroleo Brasileiro currently has a Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes PBR a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Petroleo Brasileiro might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of C and a Momentum score of D  This gives PBR a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days and one lower  while the full year estimate has seen one downward and no upward revisions in the same time period This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has surged about 33 3  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has fallen nearly 5 9   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Petroleo Brasileiro S A   Petrobras Price and Consensus    This mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LinePetroleo Brasileiro is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  a formidable industry rank  top 2  out of more than 250 industries  further supports the growth potential of the stock  However  with a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past one year  the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn favorable in this name first  but once that happen  this stock could be a compelling pick Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana Ignited by new referendums and legislation  this industry is expected to blast from an already robust  6 7 billion to  20 2 billion in 2021  Early investors stand to make a killing  but you have to be ready to act and know just where to look ,2017-12-04,Zacks Investment

93800,315315,PBR,Exclusive  Ethics watchdog for Norway s  830 billion wealth fund sees increase in bans on firms,news,"By Joachim Dagenborg and Gwladys Fouche OSLO  Reuters    The ethics watchdog for Norway s  830 billion wealth fund will focus this year on identifying corruption in telecoms  arms and energy companies and expects to recommend that an increasing number of firms across all sectors be barred from investment  By the end of this year  the fund which invests income from Norway s oil and gas production could add the first companies to its blacklist for emitting too much climate changing gas  said the chairman of its independent ethics panel  Johan H  Andresen  The ethics panel will also look into allegations of human rights abuses in Qatar s building sector  Malaysia s electronics goods industry  and textile factories in some Asian countries  Andresen told Reuters  The fund is the world s biggest sovereign wealth fund  owning 1 3 percent of all listed company equity on earth  As of the end of last year it owned shares in 9 050 firms worldwide  It is forbidden by law from investing in firms that produce nuclear weapons or anti personnel landmines  or are involved in serious and systematic human rights violations  among other ethical criteria  Norway s parliament has set a new mandate from this year to restrict investment in companies that emit excessive climate changing gases  Andresen said his panel was still looking into the criteria for such judgments but its first recommendations on climate criteria could come by the end of the year  Some 66 companies have so far been excluded from the wealth fund on ethics grounds  and two are under observation  including  since January  Brazil s state oil company Petrobras  SA PETR4   under scrutiny for alleged corruption   Most of the corruption cases come from the industry studies within defense  telecoms and energy  Those three  sectors  seem to keep us very busy   Andresen  the council s chairman  said in an interview   We will of course look into other companies  should we be made aware of them   The Council on Ethics makes recommendations to the central bank on firms which may be in breach of the fund s ethics guidelines  It is now examining 14 corruption cases  including Petrobras  Based on the council s recommendations  the central bank board instructs the fund s management whether to exclude companies from the fund  The board can also put firms under observation to allow them to fix the problem  A key factor is the risk that an ethics breach will be repeated in future   The risk of corruption increases in the energy  defense and telecoms sectors as they more often involve large contracts between parties that can withhold information based on internal national security directives  Andresen said   We were especially surprised with what we found in the arms industry  It seems that the absence of corruption was the exception and not the norm   said the 54 year old Norwegian investor  owner of private investment vehicle Ferd  Andresen declined to comment specifically on Petrobras  but speaking generally  he said   Companies should aspire to be far better     They should not try to guess what is the least amount of good behavior that is expected   Across all sectors  he expected the number and frequency of recommendations to the central bank s board to increase as the council concludes the different sector studies it has begun   We did recommend one company for exclusion last week  and there are others that we are working on right now  Some of these companies are quite large  so the  central  bank may decide to undertake some type of ownership interaction   he said  TEXTILE  CONSTRUCTION AND CLIMATE CHANGE Asked about the apparent irony in looking at climate change for a fund that earns nearly all its wealth from Norway s oil and gas industry  Andresen said   We don t get involved in politics and therefore we don t question the criteria  Whichever criteria the politicians give us  we will use    Andresen said the council would look at  a broad set of industries  including the oil and gas sector over climate change  and had not yet concluded which factors to analyze to determine what is acceptable    I don t think there is a reason to avoid looking at oil and gas companies  But they are not going to be the only ones by far   he said  speaking at the council s office in central Oslo   We think that there might be some exclusions towards the end of the year within the climate criterion   Next month the council will receive a first report on the construction industry in Qatar  Construction companies working in neighboring countries will be under review too  he said  Also under scrutiny will be electronics goods manufacturers in Malaysia  The council will look at workers rights in the Indian and Bangladeshi textile industries  after looking at Cambodia and Vietnam last year   In earlier studies of textile production facilities  we have been confronted with forced overtime  loss of bonus when legally sick  possible child labor  safety issues and the integrity of the construction of the  plant  building   he said  Another target will be the environmental damage made by the chemical industry  The council is looking at  less than ten  companies in this field  he said  The council  although independent  is collaborating closely with the fund  which has its own ethical targets  such as children s rights  human rights and water management  They are working together on the textile industry  
 They are focusing on the buyers  side  the big companies within the fund  while we engage with the smaller companies where the potential breach is happening on the ground   he said ",2016-03-11,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/exclusive:-ethics-watchdog-for-norway's-$830-billion-wealth-fund-sees-increase-in-bans-on-firms-389377,389377
93801,315316,PBR,Protesters pack streets across Brazil to demand Rousseff s exit,news,"By Daniel Flynn and Alonso Soto SAO PAULO BRASILIA  Reuters    Hundreds of thousands of Brazilians poured onto the streets of major cities on Sunday to protest against President Dilma Rousseff  deepening a political crisis that threatens to unseat the leftist leader amid the worst recession in a generation   The demonstrations were the latest in a wave of anti government rallies that lost momentum late last year but have again gained strength as a sweeping corruption investigation nears Rousseff s inner circle   From the Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  jungle city of Manaus to the business hub of Sao Paulo and the capital Brasilia  protesters marched in a nationwide call for Rousseff s removal  raising pressure on lawmakers to back ongoing impeachment proceedings against her in Congress   No official estimates for the number of protesters across Brazil were immediately available  But two government sources  speaking on condition of anonymity  told Reuters the demonstrations could be bigger than anti government rallies in March 2015  which gathered as many as 1 million people  In a preliminary tally  polling firm Datafolha estimated 450 000 demonstrators in Sao Paulo on Sunday  the biggest rally in the city s history and more than twice the size of a previous protest a year ago  In the skycraper lined Avenue Paulista in Sao Paulo  a sea of protesters wearing the national yellow and green colors chanted  Dilma out  and waved banners that read  Stop the corruption    I support her impeachment and new elections because the presidential vote in 2014 was financed with dirty money from corruption   said Alexandre Cortes  a 39 year old engineer draped in a Brazilian flag at the festive rally in Sao Paulo  Many blame Rousseff for sinking the economy into its worst recession in at least 25 years  Opinion polls show that more than half of Brazilians favor the impeachment of the president  who was re elected for a second four year term in 2014   Rousseff is the latest leftist leader in Latin America to face social upheaval as a decade long commodities boom that fueled breakneck growth rates comes to an abrupt end   Ahead of the demonstrations  tensions were high after Sao Paulo state prosecutors requested the arrest of Rousseff s predecessor and political mentor  Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva  on money laundering charges  A judge still has to decide on the request  which can be rejected  As in previous protests  Sunday s rallies were led by middle class Brazilians angry over growing allegations of corruption in Rousseff s administration  No violence was reported  Poor Brazilians  who form the traditional base of the ruling Workers  Party  have not turned out in great numbers in recent protests  But their support for Rousseff has faded as unemployment rises and inflation climbs   This government helped many people buy homes  cars and electronics  but we still don t have health  education and basic sewage   said Paulo Santos  a waiter who stopped at the beach front demonstration in Rio de Janeiro before heading to work   OPPOSITION ON THE OFFENSIVE  In the capital  Brasilia  protesters inflated a giant doll of Lula wearing a striped prison uniform and chained to a ball that read  Operation Carwash   the name of the investigation centered on state oil company Petrobras  SA PETR4   Police estimated about 100 000 protesters in Brasilia  but that figure could not be independently confirmed   Speaking to protesters in the city of Belo Horizonte  the leader of the opposition PSDB party  Aecio Neves  said Rousseff should not remain in office   We believe that the president is no longer capable of making Brazil return to growth   said Neves who narrowly lost the 2014 election to Rousseff and has called for new polls   With the strength of our people  we will build a better future for Brazil   For Brasilia based political analyst Leonardo Barreto  the massive scale of Sunday s demonstration could accelerate impeachment hearings in Congress    Today s protests give legitimacy to this process   Barreto said   If the government fails to react  the impeachment process will move faster   The two year old corruption probe has already strained Rousseff s ties with her main coalition partner  the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party  PMDB   At its national convention on Saturday  the PMDB said it would decide within a month whether to break with the government  with party insiders saying the mood of the country would be decisive  Small groups of government supporters wearing red shirts and holding banners that read  There will not be a coup  marched in several cities  The Petrobras probe has implicated senior politicians from Rousseff s coalition as well as top business executives   Popular discontent grew in recent weeks after a ruling party lawmaker reportedly testified under a plea bargain and accused Rousseff and Lula of trying to hamper the Petrobras investigation  Protesters also voiced support for Sergio Moro  the judge overseeing the Petrobras investigation  holding banners that read  We are all Moro  and wearing masks of his face   Shares in Brazilian companies and Brazil s real currency  have surged in recent weeks as investors bet that a change in government would lift business and consumer confidence and rescue an economy that contracted 3 8 percent last year   Rousseff  whose popularity is near record lows  has said she will not quit and blamed her opponents for creating the crisis that is sinking the economy

93805,315320,PBR,Brazil s Lula sworn in over protests as Rousseff faces impeachment ,news,"By Anthony Boadle and Leonardo Goy BRASILIA  Reuters    Former Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva was sworn in as chief of staff to his successor Dilma Rousseff on Thursday as a judge sought to block his appointment and Congress began proceedings to impeach her amid the country s deepening crisis  Police used tear gas to disperse hundreds of opposition demonstrators who clashed with Lula s leftist supporters outside the presidential palace where he was sworn in  while ministers and corruption investigators traded barbs throughout the day   Demonstrations also blocked major avenues in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro  spurred by anger that Lula s appointment will shield the former president from prosecutors who charged him with money laundering and fraud as part of a sweeping graft probe centered on state run oil company Petrobras  SA PETR4    Only Brazil s Supreme Court has jurisdiction in cases against ministers  Shortly after the swearing in ceremony  a federal judge in Brasilia issued an injunction against Lula s appointment on the grounds it blocked  the free exercise of justice   Attorney General Jose Eduardo Cardozo vowed to appeal the injunction against Lula joining the government  which he called the decision of a partisan judge  The standoff inflamed tensions that are already running high between Brazil s executive and judiciary branches  as the snowballing Petrobras probe reaches Rousseff s inner circle and hangs over a congressional impeachment committee named on Thursday  Calls for Rousseff s impeachment have centered on allegations  unrelated to Petrobras  that she broke budget rules intentionally to boost spending as she campaigned for re election in 2014  A 65 member impeachment committee of the lower house will now formally begin studying whether there are sufficient grounds to remove her  Deliberations could drag on for months  But hotly contested seats on the committee  amid vocal calls from some opposition lawmakers for Rousseff to resign  were spread among all parties in the lower house of Congress   The panel includes moderates  allies and opponents of the government   said Leonardo Picciani  leader in the lower house of the centrist PMDB party  Rousseff s main governing partner  Rousseff and Lula have both denied any wrongdoing  Brazil s benchmark stock index  BVSP  rallied 6 6 percent  the biggest daily jump in seven years  and the Brazilian real  BRBY  firmed 2 3 percent as the political crisis increased bets that Rousseff s ouster could bring a more market friendly administration to power  The real s 10 percent gain so far this month led the central bank to scale back its currency intervention  Rousseff appointed her mentor  who remains one of Brazil s most influential politicians six years after leaving office  in an effort to fight impeachment and win back working class supporters amid the worst economic recession in decades  The corruption probe  however  has weakened Lula s sway in Congress and there are growing signs that Rousseff s main coalition partner is ready to abandon the unpopular government   Brazil s powerful industry lobby  the CNI  said the political crisis was having  catastrophic  consequences for businesses and called on the country s politicians to overcome their differences to restore confidence   UNDERGROUND WAR  As Rousseff swore Lula into office  she strongly criticized the release on Wednesday of a taped telephone conversation between them that was made public by Sergio Moro  the crusading federal judge overseeing the Petrobras investigation  Moro  the public face of the biggest graft probe in Brazilian history  said the tape showed they had discussed influencing prosecutors and courts to protect Lula  who leaves Moro s jurisdiction   Convulsing Brazilian society with lies  with reprehensible practices violates constitutional rights and as well as the rights of citizens   said Rousseff  who called the recording illegal and anti democratic  Judiciary association and prosecutors working with Moro sprang to his defense  repudiating what they called efforts to intimidate him and his team of investigators   Those telephone conversations provide evidence of obstructing the investigation  part of a treacherous underground war waged in the shadows  far from the courts   wrote thirteen federal prosecutors on Moro s task force in a public statement  Moro said in a court filing released on Wednesday that the taped telephone conversations did not provide proof that Lula and Rousseff were interfering with his investigation  He said  however  that he released the recordings because citizens had a right to know how they were being governed   One recording  made public by the court  included Rousseff offering to send Lula a copy of his appointment urgently  in case it was necessary    a possible reference to the ministerial post providing him with immediate immunity from arrest  Brazil s biggest ever corruption probe  which centers on bribes and political kickbacks at Petrobras  has led to the conviction of dozens of powerful executives and politicians while recovering 2 9 billion reais   795 million  in stolen money   Prosecutors accuse Lula of concealing ownership of an oceanfront apartment that was built and furnished by one of the Petrobras contractors in the graft scheme  The widening bribery scandal has divided Rousseff s fractious coalition and moved the PMDB closer to breaking with her government  Vice President Michel Temer  leader of the PMDB  did not attend the swearing in of Lula because Rousseff appointed a lawmaker from his party as civil aviation minister  Temer s aides said  A PMDB convention on Saturday banned its members from taking new posts in her government

93836,315351,PBR,Brazil s president loses legal battle  faces impeachment threat,news,"By Anthony Boadle and Alonso Soto BRASILIA  Reuters    Brazil s besieged President Dilma Rousseff lost a major battle on Wednesday when the federal audit court rejected her government s accounts from last year  paving the way for her opponents to try to impeach her  In a unanimous vote  the Federal Accounts Court  known as the TCU  ruled that Rousseff s government manipulated its accounts in 2014 to disguise a widening fiscal deficit as she campaigned for re election  The ruling  the TCU s first against a Brazilian president in nearly 80 years  is not legally binding but it will be used by opposition lawmakers to argue for impeachment proceedings against the unpopular leftist leader in an increasingly hostile Congress   Rousseff s office said there were no legal grounds for the ruling and maintained in a statement that the audit court unduly penalized actions taken by her Workers  Party government to maintain social programs for Brazil s poor  Opposition leaders hugged and cheered when the ruling was announced in Congress  though it was not clear whether they have enough support to impeach the president despite a widening corruption scandal engulfing state oil firm Petrobras  SA PETR4  and Brazil s deepest recession in 25 years   This establishes that they doctored fiscal accounts  which is an administrative crime and President Rousseff should face an impeachment vote   said Carlos Sampaio  leader of the opposition PSDB party in the lower house   It s the end for the Rousseff government   said Rubens Bueno  a congressman from the PPS party  He said the opposition has the votes to start proceedings in the lower house though perhaps not the two thirds majority needed for an impeachment trial in the Senate  In a last ditch bid to win time  the government had asked the Supreme Court to delay Wednesday s ruling  but it refused   Attorney General Luis Inacio Adams said the government would appeal again to the top court to overthrow the audit decision  Earlier on Wednesday  Rousseff s government failed to get enough support in Congress to back her efforts to rebalance Brazil s public accounts  Rousseff is also reeling from a ruling on Tuesday that cleared the way for a separate probe on alleged irregularities in her re election campaign last year  Congress put off for a fourth time a session on whether to back or overturn her vetoes of two spending bills after her government was unable to obtain a quorum despite a cabinet reshuffle last week meant to bolster her support   It s as if the government has ceased to exist   said congressman Pauderney Avelino of the opposition Democrats party  The congressional setback calls into question her ability to raise taxes to plug a widening budget gap that led the Standard   Poor s rating agency to strip Brazil of its investment grade rating last month   WEAK ECONOMY Backed by a commodities boom  Brazil s economy posted several years of strong growth that pulled millions of people out of poverty  But the boom ended after Rousseff came to power in 2011  hit by weaker international prices for its products and her government s interventionist policies   Uncertainty over Rousseff s ability to survive the political crisis and pull Brazil out of an economic tailspin has driven down its currency  the real  to its weakest levels ever  In the ruling on Tuesday  Brazil s top electoral authority said there were grounds to investigate her re election campaign  including the suspicion of illegal funding from kickbacks involving oil firm Petrobras  Rousseff served as chairwoman of the board of Petroleo Brasileiro SA  as Petrobras is formally known  from 2003 to 2010 when much of the alleged graft took place  She has denied knowing of or benefiting from the graft  The TSE electoral court investigation requested by her challenger in last year s election  Aecio Neves  could lead to the invalidation of Rousseff s slim victory  though the judicial case is expected to last for months if not years and can be appealed to the Supreme Court  The only good news Rousseff has had recently was the confirmation by Swiss authorities that her declared enemy in Congress  lower house speaker Eduardo Cunha  holds bank accounts in Switzerland  which he had denied  
Cunha  who holds the key to starting impeachment proceedings in the lower house  already faces charges of corruption in the Petrobras bribery scandal  On Wednesday he said he had no intention of resigning ",2015-10-07,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/brazil's-rousseff-suffers-new-setback-over-austerity-365107,365107

93840,315355,PBR,Brazil s Lula detained in corruption probe  Rousseff objects,news,"By Brad Haynes and Anthony Boadle SAO PAULO BRASILIA  Reuters    Former Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva was briefly detained for questioning on Friday in a federal investigation of a vast corruption scheme  fanning a political crisis that threatens to topple his successor  President Dilma Rousseff  Lula s questioning in police custody was the highest profile development in a two year old graft probe centered on the state oil company Petrobras  SA PETR4   which has rocked Brazil s political and business establishment and deepened the worst recession in decades in Latin America s biggest economy   The investigation threatens to tarnish the legacy of Brazil s most powerful politician  whose humble roots and anti poverty programs made him a folk hero  by putting a legal spotlight on how his left leaning Workers  Party consolidated its position since rising to power 13 years ago  Police picked up Lula at his home on the outskirts of Sao Paulo and released him after three hours of questioning  They said evidence suggested Lula had received illicit benefits from kickbacks at the oil company  Petrobras  in the form of payments and luxury real estate  The evidence against the former president brought the graft investigation closer to his protege Rousseff  She is already fighting off impeachment for allegedly breaking budget rules  weakening her efforts to pull the economy out of recession  Rousseff expressed her disagreement with the police taking her mentor into custody  saying it was  unnecessary  after his voluntary testimony  But she repeated her backing for institutions investigating corruption and said the probe must continue until those responsible were punished  News of Lula s brief detention sparked a rally in Brazilian assets as traders bet that the political upheaval could empower a more market friendly coalition   The real currency  rose over 3 percent against the U S  dollar before settling to a 1 percent gain  The Bovespa stock index  BVSP  rose 4 percent  led by a 10 percent surge for the state oil giant Petrobras  formally known as Petroleo Brasileiro SA   Ex president Lula  besides being party leader  was the one ultimately responsible for the decision on who would be the directors at Petrobras and was one of the main beneficiaries of these crimes   police said in a statement on his detention   There is evidence that the crimes enriched him and financed electoral campaigns and the treasury of his political group   Lula was indignant  slamming investigators for  disrespecting democracy  and running what he called a media circus rather than a serious investigation  He told supporters at Workers  Party headquarters he had already answered the questions that police asked him on Friday and reiterated that he was not the owner of luxury real estate that investigators have suggested he received as bribes  Rousseff has also repeatedly denied any wrongdoing  Her labor minister  Miguel Rossetto  said in a public statement that the detention was  a clear attack on what Lula represents    This is not justice  this is violence   he said  Underscoring the deep political passions surrounding the former president  TV images from the street outside Lula s home on Friday showed his supporters clad in red shirts exchanging chants  insults and even blows with opponents  Dozens of police arrived to break up the altercations  clearing the street by force  Pro Lula protesters also gathered in a noisy protest outside federal police offices at a Sao Paulo airport where he was taken for questioning   VIOLENCE IN THE STREETS  As the founder and figurehead of his party  Lula s image has been central to huge street protests over the past year  both for and against Rousseff s impeachment  and powerful unions have marched repeatedly in his name  A presidential aide who had not been authorized to comment publicly called the accusations against Lula a  turning point  in a long simmering political crisis   This breaks with standard procedure  If they do not quickly present concrete proof against Lula  there is going to be violence in the streets  It could be a real war   the aide said  Lula  70  was a model for a wave of leftist presidents in Latin America as his government coupled healthy economic growth with popular social programs that lifted more than 30 million people out of poverty during his presidency from 2003 to 2010  Yet investigators say much of the corruption at Petrobras happened during that period  On Friday  they called him and Rousseff the chief political beneficiaries of a scheme to fund Worker s Party campaigns with bribe money  In an online survey conducted on Friday by pollster Ipsos  97 percent of respondents already knew of Lula s interrogation  One in four said his errors could not compare with the good things he had done for the country  while half disagreed  Federal prosecutors who ordered Friday s raids said there was evidence that the former president personally received funds from the graft scheme at Petrobras through work on a luxury beachside penthouse and a country home   Despite Lula s denials  prosecutors say doormen  OAS engineers and third party contractors all said the condo in Guaruj   along with at least 1 million reais   270 000  in improvements and furnishings  was intended for his family  Investigators also say Lula acquired two country estates in Atibaia worth 1 5 million reais  between 2010 and 2014  from businessman Jos  Carlos Bumlai and builders Odebrecht and OAS  Odebrecht representatives said the company was collaborating with a search and seizure operation at its headquarters in Sao Paulo on Friday  OAS declined to comment   The suspicion is that the improvements and the properties are bribes derived from the illegal gains made by OAS in the Petrobras graft scheme   the prosecutors  statement said  Prosecutors are also investigating payments to Lula by companies involved in the Petrobras scandal that were treated officially as donations and fees for speaking appearances  Police said they carried out dozens of search and arrest warrants in the latest round of the investigation named Operation Carwash  after the small time money laundering investigation that spawned the probe  Some 200 police and 30 auditors from the federal tax office took part   Brazilian media reported on Thursday that ruling party Senator Delcidio Amaral  a major legislative ally for Rousseff before he was arrested in November  allegedly tied the president and Lula to the scandal engulfing Petrobras in a 400 page plea bargain made with prosecutors  In a news conference on Friday  Rousseff denied details of his reported testimony  saying the allegations lacked credibility and were aimed at doing her political damage  The president s opponents in Congress are seeking to impeach her on the grounds that she deliberately broke budgetary laws to boost government spending as she ran for re election in 2014

recently raised global oil demand forecasts for this year  helping to tighten the market significantly  Further  the Paris based IEA  the global oil supply had come down by 720 000 per day last month to 97 7 million barrels on outages and maintenance in non OPEC countries Meanwhile  according to the OPEC s   the oil cartel s production fell by 79 000 barrels a day in August to 32 76 million as

retirement of the six deepwater floaters is in line with the company s strategy of increasing its fleet quality  The removal of old and less competitive rigs will make way for new high specification assets  making the company s operations more technically capable  It will provide Transocean s fleet a competitive advantage  Also  reactivation cost for most of the cold stacked rigs is high and will

93850,315365,PBR,Petrobras history of failed plans raises doubt over new promises,news,"By Jeb Blount RIO DE JANEIRO  Reuters    Brazilian state run oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA s long history of failed spending and output plans may be the biggest obstacle to its efforts to convince investors it will reduce its massive debt  The company s  90 billion cut on Monday from planned investment over five years and 30 percent reduction to its 2020 oil and natural gas output forecast mark the first major retrenchment by Petrobras  as it is known  since the discovery of giant offshore oil reserves south of Rio de Janeiro was announced in late 2007  Petrobras  though  has not met an annual production target since 2003 when the Workers  Party government of Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff and her predecessor Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva took power  Nor has it met five  or 10 year projections  Some doubt its  more realistic  2015 2019 plan will do better   Petrobras is great at over promising and under delivering  They are notorious in the industry   said Fadel Gheit  managing partner for oil and gas research at Oppenheimer   Co in New York   I don t know how anyone takes them seriously   Looking at the new  130 billion five year plan  it is almost as if the last seven years of frantic pursuit of an offshore bonanza had never happened  The company s 2008 2012 plan  announced in September 2007  called for  112 billion of investment  By the end of 2012  Petrobras said  it would be producing 3 5 million barrels of oil and equivalent natural gas per day  boepd  worldwide  and by 2015 4 6 million boepd  making it one of the world s largest producers  But now  after about  250 billion of investment and the discovery of some of the world s largest offshore oil and gas resources  Petrobras is producing 2 8 million boepd  20 percent less than its estimate for 2012 output  The new outlook for 2020 is 3 7 boepd  11 percent less than the 2008 2012 plan promised for this year  Annual revisions drove the 2020 goal as high as 6 42 million boepd in 2011 and planned five year investment to  237 billion in 2013   COST OF FAILURE The cost to investors has been huge  Petrobras was worth more than  200 billion when the 2008 plan was released  making it one of the world s 10 largest companies  Two years later Petrobras raised  70 billion in the world s largest ever share sale  Today  Petrobras is worth  56 billion  And as Petrobras goes forward the financial situation is less promising than in 2008  At more than  120 billion  Petrobras  debt is the largest of any oil company  equal to 113 percent of its capital and more than double its market value  The comparable figures for Exxon Mobile Corp are  32 billion and 16 7 percent  For Fabio Fuzette  a fund manager with Antares Capital in S o Paulo  Petrobras Chief Executive Aldemir Bendine has done little to explain how the company will keep its promise to cut debt  Most important  Fuzette said  Bendine s promise depends on raising  57 7 billion by 2019 from asset sales  restructuring and closing operations   That s absurd   Fuzette said   It s more than the company s total market value  They are being too aggressive   But if that goal is not met  Petrobras  debt will likely rise  said Auro Rosenbaum  senior oil and gas analyst with Banco Bradesco SA

Despite a favorable inventory data  oil prices recorded another weekly decline  The U S  Energy Department s inventory release showed that crude stockpiles  on record high refinery runs  With oil supplies continuing to fall  investor sentiment has turned slightly positive on dissipating fears about a meltdown to sub  40 levels  Analysts also believe that the trend  if sustained  could help tighten the market significantly 
However  this positive effect was more than offset by a strong dollar and escalating tensions between the US and North Korea that sparked investor movement away from riskier assets to safe havens like gold  The commodity was also affected by lingering concerns over OPEC and its allies  success in rebalancing the market after the cartel s July output rose to a new 2017 high

93885,315400,PBR,Stumbling blocks emerge for Brazil prosecutors in Petrobras case,news,By Caroline Stauffer SAO PAULO  Reuters    Recent setbacks for prosecutors in a huge corruption scheme at Brazil s state run oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA  SA PETR4  suggest they will struggle to win as many convictions as they seek   The Supreme Court s decision last week to release from jail nine executives at construction companies suspected of paying bribes in the scheme  and put them under house arrest instead  reduces the chances of prosecutors convincing them to strike plea bargain deals that could result in additional charges  The ruling  and a separate decision by the court to halt some new depositions  suggest defense efforts to poke holes in the investigation  often by citing procedural issues  are starting to bear fruit  To be sure  legal experts do expect more convictions in the case in which former executives at Petrobras  as the company is known  and some of its suppliers are accused of inflating the value of service contracts and funneling the excess funds into their own bank accounts and to political parties  including that of President Dilma Rousseff   Graphic on the alleged corruption scheme    Rousseff is not being investigated  but her ratings have suffered because of her party s ties to the scandal and fears that economic fallout from the investigation will tip Brazil into recession this year  Prosecutors say bank records and witness testimony show at least 2 1 billion reais   700 million  was embezzled  The probe has already led to 97 indictments  including four former Petrobras executives  the senior engineering executives  and the treasurer of Rousseff s Workers  Party  Dozens of elected officials have also been implicated in a separate investigation in Brasilia  The first eight convictions came on April 22  including a former Petrobras executive and a black market money dealer  who were sentenced to a year of house arrest and three years in jail  respectively   Yet the recent Supreme Court decisions suggest prosecutors may struggle to reach their stated goal of presenting more charges and sending scores of politicians and executives to jail to change the way corruption is treated and punished in Brazil   It s going to be hard to get these convictions   said Luiz Flavio Gomes  a criminal lawyer and director of the Avante Institute  an anti crime organization in Sao Paulo  citing Brazil s  precarious justice system  and the recent release of some defendants   In ordering the release of the nine executives  the Supreme Court rejected federal judge Sergio Moro s argument that the suspects could commit more crimes unless they were locked up  Moro  who is guiding the prosecution  has not publicly commented on the ruling  But keeping the executives in jail was seen as key to pressuring them to reveal what they knew about the graft and bring about more indictments  A lawyer for the vice president of construction firm Camargo Corr a told Folha de S Paulo newspaper that  the number of plea bargains will likely fall  because of the ruling        UNTOUCHABLES Since the scandal first broke last year  the investigation has enjoyed broad support among Brazilians who believe endemic graft and bribery keep their resource rich country from reaching its full potential   The 42 year old  telegenic Moro and a group of nine prosecutors in the southern city of Curitiba  where much of the investigation is carried out  have become celebrities  A photo of the prosecutors with the headline  The Untouchables  ran on the front page of Folha a few weeks ago  Yet some warn the publicity may have inflated expectations     Because of the size of the investigation and the amount of media attention it generates     you almost end up assuming  the defendants  are guilty   said Tatiana Farina  an economist affiliated with the University of Sao Paulo  Moro and the prosecutors declined to be interviewed for this story  They have previously defended their tactics  including the use of plea bargains  as permitted under Brazilian law and necessary to crack a case as big as Petrobras  One prosecutor  Deltan Dallagnol  has spoken of the opportunity to spur a  social transformation  by showing that corruption will not be tolerated  One major obstacle  however  is the justice system itself   Courts often have unclear or overlapping jurisdictions  making them prone to small procedural errors  Defense lawyers argue that key elements of the case should be heard not under Moro s jurisdiction in Curitiba but in Rio de Janeiro  where Petrobras is based   Leonardo Sica  the president of the Sao Paulo bar association  said that argument could get some of Moro s rulings thrown out in coming months   Defense lawyers also say they plan to continue pushing back against Moro s  preventive jailing   of suspects before they have been sentenced or even formally charged  Moro has justified the measure with flight risk and potential threat to public order posed by the suspects  Andre Azevedo  member of the legal team representing jailed lobbyist Fernando Soares  who is accused of funneling bribes to politicians  said the practice violates the American Convention on Human Rights  which Brazil signed    We have a list of cases that were thrown out in Brazil for these types of excesses   he told Reuters  He called the Supreme Court s decision to free some executives a  huge blow  to Moro   The Supreme Court s recent rulings also suggest it is reluctant to give the Moro a free rein  That matters because elected officials enjoy special protection  which means 34 politicians  including the leaders of both houses of Congress  who have been named as possible suspects must be tried before the Supreme Court  To win convictions  prosecutors will have to prove the money was originally stolen from Petrobras since companies can legally give to electoral campaigns in Brazil and the engineering firms did complete work for Petrobras  albeit at an elevated cost   It s not so clear that these were bribes   said Alberto Toron  the defense lawyer who secured the executives  release order and represents the head of construction firm UTC  who is accused of corruption and money laundering  The Workers  Party says the donations were legal and duly accounted for with Brazil s electoral authority  Rousseff has denied any knowledge of the scandal   Janaina Paschoal  an attorney and professor at the University of Sao Paulo law school  said she was concerned that just like in one past corruption case  executives might get jail time  but most politicians would get off lightly  That  would be terrible for society   she said   I  unlike many  don t see the executives as the biggest villains in this scandal  ,2015-05-04,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/stumbling-blocks-emerge-for-brazil-prosecutors-in-petrobras-case-340189,340189

93906,315421,PBR,Petrobras funding options run slim as scandal deepens,news,"By Guillermo Parra Bernal  SAO PAULO  Reuters    Brazil s state controlled oil firm Petrobras may have to hike fuel prices  cut spending or seek a capital injection from the government next year as a widening corruption probe threatens to temporarily leave it out of capital markets   Yet any of those steps would be difficult to implement and may not be enough to fully substitute international bond markets as the company s main funding source  said one banker who helped oversee some of the company s bond offerings in recent years   Last month  Petrobras  SA PETR4  delayed the release of third quarter results after auditors refused to sign off on them following allegations that it systematically overpaid for assets and work by contractors   If auditors fail to approve its annual results by April  that could trigger early repayment of as much as  11 billion of bonds and a  5 8 billion local bank loan  according to another source briefed on the situation   To be sure  few expect Petrobras to default on its debt since it would likely negotiate a solution with bondholders and banks  But global bond investors are unlikely to participate in any new Petrobras bond offering until it provides properly audited financial information  UBS Securities and Morgan Stanley   Co analysts said in reports   That means the company  formally known as Petr leo Brasileiro SA  may have to look elsewhere to keep funding its five year   220 billion investment plan  the largest in the global oil industry   While President Dilma Rousseff could allow Petrobras to hike gasoline prices next year  she would likely resist any effort to significantly scale back the plan because it is a key part of her administration s flagship infrastructure investment program  About 68 percent of the plan s financing has already been contracted  Moody s Investors Service recently said    Take into account the corruption investigation  the risk perception and Petrobras  ongoing financial constraints and you see how its ability to generate cash is severely imperiled   said the banker  who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue   The difficulties in lining up financing underpin the headwinds facing Petrobras  which only 20 months ago sold  11 billion in bonds  a record for an emerging market firm   The corruption scandal  coupled with years of rampant debt taking  is fanning concern that Petrobras could lose its coveted investment grade status  driving up borrowing costs   Touted by government officials in the last decade as the crown jewel of Brazil s economy  Petrobras has now become a symbol of the country s fall from grace  The company plans to publish unaudited results on Friday  though that is unlikely to assuage concerns about the impact of the corruption probe on operations and fundraising plans    I believe that no investor will buy shares or bonds with the current headline risk  at least not without the proper audited paperwork in place   said Ulisses de Oliveira  who helps manage  400 million in emerging market debt for Galloway Gestora de Recursos in S o Paulo   The refinancing hurdles loom as oil prices are tumbling  threatening to crimp revenue  Free cash flow  a measure of cash surpluses after payments to bondholders and shareholders  is expected to turn positive only by 2017  analysts estimate   Petrobras  which declined to comment for this story  has yet to set a date to publish audited results   If Petrobras does manage to secure fresh funding  it will come at a higher cost because of the added risks stemming from the corruption scandal   Petrobras  6 25 percent bond maturing in March 2024  71647NAM1 FINR  is currently yielding close to 6 5 percent  the highest level in about a year and a half  That is in the same ballpark as issuers rated below investment grade   OPERATION CAR WASH  The scandal is also putting pressure on Rousseff  who was chairwoman of Petrobras  board between 2003 and 2010  The probe  dubbed  Operation Car Wash   was launched in March when police began probing an alleged money laundering scheme   New York based law firm Wolf Popper LLP filed on Tuesday a class action lawsuit against Petrobras on behalf of investors who bought the company s U S  traded shares between May 2010 and November this year  The lawsuit  which alleges that Petrobras issued misleading statements that helped hide the corruption scheme  could further hamper the company s ability to access the U S  market   Petrobras borrows about half of its  40 billion in annual capital spending  most of that from bond investors  It typically taps bond markets early in the year  having made a first quarter global bond offering in five of the past eight years   Even if banks and investors in Brazil shrug off the risk of extending credit to Petrobras  local loan and bond markets are too small to supply the company with the financing it needs to undertake its projects  another banker said   The company could still turn to state development bank BNDES  BNDES UL  for credit  but it is unclear if the bank would extend enough money to Petrobras  Petrobras could pay for operations for about six months without tapping debt markets  executives said last month  BNDES declined to comment   Petrobras  the world s most indebted oil firm with  140 billion in total liabilities  has  54 billion in outstanding bonds  Net debt is above the target for leverage at 2 5 times earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortization  and above the 35 percent of equity threshold    With the recent decline in crude prices  down more than 30 percent from mid year levels  we expect lower cash generation and this will make the company more reliant on asset sales or debt to fund future development spending   Moody s said   
Shares are down about 47 percent since the investigation began gaining momentum three months ago  Chief Financial Office Almir Barbassa renewed a pledge not to sell new equity on November 17 when he outlined plans to review Petrobras accounting     Additional reporting by Jeb Blount in Rio de Janeiro  Editing by Todd Benson and Kieran Murray ",2014-12-10,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/petrobras-funding-options-run-slim-as-scandal-deepens-319713,319713

93912,315427,PBR,Brazil risks recession as central bank bucks global trend  raises rate,news,"By Walter Brandimarte and Silvio Cascione
SAO PAULO BRASILIA  Reuters    Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff s crusade to win back investor confidence has entrusted policymakers with the tough mission of hiking interest rates while major central banks cut them  raising the prospect of another recession in Latin America s biggest economy 
As it boosted the benchmark Selic rate to 12 25 percent on Wednesday  the third consecutive rate hike since Rousseff won re election in October  Brazil s central bank sought to deliver on its pledge to do  whatever it takes  to bring down inflation currently running at about 6 5 percent annually 
The move left the Brazilian central bank at odds with the European Central Bank  which unveiled a massive bond buying program on Thursday  as well as policymakers in Canada  Denmark  India and Turkey  who recently cut interest rates after the sharp drop in oil prices and forecasts of slower global growth 
Brazil s strategy seems to be paying off  for now 
Investors  also encouraged by a package of austerity measures unveiled this week  have been cautiously buying government bonds and driving long term interest rates lower 
The Brazilian real  has gained 3 percent since the beginning of the year while returns on local currency government bonds have totaled 4 9 percent in dollar terms during the same period  according to a benchmark JP Morgan index  
That has provided rare good news for Rousseff  who has otherwise been battered by a weak economy  plunging business confidence  energy blackouts and a corruption scandal since she began her second term on Jan  1 
Javier Murcio  a Boston based portfolio manager at Standish Mellon Asset Management  which oversees  10 billion in emerging market assets  said the fund was currently  slightly overweight  on Brazil s local currency debt 
 If we see an improvement in the macro conditions  then we will go more overweight   he said 
Dollar inflows have also picked up as investors try to take advantage of one of the world s highest interest rates  About  2 3 billion have flown into Brazil during the week ending Jan 16  practically offsetting outflows of  2 4 billion recorded during the first nine days of the year  central bank data showed  
RISKY PATH
Yet the central bank is going down a dangerous path that could drive Latin America s largest economy into a recession for the second time in less than two years  following a brief contraction last year 
That  in turn  has investors wondering if Rousseff  a leftist  will have the stomach needed to maintain unpopular policies such as interest rate hikes 
 The big question is whether these policies will have the necessary political backing   said Enestor dos Santos  an economist with BBVA in Madrid   Perhaps the initial plan was to implement a small adjustment that wouldn t take the economy into a recession but  if it doesn t happen like that  will the government continue to support it  
A pullback from recently unveiled austerity measures could rock Brazilian financial markets  driving investors out of the country and costing Brazil its coveted investment grade rating 
Rising interest rates have already hurt Brazilians  purchasing power  with 2014 retail sales believed to have posted their worst performance in 11 years  Mortgages also became more expensive after state lender Caixa Economic Federal last week raised lending rates to as high as 11 percent from 9 2 percent 
Economists already expected a tough year  with forecasts for a mere 0 32 percent economic growth  according to a weekly central bank survey of about 100 analysts 
Other economic headwinds abound 
A widening corruption scandal at state run oil company Petrobras  SA PETR4  has slowed investment in the oil sector while a prolonged draught is sharply increasing the cost of Brazil s hydroelectric based power generation 
Lower commodity prices also make it harder for the country to restore its trade balance  which in 2014 posted its first deficit in 14 years 
Despite such problems  the central bank on Wednesday left the door open to raise the base Selic rate by another 50 basis points in its next meeting rather than slow the pace of monetary tightening  as many economists expected 
Banks have been slashing their forecasts for Brazil s economic growth as a result  Some  such as HSBC and Credit Suisse  now expect gross domestic product to contract 0 5 percent this year 
 There is no doubt  the central bank s policy  is having a negative impact on the economy   said BBVA s Santos ",2015-01-22,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/brazil-risks-recession-as-central-bank-bucks-global-trend,-raises-rate-324694",324694

production boom  while natural gas futures slipped below the psychologically important  3 threshold On the news front  Cheniere Energy Inc    NYSE LNG   announced the dispatch of the first cargo of liquefied natural gas under its 20 year contract with South Korean government owned KOGAS  while oil and gas explorer Jones Energy Inc    NYSE JONE   struck a deal to offload several non core assets

report once again brought to the forefront the steady trend of rising domestic oil production that continues to be the biggest headwind for the market  At around 9 35 million barrels a day  domestic output has increased to the highest since Aug 2015  Investors also fretted over the burgeoning rig count   pointing to the ever increasing shale drilling activities   and rising output from Libya Meanwhile  natural gas futures fell to its lowest since March following a larger than expected increase in supplies and tepid cooling demand with forecasts of milder temperature across the country over the next few days Recap of the Week s Most Important Stories1     U S  based natural gas exporter Cheniere Energy Inc  recently commenced work under its long term supply contract with South Korean natural gas utility Korea Gas Corp   aka  KOGAS  The first shipment   loaded on Jun 3   is in transit from Sabine Pass to South Korea s Tongyeong and is likely to arrive on Jul 1 The 20 year supply contract  inked in Jan 2012  aims to supply U S  sourced LNG from the Sabine Pass Liquefaction facility in Louisiana to KOGAS  Per the deal  Cheniere Energy is expected to deliver about 3 5 million tons of LNG per year which is 10  more than South Korea s total annual demand South Korea depends heavily on Middle Eastern countries including Oman and Qatar for its import requirements through state run KOGAS  The country is the second largest LNG importer in the world due to the paucity of domestic resources to meet its energy demands With the energy production boom in U S   the nation is likely to become the world s largest LNG supplier by 2035  transcending Australia and Qatar  Cheniere Energy  which is the only LNG exporter of U S   is expected to ship 200 LNG vessels this

million contingent payment based on improving natural gas prices  The proceeds are expected to be used to repay debt under its revolving credit facility  Subject to regulatory approvals and satisfactory closing conditions  the Arkoma transaction is scheduled to close in the third quarter of 2017 The company sold other non core assets worth  2 5 million in early 2017  With the current

93933,315448,PBR,Rousseff and Neves neck and neck ahead of Brazil runoff,news,"By Anthony Boadle  BRASILIA  Reuters    Pro business opposition candidate Aecio Neves has gained support and is running neck and neck with leftist President Dilma Rousseff ahead of Brazil s Oct  26 presidential runoff  two polls showed on Thursday   The tight race highlights why Neves is actively seeking an endorsement from popular environmentalist Marina Silva  who finished third in the election s first round on Sunday with 22 million votes   Neves has 46 percent support against 44 percent for Rousseff  surveys by the Datafolha and Ibope polling firms showed  Excluding undecided voters  spoiled and blank survey responses  Neves had 51 percent against 49 percent for Rousseff   The gap between them is statistically insignificant because it is within the margin of error of both polls  meaning the race remains too close to call at this point   The polls were the first by Brazil s two major polling firms since Sunday s first round vote in which Rousseff won 41 6 percent of the votes cast to 33 6 percent for Neves  a difference of 8 million votes   Neves  a centrist senator who is an investor favorite  had trailed Silva for most of the campaign but surged late to secure a spot in the runoff  Brazilian financial markets rallied early in the week after Neves s strong showing  hoping that his momentum heading into the second round would give him a solid lead over Rousseff   To unseat Rousseff and put an end to 12 years of Workers  Party rule  Neves is trying to woo voters who backed Silva and other opposition candidates in the first round   Silva s Brazilian Socialist Party backed Neves on Wednesday  but she wants to see him formally embrace some key points from her campaign platform before offering a personal endorsement   A Silva aide  Pedro Ivo  said she is seeking  progressive  commitments to defend the rights of Brazilian Indians and landless peasants  issues that are not part of Neves s platform  She also wants Neves to commit to  sustainable development   a key concept of her campaign   Silva also came in third in the last presidential election  when she ran on the Green Party ticket  In the 2010 runoff  she remained neutral instead of endorsing a candidate   This time  though  Silva looks inclined to throw her weight behind Neves following an acrimonious campaign in which the Rousseff camp ran a flurry of attack ads portraying Silva as a serial flip flopper beholden to a greedy financial elite   TV CAMPAIGN BEGINS  Analysts expected Neves to do well in the first week of the runoff campaign  buoyed by favorable media coverage of his strong showing in the first round  But they also caution that Rousseff has plenty of time to claw back into the lead    It s more a matter of when  and not if  the Neves wave will start to recede   the Eurasia political risk consultancy said in a note to clients   Thursday was the first day of television campaigning after Sunday s vote  and Rousseff came out swinging  She warned Brazilians that what was at stake in the election was a model of development that has improved the lot of the poor in Brazil during more than a decade of leftist Workers  Party governments    He represents a model that bankrupted the country three times  cowered Brazil before the International Monetary Fund  privatized state companies for peanuts  caused widespread unemployment  wage reductions and recession   she said   Neves  a former state governor whose party ruled Brazil from 1995 to 2002  pointed to Sunday s votes as a sign that a majority of Brazilians want a change of government and vowed to restore growth to Brazil s stagnant economy and deliver better jobs and salaries   He appealed to voters disenchanted with Brazil s political establishment who did not vote on Sunday to come out and back him   Brazil needs a government that works   he said   Rousseff has a strong base of support among Brazil s lower classes but is also up against a widespread desire for change in a country where many Brazilians see their politicians as self serving and corrupt    In her TV ad  Rousseff vowed to crack down  very hard  on corruption    But a festering corruption scandal involving state run oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA and three political parties from the ruling coalition threatens to dog her for the rest of the campaign after testimony from a former Petrobras executive was leaked on Thursday   In a recorded plea bargain that was aired on Brazilian television  Paulo Roberto Costa  the former head of Petrobras  refining and supply unit  said Rousseff s Workers  Party and two allied parties shared the proceeds of a 3 percent kickback from construction  shipbuilding and other contracts   The Workers  Party and Petrobras denied the allegations  dismissing them as a politicized smear campaign  The Neves camp latched on to the case  using it to argue that Rousseff and the Workers  Party are soft on corruption    This is sad episode in the history of Petrobras and of Brazil  Corruption has always existed  but when it appears to be organized by party leaders it makes you angry   said Mansueto

93936,315451,PBR,Rousseff win rattles Brazil markets  focus turns to economy,news,"By Brad Haynes and Paulo Prada  SAO PAULO  Reuters    President Dilma Rousseff s narrow re election victory met with cold reality on Monday as Brazil s financial markets tumbled on doubts that she can restore confidence in the economy and maintain political support in a sharply divided nation    Rousseff overcame dissatisfaction with a sluggish economy and poor public services to clinch a second term on Sunday by a slim margin  dashing the hopes of investors and nearly half the electorate who bet on her pro business challenger    Finance Minister Guido Mantega  whose replacement is the focus of intense speculation  tried to beat back the pessimism with promises to control inflation and close a budget deficit in the four years ahead  although he added that the election showed popular approval for Rousseff s economic policies   Brazil s currency  the real  extended losses after Mantega s comments  dropping to a nearly six year low    Rousseff said last month that Mantega would step down at the end of the year  and government sources say her short list of potential replacements includes a businessman  a former finance ministry official and her current chief of staff   Whoever takes the reins at the finance ministry  investors are skeptical that Rousseff can pull off a swift recovery after four years of ineffective industrial policies  She now faces the challenge of delivering on campaign promises to expand social benefits for the poor while balancing a strained federal budget   Major state run companies whose profits have suffered under Rousseff plunged in Monday trading  including a 12 percent drop for scandal plagued oil giant Petrobras  The benchmark Bovespa stock index fell 5 percent   Fitch Ratings warned in a note that it could downgrade credit ratings for Brazilian companies next year due to weak domestic demand  falling prices for the country s raw materials and Rousseff s misdirected industrial policies    Clearer signals of reduced state involvement in the private sector during her second term would be important to improving business confidence and reviving investments   wrote Fitch analysts led by Joe Bormann   Investors hope a more market friendly finance minister can help restore fiscal discipline  bring transparency to the federal budget and better engage with business leaders  Some believe that Rousseff will be forced by economic realities to soften some of her interventionist policies   Announcements of new cabinet members are unlikely in coming days  presidential aides said  as Rousseff rests after a demanding campaign that went down to a photo finish    BE A BETTER PRESIDENT   Speaking to a relieved crowd of supporters on Sunday night  Rousseff struggled to raise her voice as she acknowledged the call for change expressed by many voters in remarks that some observers hoped were a sign of a shift to the center     I know that I am being sent back to the presidency to make the big changes that Brazilian society demands   she said after winning the runoff with 51 6 percent of the votes   I want to be a much better president than I have been until now    Her slim  three point margin over centrist candidate Aecio Neves came largely thanks to gains against inequality and poverty since the Workers  Party first came to power in 2003   Using the fruits of a commodity fueled economic boom in the last decade  Brazil s government expanded welfare programs that helped lift more than 40 million people from poverty despite the current economic woes   The  Brazilian model  has been adopted by center left parties across Latin America and Rousseff s victory  however narrow  is a blow for conservatives in the region    It also means there will be no dramatic improvement in ties with the United States  hit in recent years by trade disputes and U S  government spying programs that infuriated Rousseff   About 40 percent of Brazil s 200 million people live in households earning less than  700 a month  and it was their overwhelming support that gave Rousseff victory on Sunday    Now she pledges to deepen social benefits while working to revive an economy that fell into recession this year   In her victory speech  Rousseff also renewed her calls for a political reform to reduce corporate influence in campaign finance and restore faith in Brazil s messy multi party politics  The president will have a tougher time with far reaching reforms  however  after her coalition lost seats in both houses of Congress this year    Such a tight result reduces her capacity to radicalize policies   said Alberto Bernal  a Miami based economist with Bulltick Capital Markets   Pretty much half of the country is against what she has been doing    MORE HEADWINDS  A sluggish economy will also make Rousseff s second term tougher  straining a government model accustomed to high tax revenues to finance social programs and subsidized credit for companies and consumers    Brazil s economy  after growing by as much as 7 5 percent the year before she took office  is on track to expand less than 1 percent this year  Prior efforts to gun growth  largely through tax breaks and other subsidies for select industries  have largely fallen flat   Meanwhile  inflation  long a problem in a country with a history of runaway prices  is now hovering above the government s tolerance ceiling of 6 5 percent    And while unemployment is near record lows  economists don t expect it to remain so for long as plunging investment  slower growth and further uncertainty prompt employers to cut back   To correct the course  economists say Rousseff must pursue long pending tax and labor reforms in order to increase productivity and engage further with the global marketplace    But Rousseff will face gridlock in a Congress increasingly weary of the ruling party  which lost seats in this election along with its most important ally  Leading lawmakers promise to make hay over a snowballing corruption scandal at state run oil company Petrobras    After a brilliantly executed re election campaign  Rousseff will need brilliantly executed economic policy to get Brazil moving again anytime soon  wrote Citi analysts Stephen Graham and Fernando Siqueira in a note to clients

93944,315459,PBR,Oil   Gas Stock Roundup  SemGroup Buys Terminal Co   Encana   Centrica Sell Gas Assets,opinion,"It was a week where oil prices dropped to the lowest close since May 4 amid a bearish inventory data  while supportive weather forecasts pushed natural gas futures higher 
On the news front  energy midstream operator SemGroup Corp    NYSE E   is set to buy oil terminal assets on Houston Ship Channel for  2 1 billion  while Canada based Encana Corp    NYSE ECA   and U K s Centrica  LON CNA  plc   OTC CPYYY   struck separate deals to sell natural gas properties     
Overall  it was a mixed week for the sector  While West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude futures fell 3 8  to close at  45 83 per barrel  natural gas prices gained 1 3  to  3 039 per million Btu  MMBtu    See the last  Oil   Gas Stock Roundup  here    
Oil prices sank to a one month low  spooked by the U S  Energy Department s inventory release  The report revealed that crude stockpiles recorded an unexpected build after eight straight weekly draws  Moreover  refined product inventories   gasoline and distillate   both rose by significantly larger than expected amounts  Investors also fretted over the burgeoning rig count  pointing to the ever increasing shale drilling activities 
Meanwhile  natural gas futures ticked higher despite a bigger than expected increase in supplies  Forecasts for warmer weather and the resultant expectations for strong demand helped the commodity eke out a small gain 
Recap of the Week s Most Important Stories1     Tulsa based midstream player SemGroup Corp  recently clinched a  2 1 billion deal to acquire Houston Fuel Oil Terminal Co  from investment funds managed by Alinda Capital Partners  The agreement will advance SemGroup s Gulf Coast strategy and provide the company with ownership of one of the largest U S  oil terminals  Scheduled to close in the third quarter of 2017  the pact would also enable SemGroup to gain ownership of about 330 acres along the Houston Ship Channel Houston Fuel Oil Terminal stores  blends and transports residual and crude oil via pipeline  ship  barge  rail and truck  With the capacity of 16 8 million barrels  the Houston based terminal along the U S  Gulf Coast has extensive pipeline connectivity  The terminal is currently on its expansion phase having a number of projects underway  These include a new ship dock  a new pipeline and connections  as well as an additional 1 45 million barrels of crude oil storage  expected to be in service by mid 2018 The addition of the Houston based terminal is set to expand the geographical diversity and footprint of SemGroup  which currently owns assets in Colorado  Eagle Ford  North Texas  Oklahoma  North Dakota  Canada  Mexico and U K  The terminal is also complementary to SemGroup s existing assets in the middle of North America The deal would also enable SemGroup to gain synergies and leverage the well established and long tenured customer base  This in turn will boost shareholders value  Read more    2     Canadian natural gas producer Encana Corp  recently clinched a  735 million deal to offload assets in the Piceance Basin on Colorado s Western Slope to Denver based private upstream player Caerus Oil and Gas LLC for  735 million in cash  This marks the end of Encana s 15 years run in the basin Per the agreement  Encana will divest over 550 000 leased acres and 3 100 operated wells  The assets produced about 240 million cubic feet per day of natural gas and 2 178 barrels per day of liquids in the first quarter of 2017  with estimated proved reserves of 814 billion cubic feet of gas equivalent at the end of 2016 Further  Encana will also get rid of  430 million of contractual pipeline obligations  with Caerus taking over these commitments  Following the completion of the deal  around 140 employees working on Colorado s Western Slope are likely to join Caerus The agreement   set to close in the third quarter   is in sync with the Encana s strategy to streamline its portfolio and focus on its four chief asset plays   the Montney and Duvernay gas formations in British Columbia and Alberta and the Permian and Eagle Ford formations in Texas  The transaction will streamline the company s portfolio through the sale of non core assets and help them to refocus their production spending in core plays and fewer geographical areas In addition to the cash received  Encana will also benefit by reducing its midstream commitments by about  430 million  The sale of Piceance assets is likely to make Encana more efficient and strengthen financials  The proceeds from the sale are likely to be utilized by the company to repay the debt  which

executives  reflecting the breach of anti corruption terms by the J F group During contract negotiations  the price conditions Petrobras had agreed upon with Ambar were based on market criteria  However  as part of a plea bargain  J F owners Joesley and Wesley Batista admitted that Ambar was able to secure artificially low prices for the natural gas Petrobras imported from Bolivia Joesley Batista gave prosecutors a recording of a conversation with Brazilian President Michel Temer in which Joesley asked for help in an antitrust dispute between Ambar and Petrobras over the terms of the supply contract  Petrobras intends to seek claims of around R  70 million or  21 9 million from Ambar due to the alleged breach of contract

93958,315473,PBR,Rousseff s election strategy digs deeper hole for Brazil economy,news,"By Brian Winter and Alonso Soto  SAO PAULO BRASILIA  Reuters    President Dilma Rousseff s strategy of slamming bankers and playing up class divisions may give her the edge in this month s election but it further strains relations with business leaders just as Brazil s stagnant economy badly needs fresh investment   The leftist incumbent  who led the first round of voting on Sunday and now faces market favorite Aecio Neves in an Oct  26 runoff  is using heavy government spending and some tough rhetoric to shore up her support among Brazil s poor   The ruling Workers  Party has used a similar approach to win the last three presidential elections in a country with a vast wealth gap  and Rousseff is doubling down on it in Brazil s closest and most volatile campaign in decades   She is focusing on her party s impressive record of reducing poverty during its 12 years in power while portraying Neves  Brazilian Socialist Democracy Party  PSDB   which led the country in 1995 to 2002  as beholden to the wealthy    We re going to have another dispute with the PSDB  which governed for a third of the population and forgot the neediest   Rousseff said on Sunday night after Neves had a last minute surge in support to grab second place and a runoff spot   She hammered on the same theme on Monday  lambasting the PSDB as the party of the rich and dismissing a market rally following Neves  strong showing as irrelevant    Investors can do all they want  but they don t win elections   Rousseff said   The people win elections    Last month  her team ran a TV ad criticizing the proposals of another market friendly rival by showing bankers in suits sitting around a table and laughing as food disappeared from the plates of a poor family   Rousseff s advisers believe the campaign does no lasting damage because investors understand that attacks on bankers are part of the election process since the global financial crisis  even in the United States and other rich countries    I think the rhetoric that we see against the private sector will fizzle very quickly if she wins   said Carlos Thadeu de Freitas  chief economist with Brazil s National Confederation of Commerce and a former central bank director   Yet others say the Workers  Party approach is more dangerous than in the last three elections  because of the particular problems facing Latin America s largest economy   Last decade  Brazil grew nearly 4 percent a year thanks to hefty demand for commodities from China and a big rise in consumer credit and spending  But growth has slowed to below 2 percent a year under Rousseff due to infrastructure bottlenecks and other supply side problems that only investment can fix   Rousseff already had a poor reputation among investors who distrust her penchant for state intervention in the economy   Several senior executives told Reuters that Rousseff s campaign rhetoric may prevent her from repeating efforts  seen during her first term  to reach out to leaders in industry and finance  a  charm offensive  aimed at winning their confidence    If she thinks we re marching up to Brasilia again next year  she can forget it   a leading financial executive in Sao Paulo said on condition of anonymity   FISCAL SLIPPAGE  Most investors and business leaders in Brazil want a change in government  largely because of the weaker economic growth and public finances   The government all but abandoned its 2014 budget savings target as it ramped up spending on social programs and pork barrel projects in what critics say was an election year effort to shore up support among the poor and its coalition partners in Congress   Former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva used a similar strategy in 2010 to help ensure that Rousseff  his chosen successor  won the election   In polls taken before the first round of voting on Sunday  Rousseff led Neves by about 6 percentage points in the event of a runoff  That was due to a 22 point lead among voters in households earning less than about  700 a month   who account for about 40 percent of the electorate  Neves led among all other income groups   The short term benefits to heavy spending are obvious but it could create a major budget headache for Rousseff   or Neves  if he pulls off an upset    The deterioration of the country s finances is such that whoever wins the presidency will have very little room to maneuver next year   Marcos Mendes  a fiscal consultant with the Senate and former treasury official between 1989 and 1992   In 2010  the economy grew 7 5 percent  helped by a commodities fueled boom  Lula had built up a good reputation on Wall Street  and most investors were willing to look past the divisive rhetoric and missed budget goal in his final year   Today  Brazil s investment rate has fallen to just 16 5 percent of gross domestic product  That is well below the 20 percent plus rates seen in other Latin American countries like Colombia and Peru  where economic growth has been much faster   Investors have two major misgivings about Rousseff  that she has turned her back on fiscal rigor  and that she distrusts the private sector even if she isn t as hostile to it as governments in neighboring Venezuela or Argentina   Rousseff s defenders say she has had to deal with a tough global economy that has also affected other emerging markets  and that the fiscal problems are partly the result of tax cuts that business leaders themselves asked for   Through August  the government met only a tenth of its 2014 primary budget surplus target of 99 billion reais  or about 1 9 percent of GDP  That makes it almost impossible to meet a goal that it had already lowered from 3 1 percent of GDP at the start of the year   A primary surplus is the government s balance of revenues and spending  minus debt interest payments   The weaker fiscal position led Standard   Poor s to cut its sovereign debt rating closer to speculative territory in March  and Moody s Investors Service is threatening to do the same   Rousseff has suggested that she would address the concerns of ratings agencies and others by making some spending cuts in early 2015  though they would be limited and gradual   Anything more would be politically difficult since Rousseff has accused Neves of planning a  big squeeze  on spending if he is elected  a line of attack her advisers say will become even more pronounced before the runoff   In an olive branch to the private sector  Rousseff recently said she would replace Finance Minister Guido Mantega in a second term  although his departure was already expected and the president makes many of the key financial decisions herself   Charles Lieberman  founder of Advisors Capital Management  an investment fund with  1 billion in stocks and other assets under management  said he sold all shares in state run oil giant Petroleo Brasileiro SA  SA PETR4  early in Rousseff s term because of her meddling in the company and the economy at large   
Her behavior in this election campaign has been  worrying   he said   To me  it all just says  Stay away       Editing by Todd Benson and Kieran Murray ",2014-10-07,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/rousseff's-election-strategy-digs-deeper-hole-for-brazil-economy-312137,312137
93959,315474,PBR,Brazil And Emerging Markets  Muy Bueno,opinion,"In 2016  Technology didn t do very well  The NASDAQ was up 6  7  when looking at the full year returns of the NASDAQ Composite and the NASDAQ 100  while the S P 500 rose 11 9  last year and the Russell rose over 21  
Technology remains our largest overweight 
We never owned Emerging Markets for clients until Q1  16  when the 10 year return on the Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF  NYSE VWO  and the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF  NYSE EEM  both turned negative  Josh Brown over at the Reformed Broker started writing about the outflows from the Emerging Markets space in late 2015  which was a reaction to the China devaluation meltdown in late July   early August  15  That started getting us interested in the space   Pimco also made a prescient call on EM s in the Spring of  16 too   it was written about   
Part of the lack of appeal of the asset class is that these countries are commodity based economies  with a lot of debt and heavily tied to Energy too  and well  none of those asset classes did well in the disinflation that followed 2008 
Brazil was truly unique since not only did it have ties to Energy via Petroleo Brasileiro Petrobras SA DRC  NYSE PBR  and the grain markets via soybeans exports  etc   look at how Caterpillar  NYSE CAT  and Deere  NYSE DE  performed post 2008  but you had the corruption trial of Dilma Rousseff occurring just as Energy and commodity prices were melting down in late 2015  early 2016 
The iShares MSCI Brazil Capped Fund  NYSE EWZ  was too good to pass up and we took a position in it for clients in early  2016  to the tune of 1  2  of client accounts 
Brazil and the EWZ was the poster child for commodity price pressure  weak currency  a corrupt socialist government  and much more 
The above chart looks like EWZ is on the verge of breaking out if its 8 9 year downtrend off the 2007 highs near  102 in May  2008  EWZ turned up as Rousseff left office  and a more free market  business oriented government took over 
One of the few things I did right pre 2008  besides not owning any housing or residential real estate directly for clients  was that clients were kept out of the very hot commodity and Emerging Market and China plays that attracted so much money from 2000 2008  The EWZ fell  70 or roughly 70  in value from May  08 through October  08 
While the above chart shows  40 could be tough resistance  watch how that key price level plays out 
The VWO  EEM and the EWZ all look like they are trying to move out of long term downtrends  The lowest client cost basis on the EWZ is roughly  20  with the majority bought around  27  28 
Total exposure to the asset class is probably between 3  5  of client accounts  depending on the client 
A  return to global growth  theme and a return to faster GDP growth around the globe  and some reflation  I think bodes very well for this asset class 
Emerging Markets at least in the near term will likely be more closely correlated to the S P 500 too ",2017-02-16,Brian Gilmartin,https://www.investing.com/analysis/brazil-and-emerging-markets-–-muy-bueno-200175861,200175861
93960,315475,PBR,Will Aramco IPO Investors Get Burned ,opinion,"Wall Street is buzzing  The largest IPO in history will hit the market next year 
Saudi Arabia s state owned oil giant  Saudi Aramco  will go public in 2018  The company could be worth  2 trillion    or more 
But not much of it is being sold  The Aramco IPO will offer just 5  of shares to the public 
So why is it even bothering  The reason is simple    Saudi Arabia needs the cash to fund its economic diversification plan  The goal is to make its economy less dependent on oil prices 
The Chinese government is expected to be a big buyer of the Aramco IPO  Buying shares is one more way China can feed its oil addiction 
And while it may be tempting to buy shares of the world s largest oil company  you should think twice before you pull out your wallet  History repeats itself  and state owned oil companies don t have a very profitable history   
A History of Underperformance
This week s chart shows that government backed IPOs haven t gone well in the past 
Over the last 11 years  countries such as Brazil  Russia and Kazakhstan have all listed shares of state run oil and gas companies  But as you can see  after an initial spike in interest  their share prices and market valuations have lagged private sector firms like Exxon Mobil  NYSE  NYSE XOM  
Petroleo Brasileiro Petrobras  NYSE PBR  stock price has fallen on hard times recently  Since the 2010 IPO  Petrobras  management has been accused of corruption  more on that in a moment   Buyers have avoided the stock 
Rosneft  LON ROSNq   the Russian state owned oil company  went public on the London Stock Exchange in 2006  But U S  economic sanctions against Russia have hurt operations and investor sentiment 
KazMunaiGas Exploration Production  LSE  KMG  also was listed in London in 2006  Today  the company s minority shareholders are battling the Kazakhstan government for control of the company  So far  they have failed  and many outsiders have dumped the stock out of frustration 
Serving Two Masters
Why do these state run companies always run into problems  Partially because they often don t know how to be public companies  They have a hard time making the transition 
A public company with government ownership doesn t have to please just its shareholders  It s also beholden to its government  Aramco will likely end up in the same conundrum 
State run companies aren t generally as profitable  They often have higher costs  employ more people and pay more taxes  And shareholder value isn t necessarily the company s first priority  Its government may have other goals in mind 
We saw this problem rear its head in Brazil recently  Now impeached President Dilma Rousseff stuffed the Petrobras board with her own political allies  This was the beginning of a massive scandal  which ultimately led to the removal of Rousseff s entire government 
The Petrobras scandal is one example of how state run oil companies can easily become political pawns  Many investors feel that these politically entangled investments are just too risky 
Saudi Arabia is certain to be a big winner of the Aramco IPO  But for buyers  the outcome is less clear  It s too early to tell whether the Aramco IPO will be a good deal for shareholders 
Remember  bigger doesn t always mean better when it comes to investing  And state run companies rarely put shareholders first 
For now  buying shares of the oil majors like Exxon is the safer play ",2017-03-26,Investment U,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-aramco-ipo-investors-get-burned-200180138,200180138
93961,315476,PBR,Petrobras Rating Upgraded By Moody s On Improved Liquidity,opinion,"Brazil oil giant Petroleo Brasileiro S A   aka Petrobras   NYSE PBR   earned its second credit rating upgrade in the last five years as the rating agency Moody s Investors Service raised the company s corporate debt rating by one level to B1  Moody s has also revised the outlook for all ratings from stable to positive  indicating that the company is no longer faces the risk of being downgraded any time soon  The positive outlook implies that further positive rating actions can occur provided the company s liquidity and overall credit risk continues to improve  making it more attractive for investments 
In Feb 2015  Petrobras lost its investment grade at Moody s due to severe corruption charges against the company  Many of the company s officials were arrested as a part of the Operation Car Wash investigation  In Feb 2016  the company was downgraded to the lowest speculative level  However  in Oct 2016  Moody s had upgraded the company s ratings to B2 
Further  a couple of days back  Moody s upgraded all ratings for Petrobras on account of improving financial metrics and liquidity of the company in the recent quarters  The company s debt refinancing transactions and disciplined operational management also attributed to the ratings upgradation and positive outlook 
Petrobras  shares which had plummeted to around  3 in Jan 2016  rallied more than three times  closing at  9 66 as on Apr 12  This can be attributed to the company s lower capital spending initiatives  increase in the oil prices  strengthening Brazilian currency and a favorable regulatory environment in Brazil  These tailwinds have improved the liquidity position and the overall financials of the company to some extent 
The new fuel pricing policy adopted by the company has also helped it to increase margins in the downstream operations  The company which is burdened by huge debt has reduced its capital investment for 2017 2021 by 25  not only to curb costs but also to clear debts 
Currently Petrobras is concentrating on improving its liquidity and operational performance  The company s efforts to deleverage or at least refinance its debt obligations to extend its maturity also work in favor  The company s rigorous divestment goals will help in reinstating its financial health by mitigating the leverage 
However  the company at present is reeling under immense debt burden which can t be resolved smoothly until the cash flow is positive  Petrobras still has  8 8B in debt maturing in 2017 and another  11 3B maturing in 2018  Also  any negative developments from the pending litigation cases against the company may hamper the financials adversely  Therefore the state  run integrated energy company carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  

The company has outperformed the Zacks categorized industry over the past year  During the aforesaid period  while shares of Petrobras rallied almost 46   the broader industry gained around 28  
Better ranked players in the broader industry include Penn Virginia Corp    NASDAQ PVAC    Antero Resources Corp    NYSE AR   and Crescent Point Energy Corp    TO CPG    All the three companies sport a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see 
Pen Virginia reported positive average earnings surprise of 36 67  in the last four quarters 
Antero Resources reported positive average earnings surprise of 239 1  in the last four quarters 
Crescent Point Energy reported positive average earnings surprise of 127 2  in the last four quarters

Oil prices sank to multi month lows after reports showed that output by members of the OPEC cartel   whose associate nations supply around 40  of the world s crude   rose to an all time high in Oct  At 33 64 million barrels a day  current production is way over OPEC s target to limit volumes to a range of 32 5 million   33 million barrels a day  Given the recent data sets  investors have started doubting whether OPEC will be able to rein in production as part of the plan reached in Sep 
Adding to the pessimism was the U S  Energy Department s weekly inventory release  which showed a dramatic increase in domestic crude production 
Meanwhile  natural gas also turned sharply lower following a larger than anticipated inventory build that pushed the commodity s storage level to a new all time high  The commodity was further hampered by a warmer than normal weather that translates into weak demand for the heating fuel

93992,315507,PBR,Seadrill Equity Is Hugely Over Levered,opinion,"Seadrill Limited  NYSE SDRL   while sporting one of the youngest fleets in the industry  is hugely over levered  By the middle of 2017 net debt EBITDA will hit 7x  above their maximum level of 6 5x  They previously amended this so there is likely no room left  If sponsors don t contribute  1 2B in capital  the equity will need to be restructured  SDRL also has over  4B in capex due through 2019 and this includes 14 newbuilds that are being delivered 
Why does the opportunity exist  Value investors are focusing too heavily on P NAV and historical trough multiples as a crutch  rather than the future earnings power of the company  Trailing multiples are distorted as they are based on peak day rates  which have been in free fall and will continue to decline unless supply is rapidly taken off the market  At current prices  just north of  3  the stock is trading at a mid double digit forward EBITDA multiple 
At current day rates  the majority of the industry is operating below cash break even due to high expenses that will continue until drillers accelerate the process of cold stacking and scrapping rigs  Seadrill is in a particularly bad place given a large newbuild queue of both floaters   jack ups that will be unable to find profitable work at today s day rates 
On top of a supply glut amongst offshore drillers  onshore drillers continue to reduce break even costs and increase productivity  This serves to reduce the attractiveness of offshore drilling and extends the length of this down cycle A litany of catalysts exist to send both Seadrill lower  most of which are not priced in  more backlog cancellations in the vein of Petroleo Brasileiro Petrobras SA  NYSE PBR   or potential for impairments and write downs  If Seadrill avoids restructuring  they will have to issue dilutive equity to bridge a funding gap in 2017

94046,315561,PBR,Brazil  The Rise From The Bottom Continues ,opinion,"We began to get bullish on Brazil in March  you can read the Bloomberg coverage of our analysis    Since that time  Brazilian market and economic conditions have continued to move ahead  supporting a shift in business and consumer confidence  and shifting the psychology of global investors  The 2016 Summer Olympics open in Rio on August 5  barring mishaps  the games should also bolster the sense that Brazil has put the worst behind it 
One of the star performers of Brazil s recovery from the economy s lows has been the state oil company  Petr leo Brasileiro S A   NYSE PBR   better known as Petrobras  The company was at the epicenter of the bribery and corruption scandal that has taken down dozens of senior figures in Brazilian business and politics  including the current president  Dilma Rousseff  against whom impeachment proceedings are ongoing  
Brazilian Energy Expertise Is Prodigious
Underneath the scandals  and in spite of the corruption  the Brazilian energy sector  including PBR  has a remarkable technical track record  particularly in the development of the off shore reserves known as  pre salt   The pre salt reserves exist on both sides of the Atlantic  off the shores of Brazil and Angola  They originated when Africa and South America split apart more than a hundred million years ago  the result of organic matter laid down in vast lakes that were inundated by the sea and buried by later volcanic activity 
These large reserves are among the most technically difficult offshore reserves to recover  The total depth of pre salt wells can include miles of water  sedimentary and volcanic rock  and compressed ancient salt  The technical complexities of identifying  mapping  and drilling    not to mention the sheer logistics of carrying out such a project hundreds of miles offshore    were daunting  But the pre salt wells are now flowing  with completion costs down to  80 million from an initial  240 million 
Pre salt production was 41 000 barrels per day in 2010 and in May 2016 it exceeded 1 million barrels per day  Meanwhile  two of the three large geological formations remain largely unexplored  Pre salt production is the culmination of nearly a half century of offshore experience  In spite of Brazil s political and economic woes  the Brazilian energy sector has been no slouch in terms of technical innovation and expertise  It can continue to benefit as the global energy sector rebounds from its deep cyclical downturn  and as Brazil continues to move forward from its recent political chaos 
The confluence of the global commodity downturn and the climax of Brazil s political storm took the Brazil s currency  the real  to lows last seen in 2002  From the bottom in January  the real has seen significant appreciation  In late June  Brexit jitters caused it to spike  and action by Brazil s central bank damped it down again  It remains in an upward channel  driven by global desire for the high yield of Brazilian debt 
We are bullish on Brazilian debt  because we believe that interest rates can fall  and the real can continue to appreciate  However  the real is close to the top of its channel  and a 5 to 10  correction is possible  The Brazilian government knows that the real s collapse has done indispensable work in helping boost exports and curtail imports  and the central bank may take action from time to time to control the currency s continued appreciation 
In sum  Brazil is doing better  and in the medium term  we continue to be bullish on Brazilian bonds and the Brazilian currency  while we look for a near term correction 

Investment implications  We re bullish on Brazil  We favor Brazilian bonds and currency  although we believe that there may be a near term correction in the real as the Brazilian government moderates its ascent  When such a correction has occurred  we may also become bullish on Brazilian stocks ",2016-07-29,Tim Shirata,https://www.investing.com/analysis/brazil:-the-rise-from-the-bottom-continues-200144863,200144863

consistently beating estimates quarter upon quarter  In fact  the Houston based offshore driller has an excellent track record  its beaten estimates in each of the last four quarters at an impressive average rate of 290 52   This  together with its balance sheet strength  helped Diamond Offshore outperform the sector over the past year  However  a look at the company s latest fleet status report

sometime back  earning Diamond Offshore a Zacks Momentum Style Score of  D  So What s a Momentum Style Score As evident from the Diamond Offshore story  stocks can take a sudden turn for the good  or bad   making stock picking a risky game  Every good stock also has its bad day  which further adds to the risk  At the same time  this volatility can be exploited to make significant profits  which is where the Momentum Style Score enters the picture The Momentum Style Score is an indication of the time to buy a stock to benefit from rising share prices  The highest score is an A  so getting in on an A and out on a B or C could be a strategy for short term gains  For a more in depth understanding  check out our  But investors should bear in mind that this is a speculative strategy and not meant

94078,315593,PBR,Oil   Gas Stock Roundup  Energy Transfer Quits Williams Deal  Kinder Morgan Sells 50  Ohio Pipeline Stake,opinion,"It was a week where oil prices moved higher on fading Brexit concerns  while natural gas futures soared to a 13 month high 
On the news front  Energy Transfer Equity L P    NYSE ETE   walked away from the merger with Williams Companies Inc    NYSE WMB    while Kinder Morgan Inc    NYSE KMI   agreed to sell a 50  stake in its Utopia Pipeline Project 
Overall  it was a good week for the sector  West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude futures added 2 8  to close at  48 99 per barrel  while natural gas prices jumped 12 2  to  2 987 per million Btu  MMBtu    See the last  Oil   Gas Stock Roundup  here    
Oil prices moved north for the first time in 3 weeks on subsiding fears about the effects of Brexit   the short way of saying Britain s exit from the EU   on crude demand  A weaker dollar  which made the greenback priced crude cheaper for investors holding foreign currency  also lent support 
Things were further helped by the U S  Energy Department s weekly inventory release that showed a large drop in crude stockpiles  However  some of the gains were erased after the Baker Hughes report revealed a rise in the U S  oil rig count   indicating resurgence in shale drilling activities Oils Energy Sector Price Index
Natural gas gained big following another lower than average build and predictions of strong cooling demand with forecasts of warmer temperature across the country over the next few days 
Recap of the Week s Most Important Stories1     Texas pipeline operator Energy Transfer Equity L P  reported that it has ended its merger agreement to buy rival natural gas pipeline company Williams Companies Inc   following the ruling by the Delaware Court of Chancery Few days back  the court ruled in favor of Energy Transfer Equity  Notably  the ruling came in a lawsuit filed by Williams to hold Energy Transfer Equity to the deal  In May  Williams took the legal step when Energy Transfer Equity expressed concerns over the merger citing that the deal had not secured the necessary legal opinion to make it tax free for shareholders But much to the dismay of Williams  the Delaware Court concluded that Energy Transfer Equity is contractually entitled to end the merger agreement with Williams in the event that the company s counsel Latham   Watkins LLP were unable to deliver a required tax opinion prior to the merger deadline date of  June 28  2016   See More    2     Houston  TX based energy infrastructure provider Kinder Morgan Inc  announced that it has divested a 50  stake in the Utopia Pipeline Project to private equity firm Riverstone Investment Group LLC Per the agreement  Riverstone would provide an upfront cash payment  consisting of the reimbursement to Kinder Morgan for its 50  share prior capital expenditures and a payment in excess of capital expenditure to recognize the value created in developing the project  The total project cost is estimated at  500 million The Utopia Pipeline is a common carrier project that will include approximately 215 miles of new  12 inch diameter pipeline constructed entirely within the state of Ohio   from Harrison County to Fulton County  The pipeline will facilitate the transport of ethane and ethane propane mixtures to petrochemical companies operating in Ontario  Canada  to be used as a feedstock in the production of plastics   See More    3     Energy producer Hess Corp    NYSE HES   tasted success in the Liza 2 exploration well in the Stabroek block  offshore Guyana  The results indicate that Liza prospect is a world class oil discovery with estimated recoverable resources between 800 million and 1 4 billion barrels of oil equivalent Located in the Stabroek block  the Liza wells are about 120 miles  193 kilometers  offshore Guyana  The Stabroek block spans across an acreage of 6 6 million acres  26 800 square kilometers  Drilled by an affiliate of Exxon Mobil Corp  NYSE XOM    the Liza 2 well was drilled to a total depth of 17 963 feet  5 475 meters  in 5 551 feet  1 692 meters  of water  The Exxon Mobil unit is also the operator of the Stabroek block with a stake of 45   Other partners in the block are Hess Guyana Exploration Ltd  and CNOOC Nexen Petroleum Guyana Ltd  with 30  and 25  interest  respectively   See More    4     As part of it s previously announced divestment plan to deal with its massive debt  Brazil s state run energy giant Petrobras   NYSE PBR   has put up nine shallow water oil fields in the northeastern states of Cear  and Sergipe for sale  These fields produce a total of 13 000 barrels of oil and equivalent natural gas a day from multiple wells The proposed divestment  however  is not expected to result in a significant reduction in Petrobras   126 billion debt  This is because the nine fields contribute less than 1  of the total production of the company  Also  the sale is unlikely to draw the same level of interest as the integrated player s prized deep water  pre salt oil fields  which will be up for auction in 2017 5     British energy major BP plc  LON BP    NYSE BP    on behalf of Tangguh Production Sharing Contract Partners  declared that its Tangguh Expansion Project in the Papua Barat Province of Indonesia has received approval for the Final Investment Decision  FID  This FID decision follows the Government of Indonesia s approval of the Plan of Development II in late 2012  The contracts for the project s key engineering  procurement and construction  EPC  are anticipated in the third quarter of 2016  while the construction is expected to begin soon afterward  The project is scheduled to come online in 2020 The scope of the project includes construction of a third LNG process train  Train 3   The production capacity will also be augmented by 3 8 million tons per annum  mtpa   thereby increasing the total plant capacity to 11 4 mtpa  This apart  the project has two offshore platforms  13 new production wells  an expanded LNG loading facility and supporting infrastructure

94087,315602,PBR,3 Reasons Value Stock Investors Will Love Petrobras  PBR ,opinion,Many investors like to look for value in stocks  but this can be very tough to define  There is great debate regarding which metrics are the best to focus on in this regard  and which are not really quality indicators of future performance  Fortunately  with our new  we have identified the key statistics to pay close attention to and thus which stocks might be the best for value investors in the near term This method discovered several great candidates for value oriented investors  but today let s focus on Petr leo Brasileiro S A    Petrobras   NYSE PBR  as this stock is looking especially impressive right now  And while there are numerous reasons why this is the case  we have highlighted three of the most vital reasons for PBR s status as a solid value stock below Forward PE for Petrobras Easily one of the most popular readings for value investors  the forward PE ratio shows us the current price of a stock divided by the full year earnings  Generally speaking  value investors like to see this ratio below 20  though it can vary by industry Right now  PBR has a forward PE of just 14 83  which means that investors are paying  14 83 for each dollar in expected Petrobras earnings this year  Compared to the industry at large this is pretty favorable as the overall space has an average PE of 18 53 in comparison PETROBRAS ADR C PE Ratio  TTM    Price Cash Flow for Petrobras StockAn often overlooked ratio that can still be a great indicator of value is the price cash flow metric  This reading is preferred by some since it avoids amortization and depreciation concerns and can give a more accurate picture of the financial health in a business The P CF ratio for PBR comes in at 2 26  and since investors are generally looking for a reading under 20 here  this is pretty good news  Meanwhile  we should also point out that the industry average for this metric is 3 01  so Petrobras has its peers beat in this regard too PBR Earnings Estimate Revisions Moving in the Right DirectionThe solid value ratios outlined in the preceding paragraphs might be enough for some investors  but we should also note that the earnings estimate revisions have been trending in a positive direction as well  Analysts who follow PBR stock have been raising their estimates for the company lately  meaning that the EPS picture is looking a bit more favorably for Petrobras now Over the past 30 days  2 earnings estimates have gone higher compared to 1 lower for the full year  while we are also seeing that 2 estimates has move upwards with 1 downward revision for the next year time frame too   These revisions have helped to boost the consensus estimate as 30 days ago PBR was expected to post earnings of 42 cents per share for the full year though today it looks to have EPS of 55 cents for the full year Bottom LineFor the reasons detailed above  investors shouldn t be surprised to read that we have PBR as a stock with a Value Score of  A  and a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   So if you are a value investor  definitely keep PBR on your short list as this looks to be a stock that is very well positioned for gains in the near term ,2016-07-14,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-reasons-value-stock-investors-will-love-petrobras-(pbr)-200141905,200141905
94094,315609,PBR,Exxon Mobil And 4 Other Energy Stocks To Buy This Summer,opinion,After a prolonged period of weakness  crude prices have ultimately started to improve  especially from the mid February lows  Last month  oil prices settled above the psychologically important  50 per barrel level for the first time in more than 10 months This is definitely good news for upstream energy players as their business is directly related to the price of crude  However  the big question in everyone s mind now is  will the shine in black gold last through summer  Analysts have varied opinion that is confusing investors  But there is nothing really to worry about Crude on Path to RecoveryAfter mid 2014 the oversupplied crude market started taking a toll on oil prices amid lackluster global demand  Crude started running down a steep mountain to touch the bottom  While doing so  the commodity also compelled the market to follow the same route  Eventually  the major benchmarks were in the red after oil started hitting multi year bottoms  Also  week after week  major energy players started touching their respective 52 week lows   The trend was also maintained in the beginning of this year and in mid February  West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude fell to a 12 year low mark of  26 05 per barrel which reflected investors  worries over the excess supply in crude markets However  all of a sudden  the commodity market took a U turn and managed to cross the  50 a barrel mark  The surge in benchmark crude was driven by supply outages in Nigeria  Libya  Venezuela and Canada   countries that hold some of the world s major sources of crude Dilemma in Crude RallyThis is definitely a million dollar question as the entire oil energy sector is dependent on the movements of the commodity s price  Big brokerage houses and large investment banks have been coming up with their forecasts with so many valid reasons Overall we can say that with almost 70  improvement in oil prices   WTI crude closed at  44 75 per barrel yesterday   since the mid February lows there will be huge incentives for upstream energy players to again start investing in exploration and production activities  For sure  the move will help oil production to increase in the already existing oversupplied market  But where will that extra crude output lead oil prices to  Crude might go down again Now  the picture will change abruptly if there is significant increase in near term global market demand for the commodity  Recently  Paris based International Energy Agency  IEA  projected 2016 global crude demand to grow by 1 4 million barrels per day  bpd   higher than the prior forecast of 1 3 million bpd  However  IEA warned that if global crude demand fails to surpass its latest projection  higher crude production will nullify the small improvement in worldwide commodity demand and will eventually push oil price to the bearish territory      Which Stocks to Consider There is no cue to whether the crude rally will last in the coming months  Yet  we have introduced five oil stocks that have solid fundamentals and the possibility to outperform the broader U S  equity market in an unpredictable oil pricing scenario For this  we have gone through our proprietary screening methodology to select a handful of stocks The first is Exxon Mobil Corporation   NYSE XOM     the world s best run integrated oil company based on its track record of high return on capital employed  As the world s largest publicly traded oil company  ExxonMobil has long been a core holding for investors seeking defensive as well as continued dividend growth The integrated player currently carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   which implies that the stock will outperform the broader U S  equity market over the next one to three months We advise investors to add Transocean Ltd   NYSE RIG   which is the world s largest offshore drilling contractor and leading provider of drilling management services  With less oil being discovered on land and companies having to dig ever deeper to get to their reserves  Transocean is poised to benefit from a market with robust multi year demand trends  given its technologically advanced and versatile drilling fleet Transocean presently carries a Zacks Rank  2 The third pick is Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc    NYSE DO     a major contract driller  providing comprehensive offshore drilling services to the global energy industry  The company boasts solid fundamentals with significant free cash flow potential and a clean balance sheet  Moreover  the company intends to increase its footprint in emerging markets  like Australia  Brazil and West Africa  to reap benefits from the recently discovered deepwater fields Presently  Diamond Offshore holds a Zacks Rank  2 Houston  TX based Marathon Oil Corporation   NYSE MRO   is also on radar  The company s strong inventory of development projects should lead to production growth over the coming years  Also  its recent plan to buy PayRock Energy Holdings is a huge positive as the latter possesses 61 000 net surface acres of land in Oklahoma The company carries a Zacks Rank  2 The last pick is Petroleo Brasileiro S A  or Petrobras   NYSE PBR    Also holding a Zacks Rank  2  this is the largest integrated energy firm in Brazil and one of the largest in Latin America ,2016-07-14,Zacks Investment

94113,315628,PBR,Brussels Attack May Slow Oil Momentum,opinion,"A terror attack in Brussels may slow momentum for oil as there could be a backlash on the demand side  Reports are saying that at least 13 people have died and several injured after two explosions ripped the Brussels airport  Then 90 minutes later  another explosion took place at a Metro station near the European Union headquarters in central Brussels  confirming fears that the attack may be on going  As details are filtering in about another terror attack  oil traders may pull back if they fear that this incident with cause a drop in demand  Yet if the market feels that this incident will have little impact on the psyche or travel arrangements of people  it may be sadly forgotten in the crude oil market  Oil dipped as the reports came in then seemed to recover and we will watch developments as the day goes on 
Oil prices were gaining strength as it appears that OPEC and non Opec members are close to hammering out the details of a production freeze  Saudi Arabia says they will agree to a freeze even if Iran does not join  Abdalla El Badri  Optec s secretary general  according to the FT says   Maybe in the future they  Iran  will join the group  They have some conditions about their production   The FT says that   15 Opec and non Opec countries   accounting for two thirds of global oil output   have so far supported an oil freeze   quoting Qatar s energy minister Mohammed Bin Saleh Al Sada 
In the meantime  there are more worries about the stability of many U S  energy Interests  The FT reports that investors have suffered losses of at least  150bn in the value of oil and gas company bonds  as the slump in crude prices since the summer of 2014 has fueled fears of a wave of defaults in the U S  and emerging markets  The 300 largest global oil and gas companies have also seen  2 3tn sliced from their stock market value over the same period  a 39 per cent slide since oil began its decline  an analysis by the Financial Times has found  The losses show how intense the financial strain on oil producers from falling crude prices remains  in spite of the partial recovery in prices since January  Oil is still down about 65 per cent from its June 2014 peak 
The FT says that banks have also been increasing their provisions for energy related losses on their lending  With several banks having loans to the industry equivalent to more than 40 per cent of their equity  lenders have tightened loan agreements with oil producers and capital markets remain closed to the lowest rated groups  More than  150bn has been shaved off the value of 1 278 actively traded bonds denominated in dollars  euros  sterling and yen since Brent crude hit almost  116 00 a barrel in June 2014 
Borrowing by oil and gas companies has soared over the past decade  Their total debt  including loans  almost tripled from  1 1tn in 2006 to  3tn in 2014  according to the Bank for International Settlements  The borrowers with the steepest increase in debts relative to their assets include U S  independent production companies caught up in the country s shale boom and national oil companies from emerging economies including Pemex of Mexico  Petrobras  NYSE PBR  of Brazil and CNPC of China 
AAA says that the U S  average gas price may climb above  2 00 for first time in 2016  AAA says that pump prices have climbed higher for two straight weeks and the national average price of gas may soon climb above  2 00 per gallon for the first time this year  Gas prices have increased largely due to seasonal increases in fuel demand and reduced production as some refineries conduct maintenance  Today s average price of  1 98 per gallon is the highest daily mark since January and drivers are paying a nickel more per gallon than a week ago and 27 cents more per than a month ago  Despite retail averages rising  consumers continue to benefit from yearly savings and prices remain 44 cents per gallon cheaper than a year ago 
Oil prices are looking more and more like they ve found a bottom  While today the market may pull back on fear  it appears we are seeing better than expected demand and the possibility of lower production  While many are fearing the short term impact  from the longer term perspective  this market may be putting in a low that we will not see again for a decade  With capital spending cuts at a historic high and the potential of restraint by global producers  the upside potential for this market over the next few years far exceeds the downside risk ",2016-03-22,Phil Flynn,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-phil-flynn-energy-report-03-22-2016-200122505,200122505

In a reaction against the previous authoritarian  but free market  regime  the 1988 constitution guaranteed public sector jobs and pensions  linking public sector remuneration to a multiple of the minimum wage  which is typically boosted in election years 
This led to a situation that s common among many emerging markets  where the state bureaucracy is the most attractive place to work  It enforces little workforce discipline and offers far too many opportunities for corruption 
Thus  Brazil s public spending reached 41  of gross domestic product  GDP   Compare that to Colombia  which spends 29  of GDP  for example 
Brazil s unions  especially those in the public sector  are very strong  and only an extremely determined leader has any chance of reining them in 
22 Years of Hurt
Fernando Cardoso   the country s president from 1994 to 2002   made a valiant effort in his early years  but lost control towards the end 
In 2002  Workers  Party candidate Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva was elected  Investors were so impressed that he didn t bankrupt Brazil during his term in office  2002 2010   they poured money into the country  Commodities prices rose and Brazil enjoyed a long boom 
But if Lula had actually restrained the Brazilian public sector  the country could ve emerged from its middle income trap  While Lula maintained good figures in regards to official statistics  he handed out subsidies to his favorite projects through low interest loans from the Brazilian Development Bank  BNDES  
In the election year of 2010  spending in state controlled companies soared by 32  
Lula s successor and current embattled president  Dilma Rousseff  made matters even worse after she was elected in 2014  She s had even less fiscal discipline  running a deficit totaling 10  of GDP during 2014  while hiding the figures until the election was over   This is the basis for her impeachment  
The State of the Nation
As for Brazil s economy  far from being a once proud member of the BRIC nations  it s now struggling 
Commodities prices have declined and Brazil has fallen into a two year recession  despite the additional spending for the 2016 Rio Olympics 
And almost the entire political class  including Lula  Dilma  and the top management of oil company Petroleo Brasileiro Petrobras SA  NYSE PBR   have become embroiled in an ugly corruption scandal 
Petrobras is currently in the middle of a gigantic investment program to develop the deep sub salt  Lula   formerly Tupi  oil fields  There s just one problem  though  The plan is thoroughly uneconomic in light of the recent decline in oil prices 
Petrobras  oil production revenue after Lula comes onstream were supposed to bail out the Brazilian public sector  But at present prices  the losses are likely to make matters worse 
The only bright spot in the economy  Brazil s central bank  which is running an admirably tight money policy  with short term rates above 14   still well above the current inflation rate of 9 8  
This makes hyperinflation  Brazil s chronic problem in past decades  unlikely   Also unlikely is the sort of productivity blight caused by ultra cheap money in Western countries  
No Political Light at the End of Brazil s Dark Tunnel
In short  Brazil needs top to bottom reform 
Unfortunately  the country won t get it before a new election  And there s nobody on the horizon who looks capable of implementing it  If Rouseff is removed from office  Vice President Michel Temer is likely to succeed her  But this is barely any better 
Temer ran on the same ticket in 2014 and is also facing possible impeachment  even though he s from a different party  He certainly has no commitment to cleaning up Brazil s corrupt and bloated government system 
Aecio Neves  the eventual runner up in the 2014 election  is a no go  He was far too committed to the existing broken system 
Marina Silva  who appeared to be the best candidate in Brazil s 2014 election  at least to me  has called for new elections in 2016  This seems to be the best solution for Brazil  but it s not yet clear whether it will occur  In any event  no likely savior has appeared  though Silva at least showed some understanding of Brazil s problems in her 2014 campaign 
122nd  And Still Sinking
Goldman Sachs economist Jim O Neill chose Brazil as one of the four  BRIC  economies that would provide the majority of future global growth  For a decade  the concept worked  It certainly caused a tsunami of foreign investment from both conventional and hedge funds chasing the latest fashionable concept 
But the country s prospects have hit the skids because weak  corrupt government has kept the predicted growth from occurring 
At the moment  Brazil is ranked a lowly 122nd out of 185 countries on the Heritage Foundation s Index of Economic Freedom  having steadily declined over the past decade 
It even now ranks below much poorer African countries such as Kenya and the notoriously corrupt Nigeria  That s certainly not a safe place for your money  Bottom line  Don t follow the hot money into Brazil  Hold off until it has a leader with a deep commitment to reform and free markets

94120,315635,PBR,Brazil Strengthens Under Michel Temer,opinion,"During Dilma Rousseff s six year occupation of the presidency  she ran  into the ground  Luckily for the country  Vice President and successor  moderate Michel Temer  has shown an understanding of what s needed economically  and is making some good appointments 
Yet some of Brazil s problems remain structural  and difficult for a president without a committed congressional majority to solve  At best  only cautious optimism is warranted 
And there s always the possibility that Rousseff could still return  if the impeachment process fails 
A History of Scandal
I wasn t thrilled about Rousseff s election in 2010  The outgoing President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva had already blown out the budget that year  masking the excess spending through massive Brazilian Development Bank  BNDES  loans 
To make matters worse  Brazil s public sector is too large  It s running at a Western European like 43  of gross domestic product  GDP   in an economy that s much too poor to support such extravagance 
It doesn t help that Brazil runs its budgeting on the basis of  primary balance  before interest payments  So it s claimed a  primary surplus  for decades while actually running large deficits 
Rousseff  who started her career as a left wing renegade  seemed unlikely to improve matters   and she didn t 
Her impeachment rests on her falsification of 2014 budget figures  making the primary balance appear positive and thereby improving her re election chances 
In addition  there s also the morass of corruption scandals surrounding her administration  Many of these involved oil company Petrobras  which  under the leadership of one of her cronies  was used as an all purpose slush fund 
However  the process isn t final  It requires a two thirds majority of the Senate for conviction  And if she returns  it would undo any reforms Temer passes 
Righting the Ship
Temer has moved quickly  appointing people with excellent track records and considerable determination  For example  as central bank governor  he has appointed Ilan Goldfajn  Chief Economist at Itau Unibanco 
Actually  central bank monetary policy isn t a problem 
The SELIC short term policy rate is above 14   while inflation remains below 10   This means Brazil has a sounder monetary policy than any of the big top four Western economies  all of which are stuck around or below zero 
As minister of finance  Temer has appointed Henrique Meirelles  who was the central bank governor from 2003 to 2011  before Rousseff replaced him  During this period  he notably avoided the mistakes his Western contemporaries were making 
The new team is already working on one of Brazil s major problems   its unfunded state pensions 
State salaries and pensions are guaranteed by the 1988 Constitution  one of the reasons why the public sector is so overblown 
Unlike in the United States  ultra low real interest rates haven t made the problem worse  The pensions are simply too large  and  in many cases  are tied to the minimum wage  which gets increased during election years 
Brazil s economy sank into recession in late 2014  and has continued to decline since  For the economy to recover  Brazil needs public sector reform  and it isn t clear whether or not Temer can achieve this  since he has no secure majority in Congress 
In this respect  2016 will be especially difficult  because of the flood of public spending for the forthcoming Rio Olympics 
Nevertheless  if a Rousseff return can be avoided  the chances are good that Temer and his team will be able to improve the country  at least somewhat  That will  in turn  reinvigorate the private economy and  with the real having been so weak  revive Brazil s export sector 
The Economist s team of forecasters expects a 3 7  decline in GDP in 2016 and only a 0 6  revival in 2017  but that latter estimate could prove too conservative 
For us as investors  Brazil looks as though it s worth a modest position  though I would certainly sell immediately if Rousseff returns 
One possible Brazilian investment is Petroleo Brasileiro Petrobras  NYSE PBR   which has recently appointed a new CEO Pedro Parente  who s untainted by previous scandals  Parente has banned political appointments to Petrobras  a source of much waste in the past 
Assuming Rousseff doesn t return  with oil prices having stabilized in the high  40s  Petrobras looks like an attractive investment  with its new  Lula   formerly  Tupi   deepwater oil fields ramping up production over the next few years and leverage beginning to reduce  helped by the modest recovery in the real s value 
Brazil is still in a very difficult position  but its prospects look better than they did a few months ago  although the specter of a Rousseff return still looms 
However  long term progress will require structural reforms that an interim President like Temer probably can t achieve

94141,315656,PBR,Oil Sets Up For Action  Large Breakout Inevitable,opinion,"Oil is consolidating in a very large pennant shape that is getting close to the critical point  Resistance has been found along the top of the shape and a short term bearish leg is likely  In the longer term  a large breakout is inevitable 
The last 24 hours have seen a solid rally in crude prices which has met resistance at the top of the large consolidating pennant shape  There have been some supply concerns crossing the wires that have given oil bulls hope that things might improve for the beleaguered commodity  The unfortunate reality is that the underlying fundamentals haven t changed 
The news in question emanates from Brazil and Libya  In Brazil  oil workers went on strike on Sunday over the sale of state assets as well as a pay dispute  The strike has cut around half a million barrels of output in the first 24 hours  It has also slowed Petrobras   N PBR  output by 25   which will have a considerable effect on exports for the nation  Brazil is the world s ninth largest oil producer  so this could be a story to keep an eye on 
There are also supply troubles in Libya where the export terminal at the port of Zueitina has been closed under force majeure  Escalating conflict between the country s two rival powers has put the port at risk  Force majeure is a legal clause protecting parties from liability if they cannot fulfill their end of a contract for reasons out of their control  The closure will cut 100 000 bpd from Libya s exports 
These events have been priced in  which opens the door for a short term rejection off the bearish trend line  The fundamental situation has not changed  especially in the US where production remains robust  This can be seen in the API crude inventory figures which jumped another 2 8m barrels last week  Keep an eye on the official figures due later today for further confirmation of the oversupply 

In the longer term  there is likely to be action in the form of a breakout of the consolidation pattern  It could go either way and will likely depend on the fundamental situation  If things don t change  expect a breakout lower  In the meantime  look for support at 45 74  43 77 and 41 80 with resistance at 48 29  50 03 and 52 41 ",2015-11-04,Ross Woodfield,https://www.investing.com/analysis/oil-sets-up-for-action-270193,270193

Spillover effect of Petroleo  N PBR  scandal hit BRL 
The Petrobras corruption scandal continues to make headlines as the investigation continues  More heads will roll  Dilma Rousseff took another hit yesterday as the police arrested Delcidio do Amaral   one of Rousseff s last strong supporters and head of the Senate Economics Committee   for allegedly trying to interfere with ongoing investigations  This is another setback for Rousseff but also for the Brazilian economy as a whole  slowing down the recovery process by postponing the approval of austerity measures  The bottom line is that the Brazilian economy continues to slide further into recession as the political gridlock persists and corruption probe advances  USD BRL jumped 1 25  yesterday amid headlines  The Brazilian real is expected to remain under pressure as investors digest the information 
Australia  Business investment vs  paper market
When commodities price lower  there is a transfer of wealth between exporters  producers  and importers of commodities  The decline favours industries that need commodities as primary source for manufacturing products  Australia is on the exporters  side  Indeed  an important part of the Australian s revenues accounts for the revenues on the extraction of gold  silver  platinum and other metals 
The consequences of low commodities prices are weighing on the Australian economy and are now reflected in the current business investment data which declined 9 2  q q for the third quarter  We believe this is partially because Australia is being hit by a major contraction of the commodities markets  The negative demand of the paper market  gold for example  also drives down the price of the physical market as there is no decorrelation between those two and especially because of the sheer size of the paper market  More specifically  there are two hundred times more paper ounces of gold than physical ounces  At the same time the demand for physical commodities has exploded  And at some point  we cannot say that the paper market is a hedge for the physical one as the difference in size is so great  We believe that Australia s issues with this contraction is not likely to lessen as the paper market continues to expand at a massive pace

94144,315659,PBR,Brazil In For Worst Recession Since 1930s,opinion,"Brazil s gross domestic product fell by a record 4 5  year on year in the third quarter  confirming expectations that Latin America s largest economy is in for its worst recession since the 1930s 

Source  Financial Times
Brazil s left leaning president  Dilma Rousseff  presided over an economy where unemployment rose to 7 9  in September  up from just 4 7  in October of last year  inflation is running at more than 10  for the first time since 2002 and Brazil s government budget deficit is now at 9 5  of GDP according to the  
What Happened to Brazil s Economy 
Brazil has a rising middle class and  for a resource rich emerging economy  it also has a substantial domestic consumer market but household consumption fell 1 5  in the third quarter  while services dropped 1   Weak harvests for coffee  sugarcane  oranges  cotton  wheat  forestry and cattle husbandry contributed to an agriculture sector contracting by 2 4  compared with the previous three months and both industry down 1 3  and investment down 4  
The trade balance made a positive contribution to growth  the FT said  but this was mostly due to a crash in imports down 20  quarter on quarter rather than a large increase in exports  which grew only 1 1   helped by the weaker real 

Source  Financial Times
Keepin  It Real
Not surprisingly  the Brazilian real has fallen more than 30  in a year  partly due to the deteriorating economy and partly due to the fall in commodity prices that has undermined all resource exporters 
The fall  though  is worrisome because interest rates are at 15    usually an incentive for foreigners to buy the currency but with inflation at 9  the net rate is more like 6  still a fall of 30  while interest rates are at 15    that doesn t say much for investor confidence in Brazil 
Problems at the Top
Dilma Rousseff s government seems paralyzed  on the one hand unable to bring themselves to enact the austerity measures needed to help balance the books  and on the other swept up in the country s biggest corruption scandal in which the state owned energy company Petrobras  N PBR  admitted to 6 billion real   1 6 billion  in losses  so far 
Neither the economy nor the currency is expected to recover anytime soon  Q4 of this year and much of next year could be little better than Q3  Rousseff could be ousted  or resign  making way for a more fiscally sound government to take charge but she could equally cling on to the next election in 2018 although her rating is said to be at an all time low of just 8  
The only silver lining according to Lee Alston  Ostrom professor at Indiana University and a research associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research  writing in the  is that compared to previous crises  particularly corruption scandals  this time those in charge are holding the government to account  especially the judiciary  public attorneys  the TCU and the federal police 
They have investigated  prosecuted and even imprisoned previously untouchable business leaders and politicians involved in corruption  While these changes are not likely to improve the economic situation in the short term  they do hold out hope for the future and will instill confidence in foreign investors that the country is coming of age ",2015-12-08,MetalMiner,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-sick-man-of-south-america-or-an-opportunity-in-waiting-374894,374894
94145,315660,PBR,Market Focus Now Squarely On Equities  Dollar  Yen Firmer,opinion,"Chinese shares and the USD CNY stabilized with the apparent help of the government s guiding hand  but global markets are still on the defensive  The euro extended yesterday s decline through the  1 08 level  The next immediate technical objective is near  1 0730 
The greenback is firmer against most major and emerging market currencies  The chief exception is the Japanese yen  Lower equity prices and the continued pullback in US yields are often associated with a stronger yen  The dollar thus far remains above yesterday s low against the yen   JPY118 70   but only just  A new low  albeit marginal  toward JPY118 30  is possible in the North American session  especially if the S P 500 extends the 10 point decline in electronic trading 
Chinese officials apparently recognized the need to prevent the stock market weakness from spilling over and fueling expectations of sharp yuan losses  Intervention in the foreign exchange market through state owned banks has been widely cited  While the onshore yuan stabilized  the offshore yuan has not  The spread between the two is at record levels  Last summer  the IMF urged China to reduce the gap in order to provide a proper hedging market for central banks which chose to put reserves in yuan with it being included  as of later this year  in the SDR 
Reports also indicated that a number of state owned and state guided entities likely intervened in the equity market as well  The buying would likely have been concentrated among the blue chips state owned banks and industrial combines  This is reflected in the fact that the CSI 300  an index of large companies  managed to eke out a small gain  almost 0 3    while the Shanghai Composite ended a volatile session off nearly as much and the Shenzhen Composite lost another 1 8  after yesterday s more than 8  drop 
In addition to the reports of material intervention  officials may tap other levers  For example  the ban on large equity investors selling shares is to expire at the end of the week  and China s key regulator suggested that the ban may be extended  Also  some reports suggest that at least ten companies reported that their executives would not sell their holdings for the next six to 12 months 
Although most Asian shares were lower  the gains in Korea  Malaysia  and Indonesia kept the losses in the MSCI Asia Pacific Index modest at about 0 3   The MSCI Emerging Markets Equity Index was down about the same percentage  European markets opened higher  but quickly retreated and many markets  including the DAX and CAC 40 are extending yesterday s losses  The Dow Jones STOXX 600 is off about 0 35   led by consumer discretionary and material energy sectors  Telecom is bucking the trend  gaining about 0 25  
The news stream is light today  There are four developments to note  First  the German labor market report showed a strong finish to 2015  The unemployed queues fell 14k  Bloomberg consensus was for an 8k decline   which matches the revised decline in November  The unemployment rate was unchanged at 6 3   What is less obvious is that 43 mln workers are the most since unification  and the number of unemployed has fallen below 2 mln for the first time as well  We note that new jobless claims in Spain fell by 55 8k in December  which is also a little more than expected  It is the largest decline since July 
Second  following the disappointing German figures yesterday  the eurozone December CPI was unchanged at 0 2   The core rate was also unchanged at 0 9   Prior to the German report  the consensus expected a small increase 
Third  the UK construction PMI rose to 57 8 from 55 3  The consensus expected a smaller increase   56   It averaged 57 3 in Q4 after 58 1 in Q3  Sterling fell to its lowest level since last April yesterday just below  1 4665  It has held above it  albeit barely  today  The intra day technicals suggest a retest on the  1 4720 in North America 
Fourth  Norway reported a disappointing manufacturing PMI  46 8 vs  47 5 in November   It is the lowest since August  While the weakness in the krone buys officials some time  a rate cut in the middle of March  the next time that the Norges Bank meets  is likely  Separately  we note that the weakest of the major currencies today is the Swedish krona following reports yesterday that the central bank was preparing to intervene 
The North American calendar is light  US auto sales are expected to have reached the 18 mln annual vehicle pace for the fourth consecutive month in December  Last year appears to have been a record year of sales  Canada reports industrial and raw material price indices  The real challenge Canada faces is not prices but growth  Canadian banks  chief economists provide 2016 economic outlooks today  while Bank of Canada Governor Poloz speaks on Thursday 
Although the markets seem to reward dispassionate analysis  there is a strain of superstition that creeps in from time to time  The sharp equity market decline on the first day of trading for a new year is seen by some as some sort of omen  It is not  According to a study cited on Bloomberg  since 1904  the direction of the first day predicts the direction of the market for the year about half the time  which is what one would expect if it was random  Moreover  the magnitude of the move adds nothing to its predictive value 
Lastly  we note that former Brazil President Lula has been called to testify in a lobbyist bribery scandal that involves his son  This is a separate scandal from the one that involves Petrobras  N PBR   so called Operation Car Wash   The scandals and potential impeachment of Lula s handpicked successor has begun eroding the former president s public support  There had been talk that he would consider running for president again in 2018 ",2016-01-05,Marc Chandler,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/focus-is-squarely-on-equities,-dollar-and-yen-firmer-378727",378727

94147,315662,PBR,World Equities And Oil  How Exaggerated Is The Relationship ,opinion,"Equities and oil continue to be moving in the same direction  During the first few weeks of the year they were moving down together  Now it s up together  It is frustrating for asset managers large cap and small cap stocks moving together as if everything is being tarred with the same brush  
We continue to try to tease out the relationship between equities and oil prices  but there is some underbrush needed to be gotten rid of before we can have a clear space to share our tentative conclusion   
First we need to break out of the habit of thinking that relationships can be simply eyeballed by looking at a chart   This first Great Graphic is typical of charts some analysts and reporters are showing  The white line shows the free float weighted index of MSCI World Equities  emerging and developed markets   The yellow line is the continuation contract for light sweet crude oil  It appears to be a good fit  
However  in this form  it is too much of an exercise in curve fitting  There are two time series and two different scales  There is no objective reason to line up the two time series so that 400 on the equity index is almost  45 a barrel for oil  or why 360 on the index is roughly equal to  27 50 on oil  It looks more pleasing to the eye  but this is not a beauty contest  
The second chart  above  shows both time series indexed so the movement of each can be seen on the same scale  Both began at 100 on 1 January 2015  MSCI global equity index is off about 12  through today  Oil is off by nearly 41   
While the first chart makes it appear that an investor in equities and oil would have lost the same amount  the lower chart indicates that this is most certainly not the case  Investing is difficult  and the outcome is important We owe it to ourselves and others to use as robust of tools as we can and be wary of pretty pictures  
We wanted to digger deeper and looked at the longer term relationship  We conducted a regression analysis of the daily percent change in oil and the daily percent change in the world equity index since the start of 2000  Based on a linear regression  we found that the change in oil can explain a little less than a fifth of the change in world equities  This may  in fact  overstate the case  Some of those equities  of course  are in the oil sector  like the Royal Dutch Shells  N RDSa   Exxons  N XOM   Pemexs and Petrobras  N PBR  of the world  for example This clearly suggests that while long term equity investors ought to monitor oil prices  the relationship should not be exaggerated ",2016-01-27,Marc Chandler,https://www.investing.com/analysis/world-equities-and-oil-381777,381777

Brazil s credit metrics have deteriorated  materially  in the past few months and will worsen over the next three years  according to the ratings company  which also cited the negative impact of political gridlock on the government s efforts to close a budget deficit and undertake structural reforms  The cut   Brazil s third in as many months from major ratings companies   adds pressure on Rousseff to win lawmakers  support for measures to raise taxes and reduce spending as she fights off efforts to impeach her 
 Even though it wasn t a surprise  it still sends a negative signal to investors   said Arnaud Masset  an analyst at Swissquote Bank SA in Gland  Switzerland   Unfortunately  Brazil s outlook remains very cloudy as the market expects more from lawmakers than minor reforms  
The government remains committed to undertaking a fiscal adjustment that would stabilize public debt and bolster the outlook for Brazil s economic recovery in the medium term  the Finance Ministry said in a statement after the downgrade 
The Ibovespa stock gauge dropped 2 percent as of 8 43 a m  in New York as state controlled companies including Petroleo Brasileiro  N PBR  and Banco do Brasil  SA BBAS3  tumbled  The real fell 0 8 percent  extending its decline over the past year to 29 percent  the most among the world s 16 most traded currencies  Benchmark dollar bonds slipped  The moves were in line with declines in emerging markets globally on Wednesday 
Economists are forecasting that Brazil is in the midst of its worst recession in a century as a rout in commodity prices and a slowdown in China damps revenue from exports including soy and iron ore  At the same time  annual inflation is running at the fastest pace in more than 12 years  curtailing central bank policy makers  ability to lower interest rates in an effort to stoke economic growth 
On Tuesday  Congress approved a watered down version of a bill to increase taxes on capital gains  a measure that was part of the government strategy to boost revenue and narrow a record budget deficit  Rousseff s administration said last week it would ask Congress to lower the government s fiscal target for this year to a deficit before interest payments rather than surplus  as the economic downturn crimps tax collection efforts 
 Macroeconomic and fiscal developments over the next two to three years are expected to produce a materially weaker credit profile   Moody s said   The negative outlook contemplates the risks of further deterioration to Brazil s credit profile emanating from macroeconomic shocks  deeper political dysfunction or the need to support government related entities  
The government now estimates gross domestic product will shrink 2 9 percent this year  rather than the 1 9 percent decline forecast in November  Budget Minister Valdir Simao said Friday  The economy contracted 4 1 percent in 2015  according to the central bank s economic activity index  which is a proxy for GDP 
Standard   Poor s cut the country below investment grade in September   and downgraded it again this month   while Fitch Ratings lowered the nation s debt in December  All three have a negative outlook on Brazil 
Moody s expects the economy will shrink at an average rate of 0 5 percent a year between 2016 and 2018  with government debt likely exceeding 80 percent of GDP within three years amid slow progress on shoring up public accounts 
 Addressing Brazil s fiscal challenges will require significant political will and consensus   Moody s said   While discussion of structural reforms is a positive development  their approval by Congress will be difficult  ",2016-02-24,Dean Popplewell,https://www.investing.com/analysis/brazil-credit-ratings-cut-to-junk-200119382,200119382
94176,315691,PBR,Macro Scenario Pressures Sugar Even More In NY,opinion,"The NY sugar market fell up to 17 dollars per ton in the months that reflect the 2015 2016 harvest in the Center South  and slightly less than 16 dollars per ton in the following harvest  The world macro scenario  with the strengthening of the dollar  knocks down all commodities  Only this July s accumulated  until Friday s closing  oil had fallen almost 20   wheat plummeted by more than 16   sugar shrunk 10   soy oil 9   ethanol in Chicago 8 5  and coffee 8   It has not been easy for anybody 
WTI oil market traded in NY  for instance  reached the lowest price in the last twelve months last Wednesday   47 96 dollars per barrel  The average gas price on the foreign market  based on values collected last Monday  was R 3 6092 per liter  The average traded price in the Center South was R 3 2400  Therefore  there is a 10 23  lag against the price traded abroad  A gas price increase would be welcome by ethanol producers  who would see their product appreciate  However  the dilemma Petrobras  NYSE PBR  is facing now is that a price rise will harm the fast dropping consumption of fuel even further 
In July 2015  fuel consumption in Brazil reached 4 83 billion liters  a 9 6  increase in relation to June last year  Nevertheless  gas A consumption dropped 5 9  over the same time period  Although in the yearly accumulated in comparison with the same previous period the total fuel consumption had gone up 5 59   over the six first months this year we can see a slowdown  which should bring this growth down to 1  on an annual basis by the end of this year  The worst expectation for consumption growth makes us estimate a decrease of one billion liters of ethanol and hydrous 
The freefall of the real against the American currency also helped sugar in NY follow its long and apparently endless path to lower and lower levels  The real hit 3 3470  the lowest quote over the last twelve years  while the futures sugar contract in NY  the first trading month October 2015  reached 11 35 cents per pound  the lowest 11 12 cents per pound traded last month  However  the traded value in NY converted into real per ton FOB equivalent is above the low for the last two years  Based on this Friday s closing  with NY closing the session at 11 24 cents per pound and the dollar at R 3 3470  the value in real per ton is 863  2015 average is R 899 per ton  2014 average was R 879 while the lowest price was R 724 per ton in September 2014  see chart  
Can something hold back this market  That is hard to say  The amount of crushing over the fortnight was disappointing  less than 29 million tons in a week  which had as an average 41 3 million tons over the last five harvests  Usually  this week s accumulated has represented over the last five harvests 41 6  of the crushed total in the respective crop year  that is  if we extrapolated this number  the 2015 2016 harvest would come to 550 million tons at the most  It is too early to talk about this  but it is amazing for those who visit the countryside of Sao Paulo to see the cane field with lots of flowers on the top of the sugarcane  A phenomenon called pith  which dehydrates the culms  generating weight loss  increase in fiber and decrease in sugar extraction by the mills  After this process occurs  there is nothing to be done  Some producers say that blossoming is affecting up to 10  of some areas 
Some other arguments  which can bring the market down  do not forget we are far from the lowest in real per ton   the funds are short sold by about 60 000 lots  Being sold at this volume at 15 16 cents per pound is one thing  but at 11 50 cents per pound is much more vulnerable 
BM F Bovespa has recently launched a futures crystal sugar contract  150 maximum color ICUMSA   quoted in real per 50 kilo bag  in 25 4 ton lots  equivalent to half of the NY contract   with maturities  financial settlement  coincidental with the NY exchange  BM F Bovespa promises that market makers will get onto the market at full strength in the third quarter of this year to bring liquidity for this contract and for the hydrous contract for the daily last two hours of the session  Even though both contracts do not provide physical delivery  which has always been a controversial issue on the part of the BM F Bovespa  the fact is that we can see an important tool to take advantage of arbitrages and even compensate for washout operations  which can come up on the physical market of both products being born 
For those who bet on what would fall below 10 first  the percentage of the positive evaluation of Dilma s PT government or the sugar market in NY in cents per pound  the  creature  created by Lula won out  With 7 7  of excellent and good ratings  probably given by those people who live a faraway galaxy  Dilma beat the sugar market easily and gets to the utmost mediocrity as the worst president in the history of this country  What a legacy  However  it will get even worse over the 1 256 days to go before we can get rid of this sect of worthless people ",2015-07-27,Arnaldo Luiz Correa,https://www.investing.com/analysis/macro-scenario-pressures-sugar-even-more-in-ny-259648,259648
94177,315692,PBR,The Down Side Of Devaluation,opinion,"Last week  the NY sugar futures market closed the week with another new low  This time around October 2015 closed Friday s session at 10 66 cents per pound  driving up the yearly accumulated fall by over 27  and making sugar the most devalued commodity in 2015  Last week s closing has been the lowest since December 2008 
The evil side of the real devaluation is that it affects the traded price in cents per pound in NY in an inversely proportional way  The correlation seen in July was  0 8432  that is  for each 1  of the dollar appreciation against the real  the price in NY devalues 0 84   In a way  the value in real per ton obtained by the mill doesn t change significantly  The regrettable fact  however  brought up by a mill facing financial difficulty  is that it had to make an advance on the exchange contract a few months ago when the dollar was around 2 7000 in order to meet its cost commitments  Only now  when it will load its sugar  was it allowed to fix its commercial contract before a trading company selling NY on the cheap because it doesn t have any credit limit to fix its price well ahead of time   a double and disastrous setback 
Even more evil than this situation  which further worsens the indebted mills whose amount of debt estimated by Archer might go beyond R 90 billion due to the stronger dollar  is that the real devaluation has a really strong political component since we still haven t seen the foreign capital going away  The dollar reflects the abysmal incompetence of PT s Dilma Roussef s government  a president unable to connect one sentence to another intelligibly  let alone dictate the paths for a complex country such as Brazil  which demands great planning capability  political skill and economy knowledge from its leaders 
We shouldn t forget that the root of the problem of the sugar alcohol sector has been the gas price freeze policy imposed by this abominable party since 2005 and which has been slowly eating away the foundations of the sector  With the economic policy  which focused on the rampant consumerism and plentiful credit  adopted by Lula and his troupe  it made sense for the former president to provide people with financing to buy cars and pay them off in up to 84 months  and then cheap gas  The so called liking some opinion makers thought Lula had for sugar and alcohol  so much as to honor them  would only make sense if we added ice and lemon to them 
The result of Lula and Dilma s nonsense came later with Petroleo Brasileiro Petrobras   NYSE PBR  huge loss  not to mention what the Party s gang  whose core now meets up in orange jumpsuits  has stolen  and with the deconstruction of the sector  Today  gas in Brazil is still below the foreign market price by 5   The sector doesn t realize that it is picking up part of this bill 
In 2013  I wrote an article entitled  Petrobras   the New Venezuela   Back then  before the corruption scandal  which PT is in over its head  broke out  I commented that  to increase production  Petrobras needs money  something the state run company didn t get because of the bleeding caused by the gas import at a price above what it receives  The insecurity on the financial market in relation to the management of the state run oil company will probably cause a decrease in its rating and an increase in the risk and interest rates to be offered from then on   It sounds like it has just been written 
Never in the recent past has such a huge political crisis been seen  especially for a government into its eighth month in office only and with just a 7  support of some alienated people or aliens  Maybe the crisis is smaller than we all think it is  Also  never before has such a crisis been seen in the sector  Not even the amazing sugar prices in NY trading at below 5 cents per pound in 1999 are close to what we see today  At that time  the mills  debt weren t even close to 30  of the yearly revenue of the companies  those which were doing really badly   We didn t see mills going bankrupt or stopping crushing  Today  things are way too shaky  What lies ahead for us 
Some banks have reduced the oil price forecast for next year  Patricia Hemsworth  expert on energy market  believes oil  WTI  can top 40 dollars per barrel  That is a sign ethanol might also have a ceiling price 
Archer released early in the week its 3rd Sugarcane Production Estimate in the Center South for the 2015 2016 harvest  We have kept the previous estimate volume of sugarcane to be crushed  581 million tons   but with a sensible change in amount of ATR per ton due to the smaller yield and the impossibility of our reaching the average ART we had predicted for the whole harvest  We have also changed the mix  reducing sugar availability and increasing ethanol production  in line with the current moment  As a result  we have reduced our sugar production to 29 796 tons  from the previous 32 642  and increased ethanol production to 27 488 cubic meters  from the previous 26 613  
Options volatility is increasing  An operation with straddle at 12 00 cent per pound for March 2016 is trading at 180 points  For those who are bold enough to sell the straddle it means that if the market expires in mid February 2016 below 12 cents per pound  you are long the equivalent of 10 20 cents per pound  If it expires above 12 cents per pound  you are short the equivalent of 13 80 cents per pound ",2015-08-11,Arnaldo Luiz Correa,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-evil-side-of-devaluation-261288,261288
94178,315693,PBR,Keep Playing Defense,opinion,"Defense is still looking good right now 
The S P 500 annualized a 6 1 2 year return of 13 7  through its summer highs  The recent uptick in volatility shows you that investors who were happy with the run are now interested in banking some of those gains  Even the 2nd largest pension fund  CalSTRS  is going to downshift their equity risk into less volatile buckets  and save money for a rainy day  The clouds continue to build and threaten in the form of Emerging Markets  widening Credit Spreads  Investor Fund flows  and Congressional spending disagreements  Also complicating things is the upcoming FOMC shift from Easing to Tightening  The market is betting on a delayed rate hike this week but it is going to start at some point  The Fed has made it clear that they are preparing for wage inflation  and that it would take more International pressures to keep them from tightening  While there are still some areas of the market to hunt in and be long  this is not a time to be all in on risk  Pick your spots prudently and wait for some clouds and volatility to dissipate 
So what data could the Fed be looking at to raise rates this week  David Rosenberg would highlight last week s JOLTS data 
The ratio of the unemployed to the level of job openings has declined to 1 43x  far below the near 7x peak at the worst part of the Great Recession and a place we have been at just two other times before  since the JOLTS data were first published   This may well be the most accurate measure of just how tight the labor market is   we are heading to an environment where we are down to one person competing for one job  The sands have shifted toward this being a sellers  market for labor  Wage acceleration either starts real soon or we can simply take the laws of supply and demand and throw them in the dustbin 

The Housing and Construction industry is having its own set of issues in finding workers 
While debate rages on about whether demand or supply factors are more to blame for the sluggish home construction recovery  most industry observers and participants agree on at least one point  Construction labor is in short supply  Scant availability of skilled construction workers has hampered home construction at various times in the past few years of recovery  But the shortfall seems to have grown more acute of late  as new home sales are up 21 2  so far this year from the same period last year and commercial construction has increased steadily  Construction employment isn t quite keeping pace with that rebound  and workers with certain skills  such as carpenters and sheet metal installers  are hard to find 

J P  Morgan s forecast and the University of Michigan survey of wage inflation are also moving up and to the right 

Meanwhile  the market is betting on higher short term rates  Why wouldn t the Fed use the implied market as an excuse to lift now and put a few rate cuts in its pocket for later   MktOutperform  2 Yr Treasury yield at highest level since Apr  11  Sep hike still a low prob  28   but market saying it s coming 

Many would argue that inflation is under pressure to the downside due to the big move in oil  Some big Banks took axes to their crude forecasts last week  including Credit Suisse   csapac  We ve significantly lowered our Brent  oil forecast for 4Q15 to US 48   barrel

And then Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  lowered its global crude oil price forecast last week  the oil market is even more oversupplied than we had expected and we now forecast this surplus to persist in 2016 on further OPEC production growth  resilient non OPEC supply and slowing demand growth  with risks skewed to even weaker demand given China s slowdown and its negative EM feedback loop 

Of course  for the users of fuel  like Delta Airlines   plunging prices are going to be a bonanza for their shareholders  employee owners  and customers  Delta Air Lines  NYSE DAL  said on Wednesday it expects to pay between 30 percent and 35 percent less for its fuel in the second half of the year than in the first 

RyanAir  LONDON RYA  is seeing such a positive impact that they were forced to pre release earnings last week  A combination of stronger than expected demand for flights over the summer  low fuel prices and higher fares has pushed Ryanair to raise its full year profit guidance by 25 percent  The European low cost airline  which has been trying to overhaul its image and attract more business passengers  has been forced to update shareholders early on its recent trading  after a much stronger than expected performance over the summer  Its decision to advise shareholders that profits are likely to be higher than forecast this year follows a similar move by its rival easyJet  LONDON EZJ   which also recently reported unexpectedly high demand to beach destinations and European cities over the summer months 
Traffic in the first half of the year rose 13 percent compared to the company s expectations of 10 per cent growth while fares were also 2 percent higher over the period  Ryanair had previously told shareholders that it expected no growth in fares amid intense competition in the European short haul market  In the third quarter  Ryanair is now expecting traffic growth of 15 percent compared to 13 percent previously and for fares to be flat whereas it had previously forecast a fall in ticket prices of between 4 and 8 percent during what is the traditionally quieter autumn and winter season  when airlines slash fares and often ground planes due to lower demand 
And we are finally seeing a significant uptick in petrochemical plant construction  Natural gas is both raw material and fuel for petrochemical production  and the industry s expansions have made the Houston area the birthplace of many products exported to China and the rest of the developing world   Those of us who have been in this business for 30 years would never have imagined Texas and Houston to be the big export hub for petrochemicals   Exxon Mobil  NYSE XOM  Chemical President Neil Chapman said  noting that there had been little petrochemical growth in the region for at least 15 years 
The American Chemistry Council counts 243 announced projects with a cumulative investment of  147 billion from 2010 to 2023  More than 60 percent comes from foreign investment  and a small majority of projects remain in the planning stage  Global chemical demand is expected to double from 2000 to 2040 but stay flat in the U S  Texas alone accounts for 99 of the projects with a total value of  48 2 billion  and most of those are in southern parts of Texas  including Houston  Corpus Christi and Beaumont  That means 15 800 direct new jobs in Texas   not counting construction jobs   and 67 000 nationwide  the council projects 
Not all will benefit from falling fuel prices  Fannie Mae is warning lenders about Energy job dependent economies 
Using oil industry employment to gauge the potential drag on home values  the Fannie analysis finds that North Dakota faces the greatest possible hit on home values  If oil prices remain at the  55 a barrel over the next five years that is implied by the current price futures curve  home prices in North Dakota could decline anywhere from 2  to 20  over the next five years  with an 11  decline as the base case scenario  Wyoming could see declines of 4   and Alaska  8   Texas  on the other hand  looks like it wouldn t see any price declines  Under the base case scenario  prices would rise 5  over five years a far slower rate of growth  but growth nonetheless  Colorado  which was clobbered by the oil patch recession  would see prices rise by 22  over the next five years 

Back to Equities  some of the market s newer technology stocks have had a volatile end to the summer 

Last week in Japan  the market was volatile with an 8  gain in one day  But as Bespoke s chart shows  5   moves do not typically lead to higher prices  we would prefer to see a string of positive days rather than just one big moonshot day 
 bespokeinvest  Biggest rally for the Japan s Nikkei in 4  years  Here s a chart showing occurrences of prior 5   up days since 2000 

The recent market volatility has definitely impacted Main Street  as seen in the University of Michigan s September survey 
 Compared with five years ago  do you think the chances that you  and your husband wife  will have a comfortable retirement have gone up  gone down  or remained about the same  

And volatility is causing investors to reduce exposure to Mutual Funds  as this Morningstar data for August shows  it is interesting to still see buyers of International Index Funds  We are of course happy to see the only actively managed category to grow assets in August was the Alternative category 

Some large Institutional Investors were also forced to reduce their Equity exposures if they were following a Risk Parity investing strategy 

If you are forced to hunt for Equity exposure  these would be the areas that I would be spending the most time looking for  Stocks or ETFs 

It is gut check time for the Fiduciaries who were pulled into Emerging Market debt by the chase for yield 
The recent volatility in EM debt no doubt caused many to double fist Tequila and Maalox 

Fabulous timing by Petrobras in selling  2 5b of 100 year debt in June 
When Petroleo Brasileiro  NYSE PBR  sold 100 year bonds in June  the move was largely seen as a sign the corruption tainted oil producer had put the worst of its problems behind it  Since the  2 5 billion offering  the bonds have tumbled 15 percent  That s four times the average loss for emerging market company debt  The plunge deepened last week  when the securities sank to a record low 69 5 cents on the dollar after Petrobras  as the Brazilian company is known  had its credit rating cut to junk by Standard   Poor s  The world s most indebted major oil producer was stripped of its investment grade by Moody s Investors Service seven months earlier as a widening probe into alleged bribes paid to former executives at the state controlled oil company caused it to delay reporting earnings  Yields on Petrobras s 6 85 percent bonds  which mature in 2115  have soared 1 5 percentage points to a record 9 86 percent since they were issued on June 2  according to data compiled by Bloomberg

94179,315694,PBR,Is Glencore The Next Lehman  ,opinion,"Are we about to witness the most important global financial event since the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008  Glencore  LONDON GLEN  has been known as the largest commodities trading company on the entire planet  and at one time it was ranked as the 10th biggest company in the world  It is linked to trillions of dollars of derivatives trades globally  and if the firm were to implode it would be a financial disaster unlike anything that we have seen in Europe since the end of World War II  Unfortunately  all signs are pointing to an inescapable death spiral for Glencore at this point  The stock price was down nearly 30 percent on Monday  and overall Glencore stock has plunged nearly 80 percent since May  There are certainly other candidates for  the next Lehman   Petroleo Brasileiro Petrobras SA  NYSE PBR  and Deutsche Bank  XETRA DBKGn  being two perfect examples   but Glencore has definitely surged to the front of the pack  Right now many analysts are openly wondering if the firm will even be able to survive to the end of next month 
If you are not familiar with Glencore  the following is a pretty good summary of the commodity trading giant  

Glencore plc is an Anglo Swiss multinational commodity trading and mining company headquartered in Baar  Switzerland  with its registered office in Saint Helier  Jersey  The company was created through a merger of Glencore with Xstrata on 2 May 2013  As of 2014  it ranked tenth in the Fortune Global 500 list of the world s largest companies  It is the world s third largest family business 
As Glencore International  the company was already one of the world s leading integrated producers and marketers of commodities  It was the largest company in Switzerland and the world s largest commodities trading company  with a 2010 global market share of 60 percent in the internationally tradeable zinc market  50 percent in the internationally tradeable copper market  9 percent in the internationally tradeable grain market and 3 percent in the internationally tradeable oil market 

For months  I have been warning about the consequences of the crash that we have been witnessing in commodity prices  We saw a similar thing happen in 2008 just before the financial crisis that erupted in the fall of that year  If commodity prices kept going down  which they did   it was only a matter of time before firms like Glencore started imploding 
At this point  Glencore owes almost twice as much money as the entire firm is worth 
Now there is every chance the merged operation could implode  If it does  it will be the resources sector s very own Lehman Brothers moment 
With debt approaching  US30 billion and a market value of just  US16 billion  shareholders and those holding the debt are desperately looking for an exit 
The cost of Glencore s credit default swaps   a financial instrument that insures against a default   soared overnight 
Actually   soared  is a horrible understatement 
The cost of insuring Glencore s debt is absolutely screaming into the stratosphere  This is precisely what we would expect to see right before a  Lehman Brothers moment   Here are some of the specific details  
Investors had to pay on Monday more than  790 000 a year to insure  10 million of Glencore debt against default for five years using credit default swaps  according to Markit  more than 40  higher than Friday  At the beginning of the year  the same insurance cost  154 000 
When Glencore goes down  they will take a whole lot of others with them  That is because Glencore is tied to trillions of dollars worth of derivatives trades all over the planet  According to Zero Hedge  we are looking at  the start of a self fulfilling prophecy which leads to the Companys s IG downgrade and the collapse of trillions in derivative notionals as what may be the trading desk of the biggest commodity counterparty quietly goes out of business  
For years I have been ranting about the danger of derivatives  In article after article I warned that they would play a starring role in the next financial crisis 
Now the reality of what I was warning about is staring us right in the face 
The  nothing is happening  crowd is completely and utterly clueless  There are these people running around telling everyone that the stock market decline is  over  and that we aren t about to experience another great financial crisis 
I don t understand how these people can be so ignorant  Global giants such as Glencore  Petrobras and Deutsche Bank are imploding right in front of our eyes  As I write this  stocks in Hong Kong are down 744 points and stocks in Japan are down 677 points  The stock markets of the 10 largest economies on the entire planet   but the mockers are going to continue to mock  They will continue to tell you that  nothing is happening  even in the face of undeniable evidence to the contrary 
And the sad thing is that many of these mockers are given air time on the big mainstream news networks  They will tell you that stocks are  oversold  and that you should  buy the dip  because stocks are going to be going back to record highs really soon 
I wish that was true  Unfortunately  the reality of the matter is that we are finally witnessing the bursting of the last great global financial bubble  I really like how Bill Holter put it recently 

In my opinion we are already well within the jaws of a meltdown shutdown as liquidity is evaporating  There are a dozen developed countries with their stock markets already in bear markets  down 20  or more   All crashes come from oversold levels just as bank runs come on fast and are a surprise at the time  What is coming should be NO SURPRISE to anyone as we are looking at the end of not only an empire but of a flawed system which has endured for far too many years  This was a solvency problem in 2008 and  liquidity  was the incorrect tool used then  Now it is a bigger solvency problem with an illiquidity kicker attached  while the Fed has already used every tool imaginable and every last ounce of credibility  The loss of confidence in the issuer of the world s reserve currency would be bad enough in an unlevered world  the loss of confidence in today s  debt world  will be a DISASTER 
To wrap this up  do not let anything that may happen from here surprise you  The conditions are ripe for global currency crises and a shutdown of credit  The conditions are also ripe for hot war to explode in multiple venues  A meltdown or shutdown of markets will serve as a FINAL FLUSH of what remains left of the U S  middle class 

We are steamrolling toward a global economic collapse that will be permanent and irreversible 
For months  I have been warning that we were witnessing a textbook example of what the lead up to a major financial crisis looks like  and now it is happening  All of this was completely and totally predictable for those that were willing to look at the signs 
Unfortunately  there are way too many people out there that think that they know it all and that have a tremendous amount of blind faith in the system 
Now the system is failing  and that blind faith is about to be shattered ",2015-09-29,Michael T. Snyder,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-glencore-the-next-lehman-the-world’s-largest-commodities-trading-266458,266458

Meanwhile  the Fed Chair and other members are still talking about a 2015 rate hike lift off  Could someone send them a chart of High Yield or even Investment Grade corporate bonds  How do they expect to pull off a rate hike in the thinly traded month of December when Congress is a question mark and the global growth picture is not any more clear  If the Fed does hike  I am putting my money on Jack to snatch Santa and do away with Christmas this time 
 So in looking at global equities from a U S  investor perspective  there is little to be positive about given the lower low and the ACWI Index trading below its major moving averages 

 Looking more specifically at the local markets will show larger markets are now entering Bear market territory with the majority now in Correction mode

 So what is causing global equities to continue to be bulldozed  Look no further than Caterpillar s news release last week  Global mining equipment sales continue to be dragged lower by global growth and falling commodity prices  Tough times for Peoria as 10 000 jobs will be let go 

Caterpillar Inc  NYSE CAT   said it would slash thousands of jobs and cut manufacturing space by 10   as it expects weakening demand from resource and construction companies will continue to drive down sales of its heavy equipment through at least next year  The company said the job cuts could exceed 10 000 people through 2018  including 4 000 to 5 000 salaried and management positions to be eliminated by the end of next year  It aims to reduce annual costs by roughly  1 5 billion  Caterpillar said it now expects 2015 revenue to be about  48 billion  1 billion lower than its previous projection which would mark a decline of about 27  from a peak of nearly  66 billion in 2012  And it said 2016 revenue likely would fall a further 5  from 2015  which would be the first time in Caterpillar s 90 year history that sales declined for four consecutive years      

 Meanwhile  as Jeff Macke illustrates so well  the Board s decision to bet on a commodities rebound via stock repurchases has not worked 

 JeffMacke  If  CAT bought an index fund instead of Cat shares they d have saved  4b  A breakdown 

 Like Caterpillar  Glencore  LONDON GLEN  is a global commodities company that is also under distress from the weakness in commodity prices  But as the chart below shows  Glencore s problem is one of debt  not stock repurchases  As commodity and asset prices continue to fall around the world  expect to see many similar charts appear as corporations with debt come under pressure

 The credit pressures are building up leading to notably wider European spreads  not just in High Yield  but also in Investment Grade  This continued breakdown should be a RED FLAG for equity investors 

 Eurofaultlines  Despite ECB QE  2015 has not been a good year for  IG and  HY


 Here is the widening spread for U S  High Yield credits  Again  another RED FLAG 
   
 We have blamed the wider Junk Bond spreads on Energy issuers  but last week there was a buyer s strike  If this continues  you can say goodbye to easy financing for M A which will remove one large pillar of support from stock prices 
Altice  AMS ATCA  on Friday sold  4 8 billion of junk bonds to fund its  10 billion purchase of Cablevision Systems Corp  NYSE CVC    according to S P Capital IQ LCD  When the deal was shopped earlier this month  Altice expected to sell  6 3 billion of debt  investors said  A 10 year bond was priced to yield 10 875   compared with yields as low as 9 75  that were suggested by bankers initially  according to S P Capital IQ  Olin  NYSE OLN  on Friday sold  1 2 billion of bonds to pay for its pending acquisition of Dow Chemical Company s  NYSE DOW  chlorine products unit  Earlier in the month  Olin was expected to sell  1 5 billion of bonds  fund managers and analysts said  The annual interest rate on Olin s 10 year bonds sold Friday was 10   up from 7  expected earlier in the month  according to S P Capital IQ 
Companies have announced  3 2 trillion of M A this year  according to Dealogic  emboldened to merge by cheap debt and the long stock rally that began after the financial crisis  That puts 2015 on pace to rival 2007 as the biggest year ever for takeovers  Issuance of junk bonds backing M A deals hit a year to date record of  77 billion through Friday  according to data from Dealogic  A souring of investors on junk bonds could limit the availability of financing for deals that require a lot of borrowing  Banks have been under pressure from federal regulators to reduce their loans to such companies  and a pinch in the bond market could leave those deals struggling for financing      
 Meanwhile  non bank lenders are also staying out of the water   When there is a shark attack  there s no prize for being the first one back in the water  
When banks began to scale back financing for energy companies earlier this year amid the slump in oil prices  some of Wall Street s savviest asset managers sought to capitalize by lending at high rates  That didn t work out so well  as crude continued to plunge and lenders were stuck with losing positions  Now  banks are again contemplating credit cuts  But this time hedge funds and private equity firms are showing more reluctance to step in 
This wariness threatens to create a liquidity crunch for oil and gas drillers that have relied on relatively cheap funding for their operations  After investors snapped up more than  37 5 billion of bonds issued by junk rated energy companies in the first six months of 2015  just  5 9 billion has been raised since then  according to data compiled by Bloomberg      
 China released some key manufacturing data last week  Nothing positive to see here  Key Points

 As investors lose total confidence in the Brazilian Government and its credit and equity markets  capital is fleeing the country leading to an ever cheaper Brazilian real  So that Christmas vacation in Rio is now 40  cheaper than last year s price 

 Now it gets serious for the President of Brazil  The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation Trust joins the lawsuit to sue the heart of corporate Brazil  and main source of Brazilian Government corruption  

 The depth and breadth of the fraud within Petrobras is astounding  By Petrobras s own admission  the kickback scheme infected over  80 billion of its contracts  representing approximately one third of its total assets   the lawsuit said   Equally breathtaking is that the fraud went on for years under PwC s watch  who repeatedly endorsed the integrity of Petrobras  internal controls and financial reports  This is not a case of rogue actors  This is a case of institutional corruption  criminal conspiracy  and a massive fraud on the investing public

 An epic bull run in Biotech comes to an end   via iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology  NASDAQ IBB  

 All it took was one Tweet 

 It was probably the most expensive tweet in history  A 21 word missive from Hillary Clinton on Monday wiped more than  40bn off the value of U S  pharmaceutical and biotech stocks  The Democratic presidential front runner decried as  outrageous  the  price gouging  by some drug makers and promised action to stamp it out  The next day she announced a package of measures designed to rein in pharmaceuticals  profiteering  
 Her intervention coincided with an outcry over a 5 000 per cent price increase levied on an anti infective drug used by AIDS and cancer patients  The company   Turing Pharmaceuticals   is run by a 32 year old fast talking former hedge fund manager  Martin Shkreli  who instantly became the unapologetic face of an industry accused of putting profits over public health  Mr Shkreli responded to the ensuing media storm with a tweet linking to an expletive filled Eminem song   The Way I Am   containing the lyrics   I m tired of all you  I don t mean to be mean  But that s all I can be is just me  
This tale of two tweets has thrust drug pricing to the center of the U S  presidential campaign and sent investors fleeing in fear of a clampdown on one of the world s biggest and most profitable industries

We are carefully monitoring market liquidity conditions  given that the risk capacity and shock absorption ability of sell side market makers is low  as a result of the new regulatory regime that has shrunk balance sheets and reduced risk appetite  The U S  Treasury  flash crash  of 15 October 2014  when the U S  10 Year Treasury note moved a total of 68 basis points in one day  was a stark manifestation of the evaporation of liquidity that can occur even when no material economic event has occurred  The recent high volatility in the U S  stock market is another indicator that market liquidity can be prone to rapid evaporation  To give an order of magnitude  from 1 January 2015 to 10 August 2015  the S P had a trading range of 7   On 24 August 2015  the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 6 6   rallied 6 4  and then fell 4 7  within the trading day  The new regulatory environment for financial institutions is having significant effects on the ability of banks to use balance sheets  warehouse risk  or act as market shock absorbers

 Talk about a Crash Test Dummy 

 How did this happen   what happened at Volkswagen over the last week is actually pretty simple  The company admitted that it had programmed 11 million of its diesel cars including popular models like the Volkswagen Passat  Jetta  Golf  and Beetle  along with cousin cars like the Audi A3 to cheat on their emissions tests  using something called a  defeat device   When these cars  software detected that they were being put through a standard nitrogen oxide emissions test  they switched into a low emission mode that allowed them to pass the test  Then  once the test was over  the cars reverted to pumping out up to 40 times as many pollutants as the law allowed  while appearing to stay under the legal limit    
 Losing the respect of the Regulators  Customers and Employees will cost Volkswagen plenty 
 the fines and lawsuits facing Volkswagen are likely to surpass Enron in both scale and scope  Volkswagen s potential liability to Environmental Protection Agency fines is  18bn  Add to this fines in most or all of the 50 US states and class action lawsuits by buyers and car dealers who have seen the value of their cars and franchises diminish overnight and you have a massive legal bill  No jury in the U S  will be lenient with a foreign car company that touted its  clean diesel  technology when the technology on board instead served to hide the fact that particulate emissions were up to 40 times greater  And that is before expert testimony about the effects on children with asthma  Yet crucially  fewer than 5 per cent of the cars in question were sold in the U S  and regulators in Europe  South Korea and elsewhere have already launched investigations  This is a truly global fraud and global scandal    
 While it feels like the world is crashing  there are still those that will benefit from collapsing commodity prices  For example  check out Nike s earnings report last week 

Nike  NYSE NKE  proved again that a strong dollar can t keep it down  The U S  athletic apparel and footwear maker said global future orders excluding currency swings jumped 17 percent in the last quarter That was comfortably ahead of Wall Street s expectation of a 10 3 percent gain for the orders  which are an indicator of the U S  company s future revenue  Nike shares  which have advanced 19 percent this year  rose 5 percent to  120 68 in after hours trading  The increases are the fastest future sales growth  on a constant currency basis  since 2012  Nike has managed to weather the impact of the strengthening dollar better than some of America s largest multinationals    
 They even crushed it in China

This is one of the reasons that we are seeing U S  oil output fall as quickly as it is  We saw more evidence of that in yesterday s American Petroleum Institute  API  report that showed yet another drop in the CME Group s  NASDAQ CME  delivery point of Cushing Oklahoma  Even though over all the API showed a hefty 4 6 million barrel increase in Oklahoma  land of the fracker  supply fell 1 2 million barrels 
The API also provided a surprise with a big 1 5  uptick in refinery runs  That helped gasoline inventories rise by 3 3 million barrels and distillates to increase by 176 000 barrels  U S  demand seems robust and that should help supplies tighten

94182,315697,PBR,Brazil s Tough Economic Times  What Happened  What s Next  ,opinion,"Introduction
In late 2008  I wrote  with my students at the University of Palermo s Business School in Buenos Aires  The articles examined the economic impact of the global depression started in 2008 on a selection of Latin American countries  On Brazil  my co authors  Roberto Flamini and Paula Gomez  and I concluded 

 The 2008 global collapse had little impact in Brazil  In fact  its effects in Brazil were far less than previous global downturns  Overall  Brazil has become one of the soundest economic powers in the world  With diverse exports  a growing middle class  and a broad natural resource base  Brazil s prospects are excellent  

And yet  Brazil now appears to be in horrible shape  the country is in recession with GDP projected to fall 2 7  this year  Business and consumer confidence are at record lows with investment and consumption expenditures declining  The government deficit has shot up and is now projected in the    LatinFocus Consensus Forecast  to reach 8 2  of GDP in 2015  And this  after a GDP growth rate of 7 6  in 2010  What happened 
Pundits point to the need to diversify exports and reduce corruption  In what follows  these and other factors contributing to the downturn are considered  But first  Brazil is placed in its Latin American setting 
Brazil in Latin America
Brazil is the largest of the Latam countries  measured by both population and GDP  It is only one of two countries with a declining GDP  the other being Venezuela  Its GDP per capita ranking is about in the middle  A Gini Coefficient is a measure of income inequality with a 0 meaning equal incomes and a 1 meaning complete inequality  Income inequality in Latam is high relative to the rest of the world and particularly so in Colombia  Brazil  and Chile 
Table 1    Basic Economic Statistics  Latam Countries

Source    
 Exports
 argue Brazil s problems could be solved through greater export diversity  Sure  this is an easy thing to suggest in light of what happened to commodity prices in the last few years  But this is a misconception  Brazil is not suffering from a lack of diversity in its exports  I quote from  on the subject 

 Brazil is recognized as a global trader  endowed with a wide range of natural resources along with a well diversified industrial structure  This translates into an impressive level of export diversification  not only in terms of number of destinations  but also of products  When compared with other countries the Brazilian economy proves to be able to sell a large number of products in many markets  

One measure of export diversity is the percentage share of the top 15 export products  the higher this number is  the less is the diversity  Table 2 provides these data for Latam countries  Brazil is second only to Mexico in having diverse exports  And
Table 2    Latam Countries  15 Leading Export Products  Share

Source  
But Brazil did have a 12 5  export decline between 2012 and 2014  and another 12  fall is expected in 2015  So what is happening  Table 3 shows export change by country since 2011 
Table 3  Brazil  Export Change 2011   2014 by Country  mil  US  

Source  
It is interesting that the largest export decline was to Argentina and not China  its largest export partner   Details on the Argentine export decline are provided in Table 4  Many of these reductions stem from the weakening Argentine economy 
Table 4    Change in Leading Exports to Argentina  mil  US  

Source  
Exports to China tell a quite different story  Table 5   Unlike the Argentine case where a good deal of the declines came in manufactured products  most of the China cutbacks came in commodities 
Table 5    Change in Leading Exports to China  mil  US  

Source  
So why the large reduction in commodity exports to China  The export declines can hardly be attributed to a decline in the Chinese growth rate  After all China s GDP still grew at a hefty 7 3  in 2014  Rather  the answer lies in what happened to commodity prices  As Table 6 indicates  there were huge price declines in most of Brazil s export commodities 
Table 6    Changes in Commodity Prices  2011   2015

Source  
How Important Is the Export Decline 
 In 2015  total GDP is projected to be down  865 billion  33   since 2011  The export decline is projected at  61 billion  and its multiplier effects will increase its overall GDP impact considerably 
As mentioned earlier  some say Brazil is too dependent on commodity exports  It is far too soon to draw this conclusion  Brazil is resource rich  Should it not take advantage of this comparative advantage  Commodity prices fluctuate and most will recover 
Others say Brazil is too dependent on China for exports  That is like saying Brazil should not sell its products in the global market to the highest bidder  China and India offer the largest and most rapidly growing markets for Brazil to develop 
Corruption
 claim corruption is the number one challenge facing Brazil  I don t see it  There are two types of government corruption  In the most serious type  corruption blocks needed government reforms  For example  groups favoring the status quo in India have blocked energy reforms  And in the US  as a result of the lobbying and campaign contributions of hospitals  doctors  and insurance companies  US health care is the most expensive and least effective of any developed country 
The corruption problem in Brazil is not of this type  In Brazil  a small share of Petrobras   N PBR  profits was siphoned off  That meant the company s profits were a bit lower than they should have been  but there is no evidence that the operating policies of Petrobras were affected  There is also plenty of this type of corruption in China  illegal monies end up in the hands of government officials  But the corruption rarely influences the government s policies 
Changes in Exchange Rates and Inflation
 Several years back  the Brazilian Central Bank was complaining that the real  the Brazilian currency  was too strong relative to the dollar  thereby putting its exporters at a disadvantage  This has all changed  Today  the Brazilian exporter gets R 3 87 for every USD of exports versus only R 1 86 in 2011  On the other hand  the weaker real means imports have become far more expensive to Brazilians  And higher import prices have contributed to inflation  34  since 2011  
Investments
It is an understatement to say that since 2011  the Brazilian stock exchange has not performed well  the stock market  Bovespa  is down 33  since 2011  In 2011  the stock market capitalization was  1 2 trillion  today  it is  514 billion  Needless to say  this huge loss in wealth is having a negative impact on the consumption outlays of Brazilians

Conclusions
Brazil is going through tough economic times  Table 8 provides the FocusEconomics consensus forecasts of more than 15 financial organizations  GDP  consumption  investment and industrial production are declining sharply  and who really knows about 2016   The unemployment rate is increasing  as is the government debt and inflation  The good news is that Brazil s debts are quite low by international standards

94183,315698,PBR,Bottom Fishing In Brazil,opinion,"In retrospect  it was a clear sign of a market top 
A few years ago  I was waiting to speak as an energy specialist was wrapping up his presentation  He closed with a recommendation of Brazil s energy giant Petrobras  N PBR   boldly predicting that its market value could reach more than a trillion dollars 
While Petrobras stock reached  71 in 2007  it now trades under  5 
And just last month  Brazil itself lost the coveted investment grade status it earned in 2008 
We re likely close to the bottom  as well as what Sir John Templeton famously referred to as the point of maximum pessimism 
Does this mean we should count Brazil out  On the contrary  Despite the country s troubles  Brazil represents an undervalued emerging market opportunity 
Trouble in Paradise
So what s wrong with Brazil  Where to begin 
Brazil is a giant commodity play and  from oil to iron ore  prices have been in a free fall  President Dilma Rousseff is embroiled in a scandal amidst charges of corruption and mismanagement  Brazil s bloated government has 39 ministries and a widening fiscal deficit 
Inflation is soaring and its currency  the real  has lost 36  of its value against the U S  dollar in the last year  Brazil s stock market is reeling  The Brazil iShares ETF  N EWZ  is down 49 8  in the last year and small caps are down 63  This brings the market back to levels last seen in 2009 during the global financial crisis 
State owned Petrobras is down 70  this year alone and is weighed down by  107 billion of debt    80 billion of which is denominated in U S  dollars   ExxonMobil  N XOM  has a market value 10 times that of Petrobras  
Buy and Hold Is a Losing Game
This is the way it is with some emerging markets  It s a rollercoaster ride as stocks swing from euphoria to despair  Investors need to manage risk by waiting for a sharp selloff and then scooping up distressed deep value assets 
In other words  during a downward movement like this  you ll need to adjust your approach to investing in emerging markets in two ways 
Ignore the common advice of financial advisors to have a 10  or 20  allocation in your portfolio to emerging markets  This  buy and hold  strategy is a real loser 
Shift your focus from markets that are doing well to those that are out of favor   even hated 
Which brings us back to Brazil 
This month  I m leading a group of hedge funds to Brazil to evaluate opportunities  Here s what we ll be looking for 
Quality companies with solid earnings and low debt trading well below book or fair value 
Companies and assets that are in terrible shape  but are trading at distressed prices so cheap that the upside potential is well worth the downside risk 
Despite its present challenges  Brazil has some tremendous advantages 
The country has a youthful population with a giant consumer market  It s the world s largest producer of iron ore  coffee  and sugar cane  and the largest exporter of coffee  sugar  soy  meat  and chicken  Brazil is self sufficient in energy  and hydro supplies 40  of its electricity needs

94201,315716,PBR,Shell Betting On LNG And Brazil With BG Group,opinion,"Last week  Royal Dutch Shell  LONDON RDSa  put in motion a huge takeover offer for BG Group  LONDON BG  at a cool  70 billion 

The Shell BG deal is the largest in the sector since 1998  when Exxon bought Mobil 

If completed  the acquisition will add about 25  to Shell s oil and gas reserves and 20  to its level of hydrocarbon production 

What this acquisition really means  though  is that Shell is placing a long term bet on two key areas of the energy sector  liquid natural gas  LNG  and deepwater oil  specifically offshore of Brazil 

The results of this move are expected to be impressive  In fact  by 2020  Shell expects these two segments of the company   LNG and deepwater oil   to produce anywhere from  15 billion to  20 billion in cash flow 

Gambling on LNG

Shell is already a profitable player in natural gas  In 2014  the company reported earnings of  10 4 billion from gas  which is up 470  from the company s natural gas earnings just five years ago 

But soon  Shell will make even more from natural gas  BG Group owns the rights to the first sizable shipments of LNG from the United States to overseas buyers  thanks to its agreement with Cheniere Energy    

By 2018  the combined companies will be able to produce 45 million tons of LNG  That s 20  of the global output  That will be almost double the capacity of rival Exxon Mobil Corporation  NYSE XOM  

In effect  the deal is a bet that Asian demand for LNG will grow  The continent accounts for three quarters of global LNG demand already 

It s an interesting gambit considering the deal comes at a time when LNG prices in Asia are tumbling to less than  7 per million BTU  levels not seen since 2011  before the Fukushima nuclear disaster  The tumble is due to the fact that the majority of LNG in Asia is sold in long term contracts tied to the price of oil 

But Shell clearly believes that major LNG consuming countries in Asia  like China and India  will continue moving away from dirty coal to cleaner burning natural gas  Shell expects this increased demand to eventually push up LNG prices in Asia again 



So  in the longer term  this seems to be a reasonable bet 
Exxon estimates that global trade in LNG will more than triple by 2040 to nearly 100 billion cubic feet per day  Exxon also expects Asian countries to import half the natural gas they consume  with LNG making up 80  of that amount 

Rolling the Dice on Brazil

However  the second part of Shell s gambit is a lot more questionable 

You see  the deal will make Shell the leading foreign investor in Brazil s vast deepwater oil basins 

BG owns assets in Brazil s Santos Basin in conjunction with Petroleo Brasileiro Petrobras SA  NYSE PBR   the oil giant that has been buried under a corruption scandal 

Energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie says that  by 2025  Brazil will be the largest country position in Shell s vast portfolio  At the moment  that seems to be a dubious distinction 

Shell believes it will be able to increase its acquisition s oil output in Brazil to 550 000 barrels per day by the end of the decade  That would be a rise of more than four fold 

But the risks of major delays  thanks to Petrobras  troubles  including its solvency  are very real 

So  Good Deal or Bad Deal 

The Financial Times reports that many European oil analysts think that Shell needs oil to be at least  70 per barrel in the coming years for the deal to be a winner 

That may look like a stretch at the moment  But  historically  periods of low oil prices don t last for long periods of time  So  Shell may have time on its side 

That is  of course  if the deal gets the final okay from regulators around the globe  Chinese regulators may  for instance  demand that Shell divest some assets before giving approval for the takeover  Shell is probably hoping that China doesn t want it to divest its juiciest LNG assets 

And the chase continues ",2015-04-19,Wall Street Daily,https://www.investing.com/analysis/shell-betting-on-lng-and-brazil-with-bg-group-248856,248856
94202,315717,PBR,Trading Binary Events  PBR Case Study,opinion,"Petroleo Brasileiro Petrobras SA  NYSE PBR  reports earnings on Wednesday and given   it s likely that we will witness volatility as traders position themselves for the unknown 
Earnings releases are binary events  they can be great for shareholders or they can be dreadful  Stocks can either soar higher after a solid report or collapse if a company under delivers on Wall Street s expectations  I don t like betting on binary events  but trading stocks in anticipation of them can be exciting so long as you manage risk and trade with short time frames in mind 
So let s put aside the unknown that is Wall Street s reaction to the upcoming earnings release and take a look at the price action for  PBR to see what it may be hinting at  at least in the very near term 
Since the end of March  the bulls have dominated the price action on the daily time frame  as  DMI crossed above  DMI and has held above it since then  The momentum of the trending move higher picked up when the stock pushed above  7  as the rising ADX line on the hourly chart pointed out by the elongated blue arrow reflects 
However  since climbing to nearly  9 from its yearly lows of just under  5 a month ago   PBR is showing some signs of exhaustion  The ADX line on the hourly chart has been in decline  indicating a trading range scenario where the bulls and bears can be expected to push the price around between support and resistance levels 
Since 4 15  the  9 area has been a clear resistance level that the bulls have failed to overcome  Below  we have support at roughly the  8 30 price level  followed by a runaway gap around  7 75 that may be filled should bears be able to exert enough selling pressure 
The 5 day moving average is currently at  8 67 and the bulls have thus far held  PBR above it on every close since 3 30  However  the fact that the bulls were unable to close the stock above its open price yesterday  in addition to a subsequent rejection of price at the roughly  9 resistance level  is a sign of weakness on their part and may foreshadow a pull back in the short term 

The hourly chart is showing that RSI has been hovering at just above the 60 level since 4 16  the bulls are not as strong as they were just a few weeks ago and any sustained break lower in RSI would be in favor of the bears  Bollinger bands on the hourly chart are also tightening  which is a sign that volatility in price action is likely to commence soon 
If the bulls are able to manage a close above  9  this would be bullish  but with an earnings release approaching  there is no way to predict how Wall Street will respond  so its best to simply trade what one sees on the charts in limited time increments ",2015-04-21,Syncubate,https://www.investing.com/analysis/trading-binary-events:-$pbr-case-study-249110,249110

94206,315721,PBR,7 Cheap Dividend Stocks Trading For Less Than  10,opinion," Price is what you pay  Value is what you get    Warren Buffett

 Price  and  value  are often two very different things  Though a single share cost more than  200 000  Buffett s Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa  is considered a value stock by many  Yet Twitter  NYSE TWTR   which trades hands for just  35 per share  is often called a bubble stock 
Still  low priced stocks are a hunting ground for some very smart  very successful investors  Joel Tillinghast  manager of the Fidelity Low Priced Stock Fund  FLPSX   is one of the most successful fund managers of his generation  and he invests almost exclusively in stocks trading for less than  50 per share 
InvestorPlace Editor Hilary Kramer  author of  takes it a step further  focusing on stocks trading for less than  10 per share 

As Kramer points out  most  big money  institutional investors are prohibited from buying stocks priced at less than  10  And even if they have the ability  few have the intestinal fortitude  Their own research departments generally won t cover the stocks  and it s a career risk to buy a stock that is too far out of the mainstream 

But the rationale for buying a stock with a single digit price tag is straightforward  Due to the mechanics of the market  it s generally a lot easier for a  5 stock to go to  10 than for a  50 to go to  100  Yes  the percentages are the same  But lower priced stocks are often low capitalization stocks as well  A large investor moving into a small cap stock is going to move the price a lot more that he would in a large  liquid stock with an enormous float  The key is finding these gems before the big boys do 

Today  we re going to take a look at seven cheap dividend stocks trading for under  10  All have a few bumps and bruises on them  you simply don t get this kind of pricing otherwise  But all are also solid dividend payers worth a good  hard look 

Banco Santander  MADRID SAN   Banco Santander  

With Greece likely to default and send shockwaves through the Eurozone  a European bank might seem like an odd choice of investment  Yet Banco Santander  NYSE SAN  is one of biggest  best managed and most globally diversified banks in the world  Its US traded ADR also happens to sell for just  7 26 per share 

At current prices and exchange rates  Santander s  0 40 expected 2015 dividend works out to a yield of about 6 3   Santander cut its dividend earlier this year  as incoming Executive Chairman Ana Bot n make boosting the bank s capital cushion a top priority  That diluted existing shareholders which is part of the reason the shares trade at the bargain prices they do today but it also made Santander a safer  more conservative bank going forward 

An unruly default in Greece will probably rattle Santander s stock  If it does  use the volatility as an opportunity to load up on a cheap stock with a fantastic dividend  And here s one more thing worth mentioning  Legendary contrarian value investor David Dreman has recently become a strong buyer  Dreman initially purchased Santander in 2010 and has grown his share count from 111 820 shares to 631 135 as of last quarter 

Prospect Capital

I ve written quite a bit about business development company Prospect Capital  NASDAQ PSEC  lately  see  A Look at the Most Hated Stock on Wall Street   

There s a reason for that  At current prices  around  7 70  I consider it one of the best bargain stocks in America today  The stock trades at a 25  discount to book value  a book value that was just reaffirmed this past quarter  To put that in perspective  its peers in the BDC sector trade at an average discount to book value of just 6   The last time Prospect Capital was this cheap  it returned 60  in capital gains and dividends over the following 12 months  Even if we got only half that return this time around  that would be a fantastic return we re not likely to find too many places in today s overpriced stock market 

Prospect Capital s dividend  which is paid monthly  works out to a 13  dividend yield at today s prices  And I expect the dividend to be safe for at least the next 9 12 months  Prospect Capital cut its divided last year as part of a larger strategy to de risk the company  While the dividend cut was not popular with investors   and is a big reason why the stock trades at the discount it does today   it was the only sensible move  Management wanted to avoid reaching for yield  risking defaults and ultimately putting the company at risk 

The good news is that  with the dividend cut out of the way  investors can feel a lot more comfortable with today s very attractive payout 

American Realty Capital Properties 

It may be a little controversial to include American Realty Capital Properties  NASDAQ ARCP  on this list  ARCP temporarily suspended its dividend late last year as it dealt with the fallout from its accounting snafu   For a review of ARCP s accounting saga see  Accounting Irregularities knock down ARCP  Buying Opportunity or Enron Part II   

ARCP s management has been somewhat vague about when the dividend will be reinstated  though most analysts that follow the stock expect it by later this year 

While they are waiting  investors can buy an inexpensive REIT loaded up with high quality retail properties trading for just  8 66 per share 

Accounting scandals are an ugly affair and bring to mind the unfortunate Enron affair  But after its travails and subsequent audits  ARCP may very well now have the cleanest and most conservative accounting books in America  But because investors are still wary of the stock  we can get it at a fantastic price  Shares of ARCP trade for just 86  of book value  To put that in perspective  Realty Income  NYSE O    considered by most analysts to be the blue chip in the triple net retail REIT sector   trades for 202  of book value 

It might be a while before investors award ARCP a similar valuation  But buying at today s prices  we have a wide margin of safety  And once the dividend is reinstated  I would expect a dividend yield somewhere in the ballpark of 5  7  based on today s prices and perhaps even higher 

Lexington Realty Trust 

Up next is another REIT that has taken its knocks  Lexington Realty Trust  NYSE LXP    Lexington trades for just  9 34 per share and sports a 7 6  dividend yield 

As with the rest of the REIT sector  2015 has not been kind to Lexington  As recently as January  it was trading for  11 69 per share  Fears of Fed tightening have taken a wrecking ball to bond prices and to the prices of  bond like  investments like high yielding REITs  So the sell off in Lexington shares has relatively little to do with the REIT itself and a lot to do with macro concerns about interest rates 

But even so  Lexington is cheap relative to its peers  According to REIT guru Brad Thomas  Lexington has one of the lowest price FFO multiples in the REIT universe at just 8 9  To put that in perspective blue chip Realty Income trades at a price FFO multiple of 17 6 

Lexington is a riskier REIT than Realty Income and should trade at a modest discount  But the discount we see today is anything but modest  At today s prices  Lexington would seem too good to pass up 

Fortress Investment Group 

Going a very different direction  we come to private equity manager Fortress Investment Group  NYSE FIG   Despite the size of its business   Fortress has  70 billion under management scattered across various funds and strategies   Fortress trades for just  7 71 per shares and yields a respectable 4 2  in dividends 

Fortress is best known as a private equity manager  and the firm s biggest investments in this space are in transportation  infrastructure  financial services and senior living  But private equity only accounts for for about  15 billion of Fortress s total assets under management  Fortress also manages about  14 billion in distressed debt funds and about  8 billion in aggressive hedge fund strategies  But the bulk of Fortress s business   at  33 billion in assets   comes from good  old fashioned plain vanilla bond portfolios 

Fortress s stock price has struggled over the past two years and has been choppy and volatile since coming out of the 2008 meltdown  But Fortress has beaten the pants off the S P since the beginning of 2009  generating returns of 244  to the S P 500 s 138   And those figures don t include Fortress s higher dividend 

Fortress  like the rest of the financial sector  might have a hard time navigating the Fed s coming tightening cycle  Only time will tell  But at  7 71  the shares might be worth a stab 

TransAlta Corp 

Next up is Canada based utility TransAlta Corp  NYSE TAC   a non regulated power generation company with operations in the United States  Canada and Australia 

TransAlta owns and operates hydroelectric  wind  natural gas and coal fired facilities  It also actively trades electricity and other energy related commodities and derivatives 

TransAlta has had a rough run  As recently as two years ago  shares traded hands for more than  14 per share  Today  shares fetch just  7 99 

TransAlta s dividend will appear wildly variable to American investors  That s because  as a Canadian company  it declares its dividends in Canadian dollars  TransAlta s dividend has been set at 18 Canadian cents per quarter since April 2014  At current exchange rates  that works out to 14 6 U S  cents for a dividend yield of 7 3  

That s not too shabby  Though be warned  TransAlta aggressively cut its dividend in 2014 from 29 Canadian cents per quarter 

Braskem SA 

And finally  we get to Brazilian chemical producer Braskem SA  NYSE BAK   You can roughly think of Braskem as the Brazilian equivalent of Dow Chemical  NYSE DOW   though it specializes specifically in petrochemicals  And speaking of  petro   Braskem is an affiliated company of Brazilian oil major Petrobras  NYSE PBR   which partially explains why the share price has plunged to the depths that its has  Petrobras was embroiled in a corruption scandal last year that still threatens to bring down the presidency of Dilma Rousseff 

At time of writing  Braskem traded for  8 58 after trading as high as  15 59 last November  The dividend yield is a respectable 4 4  

Your biggest concern with Braskem is Brazil s macro stability  The Brazilian economy is slowing  even while inflation is on the rise  It s the modern day version of 1970s stagflation  and it isn t pretty 

All the same  Brazilian stocks are cheap  and strength in the Brazilian real due to central bank tightening should be good for holders of the American ADRs  Consider Braskem a high risk but potentially very high return play on a Brazilian return to macro stability ",2015-06-22,Charles Sizemore,https://www.investing.com/analysis/7-cheap-dividend-stocks-trading-for-less-than-$10-255749,255749

Fresh measures from the government included stopping new share sales  central bank assistance to financial margin trading and share purchases made by state owned finance companies  However  these measures failed to boost investor sentiment  The market rally had been fueled by small investors  who seemed to be disillusioned at this point 
The CSI 300 advanced 2 9   However  a sub index of tech stocks within the index slumped 4   A decline in such stocks also caused the ChiNext to lose 4 3   Meanwhile the Shenzhen Composite declined 2 7   The Hang Seng lost 3 2   and had declined 11  from the highs achieved in April  The H share index dipped 3

The benchmark index slumped to its lowest level in three months on Wednesday  Additional steps taken by the government could not reassure margin traders who continued to reduce their positions  The benchmark declined 5 9  as margin traders offloaded shares worth  15 8 billion on the Shanghai exchange  These shares had been acquired through borrowed funds 
Among new government measures  the China Financial Futures Exchange increased margin requirements needed to short contracts on the CSI 500  which is dominated by small caps  Additionally  China Securities Finance Corp  announced it would purchase additional shares of small and mid cap companies  Meanwhile  the government instructed state owned companies to refrain from reducing their stake in listed companies

Next Week s Outlook 
Markets have lost  3 9 trillion within less than a month  Stocks  dream run seems to have halted  primarily due to the rout unleashed by margin traders  With every passing day  positions built up through borrowed money are being reduced at a record clip 
A series of government measures are being consistently unveiled  but their effects have been limited to large state owned enterprises  These have ranged from stringent regulation from the securities regulator as well as fund injection into state run enterprises 
Next week features key data on new yuan loans  balance of trade  fixed asset investment  industrial production and retail sales  Additionally  crucial GDP numbers will also be released  If most of these are on the positive side  stocks might receive a much needed boost  Meanwhile  it remains to be seen whether a series of measures taken by the government have their desired effect ",2015-07-10,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/china-stock-roundup:-mindray-medical-to-buy-remaining-stake-in-dragonbio-257882,257882
94210,315725,PBR,Sugar  External Factors And Internal Problems,opinion,"The external factors have been affecting the sugar market  preventing NY prices recovery from lasting long  In the middle of last week  we saw sugar quotes heavily plummet  Blame it on commodity prices dropping in the Chinese market or that country s stock exchange  which has devalued dramatically  Oil  for instance  has already lost almost 12   WTI  and 8   Brent  only this month  Although average gas price in Center South is still lower than that on the foreign market by about 7 4   gas price readjustment by Petrobras  NYSE PBR  might be postponed if this oil downward trend goes on   this is not good news for the mils 
We thought more sugarcane would be directed toward ethanol as a result of better paid prices than that paid for sugar  but what we have seen over the last days is hydrous price drop due to sale pressure by mills in order to make cash and meet their most pressing financial obligations  Besides  the real has heavily devalued this week  which must have helped the NY sugar market fall even further   this is not good news for the mills 
To top it all off  the amount of sugarcane crushing published by UNICA this week reached a 46 5 million ton record and the market   more short sighted than an adolescent   of course promptly reacted like there was no tomorrow  Some companies are setting the amount of crushing for 2015 2016 close to 600 million tons 
Despite the gray scenario  NY ended up closing the week basically unchanged for the first maturity month  with October 2015 closing at 12 41 cents per pound  a little more than 2 dollars per ton over the previous week s closing  The other months  however  were weaker and closed at up to 3 dollar per ton falls  So  there is nothing to show that we can get our hopes up because October is influenced by the market s short term perception  The spread for October 2015   March 2016  which was trading at a 160 point discount  closed at 124 points  after having narrowed in up to 105 points   The cost of sugar production by the Archer model is R 38 9823 per bag ex mill  which is about 12 40 cents per pound FOB Santos  That is  exports have a negative margin today  Despite the different costs we have seen on the market  I believe that hydrous has a slightly higher return  but even so  there is nothing for the foreign market to feel excited about 
The average closing price of sugar in NY in June was 11 75 cents per pound  almost 22  lower than the average price in January  the steepest fall between these two months since 2010  The average price of 11 75 cents per pound refers to the Archer model estimating the top price peak for October 2015  negotiating month for March 2016 at the stock  at 15 69 cents per pound 
This week  another Ethanol Summit  one of the most important events of the world on renewable energies    especially ethanol and sugarcane byproducts   which takes place every two years and is organized by  NICA  was held in S o Paulo  At the first discussion panel  where a lecture given by the president of Petrobras  Aldemir Bendine  was expected  the audience was taken by surprise when the oil state owned company s executive regretted to have to leave earlier due to another urgent commitment  That is  a total lack of respect toward those who were present and looking forward to hearing the president talk about the company s situation and its relations to the sugar alcohol sector today 
It is hard to believe the esteemed executive did not set aside a day on his calendar for such an important event  which happens every two years  The ugly truth is that being afraid of the possible embarrassment he might have at the panel discussion table and the possible provocations by the amazing journalist William Waak  who again hosted the event expertly  and certainly wouldn t miss the chance to bring the  petrol o  subject into discussion  the state owned company executive left through the back door  In his brief presentation to the audience  he stumbled over the vernacular and struggled with poor Portuguese language  This is the face of Dilma s Brazil and her tamed executives

94229,315744,PBR,Oil Close To Support   Who Believes That ,opinion,"The Sugar market is still pressured by the devaluation of the real against the dollar and also by the Oil accumulating falls on the foreign market  The Gas price increase by only 3  announced by Petrobras  SA PETR4  and starting this Friday was badly perceived by the Brazilian stock market  which expected a higher percentage so that the state run oil company could start slowly making up for the huge loss it has had with price subsidies 
Now  the sugar price in NY reacted positively reaching up to 38 points for March 2015  Ultimately  it closed the week at 15 69 cents per pound with a 33 point negative variation against the previous week  The other months varied between a 5 50 and 10 dollar fall per ton in the week   Technical analysts say that the futures sugar market can still fall even further  Since this is not really up my alley  I d rather focus on what I can explain  Let s see  This week the dollar was being traded at 2 5750 on the spot market  If someone made a dollar NDF  non deliverable forward  maturing within ten months and took advantage of the rate for October 2015 at 16 68 cents per pound  he would have a price fixing between R 1 050 and R 1 100 per ton  The 2014 average is at R 872 per ton  That is  for two years  things have been pretty much the same price wise   Putting this into perspective  we can infer that the 2 5600 exchange rate practiced this Friday  and using the average closure in reals of the year mentioned above  March 2015 theoretically would have a support of 14 85 cents per pound  that is  about 100 points under what the futures market is at today  However  if we consider that export businesses are being made with a 100 point discount for delivery in November  the market is above its support   Brazil should demand 86 3 million ATRs next year to meet the export market and internal consumption needs which together add up to 36 7 million tons of sugar and ethanol which should demand almost 28 billion liters  taking into account the internal market  exports and others  That is  in this equation  the Center South will have to produce at least 575 million tons of sugarcane for the 2015 2016 harvest  Considering the critical situation in which the sector is and with few graceful ways out of it  admitting that we need to grow almost 3  next year might sound like a joke   The English newspaper The Economist has published an interesting article comparing the present oil values to the minimum price level necessary so that the producing countries could carry on with their budgetary policies  The fact is that below US 90 a barrel the situation gets dire for most producers  mainly those relying on the commodity  The question that comes up in discussion groups is which the break even value is for the pre salt production  According to some experts in the area  Brazilian oil will become economically unviable if its foreign market quotation goes below US 70 a barrel  And  more importantly  how come this government has given up on such a renewable fuel like ethanol   Election ploy   that is the least we can call it  What Dilma has done after getting reelected is exactly what she was saying A cio would do  Electric energy price  interest rate  gas price are all going up  and Mantega is pointing to decreasing the role of the public banks  If Brazil were under a parliamentary regime  Dilma would have already been thrown out  It will take a lot to put up with this haughty and cheeky president for another four years ",2014-11-10,Arnaldo Luiz Correa,https://www.investing.com/analysis/oil-close-to-support---who-believes-that-231995,231995
94230,315745,PBR,No Confidence  No Gains,opinion,The Ibovespa the main Brazilian benchmark opened for the first day of trading on January 2  2014  at 51 522 points and with dire prospects  The economy was struggling  public indebtedness was rising and there was a bout of inflation that brought concerns to the trading desks  The blue chips  Petrobras SA  SA PETR4  and Vale do Rio Doce had been punished severely as a result of the government mismanagement not only of the oil stated owned company  but also of the economy as a whole  To make the situation even worst  the president Dilma Rousseff was expected to win the elections by a large margin  The kickoff of Petrobras shares at 17 15 reais  approximately 6 35 dollars in current values  makes investors now regret any move toward those assets  The shares closed 28 November at 12 84 reais  25  below its opening in the first day of trading this year  Needless to say that macroeconomics has played a key role in holding back the stocks due to the crude oil prices and the decision made by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries  OPEP  in favor of keeping the level of production unchanged  The contamination is inevitable  but the mining company Vale do Rio Doce had its own reasons for losing so much market value Vale do Rio Doce shares opened for the first day of trading at 32 80 reais  approximately 12 11 dollars in current values   As a result of the continuation of the Chinese slowdown  the iron ore prices have fallen sharply  leading the mining company assets to close at 19 93 reais on 28 November an astonishing 40  drop in relation to its opening for the year  Macroeconomics accounts for most of the trend  but investors  general perception is also decisive for a better understanding of the downward trend  Investors don t trust the Brazilian government so there is a sentiment that Brazil is a dangerous gamble right now  The government keeps reinforcing this perception by altering the rules of the game at any time  President Dilma Rousseff announced a few weeks ago that would work around the clock with Congress to pass legislation aimed to exempt the federal government from the obligation of meeting the primary surplus goal of 116 billion reais  Clearly  the intent is to pass a bill with no clarity regarding what level of surplus is expected  allowing the government to save the amount of money it finds convenient  The problem is that Brazil is facing a bitter combination of rising public indebtness that requires more and more money to roll over the debt  and a slowdown in the economic activity whose effect is less money from taxes flowing into the government accounts  The only way to close the math without altering the legislation is by rising taxes which might be lethal for an economy that is so close to the recessionary territory  In addition to that  inflation remains a concern so the government is expected to continue raising the interest rate  what will cause comsuption to fall  Brazilians should expect rainy days ahead  The Ibovespa is unlikely to recover from the recent losses as the government continues its delusional stance toward the actual conditions of the economy  By seizing the Congress in order to make sure president Rousseff be kept from severe penalties for not meeting the primary surplus goal  the government makes clear that it has the votes to pass any legislation  The Brazilian stock market will no hesitate to price in all these variables ,2014-12-03,Artur Oliveira,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/no-confidence,-no-gains-234516",234516
94231,315746,PBR,Petrobras  Is There Value After The Oil Stock Rout ,opinion,"It s been a rough run for Brazilian state controlled oil giant Petrobras  NYSE PBR   The stock has been in almost continuous decline since late 2009 and its U S  traded ADR has lost nearly two thirds of its value since July 

This is a stock that was trading at over  70 per share in mid 2008  It now trades for barely one tenth of that value  the Petrobras ADR now trades at 2004 prices  It s as if the massive mid 2000s bull market in Brazil and the rest of the emerging markets never happened 

So  what s the story here  Why are investors giving Petrobras such a thorough thrashing 

It s a long list  but I ll start with the most pressing  Petrobras is engulfed in a nasty corruption probe that alleges the company systematically overpaid for assets and labor and that the proceeds were used by the government to give kickbacks to prominent politicians in exchange for votes  It s so bad that Petrobras  because its auditors refused to approve them 

This brings me to the second reason for Petrobras fall from grace  Dilma  Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff is ahem not known for being friendly to business  Much of the massive bull run in Brazilian stocks during the first half of the year was based on the believe that Dilma would lose reelection  And most of the brutal bear market that has endured since has been a result of her expected  and realized  reelection  Dilma herself has not been personally implicated in the kickback scandal though dozens of congressmen from her party have  Dilma s real damage is not due to corruption  however  but her preference for using the company as an instrument of the state 

Rather than allow Petrobras to be run like a normal  for profit business  she has used it as a social policy tool  A cynic might say she forced Petrobras to keep retail gasoline prices low as a way of buying votes for reelection   And yes  count me as a cynic in this case   Unfortunately for Petrobras shareholders  politics trump economics 

With profitability crimped by price controls  Petrobras has had to borrow heavily in order to fund capital expenditures  Petrobras is the most heavily indebted energy company in the world  with  106 billion in long term debt  To put that in perspective  Exxon Mobil  NYSE XOM   which is eight times larger than Petrobras by market cap and three times bigger in terms of annual revenues has only  12 billion in long term debt 

And finally  while Brazil is now a major energy player  its largest reserves are located in deepwater fields that are expensive to exploit  One estimate puts the breakeven price for Brazil s offshore fields at above  120 per barrel  With the price of crude now hovering at about half that price  Petrobras  greatest assets are essentially unexploitable 

Political corruption a president that views the company as a piggy bank for social policies a high debt burden and massive quantities of oil that are too expensive to exploit at current market prices  No wonder investors have dumped Petrobras  But is the selling overdone 

At current prices  Petrobras trades for just 6 times expected 2014 earnings and 4 times expected 2015 earnings  It also trades for an almost pitiful 0 37 times book value and 0 41 times sales 

Any way you slice it  Petrobras is cheap  But if the last several years in Brazilian stocks has proven anything  it would be that cheap stocks can always get cheaper  Right now  Petrbras is a proverbial falling knife that I wouldn t recommend you try catching with a large purchase just yet  Though I would recommend you consider averaging into the stock slowly over the next several months 

Petrobras is a stock that can move fast  It doubled in value between March and September of this year before giving up all of those gains and more in the selloff  Buying it today  at decade lows  would likely be a fantastic entry point for a 3 5 year investment time horizon  Just expect it to be a wild ride in the meantime ",2014-12-15,Charles Sizemore,https://www.investing.com/analysis/petrobras:-is-there-value-after-the-oil-stock-rout-235748,235748

fall from 8 17  to 6 76   Unsurprisingly  the dollar is making new all time highs against the lira  which would argue for postponing any emergency rate cuts  Indeed  the bank tried some damage control  saying market moves were not in line with rate cuts  Too little  too late 3  Pakistan s central bank surprised with a more aggressive cut than expected  The bank eased by 100 bp to 8 50   when only a 50 bp cut was expected  This follows a 50 bp cut in November  which came with a downward revision to its economic forecast  Officials cited improving macroeconomic conditions  declining inflation  rising foreign exchange reserves  and a contained fiscal deficit as factors behind this latest cut 4  Russia central bank surprised with a rate cut  The policy rate was lowered 2 percentage points to 15 0   We knew that the new man at the central bank  Dmitry Tulin  was placed as the head of monetary policy to take some action  but we didn t expect it to happen so soon  The central bank stated that  Inflation and inflation expectations are forecast to decrease as the economy gradually adjusts to changing external conditions and the impact of the exchange rate dynamics on prices wanes   We expect to revisit the December lows for the ruble in the coming weeks 5  S P downgraded Russia one notch to BB  with a negative outlook  We totally agree with this move to junk  as our model has

directors couldn t agree on a methodology to estimate the cost of the corruption scandals to the company  So while Petrobras met the deadline to release its Q3 earnings  it was hardly satisfying to investors  The stock price initially tumbled 12   Petrobras also announced that it would cut 2015 investment to  31 33 bln compared with  42 bln budgeted for last year  This would be the lowest since  29 9 bln in 2008 7  Finance Minister Levy said Brazil doesn t want to keep BRL artificially strong  This is his first substantive comment on the exchange rate  and sounds like a signal that the central bank will start to pare back its FX swaps program  Between this and the awful fiscal data  primary deficit of  0 63  of GDP was the worst since November 1998  nominal deficit of  6 7  of GDP was the worst since August 1999   sentiment remains poor  Brazil has a few months to turn things around  Otherwise  we think a junk rating will be seen  We already saw it with Russia  so agencies are not shy about downgrading to junk if it s warranted 8  Belarus President Lukashenko said the country was considering debt restructuring  but then said there would be no default  Yields spiked for foreign currency government debt spiked over 100 bp  now trading around 25  today and this comes after a near 40  depreciation just this month  The country could tap Russia for up to  500 mn in aid

94234,315749,PBR,Brazilian Economy Continues To Worsen  2015 Contraction Expected ,opinion,"Brazil s economic uncertainty continues to worsen  While growth projections for all the BRICS have been lowered  for the first time in years Brazil s economy is now expected to contract in 2015 
 We can see the impending recession reflected in the nation s inverted government bond yield curve 

 The fiscal situation has worsened materially  As the Economist recently pointed out  wage growth of public sector employees is unsustainable 
 The government is now forced to undertake significant austerity measures which will hit the economy hard  Years of mismanagement have come home to roost  With fiscal risks on the rise  the nation s sovereign CDS remains elevated  
 The Brazilian real hit new lows not seen in over a decade  as the economy struggles  Furthermore the Petrobras  NYSE PBR  scandal as well as its potential impact on state banks  which are massively exposed to the firm s credit risk  weigh on the currency 
As the currency depreciates  the nation s dollar denominated debt is becoming increasingly burdensome 
In response to the currency weakness  Brazil s central bank hiked rates to the highest level since 2009 to stabilize the currency and fight rising inflation  This will further dampen credit demand and accelerate the recession  Now all we need is for the Fed to hike rates  That will put more downward pressure on the real and force Brazil s rates even higher  As it is the 10 Year government bond yield is already above 12 75  

It s important to point out that given its significance to the global economy  Brazil s problems can spread way beyond its borders  The Petrobras scandal for example has shaken other Latin American debt markets     The currency weakness in Brazil is now pressuring some international commodity markets  The nation s growers of sugar  oranges  etc  can dump commodities at lower dollar prices and still come out ahead in domestic currency terms  As a result  orange juice and sugar futures have fallen sharply  May 15 contracts shown below   A number of other commodity markets will be impacted as well ",2015-03-05,Sober Look,https://www.investing.com/analysis/an-update-on-brazil's-flagging-economy-243957,243957
94255,315770,PBR,Brazil  Politics Driven Markets,opinion,"Investors follow the news in order to identify both economic drivers and corporate data so that they can make their financial decisions  However  stock markets can be tricky at certain occasions  especially when there is a high level of volatility led by uncertainty in the most important economies  As a result  market participants behave based on what the central banks are expected to do next instead of taking into account a firm or weak recovery of the economy  
The United States
The Federal Reserve s commitment to purchase billions in mortgage backed securities and treasury securities in order to  respectively  help many American families which still struggle to pay for their houses  and keep the interest rate near zero  has changed the market dynamics  In other words  at certain moments back in 2012  investors expected bad data to be reported regarding the business environment  so the Central Bank was unlikely to slow down in its asset purchasing program  As a result of this nonsensical behavior  corporations are likely to withdraw when it comes to issuing new shares or selling debt to support their projects  Stock prices are led mostly by feelings and expectations regarding politics rather than portray the actual state of the economy  Speculators jump into seeking gains through volatility  whereas long term investors rush to the sidelines to protect their savings  As the global economy still struggles to recover from the 2008 financial crisis in the United States and sovereign debt issues in Europe  instability in the stock markets keeps many economies from strengthening  
Brazil
Investors have already chosen one side  they are eager to support any candidate but the current president  Dilma Rousseff  Every time the polls indicate Mrs  Rousseff is losing territory  the market caps of state owned companies increase substantially  Therefore  the market participants are willing to watch the diminution of the state oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA  Petrobras  NYSE PBR  today for a better future without political scandals and mismanagement regarding the use of the company as a tool to fight inflation Investing in Brazil is such a delicate issue for a simple reason  macroeconomics keep telling you that the Latin American country is likely to face a bitter combination of lower growth prospects and higher prices in the next years  On the other hand  as we have seen  the shares of Petrobras  which make up about 14  of the Brazilian benchmark Bovespa are driven mostly by politics  it seems to be a huge opportunity cost for investors to not put their money into Petrobras ",2014-06-22,Artur Oliveira,https://www.investing.com/analysis/brazil:-politics-driven-markets-216913,216913
94256,315771,PBR,Inside Brazil s Economy,opinion,"As Brazil still struggles for its solidification on the international stage  many hurdles keep the Latin American country from becoming an attractive market for foreign investors  At this time  I ll look at various aspects that play a major role in spoiling the perception of big players regarding the Brazilian Economy 
Delusionshttp   
There is no culture of investments in Brazil  what is translated into a small percentage of Brazilians taking risks in the stock markets  This unwillingness to face volatility and uncertainty for big gains in the long term leads to fewer money available for companies to support their projects 
Despite the small number of investors  there is a growing interest for investments in Brazil as competition between brokerage houses brings costs of intermediation down  This excitement regarding stocks creates the perfect environment for delusions as we could see in the OGX  SA OGXP3  oil company case 
The billionaire  Eike Batista  had the ability to convince investors that his projects    or dreams    were viable by deluding them about production data  environmental permits and so on  what led to a huge level of volatility in the shares  Speculators jumped into for gains through volatility  whereas long term investors who had put their money into the company by participating in the IPO got extremely frustrated  As a result  shares fell from above 20 reais    approximately 8 U S  dollars to one fifth of a real 
Macroeconomics
Since governments are not willing to tackle the actual reasons of inflation in Brazil    for example  the precarious infrastructure  which keeps businessmen from increasing production    the interest rate is the main tool by which authorities fight the rising prices in the economy 
As I mentioned previously  Brazil lacks a culture of investments which transforms the stock markets into a consistent tool of funding for corporations  Every time authorities face an inflationary process  the interest rate is raised to keep rising prices from hurting consumption and production figures  As a result  fixed income investments become more attractive  so that people are likely to choose those instead of putting their money into stocks 
Besides  by raising the interest rate constantly  some segments of the economy such as retail and wholesale  which deeply rely on credit  the financial industry and others sectors  are affected substantially by the enhancement of the money price  what will result in a bad performance of the stock markets as a whole 
Commodities Oriented Markets
According to statistics provided by BM FBovespa  back in the first quarter of 2013  Petroleo  NYSE PBR  shares accounted for more than 10  of all the trading volume of the Bovespa  the main benchmark   If we put together both    Petrobras and Vale do Rio Doce    into the analysis  the final outcome will reach 20  of the total volume of trade  Therefore  it is fair to state that the Brazilian stock markets are highly dependent of the commodities markets  which often leads to deviations in prices as a result of the overweight of some corporations

94257,315772,PBR,Trying To Make Sense Of The Brazilian Markets,opinion,"The main benchmark  Bovespa  bounced back 44 965 points back in April to an astonishing 56 966 points in the last trading session on July 18  driven mostly by the higher expectations of a shift in power in the Latin American country  The very simple message to investors  read the newspapers and follow the polls before putting your money into stocks  especially those that might be hugely affected by the electoral outcome 
I look forward to seeing how the market responds to some of the characteristics ofBrazil s politicians  We have seen in the last months a growing expectation over the opposition candidate  Aecio Neves  whose campaign is gaining traction as a result of the dissatisfaction over higher prices and lower growth prospects  That said  how are players expected to behave in the face of scandals making daily headlines 
Candidates are likely to point their fingers at each other in order to win the electoral race in September  which will lead to headlines that will distract people instead of allowing them to focus on productive debates  The big question  How will the market behave in the face of accusations among the contenders  How to measure the political gains or damages on the campaigns  To which  there are no clear answers 
Investors are eager to see changes in the way the Brazilian economy is run  so that anything that hurts president Rousseff s aim of remaining in power is welcomed by market participants  That s the common sense that accounts for the recent moves to the upside by some Brazilian stocks like state oil company  Petrobras  NYSE PBR   And of course  there is the geopolitical component to consider 
The conflict in the Middle East    which worsens as time goes by    and Europe and the United States moving toward tighter sanctions against Russia in the face of the downed civilian jetliner  are likely to lead oil prices up world wide  Such movement  in macroeconomic terms  will benefit Petrobras  whose shares tend to go up as a consequence of higher earnings prospects 
Finally  of the many variables driving Brazil s markets  the most important is the political factor  Certainly  most players are eager to see the Party of Workers step down from power  However  geopolitics might play a major role in strengthening the optimism by leading prices even higher 
As a consequence of a more stable environment with less volatility led by politics  the new government will find the proper conditions to implement economic change and  more specifically  change in the how state companies are run

94259,315774,PBR,Petrobras Plummets Beyond Recession Lows,opinion,"On March 17th  Petroleo Brasileiro SA  Petrobras  NYSE PBR  hit a bottom at 11 84 reais  approximately  5 84  as investors showed their dissatisfaction regarding the mismanagement of the stated owned company  Even in 2008  during the height of the financial crisis  the shares hadn t been hurt so badly  they plummeted to 15 38 reais or approximately  7 in November of that year  
There are some differences between the 2008 financial crisis  and the internal issues that Petrobras faces right now when it comes to public perception  Six years ago there were fears of a global recession led by a slowdown in comsuption as a result of high unemployment  and in investments   regarded here as capital channeled for the purchase of equipments and machinery  Therefore  Petrobras was likely to be affected by a lower demand for Crude Oil and other products 
Today  there is a different story to be revealed  The global economy is struggling to heal from the financial crisis in the United States and the sovereign debt issues in Europe  but the prevailing sentiment was that of resilience regarding the challenges the oil company faced in the years following the two events  Now  the attitude toward the markets is not the same  investors are taking riskier positions by generating strong rallies driven by expectations of a shift in power  It is not about proposing a solution  but making those causing damages leave  Let s see how much they are betting on this 
On August 13th  the day of the tragedy that killed the candidate Eduardo Campos of the Brazilian Socialist Party  PSB  and brought Marina Silva of the Pro Environment Party  PV  into the game  Petrobras presented a huge trading volume of as much as 2 billions reais  approximately 900 millions U S dollars   In the days following this strong movement to the upside  there was a slowdown in the purchases as a consequence of investors locking in gains and waiting for drivers to support new rallies 
The upward trend that occurred on August 13th is the result of several reasons  First  a stronger candidate  who got 18 million votes back in 2010  stepping in a election that was likely to be won by the incumbent  Dilma Rousseff  Second  optimism spread by banks and brokerage houses that have been struggling for years to bring clients round that markets are still attractive for those with long term views  And  third  breaks of technical points might have led short sellers to give up their positions in the face of rising risks for them 
Finally  it is important to make some observations  There is so much room for the benchmark Bovespa to rise as the Brazilian market struggles to cope with rising public indebtedness and slower prospect of growth which has led the Latin America country to stay far behind the upward trend of the US in recent months  Despite the economic conditions  corporations are strong  so investors are likely to find Brazil attractive at certain point  especially if the electoral outcome confirms expectations of a new government committed to tackling the fiscal issues ",2014-08-25,Artur Oliveira,https://www.investing.com/analysis/petrobras-plummets-beyond-recession-lows-223710,223710
94262,315777,PBR,Corruption Scandal Makes The Brazilian Elections Even More Exciting,opinion,The political outlook for the Brazilian elections is being rocked by leaked information about the corruption scandal surrounding Petroleo Brasileiro SA  Petrobras   NYSE PBR  former director Paulo Roberto Costa   affectionately known as the  suicide bomber   The man bomb has agreed to a plea bargain  i e  providing information in exchange for a reduced sentence  and has begun to talk  According to the leak in  Veja  magazine  he has essentially confirmed that the multi billion dollar deal was designed to keep congressional support for President Dilma s ruling coalition  and Lula s coalition before her   He cited dozens of politicians involved  including several member of the PT such as the party s Treasurer  a minister  and a former minister  Eduardo Campos  the former presidential candidate killed in the airplane crash  was also cited  Here is our first take on the developments What does this mean to the race   This is likely to be more noise than signal in the end  But whatever impact there is  it will be disproportionately negative for President Dilma   The impact on voting patterns will probably be small and unlikely to change the first round result  Dilma and Marina will still probably face each other in the second round because   Past political scandals have not impacted the president as much   Dilma s support rests largely on lower income groups  which will probably see less of the media coverage and be less sensitive to it   Dilma is not too far from her very elevated hard core support base  i e  floor   which are voters who will not change their vote no matter what happens But it does represent a large tail risk for Dilma and the PT  see below    This could hurt Marina  since Campos was implicated  However  it will be difficult for Dilma to exploit this given her own party s involvement   From another perspective  another high profile corruption case could increase the public s rejection of the political system and status quo  further fuelling the protest vote that has benefited Marina so much Unless Aecio  PSDB  feels that now he has a real shot at winning  which we very much doubt  he is likely to focus his attacks on Dilma  whilst sparing Marina  Aecio could also benefit from the scandal by having the moral high ground  since the PSDB has so far not been implicated  This increases the chances of an alliance between the Marina s PSB and the PSDB  For two reasons   1  Because the PMDB  another coalition option for a Marina government  is likely to be severely hurt by scandal  it will make it difficult for Marina s new politics government to make an alliance with the party so heavily involved in the corruption allegations   2  Marina may come out a bit bruised and  if anything  Aecio s  value  will rise The tail risks and the low probability events  A  Aecio comes back  The PSDB has not been implicated at all in the scandal  as far as we know  If Campos  involvement in the scandal contaminates Marina  she could lose her status as a clean representative of new politics  This could give Aecio the moral high ground to go heavily on the offensive against both Marina and DIlma  aiming for the second round  The bar is high for Aecio to go down this path  probably requiring a substantial change in polls in his favor  The strategic risk in this gambit is that it will greatly reduce his changes of an alliance with Marina later on  which will probably be necessary for him to beat Dilma in the second round in any reasonable scenario  B  Increases the chances of a first round alliance between Marina and Aecio  This is how the narrative would go  Dilma gets damaged enough by this scandal to make a first round victory by Marina possible  In this case  Aecio and Marina could cut a deal  he supports her in to win a first round victory and Marina supports him in the next elections  Marina has stated she will only stay in the presidency for one term   Then Aecio would focus his efforts on trying to rescue his home state of Minas  the second largest in the country  and where PSDB has lost a lot of ground  This scenario is still very unlikely  but the odds have increased   C  The scandal reaches huge proportions and compromises the existence of the PT and Lula s political future  This story has the potential to not only eliminate Dilma  but also undermines the PT in local elections   though recent history of scandals suggests otherwise  In any case  if Lula is as close to the bomb man as some reports suggest  this could represent a dramatic change in outlook for Brazil s future  Most observers consider it almost a given that Lula will run in the next presidential elections  so this could jeopardize or weaken his bid  Separately  Marina already hinted at the idea of picking off political leaders she respects from other parties  opposition or not  including the PT  Recall that Marina was a member of the PT for decades  Maybe a combination of a resounding Marina victory  with yet another political scandal at the core of the PT  and the loss of the Lula  anchor  will result on a mass exodus from the party  This would mean a complete re thinking of Brazil s political dynamics Market implications  short term mild positive  but big potential long term positive  In the short term  markets will be also trading the Sensus Poll published over the weekend as a positive  pro Marina event  It showed a first round tie between Marina and Dilma  and Marina with a 47 6  support in the second round  compared with Dilma s 32 8   But the new Petrobras scandal variable will somewhat dampen the importance of these polls  Longer term  markets will take any developments that will weaken the PT as a positive for asset ,2014-09-08,Marc Chandler,https://www.investing.com/analysis/corruption-scandal-makes-the-brazilian-elections-even-more-exciting-225095,225095

both series expected to show a modest slowing  The economic outlook remains soft  which has been reflected in the continued drop in iron ore prices to multi year lows from 2009  August trade data showed imports  2 4  y y  much weaker than expected The Indonesian central bank meets Thursday and is expected to keep rates steady at 7 5   Inflation fell to 4  y y in August  the lowest since February 2013 and back in the 3 5 5 5  target range  we see steady policy  However  we see a hawkish bias being maintained ahead of expected cuts to fuel subsidies by the new incoming administration The Philippine central bank meets Thursday and is expected to hike rates 25 bp to 4 0   Inflation remains high at 4 9  y y in both July and August  and could pierce the 3 5  target range in the coming months  As such  further tightening seems likely  Indeed  the target range will fall to 2 4  in 2015 Chile s central bank meets Thursday and is expected to cut rates 25 bp to 3 25   If so  this would be the third straight month of easing after a three month pause despite elevated inflation  However  we think steady rates are possible after August CPI came in higher than expected at 4 5  y y  The real sector data was weak in Q2  but may have stabilized in Q3  Peru s central bank meets Thursday and the market is split  Of the 8 analysts polled by Bloomberg  4 expect steady rates at 3 75  and 4 expect a 25 bp cut to 3 5   With inflation back in the 1 3  target range in August  at 2 68  y y   we think there is greater potential for a cut rather than no cut  Either way  the easing cycle will likely continue in Q4  albeit at a measured pace The Korean central bank meets Friday and is expected to keep rates steady at 2 25   BOK has signaled that it views the August cut of 25 bp as a  one and done  move  We agree for now  If the weak yen and slowing regional growth continues  the headwinds may be too great for the BOK to ignore Russia s central bank meets Friday and is expected to keep rates steady at 8 0   Here too  the market is somewhat split  Of the 19 analysts polled by Bloomberg  13 expect steady rates at 8  and 6 expect a 50 bp hike to 8 5   The impact of sanctions  and potentially new sanctions  is still being felt and this continues to make the central bank s job difficult  It has hiked rates three times this year for a total of 250 bp  and a stabilizing situation in Ukraine could allow the bank to stand pat for now India reports August CPI and July IP Friday  CPI is seen at 7 8  y y after ticking higher in July to 7 96  y y  while IP seen up 2  y y vs  3 4  in June  For now  we see the RBI on hold as it waits to see the full effects of the monsoon season on the economy  Since June 1  the monsoon has been 13  below  normal   and will likely push up inflation and push down GDP growth Colombia s central bank minutes will be released Friday  At that August meeting  the bank hiked rates 25 bp to 4 5   and was the fifth straight month of tightening  With

During Rousseff s reign  Petrobras was forced to bear losses by selling gasoline   the end product derived from refining oil   to Brazilian customers at much lower government regulated prices after buying crude at higher market prices   
Moreover  owing to excessive intervention by Rousseff in the Brazilian economy  the country s inflation skyrocketed and productivity slumped  Consequently  the economy of Brazil grew at the slowest pace in last 20 years 
The business community seems to have lost confidence in Petrobras  NYSE PBR  after Rousseff was re elected and is skeptical regarding the company s future profitability  This is reflected in the plummeting ADR price of the largest integrated energy firm of Brazil 
On the contrary  Petrobras  ADRs surged significantly after the result of the first round of voting in the Brazilian presidential elections was out on Oct 5  Investors were then pleased with the significant support that Aecio Neves got as they were pinning their hopes on the opposition to help Brazil to come out of its present economic downturn  
Petrobras currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  implying that the company will perform in line with the broader U S  equity market in the next one to three months

surface  China appears profitable and prosperous  But we have very little idea of what s going on inside  the leverage is opaque but clearly off the charts  and the economics fail to make sense in all kinds of ominous ways  And then  on top of that  the financial reporting sucks  with massaged data that more or less reveals what the authorities want   We were reminded of this by the following nutty Reuters story    Eighty year old Chinese farmer Guo Shuhe receives a state pension equivalent to just  9 a month  not enough to buy a month worth of groceries  but enough it seems  to risk punching a gaping hole in government finances  Guo  whose palms are thick and rough from a life spent hoeing fields in southwest China  is one of over 150 million people covered by a rapidly expanding rural retirement scheme which is accelerating the nation s slide into a pension crisis  Policy makers and economists have long been worried about the financial burden of China s expanding patchwork of pension schemes  but those concerns have recently escalated as its rural pension scheme took off in the past three years  The funding shortage is daunting  economists say it could blow out to a whopping  10 8 trillion in the next 20 years from  2 6 trillion in 2010  towering over China s  3 trillion onshore savings  the biggest hoard of domestic savings in the world  Time is not on China s side  Its fast maturing society and economy   thanks to a one child policy and a rapid rise in living standards   demand better pension coverage in future  Yet China is already straining to hold things up  Supbrime lending schemes  suicidal shadow bankers  copper collateral ponzi pyramids  deadly demographics  and now a pension time bomb  the Dragon truly has it all  Black boxes are all too often nasty  When the lid comes open  bad things tend to come out  Those saying don t worry  chill out  China is strong  invest in China for the long run etcetera display the same mentality as the complacent hand wavers who were buying black box financials in size  and averaging down  in the 2007 2008 period prior to leverage implosion and catastrophe  All of those black box buyers got fried  some of them to career destroying result  ahem  Bill Miller  cough cough   As Market Wizard Larry Hite once put it   risk is a no fooling around game   In other far less surprising news  China s official manufacturing number   which hasn t happened in a couple of years  hopes of China avoiding a hard landing now seems pure fantasy Those hopes always were fantasy  of course  as we argued in making the case that China is   Even as global slowdown concerns continue to mount   China at the forefront   there is increasing evidence of capital rotation into base metals and oil and gas names  One clear example of this is Petrobras  PBR   the Brazilian oil and gas major  There are many energy and base metals charts with this rough pattern  Clean breakout circa early SeptemberMulti week consolidation and retest to breakout supportA  cleared for takeoff  setup on countertrend breakoutThe oil and gas   base metals strength is strange on its face because 1  crude oil looks terrible and 2  the global slowdown thesis appears to be strengthening  not weakening  So why would energy and metals be looking healthy  What gives  Here are three interlinked hypotheses  possible explanations   1  Western central bank activities are EM negative  but resource positive  To the degree that the major currencies  dollar  euro  yen  are on a path to being debased  emerging market economies will be hit with the double whammy of slowing exports  to Western countries  and rising inflation  via higher food and energy costs   possibly forcing a tightening of monetary policy  which further fuels dollar weakness   And yet  this same phenomenon that is EM negative is resource positive  If everything else starts looking worse  even as inflationary pressures rise with food and energy costs  resource names start looking better on a relative and absolute basis  Keep in mind that the United States is an agrarian superpower  and that grain  oil etc  are priced in dollars  Thus  as dollars get debased  via the will of Bernanke   co   the output of oil and gas producers becomes more valuable  in nominal inflationary terms  even if the economic outlook for EM economies deteriorates  2  Energy and metals producers as best house in a bad neighborhood  Institutional capital has a desperate need to be long  and so many areas of the market look overbought  overhyped or just plain lackluster  energy and metals are one of the few areas where relatively decent valuations can still be found  coupled with a longer term thesis that  debasement trumps all   as Western CBs try to print their way out of this mess  and EM demand   growth eventually comes back  3  Belief that Draghi and Bernanke will do what they say they are going to do  Not in terms of fixing U S  unemployment  necessarily  or saving Europe from the throes of recession   austerity induced depression  but rather in the sense of central banks pre emptively going  all in  to such a degree that deflation does not take hold  in paper assets anyway  In keeping with the above  we are slowly building out the trading book with long side energy and base metals names  one example is Century Aluminum Co   CENX

94287,315802,PBR,Portfolio Refresh  Investing In Something Old   And Something New,opinion,"Something Old   
A caveat  stocks selling at depressed prices in a relative momentum market like the one we are in now are depressed for a  reason   It may be a good reason or a dumb reason  based upon accurate analysis and perceptions or emotional reactions and feelings  It s our job to find the ones that are depressed for transient or incorrect reasons and buy those  while avoiding those which are depressed because of fundamental problems with their business or their market 
Now that we have protected our portfolios with a substantial income position  it s time to expand our universe to include more dividend paying stocks  Two old favorites  previously in our portfolios  are selling for less than we previously sold them for  Senior Housing Properties Trust  NYSE SNH  and National Oilwell Varco  NYSE NOV  
SNH owns nearly 400 properties in 40 states providing the critical health needs of tens of thousands of senior Americans via its independent living and assisted living communities  continuing care retirement communities  nursing homes  wellness centers and medical office  clinic and biotech laboratory buildings  The majority of its properties are triple net leased  meaning that each tenant pays rent and also is responsible for the payment of all operating costs  taxes  insurance and maintenance costs that arise from the ownership and use of property  The Company operates in two primary segments   short term and long term residential care communities is one  and medical office buildings is the other 
I m fine holding SNH through a market downturn because I ll simply add to it if it declines further 

This is a steady long term play based upon the graying of America  Already  one in seven Americans is over 65  In 15 years  one in five Americans will be over 65  Forget Twitter  Invest in totter instead 
That s not meant to be flippant  merely a shorthand way to state the case  The entire developed world is aging and we are going to need to face facts and prepare for the inevitable  Many of us will  at some point in our lives  need assisted living  All of us will be visiting the doctor more  In both cases  SNH owns and operates facilities to be there for us when needed  Most everyone wants to live in their own home until they die  but for many that simply won t be an option  The chart above is startling  I had no idea so many seniors not only have so much of their net worth tied up in their homes  but how many  as a result of take out refinancing and home credit lines in previous years   still have whopping mortgages to pay off  I doubt all of them will be able to or will choose to  In fact  according to the U S  Census  if you take their homes out of the equation  older Americans  actual net worth is vastly lowered   from a median net worth of  170 516 to just  27 516 
I see two things happening as a result of this   1  a lot of people will be selling and moving to adult communities  using that freed up cash to enjoy their lives  making the transition to assisted living much easier later in life  and  2  residential home builders are going to be competing with a lot more existing home inventory in the future 
At  24  SNH sells for a trailing P E of 29   20x projected   a price cash flow  P CF  of 14  a price book value  P B  of 1 8  has a market cap of  5 billion and an enterprise value of  6 8 billion  and yields 6 5   I think the world will be beating a path to their  and their competitors   doors 
NOV is another former portfolio holding that is even cheaper today  I don t believe it will be that way for long  NOV is  the  provider of equipment and components used in oil and gas drilling and production  oilfield services  and supply chain services to the oil and gas industry  The company conducts operations in more than 900 locations across all 6 continents   No  not in Antarctica   The company has a legendary tradition of pioneering innovations which improve the cost effectiveness  efficiency  safety and environmental impact of oil and gas operations 
In the oil business  the mantra is that if NOV doesn t carry it  it doesn t yet exist  That goes for land drilling operations as well as offshore exploration and production  This month they are scheduled to spin off one of their subsidiaries  the tools rental unit  Both may be worth holding  In anticipation of this change  the company increased its quarterly dividend to  0 46 per share  The dividend is payable June 27  2014 to stockholders of record on June 13  2014  The yield based on the new pay out is 2 3   NOV s market cap is  32 billion with an enterprise value of  34 5 billion  It sells at a trailing PE of 13  P CF of 10 5  and a P B of1 4 
   Something New
In line with my comments about SNH  let me introduce you to what I believe is one of their top competitors  Omega Healthcare Investors  NYSE OHI   This is not a depressed stock at all  in fact  it is trending near its high for the year  On the other hand  it is in an industry we really like for the long pull  it is well managed  and even at  37 it yields 5 1 4  
OHI operates as a real estate investment trust  investing in income producing healthcare facilities  mainly long term care facilities located in the USA  It provides lease or mortgage financing to qualified operators of skilled nursing facilities and  to a lesser extent  assisted living facilities  independent living facilities and rehabilitation and acute care facilities  It s a worthy competitor to SNH  its portfolio of investments consists of 478 healthcare facilities located in 34 states and operated by 46 third party operators  The bulk of the company s holdings is comprised of 418 skilled nursing facilities  though it also holds16 assisted living facilities  11 specialty facilities  and fixed rate mortgages on 31 long term healthcare facilities 
There s business enough in this growing industry to support not only SNH and OHI but a whole host of other competitors  Omega has a market cap of  4 7 billion and an enterprise value of  6 7 billion  it sports a P E of 23  a P B of 3 4  and a P CF of 16  and it pays the aforementioned   25  As with SNH  I expect to see these dividends regularly increase 
Finally  let me offer a name already well known to many of Stanford Wealth Management s clients  I read voraciously and one of the subjects that fascinates me is the never ending torrent of articles proclaiming The End of Oil or Peak Oil Reached or some other nonsense  I ve been hearing this for 40 years  yet technological breakthroughs in finding  drilling  producing and distributing fossil fuels keep us well supplied  secure in our heated  air conditioned  well lit homes and transported between there and wherever else we choose to go 
As I read  I find new names that intrigue me  One of the under explored areas of the world is offshore South America  Years ago  researching the explorers active in this area  we bought YPF  NYSE YPF   Later  not trusting in Brazilian governance or transparency  we passed on the Petroleo Brasileiro SA  Petrobras  NYSE PBR  Brou Haha and  I m glad we did 
But I enjoy visiting Colombia  which I did most recently this past November  and have always been intrigued by the Colombian national oil company  Ecopetrol  NYSE EC   Geologically similar to neighbor Venezuela  but politically light years away  it seems to me that Ecopetrol might be on the brink of making Venezuela size discoveries offshore  I m not alone in this thinking  One of the editors with whom I exchange ideas and newsletters is Vivian Lewis  doyenne of global investing and editor of Global Investing   
Vivian has also written about EC of late  I think the company is poised to become one of the great national oil companies  Unencumbered thus far by partisan politics or a government that sees its corporations as a giant piggy bank  as do  say  Russia  Venezuela  China  Nigeria  Saudi Arabia  and on and on and on     EC has the cash flow to diversify geographically  In fact  I imagine some citizens of Mexico  those who wanted to see Pemex  their national oil company  remain in its pure and decrepit state  would rather see anyone but the US assist Pemex in joining the 21st century  Ecopetrol may have an inside edge culturally  technologically and economically  I think Mexican improvements to their massive oil production infrastructure may benefit both NOV and EC 
That s not to say of course  that the company has no problems  As Pericles admonished   Just because you do not take an interest in politics doesn t mean politics won t take an interest in you   EC is caught in the middle of both native Indian resistance and the current negotiations between the government of Colombia and the FARC  a once Marxist populist movement that has since degenerated mostly into a large number of mercenary terrorists defined less by ideology than by a hunger for power via extortion 
As to the former  the U wa indigenous tribes object to the taking of oil because they believe their ancestors are part of the billion barrels of what they call the  sacred blood  of the earth and you and I call oil  Now  before anyone snickers  we were all raised with the shorthand layperson explanation that oil is the compressed decomposed bodies of dinosaurs  right  It is  indeed  the result of carbon based life forms   like plants  dinosaurs  and you and me   decomposing into a rather more inert form of carbon  So maybe the U wa are on to something  Or maybe they re just holding out for a bigger share of the spoils  At any rate  it s a big headache for Ecopetrol 
The bigger headache is the FARC  The places the U wa haven t been blowing up the EC pipelines  the FARC has been   and they have deeper pockets and bigger things that go boom   There have been more than 30 FARC attacks on Ecopetrol pipelines since the first of the year  Since oil is Colombia s biggest  cash crop   eclipsing both cocaine and cut flowers  the FARC can extort more concessions from the government the longer EC can t export its oil   So EC has to negotiate with the U wa  the FARC and the government just to get their oil to market  And we can t even get Keystone built 
With Ecopetrol we are buying Colombia s largest oil and gas company  accounting for more than 60  of total production  It is the fourth largest oil company in Latin America  EC is also involved in exploration and production activities in Brazil  Peru and the US Gulf Coast and owns the main refinery in Colombia  most of the network of oil and multiple purpose pipelines in the country  petrochemical plants  and an increasing presence in biofuels 
The market cap is  75 billion  enterprise value  77 billion  PE is 11 and the yield is over 6  ",2014-06-10,Joseph L. Shaefer,https://www.investing.com/analysis/portfolio-refresh:-investing-in-something-old...and-something-new-215556,215556
