209190,430706,MPC,Marathon backs CEO amid calls for his ouster,news," Reuters    Marathon Petroleum Corp  NYSE MPC  said on Friday the company s board supports Gary Heminger as the chief executive officer after a report that two shareholders were calling for his ouster 
 The board of directors is firmly and unanimously supportive of Gary Heminger as MPC s chairman and CEO  and his track record of delivering value to shareholders and all of the company s constituencies   the company said in a statement 
The shareholders  Paul Foster and Jeff Stevens  sent a letter to the company on Thursday evening calling for the CEO s removal  the Wall Street Journal reported early on Friday 
The shareholders also backed a proposal by hedge fund Elliott Management Corp to split Marathon into three units  the Journal reported citing a copy of the letter 
The shareholders  who are former board members of refiner Andeavor  which Marathon acquired last year  own about 1 7  of Marathon  the Journal said 
Elliott was not immediately available for a Reuters request for comment after regular U S  business hours  while Foster and Stevens could not be reached 
Elliott on Wednesday urged the energy company to split into three companies for retail  refining and midstream assets  saying it would boost shareholder value by as much as  40 billion 
Marathon had responded to the hedge fund s proposal stating it was focused on increasing shareholder value and would  thoroughly evaluate  Elliott s proposal

209192,430708,MPC,San Francisco Area Fuel Tank Fire Contained  Shelter Order Ends,news," Bloomberg     An explosion and fire at a San Francisco area fuel terminal spewed black smoke high in the air  snarling rush hour traffic and prompting local officials to ask residents to take shelter on Tuesday  before the emergency situation eased early on Wednesday 
The fire that affected two tanks at Nustar Energy LP s Selby Terminal in Crockett  about 25 miles  40 kilometers  northeast of San Francisco  has now been contained  the Contra Costa Country fire department said on Twitter  The tanks held  very low volumes of ethanol  comprising less than 1  of their capacity  NuStar said earlier in a statement  All operations have been suspended and product shipments into and out of the facility have halted  All personnel are safe and accounted for 
A shelter in place order has been lifted for all areas affected areas near the Nustar facility  the Contra Costa County health department said in a tweet  Since there is no longer any imminent danger to the public  a section of Interstate 80 near the terminal that had been closed in both directions has now re opened  the California Highway Patrol said in a tweet 
The blaze comes less than a day after an earthquake forced Marathon Petroleum Corp  NYSE MPC   to shut units at its nearby Martinez refinery  threatening to push up gasoline prices that had just eased from the highest level in seven years  Disruptions at California refineries sent retail pump prices in the state well above  4 a gallon 
Two tanks were burning as of late Tuesday afternoon and three other tanks  holding ethanol and jet fuel  were threatened and being doused with water  Steve Hill  a spokesman for the Contra Costa Fire Protection District  said in a televised press conference  He corrected an earlier statement saying three tanks were burning 
The two burned tanks contained a combined 250 000 gallons of ethanol  The blaze spread to 15 acres of nearby vegetation  a brush fire that was put out  Hill said  A shelter in place order was in force and between 12 and 20 nearby residents were evacuated 
The incident also comes a week after the state s utility PG E Corp  shut power to 738 000 homes and businesses to prevent wildfires similar to those that devastated the state last year  causing dozens of fatalities 
Phillips 66 s Rodeo refinery wasn t affected by the blaze  the company said in a tweet  Some early initial reports indicated the fire was at the refinery  located close to the NuStar terminal 
Nustar operates about 9 800 miles of pipeline and 74 terminal and storage facilities that store and distribute crude oil  refined products and specialty liquids  Its San Francisco area facility has a capacity of about 3 million barrels of gasoline  diesel  jet fuel and ethanol  according to the company s website

209205,430721,MPC,House Democrats ask Marathon Petroleum to detail White House talks on vehicle rules,news,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON  Reuters    Three key U S  House of Representatives Democrats on Wednesday asked Marathon Petroleum Corp  NYSE MPC  to disclose any communications between the White House and federal agencies on the Trump administration s proposal to freeze fuel efficiency standards at 2020 levels through 2026 
Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Frank Pallone and two subcommittee chairs asked Marathon in a letter for all documents it exchanged between the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  Environmental Protection Agency and White House  and to disclose if the oil company was involved in the controversial rule s development 
The proposal s preferred option  announced in August 2018 but not finalized  would boost U S  oil consumption by about 500 000 barrels a day by the 2030s 
Marathon did not immediately respond to a request for comment 
The letter  also signed by Representatives Paul Tonko and Jan Schakowsky  said the oil industry  stands to profit significantly from the proposed rollback   It also seeks details of Marathon s social media efforts related to the proposed regulation 
Pallone said Wednesday  the oil industry is the only winner  from the revised rules 
In April  EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler denied the rules were written at the behest of oil industry lobbyists   This has nothing to do with the oil industry  We re not doing this for the oil industry  I m not doing this for the oil industry   Wheeler told Reuters 
The Trump administration said in August that the freeze would save automakers more than  300 billion in regulatory costs and reduce the projected cost of a new vehicle by  1 850 
Deputy National Highway Traffic Safety Administration chief Heidi King said at a congressional hearing that the agencies are still reviewing more than 650 000 comments and that the agency plans to finalize the rule  soon  
The Democrats also seek records from the American Fuel   Petrochemical Manufacturers trade group and other groups ",2019-06-19,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/house-democrats-ask-marathon-petroleum-to-detail-white-house-talks-on-vehicle-rules-1902304,1902304

Marathon is also seeking changes in time off and sick leave 
Negotiators for the USW International union reached agreement on Jan  31 with Shell  LON RDSa  Oil Co  representing oil companies  on wages increases and benefits for 30 000 refinery  chemical plant  pipeline and terminal workers represented by the union  including the hourly employees at the Galveston Bay Refinery

209246,430762,MPC,In Response to Trump  Saudis Ramp Up Oil Exports Into the U S ,news," Bloomberg     Saudi Arabia has markedly increased oil exports to America  a sign OPEC s leading producer is responding to pressure from U S  President Donald Trump to cool down the energy market 
While the export boost started earlier this year  it accelerated over the past three months after Trump repeatedly    both through private diplomacy and public Twitter harangues    asked the Saudis to lift production to keep energy prices in check 
Saudi oil shipments into the U S  reached a four week average of one million barrels a day last week for the first time since late 2017  according to government data  and are up roughly 250 000 barrels a day since late May 
 The Middle East producers are becoming much more aggressive  wanting to bring their barrels back into this market   Gary Heminger  the chief executive of Marathon Petroleum Corp  NYSE MPC    the second largest U S  refiner by distillation capacity  said at an investor conference earlier this week 
The increase in Saudi exports into the U S  equates to almost half the overall output increase the kingdom has implemented since late May after the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies including Russia agreed in June to boost output 
Saudi oil shipments into the U S  plunged to a 30 year low in October last year  This prompted talk that America s freedom from Saudi oil    a rhetorical aspiration for generations of American politicians  from Jimmy Carter to George W  Bush    was within reach  even if it was largely the choice of supplier rather than customer 
In late October  the four week average of U S  imports of Saudi crude hit a low of 506 000 barrels a day  compared with last week s four week average surge to 1 009 000 barrels a day  according to government data 
OPEC Undertaking
Last year  the Saudi export drop was part of a wider undertaking by OPEC to fight a global glut that weighed on oil prices  Because the U S  is the most transparent oil market  with the government publishing weekly data about the size of crude stockpiles  the Saudis specifically targeted the American market trying to reduce the inventories 
Saudi Arabia has been able to entice U S  refiners to buy more crude in part by lowering the price it charges to customers in America  In June  Riyadh sold its flagship export grade    Arab Light    at just 60 cents a barrel above a basket of crude pumped in the U S  Gulf of Mexico  down from  1 30 a barrel in late 2017  The kingdom lowered even more the price of its lower quality crude    Arab Medium and Arab Heavy 
The surge in Saudi exports has returned Riyadh to the second position in the ranking of top U S  crude oil suppliers  which it briefly lost to Iraq and Mexico in late 2017 and early 2018  Historically  the American market has long been Saudi Arabia s most prized  both for economic and political reasons  Aramco  the kingdom s state owned company  controls the largest refinery in the U S   the Motiva plant in Port Arthur  Texas 
Traditional Diet
Motiva cut its imports of Saudi crude sharply last year  at one point even importing more Iraqi crude than Saudi  But in recent months the company  owned 100 percent by Aramco  has returned to a more traditional diet  According to data from the U S  Energy Information Administration  Motiva bought more than 70 percent of its crude from Saudi Arabia 
As Saudi Arabia has regained its market share in the U S   Iraq  the Middle East s number two exporter  lost out  The four week average of Iraqi shipments into the U S  has dropped to less than 400 000 barrels a day  down from 500 000 to 800 000 in late 2007 and early 2008  Kuwait has also lost market share 
In ramping up shipments into the U S   the Saudis also appear to be responding to American lawmakers threats to resurrect the so called  No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels Act   or NOPEC  which proposes making the cartel subject to the Sherman antitrust law  used more than a century ago to break up the oil empire of John Rockefeller ",2018-09-07,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/in-response-to-trump-saudis-ramp-up-oil-exports-into-the-us-1601743,1601743
209247,430763,MPC,Oil Rebounds After Rick Perry Rules Out Tapping Strategic Crude,news," Bloomberg     Crude erased most of the day s losses after U S  Energy Secretary Rick Perry said the nation s strategic oil reserves won t be tapped to expand global supplies 
Selling some of those reserves would have a  fairly minor and short term impact   Perry told reporters in Washington on Wednesday  As sanctions squeeze Iranian crude out of global markets  there are opportunities for other major crude producers to fill supply voids  he said 
 This is a situation where the market expected U S  President Trump to release oil from the reserves in November but that s not going to happen   said Phil Flynn  senior market analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago   The market all of a sudden looks a lot tighter  
Prior to Perry s remarks  futures closed down 1 percent in New York after crude stockpiles expanded for the first time since early August  according to the Energy Information Administration  Refiners are buying less crude as post summer maintenance work ramps up  The government s weekly assessment wasn t entirely bearish  however  Overseas demand for American oil jumped to a two month high 
Refining rates in the world s biggest economy underwent  a pretty big change   said Matt Sallee  who helps manage  16 billion at Tortoise in Leawood  Kansas  Still   we are seeing exports continue to increase  so that is more of a permanent trend  
Iran s Isolation
U S  efforts to isolate Iran  OPEC s No  3 producer  are beginning to tighten worldwide crude markets  South Korea s biggest refiner  SK Innovation Co   is increasing purchases of American crude after shunning Iranian cargoes  India also is cutting crude imports from the Islamic Republic to zero 
West Texas Intermediate crude for November delivery rose 50 cents to  72 01 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange in the first 10 minutes after Perry s comments 
Brent for November delivery rose 42 cents from the settlement to  81 76 after the energy secretary spoke 
The EIA reported American oil inventories rose last week by 1 85 million barrels  confounding most analysts in a Bloomberg survey who were expecting a decline  Meanwhile  U S  refinery utilization rates dropped to the lowest since May  At the key pipeline hub in Cushing  Oklahoma  crude inventories expanded for the first time in three weeks

209296,430812,MPC,U S  senator s biofuel overhaul faces resistance,news,"By Jarrett Renshaw SAN ANTONIO  Texas  Reuters    Texas Senator John Cornyn s plan to overhaul U S  biofuels policy faces resistance from the oil and ethanol sectors  reducing chances of a reboot to the controversial regulations  sources familiar with the matter said  The plan  which the sources said could be released as draft legislation in coming weeks  represents nearly two years of negotiations with the rival industries to end their ongoing clash over the future of the Renewable Fuel Standard  The decade old law requires refiners to cover the costs of mixing increasing volumes of biofuels  like corn based ethanol  into the nation s fuel supply by acquiring blending credits called RINs that can be purchased or earned  While the regulation has created a lucrative new market for corn growers and fuel blenders  the many refiners in Cornyn s home state of Texas complain the system has cost them hundreds of millions of dollars  as volumes mandates grow and credit prices trend higher  The centerpiece of the Cornyn plan includes the creation of a new type of ethanol RIN credit   called a D8 RIN   that the Republican lawmaker believes would lower the price of the existing ethanol blending credits  the sources said   A D8 RIN would be generated when a gallon of gasoline containing more than 10 percent ethanol is produced  The existing D6 RIN pool would then cover only gasoline with a percentage of ethanol below 10 percent   representing the vast majority of the fuel sold in the country  By separating the two types of fuel  Cornyn believes generic D6 RIN prices would tumble  saving refiners money  The higher blend D8 credits would cover a smaller portion of the market but theoretically sell at a premium  preserving the incentive for companies to invest in more ethanol blending infrastructure  the sources said   Refining company Marathon Petroleum Corp  NYSE MPC   has been an advocate of the idea  But segments of the refining industry are opposed to sweeping changes because they profit from the status quo  The downstream committee of the American Petroleum Institute  API  recently decided against voting on whether it supported the D8 RIN proposal  the sources said  because of opposition to the plan within the group  API spokeswoman Sabrina Fang declined to comment on the idea   It is not fair or appropriate to comment until there is a legislative package released that we can review and comment on   she said  But she added the group generally supported Cornyn s efforts to seek a legislative overhaul of the RFS   Members of the biofuel industry have their concerns about the D8 credit as well   Biofuel and agricultural voices do not support the D8 RIN   Brooke Coleman  head of the Advanced Biofuels Business Council  said  Cornyn s proposal would impact the market for niche biofuels by dragging down their prices and reducing the attractiveness of investing in the industry s development  Coleman said  A Cornyn spokesman  Drew Brandewie  said the senator  is working hard to unify all stakeholders   He said the legislation is still being drafted and the major industry trade groups have not seen it  He did not comment on the details of the plan   SUMMER WAIVER  OCTANE REQUIREMENT Cornyn s plan would also lift a ban on sales of higher ethanol blends during the hot  summer months   something now restricted due to anti smog rules   The sources said the proposal was included as a concession to the ethanol industry   which has long opposed the ban   to support the broader RFS overhaul  But plan faces resistance from the corn industry for another reason  It would let the renewable fuel program expire in 2022  the sources said  effectively replacing its biofuels volume quotas with a mandate for higher octane content in gasoline instead  Higher octane can increase fuel efficiency  It and can be achieved by blending ethanol or other additives into fuel  Bob Dinneen  head of the Renewable Fuel Association  said that idea endangered the ethanol industry s future  
 Any effort to reform or repeal the RFS that is founded on the premise of demand destruction is a non starter   he said on the sidelines of an industry event this week in San Antonio ",2018-02-16,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/us-senators-biofuel-overhaul-faces-resistance-1261164,1261164
209297,430813,MPC,Cushing s oil market clout wanes amid U S  export boom,news,"By Devika Krishna Kumar NEW YORK  Reuters    The volume of oil sitting in 300 steel tanks in a nine square mile radius in Cushing  Oklahoma has long been a key barometer for the health of U S  crude supply and the nation s benchmark for daily trading of billions of dollars in the commodity   But those tanks could soon drain to levels near effectively empty  even as U S  oil production soars past a new record of 10 4 million barrels per day  Oil supplies have fallen before in Cushing for a variety of seasonal or market driven reasons  But this time  there is no shortage of crude in the market  In fact  U S  production is straining pipeline and storage capacity  The declining volumes stored at Cushing reflects a more permanent shift  underscoring the hub s waning influence as the primary measuring stick for the U S  oil market and the leading barometer of future supply  demand and prices   For a graphic of falling oil inventories at Cushing  see     Companies are now spending millions of dollars building infrastructure to facilitate trading and storage elsewhere  such as in Houston and other Gulf Coast ports  That could pave the way for a change in the U S  benchmark oil price  used to value tens of billions of dollars of crude and futures contracts every day  The current benchmark   called West Texas Intermediate crude  or  WTI    has been derived from the price of physical oil delivered to Cushing for more than three decades  Traders and major global crude buyers have advocated replacing WTI with a new benchmark futures contract that would reflect the value of crude delivered to the Gulf Coast  The price of oil in Cushing   which bills itself as  the pipeline crossroads of the world    is used to value crude grades produced around the United States and some oil imported from Canada  Mexico  and South America  Prices at the hub also provide the basis for an average of 1 3 million WTI futures contracts    worth about  82 billion at current prices   that change hands on the CME Group s New York Mercantile Exchange every day  making it one of the world s most actively traded commodities  But as more pipelines are built to take oil from U S  shale fields to Gulf refineries or for export markets  much of the crude produced in the giant Permian Basin oilfield in Texas and elsewhere no longer passes through Cushing  Instead  producers are increasingly shipping directly to seaports such as Houston  where vessels carry the oil to dozens of countries worldwide  That reflects a major transformation in global crude flows since the United States lifted a four decade ban on oil exports in late 2015  Some traders and buyers argue the benchmark needs to change to reflect this  Joshua Wade  a crude oil marketer in Oklahoma  sees the benchmark delivery point moving south before long   That s the direction it s moving   he said   As opposed to importing  now you re exporting through the same infrastructure     The oil capital of the nation is in Houston    Inventories in Cushing fell to 28 2 million barrels in early March  lowest in more than three years   Analysts say a level of 20 million barrels is effectively empty  That s because tank design necessitates a minimum volume of crude be kept on hand to maintain the physical integrity of the complex and to allow for blending different crude grades to comply with pipeline specifications    There has been a major structural shift in crude flows within the U S    said John Coleman  senior research analyst at consultancy Wood Mackenzie   I think Cushing is rapidly losing its relevance   A CENTURY OLD WAY STATION Cushing got its distinction in the early 1920s when tanks sprung up to store oil en route from Oklahoma and Texas to major metropolitan areas and refineries in the Midwest   In 1983  it became the delivery point for the newly launched WTI futures contract  CLc1   Because the U S  relied on imports   and banned exports   Cushing was key for traders to gauge domestic supply trends  BP s former head of crude trading  Donald Porteous  earned the nickname  the King of Cushing  because of his deep understanding of supply logistics in the Oklahoma town   a strategy that often earned him more money than  BP   LON BP  Chief Executive Bob Dudley  Porteous  now retired  declined to comment for this story  Now  new pipeline projects head straight from west Texas to the Gulf of Mexico  a route well south of Cushing  Lately  Permian Basin prices have declined because pipelines can t be built fast enough to get crude to the Gulf  even as pipeline firms have added about 600 000 bpd in capacity since late last year  according to data compiled by Reuters    We re trying to make sure we re ahead of the pinch points for producers to bring product to refiners or to export   Greg Armstrong  chief executive of Plains All American  said at a recent industry conference   Projects in the works could boost outgoing pipeline capacity from the Permian from 2 7 million bpd in March to more than 4 5 million bpd by the end of 2019  according to energy industry information provider Genscape  Meanwhile  the Dakota Access pipeline started shipping oil last year  running out of North Dakota s Bakken shale region to the Gulf   bypassing Cushing  And Marathon Petroleum  NYSE MPC  is considering reversing its Capline crude line to bring barrels from Illinois to the Gulf  A BENCHMARK SHIFT  For now  traders watch the price differential between WTI and London based Brent crude to determine where to ferry shipments globally   But traders say the price of physical trades in Houston is growing more important as a barometer for shippers  Earlier this year  even as the WTI crude discount to Brent  narrowed  Houston s discount to Brent remained steady at about  1 60 a barrel  analysts said  helping buoy export demand  As pipeline capacity to the Gulf has increased  and storage has expanded  demand to park barrels in Cushing has waned  said Carlin Conner  chief executive at SemGroup Corp  N SEMG   which operates about 7 6 million barrels of crude oil storage in Cushing  A spokesman for Magellan Midstream Partners  which owns about 12 million barrels of Cushing storage  said it will remain important because of its connections to the Gulf and Midwest   Cushing is also connected via pipeline to the Gulf  500 miles to the south  and can offer cheaper storage than what s available on the coast  said SemGroup s Conner  
 I believe Cushing s next chapter   he said   is that it s going to become an offsite Gulf Coast storage center  ",2018-04-11,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/cushings-oil-market-clout-wanes-amid-us-export-boom-1388612,1388612
209311,430827,MPC,U S  Midwest oil refiners boost output  cut region s dependence on Gulf Coast,news,"By Jarrett Renshaw NEW YORK  Reuters    U S  refineries from Ohio to Minnesota are capitalizing on access to cheap crude from Western Canada and North Dakota oilfields  helping their region break a historic dependence on fuel from the Gulf Coast while redrawing oil trade maps  Since the early 2000s  crude and fuel flows from the Gulf Coast into the U S  heartland have been cut in half  as crude coming from Canada and North Dakota has pushed U S  Midwest refining activity to record levels  In 2016  Midwest refining capacity rose to 3 9 million barrels per day  bpd  of crude  the highest annual volume on record   Midwest refiners such as Marathon Petroleum Corp  NYSE MPC   Phillips 66  NYSE PSX    BP   LON BP  PLC and Husky Energy have invested billions of dollars on new units capable of turning sludgy crude from Canada into gasoline and diesel  Investments in the Dakota Access Pipeline and other avenues have helped bring in shale oil from North Dakota   Ten years ago  we were 1 million barrels per day short on products  with the Gulf Coast supplying the product  Today  the midcontinent is flush with products   Marathon Petroleum Chief Executive Gary Heminger said in a recent Reuters interview at the company s Findlay  Ohio  headquarters  Yet analysts warned that weakening U S  gasoline demand will make it challenging for Midwest refiners to sell their growing output  The Midwest is land locked  making it hard to get products to new markets  especially as rival refiners defend their turf  Philadelphia area refiners are currently fighting efforts to reverse a pipeline so Midwest companies can move fuel to western Pennsylvania   Graphic  Midwest Breaks Free of Gulf  Looks North Instead    CHANGING FLOWS  For years  Gulf refiners with access to cheaper crudes could underprice their Midwest rivals in Chicago  Indianapolis and other cities in the region  Traders made easy money sending gasoline north in the summer  Now  Midwest plants can compete more effectively thanks to booming production in western Canada and North Dakota of crude that routinely sells at a discount against the U S  benchmark price    The Midwest is well positioned to supply its region and parts of southern Canada  and will even have excess supplies to send to the East Coast  It s in a good spot   said Mark Routt  chief economist at KBC Advanced Technologies   At the turn of the century  the Midwest received 3 4 million bpd of crude and refined products from the Gulf  In 2016  that figure was halved  Chicago gasoline peaked at a premium of 14 cents a gallon versus the future contract this summer  much less than the summer premiums of nearly 40 cents in 2014 and 2015    The trade was as slow as I ve ever seen it   said one scheduler who sends barrels along the line   Hurricane Harvey knocked out half of the Gulf s capacity  while Midwest refiners processed a record 4 06 million barrels per day  bpd  of crude oil in late August and early September  12 percent more than the 2016 average   The Rockies  which includes Bakken oil fields  sent 550 000 bpd to the Midwest last year  That is triple the volumes seen in 2010 before Dakota Access opened  Phillips 66 and Marathon Petroleum are minority partners in the line  which opened in 2017 and can pump as much as 525 000 bpd  Canada has sent an average of 2 1 million bpd of crude through June of this year  more than triple the rate from two decades ago  according to EIA data  SPENDING ON UPGRADES Midwest refiners invested billions of dollars to handle the heavier Canadian crude  For instance  Marathon and BP spent over  6 billion to install new coking units to handle the heaviest parts of the Canadian oil  Marathon s 144 000 bpd Detroit refinery nearly tripled its usage of Canadian crude last year  hitting a record high of 137 400 bpd  EIA data showed  BP s 430 000 bpd Whiting  Indiana  refinery can now process up to 85 percent heavy crude  up from 20 percent before the upgrades  But analysts predict that ebbing U S  gasoline demand will eventually force Midwestern refiners to find other markets  including exports  To facilitate this  some pipelines that used to carry product to the Midwest have already been reversed  But Philadelphia area refiners are pressuring state regulators to reject reversal of a pipeline that would bring Midwest fuel to the Pittsburgh area  The owners of the 1 2 million bpd Capline Pipeline  the nation s largest crude pipeline by volume  will soon gauge shipper interest in reversing that line  which currently runs from Louisiana to Illinois  The line is owned by Marathon  BP and Plains All American  and the group said reversal would not come until 2022  Shippers abandoned the line in recent years due to the waning financial incentive to move barrels north  But BP  which has an ownership interest in the pipeline  has slowed the reversal over concerns that it could erode the discount on Canadian oil enjoyed by its Whiting refinery  BP did not respond to questions about that pipeline  Analysts expect regional market share battles to intensify  The Midwest will go from being short roughly 500 000 bpd of gasoline this year to a surplus of roughly 200 000 bpd by 2030  according to Wood Mackenzie refinery analyst Andrew Shepard   A gasoline supply glut would pressure prices and weaken profit margins for refiners  Shepard said  Eventually  Midwest refiners will have to close plants if they cannot access new markets

abundant and cheap domestic crude supplies  giving them the raw material they need to produce internationally competitive fuel  The nation set a record in 2016 by sending a net 2 5 million barrels per day  bpd  of petroleum products to foreign markets  That compares to net fuel imports of 2 3 million just a decade ago  according to U S  government data  Booming exports have bolstered margins at the biggest U S  refiners   including Marathon Petroleum  NYSE MPC  and Valero   and compensated for lack of strong growth this year in U S  fuel demand  Now  the government of U S  President Donald Trump is seeking to deregulate oil and gas production to further leverage rising U S  exports for international political gain   a policy Trump calls  energy dominance   Surging U S  crude production has already complicated the ongoing effort by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries  OPEC  to tame a global glut that has halved oil prices since 2014  The United States remains a massive importer of crude oil   regularly trading the top spot with China   but American refineries now re export much of that oil as jet fuel  diesel and gasoline  The U S  has a growing role in satisfying demand for motor fuel in countries such as Mexico and Brazil  where the thirst for U S  fuel is likely to accelerate amid refinery outages and high production costs  Refined U S  exports are also going further afield to Asia  and diesel exports to Europe increased in June to levels not seen in nearly two years  traders have said   See graphic    Traditionally  oil traders  refiners and investors have considered U S  fuel demand as one of the leading metrics for predicting international crude oil supply and price trends  Now  they are increasingly looking to foreign demand for U S  fuel for guidance   Globally  you re going to have increased demand for all of our products  and so our focus will go beyond the U S  borders   said Texas based Valero s Chief Executive  Joe Gorder  In contrast  he predicted a  slight decline  in U S  gasoline demand over the next decade  U S  gasoline demand hit a record in 2016  as low pump prices encouraged consumption  but has leveled off this year  Rising fuel efficiency in cars is expected to limit future domestic demand growth  LATIN AMERICAN BUYERS U S  refined products are filling shortages in countries such as Mexico and Venezuela  where refineries have been running below capacity  U S  exports have also made inroads into Brazil s market by undercutting the price of locally produced fuel  Latin America s imports of U S  fuels reached almost 2 5 million bpd in the first quarter compared with 2 32 million bpd in 2016  The growth was fueled by Mexico  Brazil  Peru  Venezuela and Central America  according to the U S  Energy Information Administration  EIA   Mexico   already the biggest export market for U S  gasoline and diesel   is seeking higher than usual volumes in July and August to fill a void left by a fire at its biggest refinery last month  In recession scarred Venezuela  the country s largest refining complex has lowered operating rates this month to less than half of its 955 000 barrel per day capacity  a level that has required state run oil company PDVSA to import more fuel to meet domestic demand  Between them  Mexico and Venezuela have recently said they want to buy extra volumes of almost 19 million barrels in the second half of the year   mostly from the United States   an amount suggesting that U S  exports will grow again this year over last year s record levels  Net U S  exports of transport fuels could rise 8 8 percent this year  according to PIRA Energy  an analytics and forecasting unit of S P Global Platts  In Brazil  fuel distributors have begun buying more U S  imports because they are cheaper than fuel sold by state run oil firm Petrobras  Petrobras had failed to align its wholesale prices with international markets  opening a window for importers to bring fuel into Brazil  Petrobras last month said it would peg its fuels more closely to international prices as it tried to slow the expansion of U S  imports  Analysts said supply from U S  refiners was unlikely to slow much  BEYOND THE AMERICAS U S  refiners have also boosted exports to Europe and Asia  In Europe  U S  shipments of diesel rose to nearly 500 000 bpd in June  according to traders  well above flows that have rarely exceeded 370 000 bpd since July 2015  U S  global distillate exports  including diesel  hit a record that month  said researcher ClipperData  which tracks global oil flows  Exports of refined products to several Asian countries  including India  Japan and South Korea  rose to record levels in 2016  and China took a record 303 000 bpd of U S  produced fuels in February  U S  refiners are likely to play in important role in meeting rising demand from Asia  said Nicole Leonard  senior project consultant at Platts Analytics Oil   Gas Consulting  Analysts and traders expect U S  refined products exports to continue to grow  even with increased competition from large exporters in the Middle East  Europe and India  Demand for U S  fuels is underpinned by refinery challenges in neighboring countries  said Sandy Fielden  director of oil and products research for Morningstar Commodities Research in Austin  Texas   It doesn t seem that these Latin American countries are going to cure their refining problems overnight   he said

209362,430878,MPC,Activist fund year end returns boosted by Trump rally,news,"By Michael Flaherty
NEW YORK  Reuters    Activist hedge funds recovered from a slow start last year  ending 2016 with sharp gains  spurred by a stock rally that followed the U S  presidential election 
Hedge fund managers who exclusively or partially manage an activist portfolio of stocks cited the election of President Donald Trump as a year end boost and a likely tailwind for 2017  though several expressed concern that the policy direction coming from the White House remains uncertain 
 Like it or not  Donald Trump s presidency changes everything   activist Raging Capital said in its fourth quarter letter  The fund  which manages around  900 million  was up 27 percent last year 
Unlike most of the hedge fund industry  activist managers directly engage with chief executives and corporate boards to push changes  sometimes publicly calling out the companies and pursuing proxy fights 
The HFRI Event Driven activist index showed a 10 4 percent gain for the year  compared with a 1 15 percent bump in 2015  In 2016  the S P 500 index ended the year up 9 5 percent 
New activist targets in 2016 included restaurant chain Buffalo Wild Wings  refiner Marathon Petroleum  NYSE MPC  and industrial retailer HD Supply 
J P  Morgan s David Hunker  head of shareholder activism defense  said activists showed more discipline toward the end of the year in targeting companies where a broader set of investors were unhappy 
 There s a lot more going on among activists to really understand what shareholder frustrations are and where they can drive a wedge between management teams  the board and their investors   Hunker said 
Raging Capital s founder and chief investment officer  William Martin  said Trump s election and the anticipation of low tax  pro business policies have handed the economic baton over to Congress from the U S  Federal Reserve  which had kept interest rates at near zero levels for nearly a decade 
 Many of the Republican proposals have potentially far  reaching impacts on certain industries  though sufficient detail does not exist to properly quantify these impacts or their timing   according to hedge fund PSAM  which manages around  2 billion and was up 14 percent last year 
The hedge fund  which occasionally takes activist positions  said Trump s expected deregulation push could further accelerate merger deals in 2017  with media companies expected to lead the pack 
Dan Loeb  a veteran activist and founder of multi strategy hedge fund Third Point  also said that the U S  monetary policy pendulum was swinging away from low rates  while fiscal policy was moving away from austerity

209432,430948,MPC,U S  refiners turn to tanker trucks to avoid  dumbbell  crudes,news,"By Kristen Hays HOUSTON  Reuters    In a pressing quest to secure the best possible crude  U S  refiners are increasingly going straight to the source      Firms such as Marathon Petroleum Corp  NYSE MPC  and Delek U S  Holdings are buying up tanker trucks and extending local pipeline networks in order to get more oil directly from the wellhead  seeking to cut back on blended crude cocktails they say can leave a foul aftertaste  While the business of hauling crude from individual oil wells to bulk storage depots or pipeline hubs has become a lucrative niche in recent years thanks to the shale oil revolution  refiners are getting into the  first mile  game for a different reason  taking control of their supply chains to secure a more predictable  consistent stream of crude      Phillips 66  NYSE PSX   the nation s fourth largest refiner  has added trucks and offloading equipment at several of its refineries to help reduce its reliance on oil coming from Cushing  Oklahoma  the nation s biggest crude oil crossroads and storage hub  Here  a growing volume of Canadian oil sands is often mixed with lighter domestic shale crude  resulting in blends that can be less profitable than similar oil fresh from the field  Phillips 66 executives say operations at its 200 000 barrel per day refinery in Ponca City  Oklahoma  only 62 miles  100 km  from Cushing  have improved since it began getting more of its crude directly from wells in the Mississippian Lime shale patch nearby   That s really the key   Phillips 66 President Tim Taylor told Reuters   With Cushing  you can get a blended barrel that hits the spec  but it s not as consistent as you d like       Others are also seeking to cut out the middleman where possible  delving into an industry once dominated by independent local players and stepping up pressure on bigger midstream transport and logistics firms to meet their needs  In December  Delek Logistics Partners LP paid  11 5 million to buy 120 trucks and 200 trailers used to haul crude and asphalt  mostly for its parent firm s East Texas and Arkansas refineries  CVR Refining LP  with two refineries within 120 miles  190 km  of Cushing  in Oklahoma and Kansas  has increased the amount of crude it gathers directly  by pipeline or truck  by more than a fifth in the past two years  In January it gathered 63 500 bpd  or more than a third of its total crude slate  IT S THE BLENDS  DUMBBELL Shipping crude by truck  though costly  has become a fast growing necessity in places like the Eagle Ford in Texas and Permian Basin  newly productive shale oil patches ill served by small local pipeline networks known as gathering systems  As a result  truck deliveries direct to U S refiners have surged to nearly 400 000 bpd nationwide in 2013  doubling since 2010  government data show  Midstream companies including Blueknight Energy Partners and some private equity firms  including Riverstone Holdings  have also invested  For refiners  the investment is less about profitable logistics than quality control  Many executives say that the crude oil blends being created in Cushing are often substandard approximations of West Texas Intermediate  WTI   the longstanding U S  benchmark familiar to  and favored by  many refiners in the region  Typical light sweet WTI crude has an API gravity of about 38 to 40  Condensate  or super light crude that is abundant in most U S  shale patches  ranges from 45 to 60 or higher  Western Canadian Select  itself a blend  is about 20      While the blends of these crudes may technically meet the API gravity ceiling of 42 at Cushing  industry players say the mixes can be inconsistent in makeup and generate less income because the most desirable stuff is often missing  The blends tend to produce a higher proportion of fuel at two ends of the spectrum  light ends like gasoline  demand for which has dimmed in recent years  and lower value heavy products like fuel oil and asphalt  What s missing are middle distillates like diesel  where growing demand and profitability lies   You end up with a dumbbell like material rich in front and back ends  neither of which refineries find most profitable   said Dennis Sutton  a former chemist and retired crude quality expert with Marathon Petroleum Corp who now heads the Crude Oil Quality Association  The trend extends beyond Cushing  With three refineries relatively close to the Utica shale in Ohio  Marathon Petroleum has added truck and barge offloading to handle crude and super light condensate as well as fuels  increasing its tanker truck fleet 16 percent from a year ago to 170  according to company presentations  The trucks can be used for crude or fuel       Every place we can  we re procuring our own crude   Chief Executive Gary Heminger said in an interview      Western Refining Inc will use trucks run by its logistics unit to haul more than 50 000 bpd to its plants in New Mexico and West Texas this year  up 39 percent from 2014  according to its annual regulatory filing  PIPES IN THE MIDDLE     Oil pipeline operators  who risk losing customers as more refiners source their own supply  are also responding      At least five new pipelines   including Tallgrass Energy Partners  Colorado to Cushing Pony Express line  which started up in November   will ship crudes in separate batches  rather than throwing them together in a single stream  as has been common for major crude pipelines to Cushing or Houston      Traditional  common stream  lines  where super light crudes mingle with WTI like oil  also are adapting      Magellan Midstream Partners  Longhorn pipeline  which moves West Texas Permian Basin crude to Houston  raised its gravity cap last year to 44 from 42  And it recently started up its joint venture BridgeTex pipeline with a cap of 44  Common stream lines could theoretically keep raising those caps as more lights enter the flow  but refiners would demand price breaks  said Brian Melton of Blueknight  which is part owned by global oil trading group Vitol

The S P 500  SPX  is up 13 3 percent from an intraday low hit on Oct  15  and the gains since then have been broad  Since that bottom  all but 23 S P 500 components are higher 
The magnitude of the rally has some concerned  Several notable fund managers at this week s Reuters Investment Outlook Summit said they don t expect stocks to do much in 2015 
Citigroup on Thursday wrote that the market was  on the edge of euphoria     causing us to be more cautious   while Goldman Sachs on Wednesday released its 2015 year end target of 2 100   just 1 8 percent above current levels 
The recent stretch of solid earnings and economic figures  however  leaves managers puzzled over what could hurt the market going forward 
 It s tough for me to wrap my head around the next big move being lower   said David Lebovitz  global market strategist at J P  Morgan Funds in New York   Some people aren t comfortable with current levels  but fundamentals remain strong  
The market s recent gains prompted a notable commentary from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco on Nov  13 that pointed out certain valuation metrics look stretched  It also noted that the ratio of NYSE margin debt to GDP in September stood at an elevated level that  in the past  was  followed by major downturns in stock prices  
Jim McDonald  chief investment strategist at Chicago based Northern Trust Asset Management  wasn t buying it  He said the level of margin debt is  more or less consistent with the trend line over the past 20 plus years   though a pullback was possible 
 The primary issue facing the market is that we ve gotten a year s return out of the S P in the past month   he said   Investors are more than willing to take risk off the table after such a big run  
Volatility may pick up next week as many take off for Thanksgiving  Markets are closed on Thursday and will close early on Friday 
However  December has historically been the best month of the year for the S P  according to the Stock Trader s Almanac  averaging a rise of 1 7 percent 
Energy names have jumped sharply since the October low  which could make them liable to profit taking  especially going into the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries  Nov  27 meeting  when members will consider whether to cut output to shore up prices

210895,432411,MPC,3 Top Dividend Stocks To Maximize Your Retirement Income   February 06  2020,opinion,"Believe it or not  seniors fear running out of cash more than they fear dying 
Also  retirees who have constructed a nest egg have valid justifications to be concerned  since the traditional ways to plan for retirement may mean income can no longer cover expenses  Some retirees are now tapping their principal to make a decent living  pressed for time between decreasing investment balances and longer life expectancies 
Your parents  retirement investing plan won t cut it today 
For example  10 year Treasury bonds in the late 1990s offered a yield of around 6 50   which translated to an income source you could count on  However  today s yield is much lower   currently under 2  and probably not a viable return option to fund typical retirements 
That means if you had  1 million in 10 year Treasuries  the difference in yield between 1999 and today is more than  1 million 
Today s retirees are getting hit hard by reduced bond yields   and the Social Security picture isn t too rosy either  Right now and for the near future  Social Security benefits are still being paid  but it has been estimated that the Social Security funds will be depleted as soon as 2035 
So what can retirees do  You could dramatically reduce your expenses  and go out on a limb hoping your Social Security benefits don t diminish  On the other hand  you could opt for an alternative investment that gives a steady  higher rate income stream to supplant lessening bond yields 
Invest in Dividend Stocks
As we see it  dividend paying stocks from generally low risk  top notch companies are a brilliant way to create steady and solid income streams to supplant current low risk  low yielding Treasury and fixed income alternatives 
For example  AT T  NYSE T  and Coca Cola  NYSE KO  are income stocks with attractive dividend yields of 3  or better  Look for stocks like this that have paid steady  increasing dividends for years  or decades   and have not cut their dividends even during recessions 
One approach to recognizing appropriate stocks is to look for companies with an average dividend yield of 3  and positive average annual dividend growth  Numerous stocks hike dividends over time  counterbalancing inflation risks 
Here are three dividend paying stocks retirees should consider for their nest egg portfolio 
Brinker International  EAT  is currently shelling out a dividend of  0 38 per share  with a dividend yield of 3 63   This compares to the Retail   Restaurants industry s yield of 0  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 75   In terms of dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  1 52 is flat compared to last year 
LCNB  LCNB  is paying out a dividend of 0 18 per share at the moment  with a dividend yield of 4 13  compared to the Banks   Northeast industry s yield of 1 83  and the S P 500 s yield  Taking a look at the company s dividend growth  its current annualized dividend of  0 72 is up 5 88  from last year 
Currently paying a dividend of 0 53 per share  Marathon Petroleum  MPC  has a dividend yield of 3 82   This is compared to the Oil and Gas   Refining and Marketing industry s yield of 2 85  and the S P 500 s current yield  Looking at dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  2 12 is up 15 22  from last year 
But aren t stocks generally more risky than bonds 
The fact is that stocks  as an asset class  carry more risk than bonds  To counterbalance this  invest in superior quality dividend stocks that not only can grow over time but more significantly  can also decrease your overall portfolio volatility with respect to the broader stock market 
An advantage of owning dividend stocks for your retirement nest egg is that numerous companies  particularly blue chip stocks  raise their dividends over time  helping alleviate the impact of inflation on your potential retirement income 
Thinking about dividend focused mutual funds or ETFs  Watch out for fees 
If you re thinking   I want to invest in a dividend focused ETF or mutual fund   make sure to do your homework  It s important to know that some mutual funds and specialized ETFs charge high fees  which may diminish your dividend gains or income and thwart the overall objective of this investment strategy  If you do want to invest in fund  research well to identify the best quality dividend funds with the least charges 
Bottom Line
Regardless of whether you select high quality  low fee funds or stocks  looking for a steady stream of income from dividend paying equities can potentially lead you to a solid and more peaceful retirement

210912,432428,MPC,Earnings Preview  Marathon Petroleum  MPC  Q4 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Marathon Petroleum  MPC  reports results for the quarter ended December 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 29  2020  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This refiner is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 85 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  64 7  
Revenues are expected to be  29 69 billion  down 8 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 14 59  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Marathon Petroleum 
For Marathon Petroleum  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Marathon Petroleum will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Marathon Petroleum would post earnings of  1 30 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 63  delivering a surprise of  25 38  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Marathon Petroleum doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2020-01-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-marathon-petroleum-mpc-q4-earnings-expected-to-decline-200500692,200500692

210928,432444,MPC,MPC Vs  INT  Which Stock Should Value Investors Buy Now ,opinion,"Investors with an interest in Oil and Gas   Refining and Marketing stocks have likely encountered both Marathon Petroleum  MPC  and World Fuel Services  INT   But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now  Let s take a closer look 
Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities  but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank  The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits 
Marathon Petroleum has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while World Fuel Services has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold  right now  The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates  so investors should rest assured that MPC has an improving earnings outlook  But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors 
Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics  including the popular P E ratio  as well as the P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years 
MPC currently has a forward P E ratio of 13 93  while INT has a forward P E of 17 62  We also note that MPC has a PEG ratio of 1 15  This popular figure is similar to the widely used P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also considers a company s expected EPS growth rate  INT currently has a PEG ratio of 3 52 
Another notable valuation metric for MPC is its P B ratio of 0 94  The P B ratio is used to compare a stock s market value with its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  INT has a P B of 1 54 
Based on these metrics and many more  MPC holds a Value grade of A  while INT has a Value grade of C

looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Marathon Petroleum Corporation   NYSE MPC   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE Ratio A key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Marathon Petroleum has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 10 53  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 18 01  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Marathon Petroleum s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  Further  the stock s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Oil   Energy sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 12 97  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers   We should also point out that Marathon Petroleum has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 15 50  which is tad higher than the current level  So it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near term P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings  Right now  Marathon Petroleum has a P S ratio of about 0 34  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 18 right now   Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years   If anything  MPC is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms  Broad Value Outlook In aggregate  Marathon Petroleum currently has a Zacks Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Marathon Petroleum a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too    For example  the PEG ratio for Marathon Petroleum is just 1 55  a level that is lower than the industry average of 2 23  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Clearly  MPC is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles    What About the Stock Overall    Though Marathon Petroleum might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of A and a Momentum Score of F  This gives MPC a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores    Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been disappointing  The current quarter has seen six estimates go lower in the past sixty days compared no movement in the opposite direction while the current year estimate has seen eight downward revision compared to one upward in the same time period      This has had a negative impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has decreased by 9 4  in the past two months  while the current year estimate has declined by 10 6   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Marathon Petroleum Corporation Price and Consensus    Despite the bearish analyst sentiments  the stock holds a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Thus  we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom Line  Marathon Petroleum is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible line up of statistics on this front However  with a sluggish industry rank  among bottom 25  of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the Zacks Oil and Gas   Refining and Marketing industry has clearly underperformed the market at large  as you can see below  So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick 5 Stocks Set to DoubleEach was hand picked by a Zacks expert as the  1 favorite stock to gain  100  or more in 2020  Each comes from a different sector and has unique qualities and catalysts that could fuel exceptional growth Most of the stocks in this report are flying under Wall Street radar  which provides a great opportunity to get in on the ground floor ,2019-10-09,Zacks

210987,432503,MPC,Analysts Estimate Marathon Petroleum  MPC  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"The market expects Marathon Petroleum  MPC  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on October 31  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This refiner is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 30 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  23 5  
Revenues are expected to be  31 49 billion  up 36 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 45  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Marathon Petroleum 
For Marathon Petroleum  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Marathon Petroleum will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Marathon Petroleum would post earnings of  1 33 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 73  delivering a surprise of  30 08  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Marathon Petroleum doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-10-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analysts-estimate-marathon-petroleum-mpc-to-report-a-decline-in-earnings-what-to-look-out-for-200477665,200477665

211045,432561,MPC,Tighter Gasoline Supplies To Aid Oil   Gas Refining   Marketing Industry,opinion,The Zacks  industry consists of companies that are involved in selling refined petroleum products  including heating oil  gasoline  residual oil  etc   and a plethora of non energy materials  like asphalt  road salt  clay  and gypsum   Some of the companies also operate refined products terminals  storage facilities and transportation services  The primary activity of these firms involves buying crude other feedstocks and processing them into a wide variety of refined products Let s take a look at the industry s three major themes  Per the EIA  gasoline supply surplus is virtually gone  with inventories of the prime transportation fuel in the United States standing at the five year average  Coupled with a record high domestic demand  crack spreads   a measure of refining profitability   have widened significantly  almost doubling from the first quarter average  The improving crack spread is likely to drive both revenues and earnings of the sector components  Surging output in the United States is expected to keep North American oil prices in check  Record volumes in the face of fairly stable consumption has made U S  crude cheaper than its international counterpart  With production set to hit another all time high this year  prices are unlikely to increase much  This should provide refiners with the opportunity to buy lower cost American oil and sell products at higher international linked prices  Deteriorating U S  China trade relations have cast a pall over the gasoline demand outlook  Moreover  slowing industrial growth in China   the world s second biggest consumer of the fuel after America   is expected to keep prices depressed  As it is  the loss of Venezuela s heavy grade oil has put U S  refiners in a difficult position  Shrinking WTI Brent crude differentials might also weigh on margins for refining and marketing companies  This is because refined products  which are exported worldwide  use WTI crude as inputs but are priced higher than Brent  Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright OutlookThe Zacks Oil and Gas   Refining   Marketing is a 13 stock group within the broader Zacks  sector  The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank  101  which places it in the top 40  of more than 250 Zacks industries The group s   which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks  indicates impressive near term prospects  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider  let s take a look at the industry s recent stock market performance and valuation picture Industry Lags Sector   S P 500The Zacks Oil and Gas   Refining   Marketing industry has lagged the broader Zacks Oil   Energy Sector as well as the Zacks S P 500 composite over the past year The industry has declined 27 4  over this period compared with the sector s decrease of 14 9   The S P 500 meanwhile rose 5 9   One Year Price Performance Industry s Current Valuation  Since oil and gas companies are debt laden  it makes sense to value them based on the EV EBITDA  Enterprise Value  Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization  ratio  This is because the valuation metric takes into account not just equity but also the level of debt  For capital intensive companies  EV EBITDA is a better valuation metric because it is not influenced by changing capital structures and ignores the effect of noncash expenses On the basis of the trailing 12 month enterprise value to EBITDA  EV EBITDA   the industry is currently trading at 7 08X  lower than the S P 500 s 11 29X  However  it is significantly above the sector s trailing 12 month EV EBITDA of 4 96X Over the past five years  the industry has traded as high as 15 63X  as low as 4 43X  with a median of 7 35X Trailing 12 Month Enterprise Value to EBITDA  EV EBITDA  Ratio   Bottom LineShortage in the Permian takeaway capacity in the face of exponential production growth has forced producers to sell their crude at a discount  The downstream companies whose refining capacity is leveraged to lower Permian pricing are poised for significant bottom line growth On a further encouraging note  gasoline futures recently shot up to their highest in more than a month on Philadelphia Energy Solutions  decision to permanently close its oil refinery in Philadelphia following last week s devastating fire However  the traditional fuels refining operation   where crude is turned into products ranging from gasoline and diesel to jet fuel and asphalt   is heavily dependent on the WTI Brent differential  Given the narrowing discount in U S  oil prices to Brent  petroleum exporters  profits are expected to be hurt  This  in turn  will limit cash flow generation at the companies with downstream exposure None of the stocks in the Zacks Oil and

211046,432562,MPC,Earnings Preview  Marathon Petroleum  MPC  Q2 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Marathon Petroleum  MPC  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on August 1  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This refiner is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 33 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  41 4  
Revenues are expected to be  31 23 billion  up 39 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 12 13  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Marathon Petroleum 
For Marathon Petroleum  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Marathon Petroleum will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Marathon Petroleum would post earnings of  0 01 per share when it actually produced a loss of  0 09  delivering a surprise of  1 000  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Marathon Petroleum doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-marathon-petroleum-mpc-q2-earnings-expected-to-decline-200445170,200445170

What s Next for Marathon Petroleum 
While Marathon Petroleum has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of  1 000   A quarter ago  it was expected that this refiner would post earnings of  1 98 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 41  delivering a surprise of 21 72  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times 
Marathon Petroleum  which belongs to the Zacks Oil and Gas   Refining and Marketing industry  posted revenues of  28 62 billion for the quarter ended March 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1 60   This compares to year ago revenues of  18 98 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Marathon Petroleum shares have added about 0 7  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 15 1  
What s Next for Marathon Petroleum 
While Marathon Petroleum has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Marathon Petroleum was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  1 98 on  31 43 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  5 38 on  113 06 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year

211128,432644,MPC,Earnings Preview  Marathon Petroleum  MPC  Q1 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when Marathon Petroleum  MPC  reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on May 8  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This refiner is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 01 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  87 5  
Revenues are expected to be  29 08 billion  up 53 2  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 4 5  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Marathon Petroleum 
For Marathon Petroleum  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  87 30  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Marathon Petroleum will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Marathon Petroleum would post earnings of  1 98 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 41  delivering a surprise of  21 72  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Marathon Petroleum doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-marathon-petroleum-mpc-q1-earnings-expected-to-decline-200413999,200413999

This refiner is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 98 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  88 6  
Revenues are expected to be  33 19 billion  up 56 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 27 78  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Marathon Petroleum 
For Marathon Petroleum  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Marathon Petroleum will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Marathon Petroleum would post earnings of  1 68 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 70  delivering a surprise of  1 19  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Marathon Petroleum doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/marathon-petroleum-mpc-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200382019,200382019

211187,432703,MPC,The Energy Report For December 7 ,opinion,"American Exporter
While there is so much focus on the drama in the OPEC cartel  the real historic news that went unnoticed was that the United States last week exported more crude oil and fuel than it imported for the first time on record  Reuters news reported that when adding in all imports and exports of crude and refined products  the U S  exported a net 211 000 barrels per day for the week through Nov  30   the first time that has happened  according to U S  Energy Department figures dating to 1973  That was on the back of a jump in crude exports to a weekly record of more than 3 2 million bpd  So now the US can join the community of exporting nations as opposed to consuming nations  at least this week  That was only one of the bullish factors that was largely ignored with the markets OPEC plus one meeting obsession 
The Energy Information Administration  EIA  also brought sanity back to the oil inventory world by reporting that US oil supplies fell by 7 323 million barrels even after a one million barrel release from the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve  SPR  and another big 1 729 million barrel build in the Cushing Oklahoma Delivery point  The reason for the big drop is a game changing record US exports to a world that despite talk to the contrary is hungry for crude oil 
That strong demand is one reason Russia is reluctant to cut production with OPEC as they feel that the market may balance on its own without a production cut  Russian oil companies do not want to go to all the trouble to cut production  which from a logistics viewpoint is difficult in winter  only to have to ramp up production in the future  Saudi Arabia on the other hand  are less sure as they are feeling the hurt of the price drop and can t afford to be optimistic  Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak flew back to Russia to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin to see if he could get approval for a cut that would please the Saudis and close the deal at today s meeting  The number that Novak reportedly came back with was 200 000 barrels a day which if OPEC agrees to its 1 million  would put the cut at a respectable 1 2 million barrels a day 
Yet Can OPEC commit to a million  The bulk of the cartel want the Saudis to carry a bigger percentage of the cut  The other thorny issue in the OPEC meeting is whether to grant an exemption to Iran  still hampered by US sanctions  a situation that should get even more challenging in the coming months  And if you grant Iran an exemption than you might have to give Libya and Nigeria one too  Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al Falih said he was not confident a deal could be reached  Oh  what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to thieve 
Oil products did see an increase  The EIA reported that gasoline supply increased by 1 699 mb vs est   1 750mb distillates  3 811mb 
Reuters reports retail gasoline prices in the United States should average  2 25 a gallon in 2019  Marathon Petroleum  NYSE MPC  CEO Gary Heminger said at an industry conference in New York on Thursday  Heminger added that he expects crude oil prices to stay in a range of  60  70 a barrel  As long as crude oil prices stay within that range  we ll probably average  2 25  a gallon  for the year   he said at the S P Global Platts Global Energy Outlook Forum 
Mr  Heminger also told Maria Bartiromo on Mornings with Maria on the Fox Business Network that US Shale operators are going to have a hard time   Heminger said when you look at the price decline  it is already threatening U S  shale production   If you look at the Canadian producers  when you re looking at the wide spreads of the Western Canadian Select versus WTI  you look at some of the real cost to get some of the crude out of the Bakken because the pipelines are full   I think we are going to start seeing a slowdown in drilling if they don t see some prices turn around   Heminger told FOX Business  Maria Bartiromo on Wednesday  ",2018-12-08,Phil Flynn,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-energy-report-200366346,200366346

million barrels for the 21st month  further confirms the status of North Dakota  centered on the Bakken formation  as one of the hottest shale plays in the United States Oil Price Plunge  Winter Might Slow Production GrowthThere is increasing evidence that a fundamental change is occurring in the oil market  WTI crude  the American benchmark  popped above  76 a barrel and was trading at multiyear highs in early October  A looming shortage of the commodity on Iran sanctions helped in driving oil prices higher  Now  in a reversal  oil is facing a two pronged attack  rising supply from major producers and fear that an economic slowdown will dampen the outlook for demand  Oil s troubles helped send the index into a tailspin  leading to a 40  drop from recent highs  Even the OPEC led supply cuts look unlikely to end the market surplus With weaker oil prices denting producer profits  oil volume in North Dakota is expected to experience muted growth  Winter weather and road restrictions in the coming months will also put brakes on the region s breakneck activity Dakota Access Pipeline  Stretched to the BrinkApart from the robustness in oil prices  there is another factor that helped to speed up Bakken output growth   the 1 170 mile long Dakota Access Pipeline  Energy Transfer L P  s   NYSE ET   mega project has a capacity to carry about 520 000 barrels of oil per day  or more than 50  of North Dakota s output   The conduit has successfully bridged the gap between Bakken players and producers in other U S  oil producing areas like the Williston and Permian basins The geographically constrained Bakken Shale s crude has now better access to Gulf and East Coast refineries and also reaches international markets  The pipeline  where energy majors like Phillips 66   NYSE PSX    Enbridge Inc    NYSE ENB   and Marathon Petroleum   NYSE MPC   have invested  has helped to improve the region s drilling economics by lowering transportation costs for operators Moreover  the pipeline s service has bolstered the revival of Bakken output  with large operators like Oasis Petroleum Inc    NYSE OAS   counting on the Dakota Access Pipeline to send a major portion of their products to market But with the pipeline s spare capacity vanishing rapidly amid high demand  there is a need for infrastructure that can allow for the movement of more oil  A potential expansion of the Dakota Access Pipeline and the proposed Liberty Pipeline  which will provide opportunity to shippers to secure transportation service from the Bakken production areas to Corpus Christi  TX  are touted as solutions  While the Dakota Access expansion is likely to augment the pipeline s capacity by 50 000 barrels per day  the Liberty pipeline will have an initial throughput capacity of 350 000 barrels per day and is expected to start operations in another two years Two Stocks to FocusWhile the crude price collapse and winter weather could stall North Dakota oil growth engine for the time being  production is nevertheless expected to remain robust Though a number of companies have built sizeable acreage positions in North Dakota  we have shortlisted two of them  Whiting Petroleum

211205,432721,MPC,Should Invesco Russell 1000 Equal Weight ETF  EQAL  Be On Your Investing Radar ,opinion,"Looking for broad exposure to the Large Cap Blend segment of the US equity market  You should consider the Invesco Russell 1000 Equal Weight ETF  EQAL   a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 12 23 2014 
The fund is sponsored by Invesco  It has amassed assets over  451 43 M  making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Blend segment of the US equity market 
Why Large Cap Blend
Companies that fall in the large cap category tend to have a market capitalization above  10 billion  They tend to be stable companies with predictable cash flows and are usually less volatile than mid and small cap companies 
Blend ETFs are aptly named  since they tend to hold a mix of growth and value stocks  as well as show characteristics of both kinds of equities 
Costs
Expense ratios are an important factor in the return of an ETF and in the long term  cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts  other things remaining the same 
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0 20   putting it on par with most peer products in the space 
It has a 12 month trailing dividend yield of 1 50  
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
While ETFs offer diversified exposure  which minimizes single stock risk  a deep look into a fund s holdings is a valuable exercise  And  most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis 
This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Industrials sector  about 12 20  of the portfolio  Information Technology and Consumer Staples round out the top three 
Looking at individual holdings  Conagra Brands Inc  CAG  accounts for about 0 34  of total assets  followed by Marathon Petroleum Corp  MPC  and Lamb Weston Holdings Inc  LW  
The top 10 holdings account for about 2 98  of total assets under management 
Performance and Risk
EQAL seeks to match the performance of the Russell 1000 Equal Weight Index before fees and expenses  The Russell 1000 Equal Weight Index is composed of securities in the Russell 1000 Index and is equally weighted across nine sector groups with each security within the sector receiving equal weight 
The ETF has added about 0 17  so far this year and is up about 5 17  in the last one year  as of 11 05 2018   In the past 52 week period  it has traded between  29 43 and  33 62 
The ETF has a beta of 1 03 and standard deviation of 12 85  for the trailing three year period  making it a medium risk choice in the space  With about 969 holdings  it effectively diversifies company specific risk 
Alternatives
Invesco Russell 1000 Equal Weight ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3  Hold   which is based on expected asset class return  expense ratio  and momentum  among other factors  Thus  EQAL is a reasonable option for those seeking exposure to the Large Cap ETFs area of the market  Investors might also want to consider some other ETF options in the space 
The iShares Core S P 500 ETF  IVV  and the SPDR S P 500 ETF  NYSE SPY  track a similar index  While iShares Core S P 500 ETF has  159 B in assets  SPDR S P 500 ETF has  259 20 B  IVV has an expense ratio of 0 04  and SPY charges 0 09

Oil prices are on the rise as President Trump warns the world that anyone trading with Iran will not be trading with the USA  That pronouncement is directed at the EU who yesterday said that  We deeply regret the re imposition of sanctions by the U S   due to the latter s withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action  JCPOA    the statement issued in Brussels said  Yet  the tough talk may have changed some minds a bit after Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said he would welcome talks with the U S   right now    I don t have preconditions  If the U S  government is willing  let s start right now  
Yet  at the same time Rouhani said that  If you re an enemy and you stab the other person with a knife and then you say you want negotiations  then the first thing you have to do is remove the knife   He also wants the U S  to apologize for past actions against the Iranian people  I think if he is waiting for President Trump to apologize  he had better just wait for hell to freeze over 
China has turned to Iran to replace U S  crude  but what is Iran to profit if they gain China and lose India  Reuters is reporting that U S  crude oil producers appear to have found an alternative buyer for cargoes no longer heading to China  with India on track to import record volumes in August 
India has booked a total of 9 94 million barrels of crude  about 319 000 barrels per day  bpd   to arrive from the United States this month  according to vessel tracking and port data compiled by Thomson Reuters Oil Research and Forecasts  This would be almost triple the 119 000 bpd India imported from the United States in July  and well above the 190 000 bpd for November last year  the previous record for a month 
Oil bears have received a reality check  Shale oil output is slowing  and pipelines are full  Saudi oil production fell  raising concerns about their ability to replace Iranian oil  The oil super cycle  that we told you was born in 2014 and 2015  is on full display  Normal seasonal weakness is overshadowing on what will turn out to be one of the tightest winter markets we have seen in over a decade  This as the oil market gets prepared for what should be a very bullish American Petroleum Institute  API  report 
Last week  we saw a surprise increase in oil supply as U S  oil exports tanked  This week  we are looking for a big increase in U S  oil exports  In fact  we mat hit a record as we may get two weeks of exports for the price of one  Data from Genscape put Cushing Storage at 24 445 733 million barrels  That is down 1 255 176 million barrels from July 27th and down 125 680 from last Tuesday  That  along with an increase in oil exports  should give us at least a 3 3 million barrel supply 
U S refiners are racking up the profits  In today s Wall Street Journal it is being reported that  American fuel makers are posting their best second quarter profits in years  thanks to soaring domestic oil production and regional pipeline bottlenecks that are allowing them to buy crude on the cheap 
Refining companies typically suffer  as oil prices rise because drivers scale back their travel  reducing demand for gasoline and diesel  But record U S  production  coupled with insufficient pipeline capacity in Canada and West Texas  has depressed the cost of oil in many parts of the country  even as oil prices have been rising in general  That has boosted margins for many stand alone refiners  propelling some  including Phillips 66  NYSE PSX  and Marathon Petroleum Corp  NYSE MPC    to their highest second quarter profits on record  Phillips 66  the largest independent refiner  earned an average of  12 28 per refined barrel during the second quarter  up from  8 44 for the same period last year  The company reported profits of  1 3 billion  up 143  from 2017 s second quarter  Marathon Petroleum earned  15 40 per refined barrel  compared with  11 32 a barrel in the year earlier period  Its second quarter profit rose 118  to  1 1 billion  Both companies seized on the favorable economics by operating their facilities at full capacity  A must read in the Journal ",2018-08-07,Phil Flynn,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-energy-report-080718-200336921,200336921
211226,432742,MPC,Why Marathon Petroleum  MPC  Is A Top Dividend Stock For Your Portfolio,opinion,"All investors love getting big returns from their portfolio  whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  But for income investors  generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus 
Cash flow can come from bond interest  interest from other types of investments  and of course  dividends  A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  and investors often view it by its dividend yield  a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long term returns  and in many cases  dividend contributions surpass one third of total returns 
Marathon Petroleum in Focus

Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits  But  not every company offers a quarterly payout 
For instance  it s a rare occurrence when a tech start up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend  It s more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends  Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  With that in mind  MPC is a compelling investment opportunity  Not only is it a strong dividend play  but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3  Hold  ",2018-10-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-marathon-petroleum-mpc-is-a-top-dividend-stock-for-your-portfolio-200352289,200352289

211257,432773,MPC,Crude Oil And Rig Counts  4 30 18,opinion,"Step Back 
Oil prices are taking a step back on Monday as an increase in rig counts and a drop in supply in Cushing Oklahoma and a perceived drop in Geo political risk premium are causing traders to take a step back  The U S  oil rig count increased by 5 rigs last week  as U S  producers are responding to higher prices and demand  but the real reason for weakness in oil may have been the fact that refinery maintenance is slowing the ravenous U  S  appetite for crude oil temporarily  Private forecasters are calling for a sizable 700 000 barrel plus increase in Cushing oil supply this week  even as overall crude  gas  and diesel supply should fall 
The other reason is potential progress with North Korea  The New York Times reported that Kim Jong un said he would abandon his nuclear weapons if the U S  promised not to invade North Korea  a South Korean official said  While there is much skepticism  a peace deal with North Korea would be a major historic turning point in world history 
France and Iran are trying to work on an agreement to save some type of nuclear deal even if the U S  decides to back away from the Iranian nuke agreement  The fact that Iran is talking could ease the fear premium of what happens after the U S  pulls out of the deal 
Yet despite Monday s weakness  oil is still in very good shape  Global demand is rising and U S  demand is strong against a backdrop of uncertain production issues  While U S  shale output continues to rise  production outside of the U S  falters  Venezuela is collapsing and now there is plunging output in Angola as well  Bloomberg reports that  Angola  once Africa s biggest crude producer  is suffering sharp declines at underinvested offshore fields  with output dropping almost three times as much as the nation pledged in an accord with fellow OPEC members  With the losses set to accelerate    a shipping program seen by Bloomberg News shows crude exports will fall in June to the lowest since at least 2008    the cartel risks tightening supply too much  
Corn is king  China trade war fears are easing and that is a good thing for farmers that saw a big pop in grain prices as well as surging demand for their products  That includes U S  ethanol  the subsidized built market  The Energy Information Administration reports that the United States exported nearly 1 4 billion gallons of fuel ethanol in 2017  surpassing the previous record of 1 2 billion gallons set in 2011  U S  imports of ethanol in 2017 increased compared with 2016 but remained relatively small at 77 million gallons  resulting in the United States being a net exporter of ethanol for the eighth consecutive year 
The United States has seen continued growth in fuel ethanol exports over the past eight years as increases in both corn production and ethanol production capacity have outpaced domestic fuel ethanol consumption  U S  fuel ethanol was exported to 35 countries in 2017  but more than half of all exported fuel ethanol went to Brazil and Canada 
Refiner madness  It is a great time to be a refiner and that means big deals  The Wall Street Journal reports that Marathon Petroleum  NYSE MPC  to buy Andeavor for More than  20 billion  The Journal writes that the cash and stock deal  which values Andeavor at about  150 a share  is expected to be announced Monday  That would be a roughly 23  premium over Andeavor s closing price Friday after the stock surged about 50  in the past year  Marathon  based in Findlay  Ohio  is the second largest refiner in the U S   according to its website  Marathon branded gasoline is sold in 20 states  and its Speedway unit owns the nation s second largest convenience store chain  It also owns a midstream master limited partnership with about 11 000 miles of crude oil and light product pipelines  Andeavor  based in San Antonio and formerly known as Tesoro  operates 10 refineries in the western U S  with total capacity of more than 1 2 million barrels a day  Part of the rationale of the deal centers on the companies  complementary footprints  with Marathon in the East and Andeavor in the West  regulatory approval could be easier to win  The deal is expected to produce  1 billion of synergies  people familiar with the matter said 
Natural gas has fought off cold but is there a spring in our future  Andrew Weissman  of ECB Analytics  says that this has been the coldest April in 35 years  adding more than 175 Bcf of demand for natural gas  Notably  however  despite record demand  the June contract never closed above  2 821 MMBtu and relinquished all its gains for the month late last week  This weak performance is a sign of the strength of bearish sentiment  Over the next three weeks  weather driven demand will fall to its lowest point of the year  potentially leading to record injections  As this occurs  the June gas contract is likely to drop to  2 61 2 68   if not lower  With colder than normal weather firmly in the rearview mirror  falling springtime power demand across the Midwest and Northeast is likely to exert considerable downward pressure on regional day ahead electricity prices this week ",2018-04-30,Phil Flynn,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-energy-report-43018-200310767,200310767
211258,432774,MPC,Merger Of Two Independents To Create  Largest U S  Refiner  ,opinion,"An April 30  2018  research note issued by Raymond James indicated that Marathon Petroleum Corp   NYSE MPC  has agreed to merge with Andeavor  NYSE ANDV  
 The combined entity will possess 3 plus million barrels per day of refining capacity  making it the largest domestic refiner  with a diverse and expansive footprint   wrote analyst Justin Jenkins  Marathon s management estimates about  1 billion   1B  worth of run rate synergies will be achieved within three years of the transaction s closing  slated for H2 18 
Under the agreement terms   Andeavor shareholders will receive either 1 87 shares of Marathon for each Andeavor share or  152 27 per share subject to a maximum 15  cash component    3 5B    explained Jenkins 
Raymond James views the proposed merger as positive   Strategically  we believe the deal makes sense by adding geographic diversity and  importantly  adding growth  and return enhancement  opportunities in the key retail and midstream segments   Jenkins noted   We project accretion from today s deal in 2019 of nearly 9   
Marathon has a history of creating value by  improving refining returns  growing the higher value Speedway segment and unlocking value at MPLX   its master limited partnership  Jenkins said   We think this only continues with the addition of Andeavor s asset base  
Also in the research note  Jenkins reviewed Marathon s Q1 18 numbers  which were a miss but inconsequential to the Andeavor deal  Earnings per share was  0 08  below Raymond James and consensus  estimate of  0 15  The shortfall was mostly due to underperformance in the refining segment  which posted a  133 million   133M  operating loss versus an expected  44M 
Raymond James remains bullish on its thesis for Marathon  For 2018 and beyond   Marathon is set to benefit from synergy upside  a strengthened refining suite that sits well positioned for IMO 2020 and robust opportunities in both the higher value Speedway and midstream segments   Jenkins purported 
He reiterated his firm s Strong Buy rating and  90 per share target price on Marathon  The refiner s stock is currently trading at around  76 50 per share

211271,432787,MPC,Oil s Trouble With Tech,opinion,"Oil ran into tech trouble as the U S  tech sector is under fire leading to a sell off in stocks against a backdrop of rising oil inventory  The Data breach scandal at Facebook  NASDAQ FB  is only one of many quick rising problems for the many tech firms and I am sure somewhere the Winklevoss twins are smiling  As the whisper number suggested  oil inventories increased by a whopping 5 32 million  according to the American Petroleum Institute  API  barrels  This was led by an increase in U S  imports  a 1 66 million barrel build in Cushing  Oklahoma and a 7 million barrel sale from the U S  Strategic Petroleum Reserve to feed our oil hungry refineries 
The U S  sale from the reserve was expected at some point but the timing of the purchase shows that refiners need supply now because even with the increase in supplies this week  oil supply are below the average range for this time of year  Platts reported that the sale was made to at least five different companies  rumored to be Atlantic Trading   Marketing  Phillips 66  NYSE PSX   Marathon Petroleum  NYSE MPC   Motiva  and Trafigura  according to sources  Phillips 66 was sold the largest amount of crude  according to Platts sources  While we are seeing great increases in U S  shale oil production  the truth is that many U S  refiners have more lighter condensate then they need for heavy crude to ramp up 
The sharp increase in U S  supply may temper prices  The fear that the tech sector sell offs may bleed into the overall economy may hurt prices  Yet we feel that those fears are over played  While the technicals on oil look weak in the short run  it does not change the bullish outlook in the long run 
While a slowdown in tech is a potential threat to the economy  the reality is that Facebook and Twitter don t run on oil  The oil sector of the economy was more concerned with a trade war and if that is averted we will raise our oil demand expectations  A deal with China to potentially open their economy is very bullish for oil demand expectations as well as global economic growth 
Refiners are buyers as they must rebuild gasoline supply ahead of summer  The API reported that gasoline fell by 5 80 million barrels last week as strong demand and the drawdown of winter fuel blends led to the decline  U S  gasoline demand is at a record and even with a drop in consumer confidence  in part caused by an uptick in gas prices  the outlook for demand is still increasing for this summer 
The API also reported that U S  distillate supply fell by 2 24 million barrels  Demand for distillate is going to stay strong as this stupid winter weather hangs on and farmers start to get their tiller  planters and tractors filled up as they prepare to plant our nations crop 
Global supply may be tighter than we think as well  In Fact on Morning with Maria on the Fox Business Network  the Saudi Finance Minister  Mohamed al JADAAN said  several countries will be running out of supply  probably due to underinvestment  On top of that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman told Reuters that Riyadh and Moscow were considering greatly extending a short term alliance on oil curbs that began in January 2017 after a crash in crude prices  with a partnership to manage supplies potentially growing  to a 10 to 20 year agreement   The Crown Prince wants to build on its recent success of winning back its influence of global oil prices  As I said before  anyone who doubted OPEC s resolve to reduce oversupply  should not underestimate them now ",2018-03-28,Phil Flynn,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-energy-report-032818-200301388,200301388

211299,432815,MPC,When It Rains It Pours  Mnuchin Mania ,opinion,"The US Dollar bids were far and few between thanks to Treasury Secretary Mnuchin s outward endorsement for weak USD policy  While we already knew the administration previously favored a weaker dollar  his comments caught the dollar prone and defenseless  opening floodgates to a massive wave of dollar selling 
His comments have turned into a bit of a fiasco and will end up going down in market folklore for marking the first time since the early 90s that a US Treasury Secretary endorsed a weaker US dollar  The bond market took an immediate and predictable defensive posture as US 10 Year yields soared topping out at 2 66  as memories of savage bear markets resonated from when then Treasury Secretary James A  Baker III threw down the gauntlet and endorsed a weaker dollar in the early 90s  But we are far from the fractures and turbulent world economy of the late 80s or early 90s  so the Munchin fallout is unlikely to trigger the tsunami of global risk aversion that occurred in yesteryear  Nonetheless  the aftershocks are still reverberating in the early APAC session Oil Markets
Oil markets too were at the epicenter of volatility with WTI breaking the  65 00 per barrel and marking the highest close since Dec 2014  Oil prices pivoted higher after the U S  Energy Information Administration  EIA  reported a 10th straight drop in US crude inventories  The report solidifies the view that OPEC production caps are working 
But let s not lose sight of the US dollar follies  which are underpropping oil markets and providing the bounce to all commodity markets  Since we may only be in the early stages of the US dollars demise  and when aggregated with the oil markets  OPEC induced positive developments  the market could press significantly higher from increasing sensitivity and stronger correlations to the US dollar alone 
Structurally  the dollar can push much lower as signs are developing that we may be in the early stages of a multi year secular bear market 
Gold Markets
Gold hit an 18 month high as investors were more than willing to pay hefty insurance premiums as a hedge against the inflationary impacts from a hapless dollar  US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin opened the floodgates to dollar sales  but with traders  best case scenario to sell the dollar at all costs  gold prices should remain well supported on dips and could be poised to move even higher on the next US dollar wobble 
G 10
The EUR
Decision day for the ECB and the traders are jointly overseeing price action which usually sends a convincing signal to reduce risk as it s typical to reduce longs ahead of the ordinarily dovish Draghi 
Given the extended EUR position  we should expect the EUR to give way some points on dovish Draghi  But with the primary macro theme in FX markets being USD weakness  it s unlikely those euro offers will hang around too long  especially after dollar red flags raised when BoJ Kuroda erred as dovish as could be and the market still bought JPY 
The Japanese Yen
They Yen has been tracking the general dollar weakness overnight  but traders are waiting for the BoJ next move  USD JPY is too high to sound the intervention alarm bells  leading me to believe a swift shift in policy may be in the offing The Australian Dollar
AUD has recovered all of Iron Ore inspired losses  as the free falling greenback has supported the commodity block of currencies en masse 
But the next catalyst may come from a build up of RBA   rate hike fever  that seems to be making the rounds these days  While the market base case is for the RBA to remain neutral  any bullish shift higher in a measly price in May hike probability could push the Aussie to 82 level 
Traders are starting to take notice of the recent string of economic data which has been particularly boisterous led by strong employment print supported by an uptick in consumer sentiment 
However  with the Aussie dollar soaring these days  there s a higher likelihood the RBA will remain faithful to current expectations as opposed to moving in front of them The Chinese Yuan
The market has come a long way in a few days primarily driven on the heels of the broader USD malaise as fast money speculators have piled into both sides of the ledger  However  there is chatter circulating of some sizable stops that are cluttering the landscape near the 6 34 level that could prove an attractive target and test the PBoC s resolve  Either way  recent price discovery is telling us heaps about the PBoC s current currency policy which appears much more investor friendly than ever before 
The Malaysian Ringgit
Overnight price action was more a reflection of a struggling US dollar rather than pre Marathon Petroleum Corporation  NYSE MPC  market positioning 
Nonetheless  the Ringgit was supported by surging crude prices and the sagging dollar  But today is the day of reckoning for Riggit bulls and the BNM could make or break many of our top line views 
Pre BNM banter
Straw polls suggest that 65  of the market has long Malaysian exposure in either short USD MYR or long short dated Malaysia Bonds 
But the massive lifting will be left to Bank Negara to express a strong currency bias by raising interest rates at today s meeting 
Our base case scenario is for slightly more aggressive action from Bank Negara Malaysia  BNM  than the market s consensus of one hike and done  So if the BNM signal one additional rate hike for 2018 this would trigger an immediate downside test of 3 70  whereas if the BNM signals only one single rate hike for 2018  the market will test 3 80
The most unlikely scenario  if the BNM take a dovish tack  suggesting no imminent rate hike  then USD MYR could gap above 4 00 USD MYR in a heartbeat 
As far as yesterday CPI data  While coming in at 3 5  for Dec 3 7  for the full year 2017 and within the central bank s 3 4  inflation target  The BNM is still expected to hike interest rates later today since firmer oil prices will translate into high headline inflation in 2018 ",2018-01-25,Stephen Innes,https://www.investing.com/analysis/when-it-rains-it-pours--mnuchin-mania-200283309,200283309

211331,432847,MPC,Is Marathon Petroleum  MPC  A Strong Value Stock ,opinion,"While growth investing is always a popular strategy  you should not discount the benefits that come with focusing on value metrics  Value investing allows investors to discover stocks with low price to earnings ratios  solid outlooks  and decent dividends

Headquartered in Findlay  Ohio  Marathon is the third largest U S  refiner based on crude oil refining capacity  operating an integrated oil refining system concentrated primarily in the Midwest  Shares have gained over 23  so far this year compared to its  year to date return of 9 6 
MPC could be an interesting play for a number of reasons  The company s forward P E of 17 18  P S ratio of 0 42  and dividend yield of 2 59  suggest that Marathon is a pretty good value pick  since investors have to pay a relatively low level for each dollar of earnings  MPC also has decent revenue metrics to back up its bottom line 
But before you think that Marathon is just a pure value play  it s important to note that the company has been witnessing solid estimate revision activity  For the current year  earnings are expected to grow nearly 68   with sales increasing 14 5  in the same time frame  nine analysts have shifted their estimate higher in the last 30 days compared to none lower Marathon Petroleum Corporation Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   This overall estimate strength has been enough to push MPC to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   suggesting the company is poised to outperform  Marathon is looking great from a number of different angles  from its low value ratios and to its strong Zacks Rank  which means that this oil giant could be a solid pick for value investors at this time

211332,432848,MPC,Oil   Gas Stock Roundup  Keystone XL s Approval  BP s Buyback   More,opinion,"It was a week where both oil and gas prices lost ground 
On the news front  sponsor TransCanada   TO TRP   won approval to build its controversial Keystone XL Pipeline through the state of Nebraska  while BP  LON BP  Plc   NYSE BP   became the first European oil major to resume share repurchase since the 2014 oil slump 
Overall  it was a dismal week for the sector  West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude futures edged down 0 3  to close at  56 55 per barrel  while natural gas prices slumped 3 6  to  3 097 per million Btu  MMBtu    See the last  Oil   Gas Stock Roundup  here   
The U S  oil benchmark fell after the U S  Energy Department s inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded an unexpected weekly build  The report further revealed that gasoline inventories increased slightly from previous week 
However  the talking point from the data sets was the steady trend of rising domestic oil production that continues to be the biggest headwind for the market  Specifically  U S  output rose by 25 000 barrels per day last reported week to more than 9 6 million barrels per day   the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983 
Meanwhile  natural gas futures logged a big decline despite a larger than expected decrease in supplies   the season s first withdrawal  Unfavorable weather forecasts and strength in the commodity s production fueled the downside 
Recap of the Week s Most Important Stories1     TransCanada Corporation s Keystone XL Pipeline has finally received a regulatory approval from Nebraska commissioners after a prolonged period of delay  The decision marks a partial victory for TransCanada since the regulators have approved the project on an alternative route rather than the company s proposed route The  8 billion Keystone XL pipeline with 830 000 barrels  capacity was designed to improve oil extraction from Alberta s oil sands and the Bakken region in the U S  refineries  The initial phase of the pipeline project was finished in 2011  A proposal was made to add another 1179 miles to the 2100 mile long pipeline  The project  already approved by Canada  Montana and South Dakota  had been eagerly awaiting a federal ruling from the Nebraska state Nebraska commissioners  recent verdict  granting approval to the project on an alternate route  created new problems  Per the company  the originally proposed route was most efficient  The alternate route will likely balloon costs and delay the disputed pipeline project further TransCanada announced that it is set to begin the review of Nebraska s decision to examine the economics of the project  The company will thereby take an official call regarding construction and completion of the pipeline after carefully reevaluating the project s viability and schedule   Read more   2     BP Plc recently commenced a share buyback program  keeping with the plans announced along with the third quarter 2017 earnings report  This makes BP the first leading energy player in Europe to recommence buybacks after 2014  when repurchases were stalled as crude price started falling on supply glut woes  As per the program  BP will repurchase no more than 1 96 billion shares between Nov 15 and the company s annual general meeting in 2018 The company s strong financials  primarily supported by crude price recovery  are backing this decision  During the third quarter  BP reported adjusted earnings of 57 cents per American Depositary Share  ADS  on a replacement cost basis  excluding non operating items  The bottom line not only surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 50 cents but was way higher than the year ago 30 cents  Moreover  the improving financial position shows that the firm has come a long way since the 2010 oil spill incident in the Macondo Prospect Investors should know that with the buyback  BP will be able to overcome the dilution problem under its scrip dividend plan that entitles the investors  options for choosing stocks as payout instead of cash   Read more  3     Oil refining and marketing giant Marathon Petroleum Corp    NYSE MPC   recently announced that it will sell its fuel distribution services and refining and logistics assets to its midstream subsidiary MPLX LP   NYSE MPLX   for  8 1 billion  The deal is expected to be over by Feb 1  2018 Of the  8 1 billion  Marathon Petroleum will receive  4 1 billion in cash  The remaining  4 billion will be in the form of equity of MPLX  comprising 111 6 million common  Limited Partner  units of MPLX along with 2 3 million general partner units  including incentive distribution rights  This will enable Zacks Rank  2  Buy  Marathon Petroleum to keep 2  general partner interest in its subsidiary  You can see  While the deal is expected to enrich MPLX s earnings by diversifying it with fee based stable revenue streams and strengthening the partnership s distributable cash flow base  Marathon Petroleum is following its strategy of enhancing shareholder value by accelerating dropdowns to MPLX  The increased equity participation in the subsidiary will also help Marathon Petroleum to receive a steady and growing revenue stream   Read  4     Oil and natural gas company  SandRidge Energy  Inc    NYSE SD   recently agreed to acquire its rival Bonanza Creek Energy Inc    NYSE BCEI    a Denver based company for a total consideration of  746 million including cash and stock The cash and stock deal will require SandRidge to buy all the outstanding shares of debt free Bonanza at  36 00 per share  This marks a premium of 17 4  to Bonanza Creek s Nov 14 closing price  For every share of Bonanza Creek  SandRidge will pay  19 20 in cash and  16 80 in its own shares  Per SandRidge  the deal is expected to be over by the first quarter of 2018 The deal will enable SandRidge to increase its presence in Colorado s Denver Julesburg Basin by attaching an enriched inventory of drill ready locations  which will complement its current portfolio  The deal includes 67 000 net acres adjacent to SandRidge s Niobrara Shale acreage Cost and operational synergies from the deal will aid SandRidge  which recovered from bankruptcy at the end of 2016 while Bonanza Creek came out of bankruptcy in early 2017  The acquisition will help the combined entity to yield risk adjusted returns in the coming years   Read more  5     Cheniere Energy  Inc    NYSE LNG   reported wider than expected third quarter 2017 loss  which stemmed from increased costs Overall costs and expenses soared 145 8  to  1 106 million from the same quarter last year  The increase is mainly attributed to the higher cost of sales which jumped to  824 million compared with  253 million in the prior year quarter  Operating and maintenance expenses rose to  114 million in the quarter  reflecting an increase of 87  from the prior year figure Depreciation and amortization expenses also increased from  49 million a year ago to  92 million in the reported quarter  Higher SG A costs and inclusion of impairment charges further led to increased costs in the quarter under review During the quarter  the company shipped 44 cargoes from Sabine Pass liquefied natural gas terminal in Louisiana  Total volumes lifted in the reported quarter were 160 trillion British thermal units Cheniere Energy updated its guidance for full year 2017 despite the wider than expected loss  The raised guidance reflects the management s confidence in its construction projects which are much ahead of the schedule The adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between  1 8 billion and  1 9 billion  8 8  higher than the prior guidance  Distributable cash flow is likely to be between  600 million and  700 million compared with the prior guidance level of  500  700 million   Read more

211333,432849,MPC,DOJ To Penalize Activists For Damaging Energy Infrastructure,opinion,The U S  Department of Justice   DOJ   recently vowed to take legal action against protesters and activists who damage oil pipelines and other energy infrastructure  The verdict came in response to the letter sent by more than 80 U S  representatives inquiring whether the activists who damaged energy infrastructure in October 2016 could be charged under the domestic terrorism law  The letter  which was sent to Attorney General Jeff Sessions  is still under review   In support of the question raised by the representatives  DOJ stated that the damage done by activists could disrupt services and consequently affect people s lives  The damages can also burden taxpayers and even put lives at risk  The damaged pipelines can also hurt the environment  The DOJ s decision can increase the persisting tension between climate activists and the administrative board Although the DOJ s legal actions will lead lawmakers to distinguish between lawful and unlawful protests  the department is yet to shed light on last year s events where activists protested in four states  The protestors twisted shut valves on a few pipelines  which were responsible for crude oil imports from Canada  The Climate Direct Action group said that the action was in favor of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe  The tribe has been vocal about the Dakota Access Pipeline operated by Energy Transfer Partners LP   NYSE ETP    as it can cause damage to the tribe s burial ground and pollute its waters  The controversial pipeline has witnessed protests since the time it of its planning  Energy Transfer started construction of the pipeline in June 2016 with oil and gas companies like Phillips 66   NYSE PSX    Enbridge Inc    NYSE ENB   and Marathon Petroleum Corporation   NYSE MPC   as minor partners  There are cases where activists have been recognized and penalized for their actions  A protestor was sentenced for 32 days for illegally tampering with a Kinder Morgan   NYSE KMI   pipeline in Washington  The construction of the Atlantic Sunrise Pipeline by Williams Partners L P    NYSE WPZ   through Lancaster County also faced protests  Recently  five protesters were arrested in Martic Township for creating obstacles at the construction site What Lies Ahead Instances of damage to energy infrastructure are expected to go down following the decision taken by the DOJ  The actions will also assure oil and gas companies of the safety of their assets  However  the decision may ignite another controversy regarding protests against climate changes Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest Strategies It s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But while the market gained  18 8  from 2016   Q1 2017  our top stock picking screens have returned  157 0    128 0    97 8    94 7   and  90 2  respectively And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon  Over the years it has been remarkably consistent  From 2000   Q1 2017  the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over  Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we re willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation ,2017-11-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/doj-to-penalize-activists-for-damaging-energy-infrastructure-200267855,200267855
211334,432850,MPC,Should Value Investors Pick Marathon Petroleum  MPC  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Marathon Petroleum Corporation   NYSE MPC   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Marathon Petroleum has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 19 1  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 21 1  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Marathon Petroleum s current PE ratio noticeably above its midpoint  which is 10 8  over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 23 4  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Marathon Petroleum has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 17 1  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Marathon Petroleum s stock in the near term too    P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Marathon Petroleum has a P S ratio of about 0 5  This is substantially lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 4 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is equivalent to the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years MPC is actually in the higher zone of its trading range in the time period per the P S metric  which suggests that the company s stock price has already appreciated to some degree  relative to its sales Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Marathon Petroleum currently has a Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes MPC a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Marathon Petroleum is just 1 6  a level that is marginally lower than the industry average of 2 0  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Additionally  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 10 4  which is slightly better than the industry average of 10 9  Clearly  MPC is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Marathon Petroleum might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of A and a Momentum score of A  This gives MPC a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current quarter has seen five estimates go higher in the past sixty days  compared to none lower  while the full year estimate has seen six upward and no downward revisions in the same time period This has had a favorable impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has surged about 42 5  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has climbed nearly 23   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Marathon Petroleum Corporation Price and Consensus    The stock holds a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   which indicates expectations of in line performance from the company in the near term  However  Marathon Petroleum is enjoying bullish analyst sentiment  as indicated by the positive estimate revisions  and this works in the company s favor   Bottom LineMarathon Petroleum is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  a decent industry rank  top 43  out of more than 250 industries  further supports the growth potential of the stock  However  with a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past one year  the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below Despite positive estimate revision activity  investors should wait for industry trends to turn around first   When it does  this stock could be a compelling value pick Zacks  Best Private Investment Ideas While we are happy to share many articles like this on the

211372,432888,MPC,The Energy Report  Dunkirk In Houston,opinion,"Dunkirk In Houston
Watching the widespread devastations in Houston due to what was Hurricane Harvey  has been gut wrenching and now that this storm has regenerated and made a second landfall in Louisiana  just west of the town of Cameron  its impact on lives and property is just starting to be measured  Ordinary citizens in Houston have been heroically rescuing their neighbors with their own boats reminds me of the beach rescue in Dunkirk when ordinary citizens  with their boats  saved the British army and changed the course of history  Despite the challenges and devastation in Houston and the pain  this will prove to be their finest hours 
The impact on energy and the economy is also just beginning to be felt as the fall out from the storm damage is just beginning to be measured  Right now  the market focus is the impact on US refineries and the shutting down of transportation pipelines  Yet they will also have to deal with the very real possibility of considerable damage to oil and natural gas producing infrastructure as well as damage caused to Eagle Ford Shale fields 
Gasoline RBOB Futures are on the rise for the seventh day in a row as it has been confirmed that the Colonial Pipeline is running at reduced rates  raising the real possibility of gas and diesel and even jet fuel shortages  Colonial Pipeline Co  said Tropical Storm Harvey affected its Houston origin  which includes Pasadena  Houston  and Cedar Bayou  Service from those locations was interrupted during the storm and its aftermath  although the company is working to restore service and minimize the impact  Still reports that flow was down by as much as 60  is feeding into that gas and diesel rally 
The Wall Street Journal says that the 

Colonial is the biggest fuel pipeline in the U S   stretching 5 500 miles through 12 states 

Analysts have likened it to  a Mississippi River of fuel   It can transport up to 2 5 million barrels a day of gasoline  diesel and jet fuel  and is directly connected to several airports  including Nashville  Charlotte and Dulles International Airport in Washington  D C  The pipeline  which was built in 1963  is a main source of fuel for the Southeast  including offshoots to parts of northern Florida  It ends in New Jersey and is also a massive supplier of fuel to the greater New York City metro area 
The Wall Street Journal also reported that the nation s largest refinery in Port Arthur  Texas  curbed fuel output to 40  Tuesday due to severe weather  That 600 000 barrel a day plant was taking on water in some areas  its primary problem wasn t getting all the oil it needed to make fuel because of port and pipeline closures  according to its owner  the Saudi Arabian Oil Company 
Other refineries are shut  not due to damage  but because they cannot get crude  Bloomberg News reports that Marathon Petroleum Corp  NYSE MPC   s Galveston Bay refinery in Texas City  with a capacity of 451 000 barrels a day  may be forced to halt production within several days because it is running out of crude  a person familiar with operations said on Monday  Its oil comes via Magellan Midstream Partners LP  which suspended use of its pipeline in the area on Sunday  That pipeline is one reason gas prices in the Midwest are already spiking 
Shale oil producers can t mover crude but there are also issues as to whether they can raise production to previous levels in the Eagle Ford after the storm may have changed the liquid make up of some of the reservoirs 
The Wall Street Journal writes 

The storm s widespread devastation has come into focus  several analysts say that much  if not most  of the 1 4 million barrels of oil produced daily in the Eagle Ford shale of South Texas has been cut off and may not return for weeks  The Eagle Ford  which is on the doorstep of Corpus Christi where the storm made landfall  is second in output in the state only to the Permian Basin of West Texas 

The shipping traffic in Houston  Corpus Christi and other ports may not be fully restored for two weeks  That and other infrastructure limitations will have a domino effect back to production  said Tony Sanchez III  chief executive of Eagle Ford operator Sanchez Energy Corp  Restarting wells may not guarantee that they resume flowing at the same rate  he said  On a technical level  he fears that shale wells  once shut off  could lose pressure  Most of his company s production wasn t shut in as it lies in areas west of the storm s path 
He said 

It s not just a matter of flipping a switch  There is significant risk in those wells not coming back to previous levels 

The Journal says that the market may be underestimating Harvey s impact because nothing like this flood has ever happened to the shale industry before  said Giovanni Satnav  a commodities analyst at UBS Wealth Management 
At this point the focus is on products  Yet we could have production issues on gas and oil that could be a big deal when we start to run crude  Refining margins are surging and we should continue to see the speed from Brent to WTI widen  Yet in a few weeks it could reverse 
The American Petroleum Institute  API  reported crude draw   5 78 mm  Gasoline   0 476 mm 19 1  Distillate   0 486 mm  Cushing   0 582 mm 
The BSEE Hurricane Response Team continues to monitor Gulf of Mexico oil and gas activities  Based on data from offshore operator reports submitted as of 11 30 CDT testerday  personnel have been evacuated from a total of 102 production platforms  13 84 percent of the 737 manned platforms in the Gulf of Mexico  Production platforms are the structures located offshore from which oil and natural gas are produced  Unlike drilling rigs  which typically move from location to location  production facilities remain in the same location throughout a project s duration  Personnel have been evacuated from five rigs  non dynamically positioned  DP  rig   equivalent to 50 percent of the 10 rigs of this type currently operating in the Gulf  Rigs can include several types of offshore drilling facilities including jackup rigs  platform rigs  all submersibles and moored semisubmersibles 
From operator reports  it is estimated that approximately 18 26 percent of the current oil production of 1 750 000 barrels of oil per day in the Gulf of Mexico has been shut in  which equates to 319 523 barrels of oil per day  It is also estimated that approximately 19 1 percent of the natural gas production of 3 220 million cubic feet per day  or 615 09 million cubic feet per day in the Gulf of Mexico has been shut in  The production percentages are calculated using information submitted by offshore operators in daily reports  therefore are estimates  which BSEE compares to historical production reports to ensure the estimates follow a logical pattern ",2017-08-30,Phil Flynn,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-energy-report-083017-200210393,200210393

211406,432922,MPC,Dakota Access Pipeline Fails To Receive Construction Permit,opinion,"Last week  the Obama administration  denied a permit for the construction of a key section of the 1 172 mile Dakota Access Pipeline   DAPL    This announcement   jointly made by the U S  Department of Justice  the Department of the Interior and the Department of the Army   came shortly after a federal judge ruled in favor of construction of this  3 7 billion project  in spite of protests by Native American tribes 
Why the Protest 
Environmental and indigenous activists have been protesting against the construction of the oil pipeline due to the possibility of the pipeline contaminating drinking water  In particular  the Standing Rock Sioux   a tribe living close to the proposed pipeline   and other activists argued that the pipeline crossing under the Missouri River threatens their primary source of drinking water alongside passing over their ancestral lands 
Tribal leaders are skeptical that an accident or a spill could potentially contaminate farmland and drinking water for millions  The tribes and their representatives believe that they were not adequately consulted on these issues and hence  filed a federal lawsuit in July against the U S  Army Corps of Engineers 
Current Situation
The decision by the Obama Administration to disapprove the permit for construction is undoubtedly a significant victory for the protesters  This implies that sponsors of the controversial Dakota Pipeline would have to halt operations along the 40 mile stretch in North Dakota  However  activity on other sections of the pipeline could proceed as planned 
However  the long struggle to block the project is far from over  Given that the federal government has not rejected the project plan and has suggested further review on the matter  it remains to be seen how the events unfold once Donald Trump takes office 

About the Pipeline
Primarily owned by Dallas based pipeline operator Energy Transfer Partners L P    NYSE ETP    the Dakota Access Pipeline has a capacity to transport over 470 000 barrels of crude daily from North Dakota s prolific Bakken formation through South Dakota and Iowa to an existing pipeline in Patoka  IL 
Bakken Holdings   formed by Energy Transfer Partners and another pipeline operator Sunoco Logistics Partners L P    NYSE SXL     owns 75  of the pipeline  Downstream operator Phillips 66   NYSE PSX   controls the remaining 25  
Per a deal announced last month  Enbridge Energy Partners L P    NYSE EEP   and Marathon Petroleum Corp    NYSE MPC   are also likely to own a minority interest in the pipeline 
Bottom Line
This issue is unlikely to be resolved any time soon and a protracted legal battle is in the offing  Nonetheless  Braskem S A   BAK is an energy stock that warrants a look by virtue of its favorable Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and might be a suitable investment option  You can see

Dakota Access Pipeline Work Halted  Is It the Next Keystone 

On Friday  the Obama administration temporarily stopped work on the 1 172 mile Dakota Access Pipeline   DAPL    The joint announcement by three federal agencies   the U S  Department of Justice  the Department of the Interior and the Department of the Army   came shortly after a federal judge denied the Native American tribes  efforts to block the pipeline and ruled in favor of construction for the  3 7 billion project to continue 

Dakota Access Pipeline

Primarily owned by Dallas based pipeline operator Energy Transfer Partners L P      the project has been designed to shuttle over 470 000 barrels of crude daily from North Dakota s prolific Bakken formation through South Dakota and Iowa to an existing pipeline in Patoka  Illinois  From there  shippers could access markets and refineries across the Midwest and Gulf Coast 

Announced in 2014  DAPL was originally expected to start up later this year  The developer claimed that the project would contribute an estimated  156 million in sales and income taxes to state and local governments  apart from providing employment to 8 000 12 000 construction workers 

As of now  the conduit is 75  owned by a venture called Bakken Holdings   formed by Energy Transfer Partners and another pipeline operator Sunoco Logistics Partners L P      Downstream operator Phillips 66     controls the remaining 25  

As per a deal announced last month  Enbridge Energy Partners L P     and Marathon Petroleum Corp     would also go on to own a minority interest in DAPL 



Protests from Indigenous Activists

All along  a group of indigenous people  climate activists and landowners have been protesting the oil pipeline 

In particular  the Standing Rock Sioux   a tribe living close to the proposed pipeline   and environmentalists have argued that the project could pose a threat to the local water supply  The DAPL route crosses under a section of the nearby Missouri River  which is the major source of natural water supply for the tribe  Tribal leaders are skeptical that an accident or a spill could potentially contaminate farmland and drinking water for millions  They say the project would also destroy a sacred burial site 

The tribes and their representatives believe that they weren t adequately consulted on these issues and filed a federal lawsuit in July against the U S  Army Corps of Engineers 

Current Status

Friday s twin developments   a federal court rejection for an injunction and then the U S  government s decision to stop work   means that sponsors of the controversial DAPL would have to halt operations along a 40 mile stretch in North Dakota though activity on other sections of the pipeline could proceed 

DAPL  Another Keystone 

While Friday s move by federal agencies does not put an end to the pipeline s progress  it does pose a major question mark over its future  In fact  some environmental activists believe that the DAPL is going the way of doomed Keystone XL pipeline 

Late last year  pipeline operator TransCanada s contentious Canada to U S  Keystone XL pipeline was rejected by the U S  Senate amid another oil versus environment debate  The  5 4 billion project would have connected the oil sands of Alberta to the U S  Gulf  It was slated to run up to 1 179 miles and carry up to 830 000 barrels of oil per day 

What Next for DAPL 

Units of Energy Transfer Partners closed down around 4  in Friday s trading session after federal government s order to halt construction on a particular stretch  It s unclear as to what the Zacks Rank  3  Hold  operator would do to move the project forward if building on the current route is not allowed 

One option is to change the path of the pipeline but that entails huge cost overrun and difficulty  Moreover  such a move would require fresh applications approvals and can peg back the development by years 

The most affected by the turmoil would be the shippers   particularly those that already purchased crude  which they expected to move via the DAPL  Until a way out is found  shippers will have to be contend with costly railroads  or with the crowded existing pipelines  This  in turn  will hit oil producers

211418,432934,MPC,Peek Into Oil Refining Q3 Earnings On Oct 27  MPC  INT  ALJ,opinion,We are entering the heart of the Q3 earnings season  with more than 170 S P 500 members coming out with results this week Picture Emerging Thus FarWe now have Q3 results from 116 S P 500 members that combined account for account for 30  of the index s total market capitalization  Total earnings for these companies are up 3 3  from the same period last year on 1 8  higher revenues  with 80 2  positive earnings surprises and 62 9  beating revenue estimates   Data from the  report dated Oct 21  2016  Energy  A Drag but Not as Bad as ThoughtExpectedly  the  Energy  sector has been a big drag on the aggregate growth picture  For the few sector components on the S P 500 index that have reported Q3 results  total earnings are down 54 6  on 20 6  lower revenues But the Energy sector s results are so far better than expected  with 80 0  of companies beating earnings estimates   though undoubtedly aided by low expectations Oil Refining   Marketing  Operating Environment Remain DepressedTill recently  the downstream operators  oil refiners and marketers  benefited from crude s collapse  This is because the companies use oil as an input from which they derive refined petroleum products like gasoline  the prime transportation fuel in the U S  Hence  lower the oil price  higher will be their profits However  this also led to overproduction and stock build up that now threatens to bite the refiners  The companies have been struggling this year with the existing stocks of refined product inventories   gasoline and distillate   remaining at their maximum seasonal levels in at least 20 years despite healthy demand  Consequently  margins have narrowed forcing some of the operators to announce production cuts  postpone capital spending and retrench employees In fact  as per  from British oil major BP plc   NYSE BP    refining margin   the income from converting crude into gasoline and diesel   is set to drop 42  year over year to  11 60 per barrel Therefore  notwithstanding oil s still relatively low levels  the earnings picture for refiners look rather uncertain Stocks to Watch for Earnings on Oct 27Let s see what s in store for three such companies expected to come up with third quarter numbers on Thursday  Oct 27  Let s take a look at how things are shaping up at their end One of the largest domestic refiner with a combined crude oil processing capacity of approximately 1 7 million barrels per day through its portfolio of seven refineries  Marathon Petroleum Corp    NYSE MPC   is expected to report third quarter 2016 results before the opening bell  In the preceding three month period  the Findlay  OH based downstream operator delivered a positive earnings surprise of 12 63  owing to improved merchandise margins and contribution from new and existing pipeline But an earnings beat is uncertain for Marathon Petroleum this time around  This is because  as per our proven model  a stock needs to have both a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  and a positive  to beat on earnings  Please check our  that enables you to find stocks that are expected to come out with earnings surprises For the quarter to be reported  Marathon Petroleum has an Earnings ESP of 0 00   while it carries a Zacks Rank  3   Read more   Simultaneously  we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions MARATHON PETROL Price and EPS Surprise    World Fuel Services Corp    NYSE INT   is another oil refining company to report third quarter results tomorrow   this time after the market closes Headquartered in Miami  FL  World Fuel Services engages in marketing  sale and distribution of fuel products and associated services globally  The company reported better than expected numbers in the second quarter on the back of successful cost reduction efforts  Moreover  World Fuel Services has an excellent track of earnings surprises  having beaten estimates in each of the last four quarters at an average rate of 16 47  However  our proven model shows that an earnings beat is uncertain for World Fuel Services in the to be reported quarter as it has an earnings ESP of 0 00  and Zacks Rank  3  You can see  WORLD FUEL SVCS Price and EPS Surprise    Finally  we have independent refiner and petroleum products marketer Alon USA Energy Inc    NYSE ALJ   coming up with third quarter numbers tomorrow after market close The company is on a bit of a slippery surface though  having missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last three reports Our model indicates that Alon USA is unlikely to beat on earnings this time also  This is because it is a Zacks Rank  3 stock and has an Earnings ESP of 0 00  ALON USA ENERGY Price and EPS Surprise    Zacks  Best Investment Ideas for Long Term ProfitToday you can

211419,432935,MPC,Lower Margins Pull Down Marathon Petroleum  MPC  Q3 Earnings,opinion,"Ohio based independent oil refiner and marketer Marathon Petroleum Corp    NYSE MPC   reported weaker than expected third quarter earnings due to lower margins  The company reported earnings per share  excluding charges associated with the Sandpiper Pipeline project  of 58 cents  lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 78 cents 
The bottom line also slumped from the year ago period profit of  1 76 
Marathon Petroleum posted revenues of  16 460 million  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  16 876 6 million  Moreover  revenues fell 12  on a year over year basis 

Segmental Performance
Refining   Marketing  The unit   which is the main contributor to Marathon Petroleum earnings   earned just  306 million compared with  1 434 million in the year ago quarter  The deterioration reflects lower gross margin on the back of narrower crack spreads 
Total refined product sales volumes were 2 316 thousand barrels per day  mbpd   lower than 2 359 mbpd in the year ago quarter  However  throughput improved from 1 912 mbpd in the year ago quarter to 1 926 mbpd 
Speedway  Income from the Speedway retail stations totaled  209 million  14  lower the  243 million earned in the year ago period  Declining margins from light products in addition to higher depreciation  hampered the results  These were partly offset by higher
merchandise margin and light product sales volume 
Midstream  This unit includes Marathon Petroleum s interest in MPLX L P    NYSE MPLX    a publicly traded master limited partnership that owns  operates  develops and acquires pipelines and other midstream assets

211481,432997,MPC,Insider Buying Key To Beating Oil Crash ,opinion,"Oil and energy stocks are getting creamed  Alternative energy shares are faring no better  It s a wholesale rout 
As oil prices crash through  65 per barrel   levels not seen in years   gasoline prices are dropping fast  Most people are rejoicing and thanking their lucky stars that they re saving so much money at the pump 
But for those of us in the energy patch  it s not a pretty moment  And that s precisely why  as an energy investor  you need to buck up and look for opportunity 
This is the time to stay focused and watch what the energy companies are up to 
By doing that  I have discovered the insiders  secret that might actually make you happy about the price of oil 
Taking Stock
Unless you re sitting on really crappy stocks  own shares on margin  or had the misfortune of investing in an oil and gas play at much higher levels through a  deal   you have little to worry about besides paper losses  really 
Oil and gas aren t renewable  obviously  And when prices fall  they get used up even faster  This crash in prices will stimulate both demand and non oil dependent economies  which make up most of the world 
At a time when most global economies are barely on life support or just coming out of recessions  this news couldn t be better  It s like getting a super stimulus without having to go into debt to do it 
That s the long term picture  The short term picture  on the other hand  is pretty ugly  and will stay that way for quite a few months 
Thus you have a couple of choices  1  Stay put and do nothing but stare at your portfolio  or 2  you can look at this as a major opportunity to wade into the market 
We re choosing the latter  Here s why 
Following the Insiders
Some savvy investors may be seeing the similarities between the crash in gold prices a couple of years ago and this current crash in oil prices 
But there s a huge difference 
You see  gold isn t a consumable asset like energy  It s bought and stored or transferred into jewelry  It also serves as a supply of wealth  It s not needed for an economy to function  like energy  Oil and gas get used and must be replenished  all the time 
Energy insiders see this difference 
Since the crash in oil prices  major and minor energy companies  a k a  insiders  are stepping up to the plate and buying back their own shares  Remember  insiders rarely buy unless they feel there is a strong profit motive 
This did not happen in the precious metals space 
In fact  I can only think of three instances in the past three years when an insider at a major mining company has stepped up to the plate  Yet  over the past month alone  a ton of insiders have bought into energy shares  That s because they see this as a long term opportunity to buy cheap in an industry that s sure to improve 
Here s a roster of some of the companies that have seen insider buying   most of which occurred in the past couple of weeks 
Chesapeake Energy  NYSE CHK 
Continental Resources  NYSE CLR 
Comstock Resources  NYSE CRK 
Transocean  NYSE RIG 
Energy XXI  NASDAQ EXXI 
Vivint Solar  VSLR 
C J Energy Services  NYSE CJES 
Peabody Energy  NYSE BTU 
Atlas Energy  NYSE ATLS 
Jones Energy  NYSE JONE 
Clayton Williams Energy  NYSE CWEI 
Marathon Petroleum  NYSE MPC 
Based on the current insider action  I believe these companies will reward shareholders in the future 
And these are just some of the significant buys in terms of size or notable companies  There are many  many more 
In this case  unlike the precious metals markets  the insiders are betting that the downturn in prices won t be long lived 
You may want to consider joining them if you have a longer term perspective 
And  the chase  continues

211491,433007,MPC,Dollar Restraint While S P 500 Collapses  What Does It Mean ,opinion,Dollar Restraint While S P 500 Collapses   What Does it Mean  After four years of consistent speculative escalation behind  risky  assets like the S P 500  is faith in stimulus finally starting to crumble  If so  the bubble behind equity and other speculative assets presents a serious opportunity for safe havens like the US dollar  Typically on the opposite ends of the spectrum  the equity and FX market benchmarks have instead run on similar paths through 2013   leading many to believe that one or both had changed their fundamental bearings  Yet  this unusual relationship does not reflect a role change for either  simply a lack of influence through that particular aspect   risk on   risk off  Under that logic  the extremely threatening move that the S P 500 made this past session   a drop back to its 50 day moving average  seven month trend floor and near 5 percent retracement threshold to 1 600   should inspire the greenback to revive its role as ultimate safe haven  That said  the Dow Jones FXCM Dollar Index  USDollar  was little changed this past session having actually slipped 0 1 percent  This tells us that we are the verge of a seismic change  but we aren t there yet  There is a technical  market condition and fundamental view of why the critical rebalancing of sentiment has yet to be made by the market  For the highly visible S P 500  the painful slump has taken us to the brink  trendline  moving average  retracement milestone  but not officially broken support  Through market conditions  we have yet to see all those assets with either a definable  risky  or  haven  quality  nearly all liquid securities   fall back into the singular line of reasoning  Fundamentals is the aspect where we can best derive the disconnect and establish a time frame for when it will present itself  If the masses really wanted a reason to fall into line with risk trends  there is plenty to rationalize it  market yields are just off record lows  leverage usage is at a record high  participation is at a 15 year low  financial futures   asset prices are at a record highs  etc  However  there is a well established trend and high level of confidence in the Fed and central banks to keep volatility under wraps  And  while sentiment can often generate its own momentum once engaged  it may need a push to initiate the turn   An  overvalued market  may simply be too vague to encourage many investors to abandon the market   unless a deep technical correction presents significant enough losses  The most effective means of breaking the speculative fever is to remove the infinite support   taper stimulus  This past session there was some modest speculation on the subject as the ISM service sector report  the United States  largest sector  offset the manufacturing slump with a firm read that tempers the need for external support  While notable  this data is too far removed from the taper debate to provoke commitment  Friday s NFP report is targeted  Could the market wait for the jobs report  Perhaps the Fed meet   Euro at Risk of Breakout as ECB Policy Decision Approaches EUR USD has worked its way into an exceptionally tight trading range just before heavy event risk  The probability of a breakout is exceptionally high  In the upcoming session  11 45 GMT specifically   the European Central Bank  ECB  will announce the most recent round of monetary policy  The consensus heading into the event is that that the group will leave the benchmark and deposit rates unchanged while all additional  exceptional policy moves are similarly left off the agenda  For those that remember the last meeting  where they cut rates   it is reasonable to be ready for the  unexpected   Changing the rate is ineffectual for long term euro influence and financial recovery  To truly hit both planes  they would need to introduce something akin to an open ended and active stimulus program  They have the OMT  but it isn t used until a full blown crisis is upon us  The probability is low  but there has been talk of SMEs  ABS quality assessments and structural recession risk   Japanese Yen Suffering the Tension Between Stimulus and Sentiment The financial situation in Japan is set to only grow more   not less   complicated  In an effort to beat deflation  the BoJ and government are inadvertently eroding real rates of return for a market that is heavily invested in local assets  Add to that the inherent battle that the authorities have to wage against risk trends  A collapse in sentiment will spur a carry trade unwind on yen crosses with record low yield differentials that subsequently opposes exchange rate progress  And  then there is the growing currency war discontent  Destined for trouble   British Pound  The Bank of England Has a Serious Chance to Surprise  Though Will NotThere is even less credibility given to the Bank of England s capacity to change monetary policy than its Euro area counterpart   and for good reason  The Monetary Policy Committee  MPC  has held both rates and stimulus unchanged for months with a recent minority calling for more gilts purchases falling well short of the necessary vote  This particular meet is Governor Mervyn King s last at the helm  and it would be ungentlemanly to shock the system before Marc Carney steps in  However  we should always be open to the unexpected   Australian Dollar Extends Plunge  AUDUSD Down Over 1 000 Pips from April 11 AUD USD has made a provocative move below 0 9550 support at that dates back to October 2010   and that isn t the only Aussie dollar based cross that is showing the currency suffering  A few other statistics to truly appreciate the scope of this move  this is the fifth consecutive week of decline  four other instances in the past decade and no six straight weeks  and the two month loss for AUD USD is now over 1 100 pips   Canadian Dollar Takes in Business Sentiment  New BoC Governor Speech There is some notable event risk on the regular docket for the Canadian dollar tomorrow  but it is unlikely to truly generate volatility  The Ivey PMI is a business activity report that gives a good growth view of an important sector  The real point of interest is the first formal speech for Stephen Poloz as the new head of the Bank of Canada  Will he keep the same tightening mindset as his predecessor ,2013-06-06,Dailyfx,https://www.investing.com/analysis/dollar-restraint-while-s-p-500-collapses:-what-does-it-mean-170071,170071
211492,433008,MPC,Australian Dollar Advances A Second Day As China Funding Crisis Eases,opinion,Dollar Steadies Even as S P 500 Rebounds  Data Leading to Taper  Both the Dow Jones FXCM Dollar Index  USDollar  and S P 500 closed the day higher Tuesday  This counter fundamental  positive correlation tells us something very important  that the  risk aversion  drive that followed the Federal Reserve s Taper warning is losing its potency  If risk aversion were truly intensifying  an unwinding of the front run the Fed trades would evolve into a deleveraging of the exposure that was founded on the assumption of boundless support by the central bank  Yet  there is not enough momentum behind this fear to keep US equities   which are arguably the most stubborn benefactor of the  more hazard    shedding the uncommitted investors as the benchmarks pull back from record highs  This hesitance should not be taken to mean that the danger of a full scale bear market has been avoided however  Leverage  measured on the NYSE  is at record highs and participation  S P 500 futures open interest  at 15 year lows   Australian Dollar Advances a Second Day as China Funding Crisis Eases Funding pressure in the Chinese markets is a significant threat to financial stability globally  but it is especially troublesome for the Aussie dollar which is exposed through its direct trade exposure as well as its position as the major s top  investment  currency  The story out of China has developed around a few Chinese banks essentially defaulting on loans due to a severe shortage of short term funding  This issue has evolved out of regulators cracking down on particular venues for financial institutions to continue to lend out short term credit at excessive rates in hopes of trying to curb a lending bubble in the economy  The People s Bank of China  PBoC  voiced confidence that funding risks would be met individually but they wouldn t lax rules  Shibor lending rates have eased today  and the relief offers further Aussie reprieve   Japanese Yen  Asia Market Volatility Remains  Stirs Yen Crosses The Tokyo session is proving to be the more active period for swing traders  While the Nikkei 225 started Wednesday s session following in the wake of the US equity market s climb  the Japanese benchmark suffered a severe jolt as trading wore on  The more than 300 point intraday plunge from the stock index may be technically smaller than the near 450 poing tumble the previous session  but it still represents serious volatility issues for the region  And  volatility begets volatility  If the market s remain this reactive  the proper catalyst to align investors  concerns can generate a breakout to undermine the past few weeks  worth of congestion  A bearish break for shares would be a direct spark for yen buying  spark for yen crosses to drop  as it would rouse risk aversion that leads to carry trade deleveraging  Yet  general activity itself   regardless of direction   is also a problem for Asian markets as it volatility is elementally a measure of  risk    Canadian Dollar the Most Oversold Currency Short Term Over the past few months  the Australian dollar may have shed more value than any other major currency  but more immediate comparison performance of the past two weeks shows a different scale  Through that period  the FX market s worst performer has been the Canadian dollar  While the USDCAD s 3 2 percent advance is most remarkable  the rest of its pairings have delivered the loonie between 1 7 and 1 3 percent in losses  Through that same period  the Canadian data has held up relatively well  Capital inflations  home sales  retail sales and inflation have improved  Furthermore  we have seen net speculative short interest on the Canadian currency via futures positioning on the COT drop 65 percent from a six year low set two months ago  An eight day straight advance in USDCAD  the longest since 2005  looks stretched   Swiss Franc  SNB s Zurbruegg EURCHF Cap Necessary  Risks Can t be Hedged EURCHF hasn t returned to the Swiss National Bank s  SNB  imposed 1 2000 floor in nine months  However  that doesn t seem reason enough for the policy authority to lift its backstop on the critical pairing  Governing Council member Fritz Zurbruegg remarked this past session that the barrier is especially necessary considering the stability of the Euro region is once again at risk  Speaking to regional bankers  group  Zurbruegg also made note that the SNB s reserve levels are a result of FX exposure accumulated through monetary policy  Furthermore  he noted that the central bank couldn t hedge itself of these risks and volatility via the euro or dollar was felt immediately by the group  This may be obvious  but it breaks from the unflappable confidence we expect from central bankers  Is that recognition of the possibility of failure   British Pound Traders Take Note of King s Warning that Carney Limited When Bank of England Governor Mervyn King testified before the Treasury Committee for the last time as the leader of the central bank  he said something sterling traders consider  In a humorous quip  King suggested that while his replacement may be more persuasive than he is  Marc Carney would not likely gain more traction than his predecessor  Each person has one vote under the current regime at the Monetary Policy Committee  MPC   and King has been outvoted in his call for stimulus in the past three policy meetings 3 to 6  The market would do well to remember that Carney can only accomplish so much in his new position without the support of the Committee  Speculation that the BoE will materially upgrade its stimulus efforts to match that of the BoJ  Fed or even ECB has added material weight to the pound  We will see if this reality clears up slowly or all at once on July 4 when Carney casts his first vote  Meanwhile  we should read through the details on the upcoming BoE Financial Stability report  Last week it was suggested that there is a  26 billion hole in bank financing   Gold Extends its Plunge to Fresh Multi Year Lows Overnight Bulls were making a feigned attempt to keep gold above the  1 275 level following last week s FOMC route  That line in the sand was crossed this morning as the precious metal dropped another 2 plus percent through Asia session trading  The stability of the US dollar through the past session   despite the firming of the US equity markets and thereby sentiment   was one aspect of erosion for the  alternative store of wealth  asset  Yet the real trigger for fresh lows for the metal seems to be the reduced tension in the Chinese funding markets  Without a material and pressing financial stability threat  the task of reviving the fundamental strength of a last resort and heavily pummeled asset like gold is even further out of reach  Meanwhile  volume behind the gold selling may be backing off  but the CBOE s gold volatility index is still above 25 percent  before April s market collapse it averaged around 13 percent  and ETF holdings hit yet another multi year low  In fact  the 1 1 percent drop in the exposure was the second biggest in 22 months and ushered in a fresh 3 year low 66 46 million ounces

211518,433034,MPC, MPC To Look Beyond Above Target Inflation  ,opinion,We expect the Bank of England  BoE  to remain on hold at Thursday s Monetary Policy Committee  MPC  meeting  13 00 CET  Since the February minutes revealed three members voting for an additional GBP25bn of asset purchases  speculations have surfaced about the majority of the MPC shifting towards restarting the QE programme at this meeting  Comments on a Bank Rate cut have also sparked a debate about the effectiveness of e g  negative rates While acknowledging the existence of the case for more QE with the data coming out of the UK and the eurozone underlining a struggle in the recovery  we do not see the majority of the MPC shifting at this meeting  Nor do we think a Bank Rate cut is the most likely policy change  the risks with the current aggressive pricing of the SONIA curve are skewed for the curve to steepen MPC will look beyond above target inflation  Since July 2012  MPC policies have been unchanged with the last gilt bought in the Asset Purchase Facility  APF  in November  Together with the publication of the unchanged policy decision at the last meeting  the MPC sent out a statement communicating its view of the appropriate policy response  which can be narrowed down to two points   1  The MPC thinks it is appropriate to look through the temporary  albeit protracted  period of above target inflation  The forecasts from the Inflation Report show that the CPI is likely to stay above target until Q4 15   2  The MPC stands ready to provide additional monetary stimulus if warranted by the outlook for growth and inflation   The latter point has been a mantra for most of the second half of 2012  but the newest MPC forecast of inflation above target until Q4 15  has forced the MPC to take a stand on whether it would attempt to bring inflation back sooner by removing the current policy stimulus faster than markets anticipate  It has clearly chosen not to   February Minutes surprised with Governor Mervyn King as a minority voter  While the unchanged policy decisions at the last MPC meeting were widely expected  it came as a surprise that three members voted for an additional GBP25bn of asset purchases  Governor Mervyn King and Executive Director Paul Fisher both joined Prof  David Miles in preferring to increase the size of the APF  David Miles has been a proponent for increasing the APF since November 2012  and has been a minority voter for four meetings now To Read the Entire Report Please Click on the pdf File Below ,2013-03-06,Danske Markets,https://www.investing.com/analysis/mpc-to-look-beyond-above-target-inflation-157943,157943
211519,433035,MPC,Dollar Is As Strong As EUR USD  USD JPY Says It Is,opinion,Dollar is as Strong as EUR USD  USD JPY Says it Is A growing voice of support is being made for the dollar as an investment currency on the rise  While this may be the case months down the line  for now  the dollar s strength is a product of the euro and yen s weakness  The short fall for the greenback is its exceptionally low benchmark yield that will be held at basement levels by the Fed until unemployment is seen back at 6 5 percent and   or inflation crests 2 5 percent  Furthermore  market based rates   based on low risk Treasury and Libor   are also at lows and can drop further with the central bank s aggressive stimulus program  This would be the issue that would hold the dollar back if there were indeed a strong drive behind risk and carry trade appetite  On that point  global yields   rates are just off record lows and investor participation  measured in volume and open interest  shows little interest in chasing such thin returns when stimulus targeted assets are the only position showing capital gains  What does this mean  Speculation that the dollar will eventually enjoy higher rates than counterparts and local assets could outperform due to abundant stimulus is premature  There are two things that can meaningfully drive the dollar materially higher in the near term  strong risk aversion that short circuits investors  appetite for yield and sends them fleeing to the safety of US markets  or the greenback s counterparts lose significant fundamental ground of their own  The Dow Jones Industrial Average nudged out a second record consecutive high this past session  which some accept as evidence that the greenback is rising alongside risk appetite  However  looking at something like the Risk Reward Index  we find sentiment is not as robust as equity indexes suggest  Instead  the side by side advance between stocks and the Dow Jones FXCM Dollar Index  USDollar  is sustained by acute dollar strength against the Euro  Japanese yen and British pound  And  those are moves that more the responsibility of the counter currency rather than the benchmark dollar  Euro  Laying out the Scenarios for EUR USD  EURJPY on ECB Of the heavy round of event risk through Thursday s session  the European Central Bank  ECB  rate decision   The shared currency has dropped this past month against the dollar and other major counterparts as the ongoing recession starts to overlap with a return of financial instability  The latest bout of trouble for Europe s debt borne crisis is Italy s election   which now finds Democratic Party leader Bersani threatening to abandon the deficit cutting agenda in order to win a workable government  If stability starts to breakdown in the region  there is little that can be done through the regular political channels to forestall the return to crisis  One of the few variables  the ECB  Heading into the event  there is considerable evidence in the euro s performance to suggest that the market has positioned for an expected softening of the central bank s policy bearing  Though the Open Market Transactions  OMT  program is a standing threat of action  it lacks action to offset the receding balance sheet on LTRO repayments   which reduces banks  access to liquidity and boosts market rates  The most bearish scenario for the euro would be a rate cut as it lowers return for the currency and is unlikely to support financial stability should conditions continue to deteriorate  The more prolific  bearish move by the ECB would be to introduce a stimulus program that is intended to build with time   competing with the Fed and the BoJ  Joining the  open ended  program would present a mounting weight as the balance sheet bloats  Most likely and least effective for volatility would be simple guidance that offered vague threats of chance in the near future  And  of course  the ECB s refusal to adopt any additional stimulus policy would present a euro relief rally  British Pound  GBP USD His New Multi Year Low Before BoEWhile the euro has room to recover should the ECB not meet the market s expectations for easing  the British pound has been forced to a far greater extreme on clear assumptions of stimulus  We can point to the more than 1300 pip drop in the GBPUSD over the past few months as evidence that the market believes the Bank of England  BoE  will play catch up to its global counterparts via stimulus  but we can look at more fundamental elements as well  We have seen the 10 year Gilt  government bond  yield drop as much as 18 percent over the span of a few weeks while overnight index swaps are pricing in 19 bps of easing over the coming 12 months  It is unlikely that the BoE cutsrates as it would be ineffective in spurring growth   though if it does happen  it could one of the few sparks that keeps the sterling diving  Instead  the more likely outcome from an expanded stimulus effort from the Monetary Policy Committee  MPC  is an increase in thebond purchasing program  Of course  the market is priced for much more than the standard 25 billion pound clip of yore  A fixed   small  stimulus move could spark a recovery  To really spur the pound s rally though  no change in policy and impotent vows for more would likely see a tremendous retracement  Japanese Yen Slow Depreciation Will Continue Unless This Happens  The Bank of Japan maintained its steady course   as expected   this morning  This was the last policy meeting to be helmed by outgoing Governor Shirawaka  and he didn t want to rock the boat  Now  we move on to a new regime  However  the next BoJ meeting isn t until April 4  In the meantime  all we have is threatens by the new central bankers  We have seen a modest advance in yen crosses on the heightened jawboning  but we have lacked for a full blown return to rally  This is a steady trend  unless risk appetite collapses and takes carry with it  Canadian Dollar as Bank of Canada Moves Further Away from Rate Hike There was considerable opportunity for the Bank of Canada to spark volatility this past session as the fundamentally inclined FX traders were weighing the possibility that the group would abandon its quest for an eventual rate hike  This is no doubt a contributing factor to the USDCAD s advance through recent weeks  However  when the statement hit the wires  Governor Carney maintained that  higher rates  would likely be needed after a  pause   Yet  the language would still  subtly eased the hawkish rhetoric   enough to satisfy to justify the loonie s recent decline ,2013-03-07,Dailyfx,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/dollar-is-as-strong-as-eur-usd,-usd-jpy-says-it-is-158060",158060
211520,433036,MPC,Dollar Outlook Tarnished By ECB  NFPs Offers A Risk Reprieve,opinion,Dollar Outlook Tarnished by ECB  NFPs Offers a Risk Reprieve The Dow Jones FXCM Dollar Index  USDollar  retreated from its two and a half year high  but the slip failed once again to turn the persistent bull trend of the past months  However  the fundamental backdrop speaks to a deterioration in the greenback s potential forward momentum  while the label of  over extended  is looking more and more appropriate for the benchmark s lofty heights  Doubt arises via multiple angles for the dollar   most notably through stimulus  Amongst the world s largest central banks  the Federal Reserve is by far the most liberal group when it comes to supporting its system  The  85 billion per month stimulus regime the Fed has maintained since the beginning of the year  upgraded from the  45 billion per month mortgage backed securities and  40 billion Treasuries recycling  is expected to remain in place through the end of the year  Setting that effort in an even deeper relief  we learned this past session that the ECB would allow its own balance sheet to shrink and the BoE was holding its small holdings steady  more on that below    We have seen periods in the past where the Federal Reserve and Treasury s stimulus efforts were overlooked by the market and demand for the dollar and dollar denominated assets continued to outperform its counterparts  However  that strength was supported by a secondary influence   risk aversion  Where policy easing leaves the market awash in dollars  global fear ensures there is plenty of demand for the safe haven to mop up the supply  And  while there is reason to be skeptical  it is hard to deny that speculators still have their appetite  With the Dow Jones Industrial Average hitting record highs and the VIX hovering just above a five year low  that flight to quality isn t a factor  So  excessive stimulus and limited risk paints a troubling picture for a safe haven at multi year highs  On the other hand  it is easy enough to offer the dollar another strong thrust forward   through a strong risk aversion move  Optimism can decay to fear easily enough in a market based on external support  but a catalyst is the best way to make the transition  Perhaps the upcoming NFPs can offer a spark   Euro Rallies Sharply after ECB Scoffs at Stimulus Expectations The European Central Bank  ECB  has solidified the euro s very unique position amongst the major currencies  With the policy authority s decision to keep thing status quo this past session  Europe sports one of the very few economies actually drawing stimulus out of the system and seeing its market rates rise because of it  That is a significant appeal to FX traders that are looking for higher yields   and more importantly a rising yield which offers further capital gains   and the alternatives are either holding rates extremely low  like the Fed  or readying to ramp their efforts even further  like the BoJ   Heading into the group s meeting  there was a definite expectation that ECB President Mario Draghi and crew would be more sympathetic to the ongoing recession and growing fiscal threat found in developments like the complicated Italian election  The statement and President s Q A revealed that discussion of a cut was easily overruled and even the concerns of the euro s influence were tempered  As long as competitive stimulus  currency manipulation  is the primary concern   and risk trends are stable   the euro is in a strong position  Of course  ignoring the region s future growth and financial risks could come back to bite the ECB and euro later on   British Pound Shows Mixed Reaction to Mum BoE  Don t Look AwayAs with the ECB policy gathering  there was considerable speculation heading into the Bank of England rate decision that the Monetary Policy Committee  MPC  would move to offer further stimulus  At the previous BoE meeting  it was revealed that Governor Mervyn King and two other MPC members called for an increase to the bond purchase program but were overruled by the majority  Yet  despite the risk of a triple dip recession  the government s vow to keep to austerity and Europe s withdrawal of support  the central bank passed up on the opportunity to ease  What is most surprising about this event though is that the sterling didn t recover lost ground  Expectations can hold for only so long   Japanese Yen  Now on to an Era of Unprecedented BoJ Stimulus Most of the focus Thursday was on the ECB and BoE policy decisions  but the Bank of Japan  BoJ  had a meeting of its own  As the last official gathering headed by Governor Masaaki Shirakawa   and given his clear disdain for government pressures   it was the running consensus that the 101 trillion yen stimulus effort would be left untouched and no additional easing would be introduced before the new regime was installed  That expectation was well founded  It is interesting to note  however  that two members   Shirai and Miyao   both voted for more easing at meeting  Considering nominees Kuroda  Governor   Nakaso and Iwata  Deputy Governors  are easing bound  that s spells a majority in April   Canadian Dollar Ready for Volatility on Employment Data Trends are hard to come by in the FX market  but volatility can be found with the right fuel source and ignition  Congestion for USD CAD after a strong climb to multi month highs sets the scene for the combination of the US nonfarm payrolls  NFP  and Canadian labor data for February  The US data has offered few misses serious enough to stock risk aversion  so the most likely outcome is to support or at least leave the loonie to define the reaction  The Canadian jobless rate is seen ticking up and a 8 000 net increase in jobs sets the bar relatively low   Swiss Franc  SNB May not be Buying More Euros  but It Isn t Selling We know that the Swiss National Bank  SNB  hasn t had to defend its 1 2000 defined  EUR CHF floor for a number of months thanks to the perceived reduced Euro area tail risks  However  the central bank clearly thinks that fear can quickly return  Aside from warnings about reinforcing stimulus  we also find they have refused to unwind their Forex reserves for a fifth month   afraid of driving the franc higher

211521,433037,MPC,Dollar Eases Off Multi Year High  S P 500 Marches Higher,opinion,Dollar Eases Off Multi Year High as S P 500 Marches Higher The dollar opened with some pep Monday   enough to post a fresh  intraday two and a half year high   but the threshold for bullish momentum is significantly more difficult to achieve  For the Dow Jones FXCM Dollar Index  USDollar   the 520 pip or 5 2 percent advance since the beginning of the year has contradicted a very prominent fundamental theme   a rise in risk appetite trends  The sustenance of this unusual correlation has been made possible by a questionable level of conviction behind the sentiment push as well as well timed troubles for the benchmark s most liquid counterparts  That fortunate combination of factors can only last for so long however  The glow from the four year low unemployment rate   specifically its marginal implication for an early withdrawal of stimulus in the second half of the year   from this past Friday has no doubt worn off  So  we move on the next round of event risk  On the docket  the House Budget Committee s 2014 budget proposal is due in the upcoming session  but its supposed 10 year return to a balanced budget seems ambitious  Meanwhile  always keep an eye on risk trends   Euro Steady After Italy Downgrade  Talk of German Voter Discontent Expectations were set high for the euro heading into the open of the new trading week  Credit rating agency Fitch s downgrade of Italy crossed the wires after most European traders were offline Friday  meaning this was the first opportunity for the new round of regional financial pressure to play through speculators  assessments  Yet  the euro s reaction to the Italian downgrade  to BBB  with a  Negative  outlook  was much like the pound s reaction to Moody s downgrade of the United Kingdom just two weeks before   absent  EUR USD and EUR JPY  the two most liquid pairings for the yen  were both higher through the opening session  Furthermore  a survey released in a German magazine that reported 29 percent of respondents said they would vote for a party that was anti Euro in the September election was similar rendered impotent  In the absence of these fears  we could always fall back on the fact that the ECB is actually reducing its balance sheet   a serious euro booster   but EURUSD instead remains range bound between 1 3125 and 1 2965  Perhaps risk trends or the EU meeting later this week can tip the scales   Japanese Yen Decline Restrained Despite Intensified Stimulus ExpectationsThe Japanese yen dropped across the board Monday  and continues to do so this morning  However  the pace with which the selling pressure was expressed was far more reserved than we would imagine given the intensity of speculation surrounding yen traders  favorite topic  stimulus  We have been moving from rumor to rumor  first sustaining the yen crosses  climb and then simply trying to hold back a reversal  The game now is to upgrade the

derivatives  longer dated debt and more risk asset purchases were all possible under his watch  But none of this is particularly new  What was novel was speculation emanating from a Nikkei report that suggested Kuroda may hold a meeting before the official April 4 meeting to implement a stimulus upgrade  Time and belief are running thin   British Pound to Find Guidance in Data  Real Interest in BoE s Plans A new week opens to a familiar trend  the sterling under pressure across the board  The only major pairing that the pound was able to gain traction with Monday was in GBP JPY   hardly a pair for fundamental inspection of anything but the yen  Once again  the market s open fears of a Bank of England that is prepared to leverage its stimulus efforts through the proximate future seems to be the culprit for speculative interests  Of course  unless the Monetary Policy Committee  MPC  under Governor King s guidance moves to adopt something more than a 25 billion pound increase in stimulus in the near future  it will be a long wait until July to see what income Mark Carney will adopt  Our interest should turn to the immediate future  On the economic docket  we have scheduled updates on

which slipped both on current and forecast measures  Coupled with the weekend release of the Chinese manufacturing  retail sales and funding data  this seems a credible concern for regional investors  That said  this is limited risk against a rising potential for return  The most hawkish outlook for the RBA  pricing in only 18 bp of easing  since August 2011 and a 10 month high 3 62 percent 10 year

211522,433038,MPC,BoJ Has To Leverage Stimulus Or Face Yen Reversal,opinion,Dollar Traders More Reactive To S P 500  NFPs Or BoJ  Despite the constant expansion of the Fed s balance sheet and a fresh record high from the risky benchmark S P 500  the dollar managed to close the week in the green  This was a  passive  advance  however  just as the equities move was founded on a deficient fundamental backing   which was manifest in the tepid volume levels  Yet  where traders had to scrounge for a driver the past week  the greenback will be overwhelmed for catalysts moving forward  And  considering the positioning of the greenback against its most liquid counterparts  a dedicated driver is needed  From the Dow Jones FXCM Dollar Index  the 10 463 close on Friday marks the sixth consecutive monthly advance for the benchmark    the longest run on record  We see this same strength in EUR USD s 6 5 percent rally the past two months  GBP USD s nearly 10 percent tumble since the year open and USD JPY s 25 percent rally in the past six months   After an exceptional run to multi month highs  the stress for a correction will be high    especially if risk positioning continues to climb and slowly leach capital from U S  assets that are undercut by yields that have been dehydrated by stimulus  Looking ahead  the most recognizable catalyst is Friday s nonfarm payrolls  NFPS   The February employment figures are indeed important as they will eventually turn the tide on QE3  Yet  this end of week release is less pressing after the past week s FOMC hold  The market will judge the dollar on its stimulus  but they will do so by way of comparison to other central banks  efforts  The Bank of Japan  BoJ   Bank of England  BoE  and European Central Bank  ECB  are all looking at some degree

point  expectations have far outpaced actual policy    a realization that has seen USD JPY and other yen crosses level off over the past few months  The fact that the yen hasn t extended its aggressive decline over the past two months despite the change of leadership at the BoJ and the vague vows made by new Governor Kuroda and his Deputy Governors tells us that the bar is set very high   For the past five years as global central banks have expanded their stimulus programs in order to fend off liquidity crises  financial disarray and recession  we have seen a strong  inverse correlation between the size of the support program and the currency s strength  This connection is what makes the yen s fundamental discrepancy so evident  USD JPY rallied as much as another 12 percent since the beginning of the year even as the Fed bought  85 billion in assets a month and the BoJ held steady  If the central bank does not at least move forward its  13 trillion per month program to May as bulls  expectation  the yen crosses could be set for an abrupt correction   British Pound Ready To Run If Bank Of England Holds Steady The sterling BoE fundamental scheme is like a scaled down version of the yen BoJ setup  Since the beginning of the year  GBP USD has tumbled over 1 300 pips from 1 6400 on the growing expectation that the Monetary Policy Committee  MPC  will ramp up its stimulus program to compete with the Fed s QE 3 laden and ECB s LTRO padded regimes  There is certainly argument to be made with Marc Carney coming onboard in July and Chancellor Osborne recently offering a remit  greater allowances to deviate from CPI   but this may just be community stimulus expectation  There was no change to the vote in the minutes at the last meeting  What if the BoE is mum despite its allowances   Euro Crisis Shifts To Italy  Slovenia  ECB And Systemic IssuesCyprus can still cause problems for the broader euro zone  but the imminent risk is far reduced from where has been over the past two weeks  However  that doesn t mean the Euro is looking at an immediate return to bullish form  Systemic fears have been stirred and there are new threats within view  Greece and Spain are lingering threats under the new  bank levy  option  which investors will try to escape at any sign of risk   but we also have more active threats  We ll find a financial outlook for Slovenia and Italy will have to decide a government path next week   Australian Dollar At The End Of Its Rate Cut Regime  RBA on Tap There are four major central bank rate decisions scheduled for the coming week  and the Reserve Bank of Australia s  RBA  meeting carries the least  short term market moving potential  Yet  it will still be critical for shaping the Aussie dollar s bearings  In the past six months  we have seen the 12 month rate forecast price in nearly 5  25 bp rate cuts to serious debate over whether there will be even one  The language from Governor Stevens and crew hasn t shifted much  But given the market s bearings  if he were to shift  it would make the currency a resilient carry option   Canadian Dollar Gaining Central Bank Favor  Ready for Jobs Volatility Last year the IMF noted that it was examining whether the Canadian  and Aussie  dollar would be giving the distinction of  reserve currency   This potential honor comes as central banks increase their holdings of the loonie  and the IMF s quarterly report shows that share continues to grow  Meanwhile  volatility traders will be watching the March employment figures Friday  But  beware of the cross

211532,433048,MPC,MNB s Doves Remain In Charge ,opinion,The Hungarian central bank  MNB  is broadly expected to continue its easing cycle with yet another 25bp rate cut  which should bring the key policy rate to 5 75  at next week s Monetary Policy Council  MPC  meeting  It seems apparent that the doves on the MPC are more or less in full control of monetary policy  Consequently  we expect the MNB to continue the easing of monetary policy in coming months despite inflation being well above the level of the MNB s official target of 3  CNB getting ready to take action on the korunaAt the latest monetary policy setting meeting of the Czech central bank s  CNB   the board decided to cut the key policy rate to a technical zero of 0 05   The CNB is  therefore  now effectively stuck at the Zero Lower Bound and further monetary easing through interest rate cuts is simply not possible  As a consequence  the CNB needs to utilise other monetary policy tools if it needs to ease monetary policy The most obvious instrument is to use the exchange rate to ease monetary policy  The CNB has been very reluctant about moving in that direction but the reluctance has been costly and  in our view  the CNB s lack of action no doubt strongly contributed to the further downturn in the Czech economy recently witnessed Lower inflation and slower growth to trigger Turkish rate cutNext week  the Turkish central bank  TCMB  will announce its key policy rate in connection with the meeting of the TCMB s Monetary Policy Committee  MPC   Turkish macroeconomic data has certainly not been encouraging recently  It is very clear that the Turkish economy is continuing to slow down and inflation is inching further down towards the TCMB s 5  inflation target  This is opening the door for rate cuts and we   in line with consensus   expect the TCMB to cut its key policy rate by 25bp to 5 50  next week To Read the Entire Report Please Click on the pdf File Below ,2012-12-14,Danske Markets,https://www.investing.com/analysis/mnb's-doves-remain-in-charge-147702,147702

211535,433051,MPC,South Africa  SARB Sticks To  Wait And See  Approach  ,opinion,The South African central bank  SARB  announced that the Monetary Policy Committee  MPC  decided at Thursday s MPC meeting to leave the key policy rate unchanged at 5 00   Such a decision was broadly expected  Even though the statement from the SARB on Thursday was perhaps squeezed slightly more on the dovish side in our view  we see the room for further monetary easing as very limited  The increasing violent labour protests and strikes seem to be weighing more and more on investors  perception of South Africa s creditworthiness  The rand has been under strong selling pressure this week  mainly on the back of negative newsflow regarding another violent riot  Furthermore  the risk of further rand weakness is quite high  Hence  given the risks to the rand posing clear upside risks to inflation and the widening of the current account deficit  we believe the door for further monetary easing has been closed  We therefore expect the SARB to remain on hold throughout 2013 Assessment and outlookThe statement was overall fairly balanced or perhaps skewed somewhat on the dovish side  Nonetheless  that the decision was unanimous and the MPC did not discuss a further rate cut means that the MPC finds current interest rate setting appropriate in the current environment The Governor Gill Marcus expressed worries about the growth prospects for the South African economy  with the mining and farm labour protests posing clear downside risks to the South African economy  While the economy remains fragile  the inflation outlook is squeezed on the upside  The SARB seems to be clearly concerned about wage settlements and the possibility of a  wage price spiral   which together with the rand represents the main upside inflation risk Even though the statement from the SARB today was perhaps squeezed slightly more on the dovish side in our view  we see the room for further monetary easing as very limited  The increasing violent labour protests and strikes seem to be weighing more and more on investors  perceptions of South Africa s creditworthiness  The rand has been under strong selling pressure this week  mainly on the back of negative newsflow regarding another violent riot  Furthermore  the risk of further rand weakness is quite high  Hence  given the risks to the rand posing clear upside risks to inflation and the widening of the current account deficit  we believe the door for further monetary easing has been closed  We therefore expect the SARB to remain on hold throughout 2013 To Read the Entire Report Please Click on the pdf File Below ,2013-01-27,Danske Markets,https://www.investing.com/analysis/south-africa:-sarb-sticks-to-'wait-and-see'-approach‏-152386,152386
211536,433052,MPC,Bank Of England Preview  Waiting For Carney  ,opinion,We expect the Bank of England  BoE  to remain on hold at Thursday s Monetary Policy Committee  MPC  meeting  13 00 CET   Any policy changes on Thursday would be a surprise  All analysts surveyed by Bloomberg expect both unchanged rates and the Asset Purchase Facility  APF  to be kept on hold at GBP375bn Recent statements from MPC members  as well as the latest minutes  suggest that the MPC in general has less confidence in additional quantitative easing  We do not expect any policy changes for the remaining period of Mervyn King s governorship More interesting is that on Thursday Mark Carney will appear before the Treasury Committee  10 45 CET   Mr Carney has recently promoted nominal GDP  NGDP  targeting as a way to communicate and manage monetary policy expectations  Here we review his comments as well as the possible implications of NGDP targeting No changes on Thursday s MPC meeting  The MPC minutes from the January meeting were largely as expected  with David Miles continuing to vote for an immediate expansion of gilts purchases  he has done it for three meetings now   The minutes indicated some concerns about the potential for inflation persistence and uncertainty of the effectiveness of additional asset purchases   There remained uncertainty about their  asset purchases  impact on nominal demand   and they might prove less effective in boosting real output       had strengthened the belief of some of these members that no further asset purchases were required at the current juncture    More colours of this view was given in recent comments from MPC members  In his final regional speech in Northern Ireland  Governor King stated his view that monetary policy cannot solve all economic problems   generalised monetary stimulus is not a panacea   But he did not rule out further asset purchases should the economy deteriorate further  This was also the essence of external MPC members Ian McCafferty s first public speech a couple of weeks ago  He expressed concerns about the marginal efficiency of asset purchases and  fears of such demand stimulus would have inflationary consequences   Without over interpreting his wording we would classify McCafferty as a median voter with a hawkish bias   Hence  we think the MPC view the economy developing in line with the November Inflation Report  with GDP slow recovering and inflation to be above target until mid 2014   We do not see the MPC to impose any material policy changes before Mark Carney takes over the chair as governor  One possible change could though be a reinvestment of the redeemed gilts currently in the APF  GBP 6 1bn in March  1 6bn in September   But such a change should merely be viewed as a technical adjustment to maintain the current policy   Note  that BoE will publish the next Inflation Report next week  13 Feb  and new forecasts will be available on this week s MPC meeting  To Read the Entire Report Please Click on the pdf File Below ,2013-02-07,Danske Markets,https://www.investing.com/analysis/bank-of-england-preview:-waiting-for-carney‏-154316,154316
