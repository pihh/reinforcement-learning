174729,396245,MET,Generali CEO May Invest at Least  3 3 Billion for Growth,news," Bloomberg     Assicurazioni Generali  MI GASI   Italy s biggest insurer  may invest at least 3 billion euros   3 3 billion  to grow through mid size acquisitions in insurance and asset management  according to Chief Executive Officer Philippe Donnet 
 I don t believe in big consolidation  because of risk management  regulation   Donnet said in an interview   I believe there will be some aggregation in asset management and insurance in Europe    some of the smaller companies won t be able to deal with low interest rates for so long    definitely we ll be proactive in these aggregations  
The Italian insurer aims to expand in growing markets to boost profit  As part of the effort  the company agreed to acquire Portugal s second largest non life insurer  Seguradoras Unidas  and the service company AdvanceCare for 600 million euros in July   After this acquisition  we still have at least three billion euros to invest for growth   he said 
In insurance  the CEO is looking at mid size companies focusing on non life  health  benefits and assistance  While not discussing specific targets  he said continental Europe would be the focus of any insurance acquisitions   We want to grow in countries where we are already present to become one of the top three players   Donnet said  Malaysia  Thailand and Brazil  are also possible regions to search for targets  according to the executive 
In asset management  Generali is looking at possible deals in the U S   Asia and Europe  including the U K  Despite issues related to Brexit  the CEO is attracted to the U K  because of the skills and expertise of London asset managers 
Generali is in talks to buy the Central European assets of MetLife Inc  NYSE MET   and some of Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA s insurance businesses  people with knowledge of the matter have said 
Growth Plans
Generali s strategic plan released last year predicts annual earnings per share growth of 6  to 8  annually by improving profitability in both insurance and money management and cutting debt  The CEO announced in November the firm will invest as much as 4 billion euros in acquisitions and internal growth over the life of the plan 
Life insurance providers are under pressure as a prolonged period of low interest rates hurts firms that buy bonds and other securities to meet payout obligations  As a large holder of Italian sovereign debt  Generali is vulnerable to swings in the value of government bonds driven by political turmoil 
 M A is a good accelerator  but only if you re successful  in terms of organic growth  Donnet said   I m convinced that we will find the right opportunities

174730,396246,MET,Relief Seen for Natural Gas Bottlenecks  Canada Bond Update,news," Bloomberg     Canada s battered natural gas market could be looking at some relief as TC Energy Corp  expands pipeline capacity and stockpiles remain low in Alberta at the start of heating season  according to Craig Nieboer  chief financial officer of producer Pipestone Energy Corp 
Benchmark prices at the AECO hub  which plunged close to zero in June  have already rebounded to  1 77 per million British thermal unit  Nieboer expects prices to strengthen in coming months 
Meanwhile  gas explorer Paramount Resources Ltd  and service provider CES Energy Solutions Corp  are looking at acquisitions if the price is right  according to CFOs Bernard Lee and Tony Aulicino  For CES  any deal would have to meet its goal to keep generating healthy cash flow  Aulicino said 
For all of Canada s pipeline woes  Aulicino is optimistic about the finances of oil sands companies 
The major players in Canada s oil sands are  some of the best capitalized   he said   There are a lot of reasons to like that business  
Ontario s Phillips Open to Diversifying Debt  Canada Bond Update  14 40 
Ontario is open to diversifying its borrowing base  though most of its 30  foreign allocation will remain in U S  dollars  Finance Minister Rod Phillips said 
The world s biggest sub sovereign borrower has issued about C 20 4 billion of its targeted C 36 billion   27 3 billion  borrowing program for 2019 20  The majority of that has been Canadian debt  followed by the U S  and a small slice of Australian bonds 
Phillips said Canada s most populous province is committed to its pledge of balancing the budget by 2023 24 and to getting a handle on debt to create attractive conditions for investors  We re really focused on a very prudent plan   so are keeping to that time horizon  Phillips said at Bloomberg s Canadian Fixed Income conference in New York Wednesday 
National Bank CEO Open to Wealth Takeovers  1 25 p m  
National Bank of Canada s Chief Executive Officer Louis Vachon says he s not a fan of acquisitions  yet he d still consider a deal to expand the Montreal based lender s wealth management division domestically 
 Essentially all of our acquisitions in the last 12 years in Canada have been in the wealth management space   Vachon said Wednesday at the Bloomberg Canada Fixed Income Conference in New York   So on the wealth management space we continue to be interested    but they have to make sense from a financial standpoint and from a cultural standpoint  
Vachon reiterated that he isn t looking to do further international acquisitions  after doing C 625 million   475 million  of investments in African and Asian lenders in the past five years  including a takeover of Cambodia s Advanced Bank of Asia Ltd  National Bank is focusing on expanding the Cambodian lender as well as its U S  specialty finance division  Credigy  while looking to sell its African investments  Vachon said 
Despite his deal making during his 12 year tenure  Vachon said he s  very skeptical  of acquisitions and prefers building from within 
 I don t like acquisitions  I feel they re risky  they really take a lot of time and attention  sometimes out of proportion to the financial impact they can potentially have   Vachon said   Our team knows that when they bring an acquisition thing to me it has to be a pretty damn good thing  because my first thing I ll say is   No  don t bother me   
 I want my team to focus on organic growth  and capital management   Vachon said 
WeWork Co Working Model Here to Stay  12 18 p m  
Co working is here to stay despite the troubles faced by WeWork  which popularized the movement  Oxford Properties Group s chief financial officer said 
 The success of the organization just highlighted a need and a customer base that probably wasn t being served as well as it could have been   Allison Wolfe said at Bloomberg s Canadian Fixed Income Conference on Wednesday 
Still co working is unlikely to take a major share of the Canadian market  according to Cecilia Williams  NYSE WMB   chief financial officer at Allied Properties REIT 
When it entered the market maybe five years ago WeWork was looking for tenant improvements but weren t willing to offer a guarantee or provide a covenant  Williams said   And it just really didn t make sense for owners of assets in the city to engage in a transaction with those terms given the strength of the market  
Last month  New York based WeWork was a seemingly unstoppable force  It was the fastest growing co working firm in the world with billions invested by SoftBank Group Corp  plus a highly anticipated initial public offering that would unlock even more cash for growth  Now  its IPO has collapsed  its controversial co founder Adam Neumann has stepped down as CEO and it s racing to get new financing before running out of cash as early as end of November 
Trudeau Leads In Election But Not by Much  12 p m  
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau s party leads his top rival in safe districts ahead of Canada s election next week  but is bleeding support to smaller parties while many races remain too close to call  polling shows 
Seat projections by Nanos Research  unveiled Wednesday at Bloomberg s Canadian Fixed Income Conference in New York  showed Trudeau s Liberals are on pace to win at least 127 of the parliament s 338 seats  with the Conservatives next with at least 84 seats  Another 95 seats remain too close to call in the Oct  21 vote  while smaller parties are on the rise 
The Liberals  vote is more efficient than the Conservatives  and translates more easily to gaining districts  Nanos said  More than one in four remain toss ups  with the election set to be decided in Toronto s suburbs  known by their 905 area code  and on the Pacific Coast  he said  None of the parties currently has enough support to win a majority  he said 
 It s battleground 905 and also British Columbia   Nanos said  The Conservatives are at 33  support nationally  compared with 32  for the Liberals  Nanos polling shows   In Ontario  the Liberals are still doing well but watch the 905 because the Conservatives need to do better in the 905 in order to do well in the election  
Infrastructure Investment Getting Harder  Tanyeri  11 a m  
Investing in infrastructure across Canada has become increasingly difficult for investors on the private side  pushing many companies into the U S   according to John Tanyeri  head of infrastructure and project finance at MetLife  NYSE MET  Investment Management 
 In 2019  it s been very hard to invest not only because there s been less opportunity but also as a natural U S  liability company  we have to swap everything back to U S  dollars so given that most of the 3Ps trade relatively tight  when you swap back to USD  it s made it very difficult for us to match liabilities   Tanyeri said at Bloomberg s Canadian Fixed Income Conference in New York on Wednesday 
Canada is also a much smaller market in comparison  making it harder to find investments compared to its southern neighbor  which has a broader scope 
 If we want to grow  our growth has to come from the U S     that s the natural step for most Canadian firms   said George Theodoropoulos  managing partner at Fengate Asset Management  In the U S 
To be sure  Canada still has some attractive infrastructure investment opportunities and its strong underlying credit provides investors more security  according to Ruth McMorrow  president of enterprises at Parsons Corp 
 The cost of bidding on a deal in the Canadian market is substantially less than bidding in the U S   McMorrow said  In the U S    It s a more litigious society so you have a lot more lawyers involved  But the Canadian market for us really provides great opportunity  
Still  Canada has some challenges moving forward  Tanyeri said   When you look at the infrastructure gap  it s probably anywhere from C 200 to C 300 billion currently   he added 
Quebec Finance Minister Sees Stronger Growth  10 30 a m  
Quebec Finance Minister Eric Girard said the province will raise its 2019 GDP forecast when it releases its economic update on Nov  7 
The economy is on track to expand by 2 5  or more in 2019  according to economists at Laurentian Bank Securities in Montreal  making the 1 8  estimate in the March budget appear conservative 
 All I commit to say is that it will be higher   Girard said  All components of the economy  including consumption  labor markets and investments are  very solid  
Long one of Canada s fiscal laggards  Quebec has turned into a poster child of budget discipline  Girard is planning to balance the budget for a fifth straight year  allowing the province to set aside hefty reserves to weather a downturn while reducing a debt burden that s still the second highest among provinces 
Girard said Quebec aims to raise potential gross domestic product to 2  and the province has the tools to stimulate the economy in case of a slowdown 
A June report showed the preliminary surplus for the last fiscal year was higher than expected  giving the government even more room for maneuver 
The commitment to lower debt has helped Quebec s borrowing costs slip below those of Ontario  which doesn t plan to eliminate its budget shortfall until fiscal 2023 2024 
Rosenberg Sees BoC Cutting Rates Four Times  10 a m  
The Bank of Canada will have to cut interest rates four times with the Canadian economy facing an 80  chance of recession in the next 12 months  according to David Rosenberg  chief economist at Gluskin Sheff   Associates Inc 
Canada s economy has little going for it except crude  cannabis and condos  and will be dragged into a global slowdown  Rosenberg said at Bloomberg s Canadian Fixed Income Conference in New York on Wednesday 
 The global economy is cooling off substantially  We are in a growth recession  and with a lag that s going to come back and it s going to hit the Canadian economy   Rosenberg said   It s going to swamp the fiscal stimulus that we re going to see  
Rosenberg s view wasn t shared by National Bank of Canada Chief Economist Stefane Marion  who sees no rate cut from the Bank of Canada with inflation doggedly around the target  Beata Caranci  chief economist at Toronto Dominion Bank  sees the central bank beginning to cut in 2020 
So far  the Bank of Canada is bucking global trends and showing no signs that it will cut rates with inflation coming in at 1 9  for September  around its 2  target  And the markets aren t expecting one either  pricing in a 12  probability for a rate cut by the end of the year 
The consensus view is that slower growth is on the horizon with economists expecting Canadian gross domestic product to decelerate to 1 5  from 1 9  last year  That s compared with 2 3  forecast in 2019 for the U S  from 2 9  in the prior year 
 The drivers of the economy continue to be our old friends of housing in particular coming back  but in terms of investment and trade we don t have a huge amount of optimism surrounding those sectors   Caranci said during the discussion 
Still  the Canadian economy has remained fairly resilient in the face of global weakness  The labor market continues to be a bright spot with low unemployment  steady job gains and rising wages  The housing market has begun to rebound and Canada reported better than expected output in the second quarter 
 The Bank of Canada should be hiking rates  not lowering rates   Marion said  adding that the fundamentals that underpin the Canadian economy are still quite strong 
While Rosenberg sees a big chance of recession in Canada  Marion sees it at 30  and Caranci sees a 30  to 40  chance ",2019-10-16,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/relief-seen-for-natural-gas-bottlenecks-canada-bond-update-1997647,1997647
174731,396247,MET,MetLife quarterly profit more than doubles on derivative gains,news," Reuters    U S  insurer MetLife Inc  N MET  on Wednesday reported third quarter profit that more than doubled from a year earlier  largely because derivatives that the U S insurer uses for hedging swung to net gains compared to a loss a year ago 
The company reported net derivative gains of  1 25 billion for the three months ended Sept 30  compared with a loss of  378 million a year earlier 
MetLife holds a book of derivatives to hedge against the risk of market swings  Such gains do not indicate actual performance of the company  but reflect the effect of accounting rules  an issue that has occurred in some previous quarters 
Net income available to MetLife common shareholders jumped to  2 15 billion from  880 million a year earlier 
On a per share basis  the company earned  2 30 compared to 88 cents in the same period a year earlier 
Excluding total notable items  such as the impact of an annual review of the company s actuarial assumptions and costs for an expense initiative  the company earned  1 54 per share 
Analysts on average had expected a profit of  1 40 per share  according to IBES data from Refinitiv  However  it was not immediately clear if the numbers were comparable ",2019-10-30,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/metlife-quarterly-profit-more-than-doubles-on-derivative-gains-2008068,2008068
174732,396248,MET,Black cat a curse for Giants but good luck for Cowboys,news," Reuters    Plenty of superstitions surround black cats  and the appearance of a feline of that color certainly did not hurt the Dallas Cowboys as they beat the New York Giants in an NFL game on Monday 
The cat entered the field during the second quarter  holding the game up for two minutes before it disappeared under a section of spectator seating and the action resumed 
Dallas were down 9 3 at the time  but thereafter out scored the Giants by 25 points in a 37 18 victory at MetLife  NYSE MET  Stadium in New Jersey 
The cat was a major talking point after the game 
 Things did kind of change when that black cat came out   joked Cowboys owner Jerry Jones 
Dallas receiver Amari Cooper welcomed the cat s appearance  though not for superstitious reasons 
 I was kind of happy about that because it came around the time that my knee was hurting so I was thinking I had a little bit more time to get this thing right   he said 
Others were less pleased with the feline s presence 
Quarterback Dak Prescott said   I m not superstitious  but I wasn t getting near it  
Dallas running back Ezekiel Elliott was of a similar mindset 
 I m allergic to cats   he said 
The result means Dallas improved to five wins for three losses  top of the NFC East standings  while division rivals Giants slipped to 2 7 
The stadium s official Twitter account said after the game that the cat was still on the loose  and promised to take it to a vet for a check up if it was located ",2019-11-05,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/general/black-cat-a-curse-for-giants-but-good-luck-for-cowboys-2012093,2012093

174734,396250,MET,13 minutes   13 million  The logistics of pulling off a Super Bowl halftime show,news,"By Nick Brown
NEW YORK  Reuters    The popular Super Bowl halftime show is only 13 minutes long  but the million dollar a minute extravaganza takes thousands of people  months of planning and near military precision to pull off 
Organizers have the Herculean task of turning a football field into a concert venue and back in less than half an hour  and without damaging the playing surface 
Halftime at Sunday s 54th Super Bowl between the San Francisco 49ers and Kansas City Chiefs in Miami will be headlined by Latina pop stars Jennifer Lopez and Shakira  It also will feature surprise artists and other ensemble singers  said Dan Parise  a producer working with Roc Nation  the entertainment company producing the show with the National Football League  
PepsiCo  O PEP  is sponsoring the show for the eighth straight year  A source with direct knowledge of the show said it would cost about  13 million  a figure an NFL spokeswoman declined to confirm 
 There are so many aspects of it  the dancers  the lighting elements  the special effects   said Parise   It s like a big jigsaw puzzle  
The work starts almost a year in advance  said Mark Quenzel  the NFL s senior vice president for programming and production  Organizers scout the venue for logistical hurdles or unique structural elements they could use to their advantage  
In 2014  for example  producers had to keep Bruno Mars  show relatively simple  because it was impossible to predict field conditions at MetLife  NYSE MET  Stadium in New Jersey  a rare outdoor cold weather Super Bowl  
This year  said Parise  a newly renovated overhang at Hard Rock Stadium allowed for deployment of more advanced audio equipment 
All in  the production takes 2 000 to 3 000 people to produce  said Quenzel  who is on his 10th halftime show  
Like past performances  this year s show will include an on field  audience  of some 800 people  mostly kids from local schools who are cast in advance  and must rehearse with the artists 
Often  they are asked to play a larger role than that of cheering fans  During Justin Timberlake s 2018 rendition of  Mirrors   the on field crowd held up mirrors to reflect stadium lights 
LIKE AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS
The biggest feat of coordination is setting up the stage  which is wheeled in on 38 separate carts  each requiring 12 people to move  Another 18 carts  with 6 member teams  carry the audio equipment 
Like air traffic controllers  team leaders wearing headsets direct each team  A stage piece ending up in the wrong place  even by an inch or two  could be disastrous  Quenzel said    
The setup takes eight minutes  with the show itself lasting about 13  Removing the stage takes just over six minutes  Quenzel said  before the teams retake the field 
During the show  behind the scenes personnel wait in predetermined spots to carry away clothing during wardrobe changes that must be executed down to the second  Quenzel said   Part of the art of the show is what we don t show you  what you don t see   he said  
An example that stands out to Quenzel was in 2015  when pop star Katy Perry wanted to sing her hit   Roar  
She and the producers thought it would be fun if she entered riding a golden lion  The 20 foot  6 1 m  mechanical beast was set on wheels concealed by legs that were pushed back and forth by performers to mimic footsteps 
For such a massive spectacle  there is precious little time to rehearse  Shakira and Lopez began separate rehearsals as early as December  Parise said  but had only a few days to practice together 
Rehearsals mostly took place at the Miami Dolphins  practice facility  before moving to the Super Bowl stadium on Wednesday   We were working 12 to 15 hour days   Parise said  
Communication is another challenge  In addition to the hundreds of people hired by the NFL  each artist brings enormous teams of dancers and staff  To get everyone on the same page  producers hire veteran industry pros  including producer Ricky Kirshner and director Hamish Hamilton  
Sunday s show is said to feature plenty of special effects and dancing  But with all that goes into planning  it is important to remember the show is not the main event  Quenzel said  
 It s never lost on us that we re the side show   he said ",2020-02-01,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/13-minutes-13-million-the-logistics-of-pulling-off-a-super-bowl-halftime-show-2073732,2073732

Participants  Prepared Remarks   OperatorLadies and gentlemen  thank you for standing by  Welcome to the MetLife fourth quarter 2019 earnings release conference call   Operator instructions  As a reminder  this conference is being recorded  Before we get started  I refer you to the cautionary note on the forward looking statements in yesterday s earnings release  With that  I will turn the call over to John Hall  head of investor relations John Hall    Head of Investor Relations Thank you  operator  Good morning  everyone  and welcome to MetLife s fourth quarter 2019 earnings call  Before we begin  I refer you to the information on non GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of metlife com  in our earnings release and in our quarterly financial supplements  which you should review  Joining me this morning on the call are Michel Khalaf  president and chief executive officer  and John McCallion  chief financial officer  Also here to participate in the discussions are other members of senior management  Last night  we released a set of supplemental slides  They are available on our website  John McCallion will speak to those supplemental slides in his prepared remarks if you wish to follow along An appendix to these slides features a number of disclosures and GAAP reconciliations  which you should also review  After prepared remarks  we will have a Q A session that will extend to the top of the hour   Operator instructions  With that  I will turn the call over to Michel  Michel Khalaf    President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you  John  and good morning  everyone  The headline from our financial results is that MetLife had a solid underlying fourth quarter and a very strong year  Our track record of consistent execution continues  and this leadership team is committed to being a top performing company  In the fourth quarter of 2019  we delivered adjusted earnings of  1 8 billion  compared to  1 3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018  On a per share basis  adjusted earnings rose to  1 98 from  1 35 a year earlier  Net income in the quarter was  536 million  driven by mark to market losses on interest rate related derivatives that we hold to protect our balance sheet  Backing out the impact of notable items  adjusted earnings per share came in at  1 53  up 21  year over year  The positive drivers included market factors  volume growth and capital management  offset in part by higher seasonal expenses as we indicated would be the case  Adjusted return on equity in the quarter  excluding AOCI  other than FCTA and notables  was 12 6   compared with 11 7  in the prior year quarter  For the full year 2019  MetLife delivered very strong results  Net income was  5 7 billion  while adjusted earnings were  5 8 billion  We ve spoken before about our efforts to bring net income and adjusted earnings into closer alignment  efforts that succeeded in 2019  On a per share basis  adjusted earnings rose 13  to  6 11  up from  5 39  Excluding notable items  adjusted earnings per share were  6 06  10  higher than the prior year  The drivers were capital management and volume growth that more than offset the impact of lower recurring interest margins  Across our businesses  2019 was a year of significant achievements  Our flagship U S  group benefits business generated adjusted earnings of  1 3 billion  nearly double the earnings from this business just three years earlier  In retirement and income solutions  we booked nearly  4 3 billion of pension risk transfer sales  our second best year ever  Just as important  we delivered on our commitment that investment spreads would fall within a range of 100 to 125 basis points  Despite declining interest rates  we came in at 106 basis points  In both our Asia and Lat Am businesses  we delivered double digit adjusted earnings growth year over year  excluding total notable items on a constant currency basis  And within investments  we generated variable investment income of nearly  1 2 billion  largely on the strength of our private equity portfolio  Our competitive advantage and sourcing private assets provided significant protection for our investment portfolio  In a year when the 10 year treasury fell by 77 basis points  our net investment yield only declined by 2 basis points  Our strong business performance drove adjusted return on equity for the year  excluding AOCI other than FCTA and notables  to 13   up 20 basis points from the prior year and right at the midpoint of our target range  Book value per share  excluding AOCI other than FCTA  grew nearly 10  to  48 97  And our direct expense ratio came in at 12 6   an improvement of 30 basis points over the prior year  As we have noted  our unit cost initiative is on track to deliver  900 million of margin expansion  which is  100 million above our initial commitment  MetLife s consistent execution in 2019 created significant shareholder value  Our robust free cash flow generation enabled us to return roughly  4 billion to shareholders in the form of common dividends and share repurchases  We deployed another  3 6 billion of capital to support new business at internal rates of return comfortably above our hurdle rate  And growing appreciation of our company s strength led to a total shareholder return of 29   The strategic themes of focus  simplify and differentiate that we outlined at our December Investor Day were clearly on display in 2019 and will drive our decisions in the years ahead  On focus  we have reduced our footprint post the ALICO acquisition from 66 markets to 44  and in 2019  announced the sale of our Hong Kong business  We continue to look at our portfolio through the lens of strategic fit and deploy capital to businesses that can meet or exceed our risk adjusted hurdle rate  We will be just as disciplined when it comes to optimizing our portfolio  Any transaction must be in the long term interest of MetLife  offering either compelling economics or a significant reduction in our risk profile  On simplify  we will overdeliver on our UCI cost saving target  and going forward  we ll adopt an efficiency mindset that will create an additional  1 billion of capacity to fund innovation and growth over the next five years  On differentiate  we will continue to capitalize on those competitive advantages that are difficult for others to replicate  We believe our group benefits business in the U S  creates unmatched value for customers  And as we expand the platform with attractive benefits  such as pet insurance  digital wells and health savings accounts  we are very well positioned to extend our lead  In early January  we gathered 200 of MetLife s senior leaders at an off site meeting to ensure we have full alignment on our strategy  Notably  10 of our 12 Independent Directors were in attendance as well  There was tremendous energy and enthusiasm for the task before us  to be a purpose driven company that creates superior value for its people  its customers and its shareholders  We have set bold aspirations for all our stakeholders  for our customers who are committed to building remarkable and enduring relationships  We are taking concrete steps to strengthen both our metrics and our leadership commitment to customer focus  For our people  we promised a culture that energizes them to make a difference  We are already making progress with our latest employee engagement survey  providing further evidence of the cultural evolution taking place at MetLife  When I look at MetLife s recent history  I see remarkable progress  A few years ago  we were in a de risking phase where the emphasis was on the need to improve our cash flow  Then we reached the inflection point I spoke about last year  where we could pivot to a focus on responsible growth  Now we are in the next horizon  where we have fully transitioned to leveraging our competitive advantages to win in the marketplace  which brings me to our aspirations for our shareholders  I covered these in detail at Investor Day and will highlight the key points today  First  we will achieve an adjusted return on equity of 12  to 14   Second  we will dispense with serial expense programs in favor of an efficiency mindset that will generate  1 billion of additional capacity over five years  And third  we will maintain a two year average free cash flow ratio of 65  to 75   which will generate  20 billion of deployable cash over the next five years  In closing  we are pleased to deliver another solid quarter and very strong year that add to our record of consistent execution  We believe that MetLife s narrative and results are converging nicely  Our thesis is clear  We are a simpler and more focused company with a great set of businesses and strong free cash flow  Our track record in support of this thesis is equally clear   900 million in projected expense savings  healthy growth in our most attractive businesses and consistent delivery of free cash flow in our 65  to 75  range  With that  I will turn the call over to John McCallion to cover our fourth quarter and full year performance in more detail John McCallion    Chief Financial Officer Thank you  Michel  and good morning  I will begin by discussing the 4Q  19 supplemental slides that we released last evening  which highlight information in our earnings release and quarterly financial supplement  Starting on Page 3  The schedule provides a comparison of net income and adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter and full year of 2019  Net income in the fourth quarter was  536 million or  1 3 billion lower than adjusted earnings of  1 8 billion  This variance is primarily due to net derivative losses resulting from the increase in interest rates during the quarter  For the full year  net income of  5 7 billion largely mirrored adjusted earnings of  5 8 billion  The results in the investment portfolio and hedging program continued to perform as expected  Notable items are shown on Page 4  and highlighted in our earnings release and quarterly financial supplement  First  favorable tax items in the fourth quarter increased adjusted earnings by  475 million after tax or  0 51 per share  I ll provide more details on these tax items shortly  Second  as a result of the favorable tax items  there was a related release of interest on tax reserves of  64 million after tax or  0 07 per share  which is a reduction in and recorded through direct expenses as opposed to income taxes  Finally  expenses related to our unit cost initiative decreased adjusted earnings in the quarter by  119 million after tax or  0 13 per share  For the full year  these costs were  332 million or  0 35 per share  As a reminder  fourth quarter of 2019 is the last quarter for this incremental spend  and therefore  there will be no UCI related costs in 2020  Excluding notable items in the quarter  adjusted earnings were  1 4 billion or  1 53 per share  Page 5 provides further detail on the notable tax items in the quarter  First  we had a tax benefit of  317 million related to a settlement with the IRS regarding the U S  tax reform repatriation transition tax  This settlement resolves uncertainty regarding the taxation of dividends from foreign subsidiaries paid prior to U S  tax reform  Second  we had a tax benefit of  158 million from an IRS audit settlement relating to the tax treatment of a wholly owned U K  investment subsidiary of Metropolitan Life Insurance Company  As some of you may recall  MetLife took a charge in the third quarter of 2015 related to this matter  We have now settled this issue for all audit years and the matter is closed  On Page 6  you can see the fourth quarter year over year adjusted earnings  excluding notable items by segment  Excluding all notable items in both periods  adjusted earnings were up 13  and 14  on a constant currency basis  On a per share basis  adjusted earnings  excluding notable items  were up 21  on both a reported and constant currency basis  The better results on an EPS basis reflect the cumulative impact from share repurchases  Overall  positive year over year drivers include strong equity market performance  continued strength in variable investment income  solid volume growth and favorable tax benefits  This was partially offset by less favorable expense margins in the quarter  Turning to the performance of our businesses in the quarter  Group benefits adjusted earnings were up 43  year over year  driven by favorable underwriting  solid volume growth and higher investment margins  This was partially offset by less favorable expense margins in the quarter  The group life mortality ratio was 85 4   which is at the low end of our annual target range of 85  to 90  and favorable to the prior year quarter of 89 4  due to lower claims severity  The interest adjusted benefit ratio for Non Medical Health was 71 4   which is below our annual target range of 72  to 77  and also favorable to the prior year quarter of 73 2   The primary driver was strong disability results  which benefited from renewal rate actions and higher claim recoveries  In addition to the strong bottom line  the business continues to grow its top line with adjusted PFOs in the quarter up 6  and full year sales up 11   led by growth in voluntary products  Retirement and Income Solutions  or RIS  adjusted earnings were down 10  year over year  driven by lower investment margins  RIS investment spreads were 106 basis points in 4Q  19  and while down 24 basis points year over year  spreads were up 4 basis points sequentially  For the full year 2019  investment spreads were also 106 basis points  which was within the 2019 guidance range  Looking ahead  we continue to expect spreads to remain within our 2020 guidance range of 90 to 115 basis points  RIS adjusted PFOs were up  2 6 billion year over year  driven by strong pension risk transfer deals of  2 5 billion in 4Q  19  As announced last week  this includes a  1 9 billion transaction with Lockheed Martin  which covers approximately 20 000 retirees and beneficiaries  The pipeline for PRTs remain strong  and we expect this to continue into 2020  Property and Casualty  or P C  adjusted earnings were down 75  versus 4Q  18  primarily due to unfavorable underwriting in the quarter  The overall combined ratio was 101 6   driven by higher severity within auto bodily injury  including approximately 6 points from adverse prior year development  We are reassessing operational practices and have accelerated rate actions  Based on current trend and planned rate actions  we expect to be within our 2020 target combined ratios  With regards to the top line  P C adjusted PFOs were up 1   while sales were down 6  versus 4Q  18  Moving to Asia  Adjusted earnings were up 21  and 23  on a constant currency basis  The positive year over year drivers were favorable volume growth as general account assets under management  excluding fair value adjustments  grew 9   as well as better investment margins and favorable equity markets  This was partially offset by less favorable underwriting  Asia sales were down 16  on a constant currency basis  In Japan  sales were down 23   primarily driven by foreign currency denominated annuity products  FX annuity products  which are primarily sold through bank channels had another challenging quarter  given the contraction of the bank market  In addition  our A H sales in Japan were down 10  year over year  which is a function of changes in the tax laws associated with certain products  We expect Japan sales to remain soft through the first half of 2020 before recovering  Other Asia sales were down 3   but up 5   excluding the impact from our divested Hong Kong operations  driven by growth in Korea  Latin America adjusted earnings were up 18  and 21  on a constant currency basis  The primary year over year drivers were higher investment margins  solid volume growth  better expense margins and the favorable impact from capital markets on our Chile Encaje  These were partially offset by the less favorable underwriting compared to 4Q  18  Latin America adjusted PFOs were down 7  and 4  on a constant currency basis  primarily due to lower SPIA sales in Chile  Latin America sales were up 11  on a constant currency basis  driven by higher sales in Brazil and Mexico  EMEA adjusted earnings were up 20  and 22  on a constant currency basis  The main drivers were lower taxes and volume growth  These were partially offset by less favorable underwriting margins  EMEA adjusted PFOs were up 5  on a constant currency basis  and sales were up 12  on a constant currency basis from growth across the region  MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were up 21  year over year  driven by the strength of the equity markets  as well as favorable underwriting and investment margins  These were partially offset by less favorable expense margins  although primarily due to items that we do not expect to recur  With regard to underwriting  the life interest adjusted benefit ratio was 55 5   in line with seasonal expectations and favorable to 58  in the prior year quarter  For the full year 2019  the life interest adjusted benefit ratio  excluding notable items  was 52 9   comfortably within the target range  Corporate   Other adjusted loss  excluding notable items  was  98 million  This result compared favorably to the prior year quarter  which had an adjusted loss of  132 million due to lower taxes and favorable investment margins  This was partially offset by less favorable expense margins  For the full year 2019  Corporate   Other adjusted loss  excluding notable items  was  608 million  which was within our 2019 guidance range of an adjusted loss of  550 million to  750 million  Excluding the notable and other favorable tax items  the company s effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was 18 5  and within our 2019 guidance of 18  to 20   As a reminder  our 2020 effective tax rate guidance is expected to be within 20  to 22   Now let s turn to Page 7 to discuss variable investment income in more detail  This chart reflects our pre tax variable investment income in 2019  including  327 million earned in the fourth quarter  This was another solid performance for variable investment income  Our private equity portfolio  which is accounted for on a one quarter lag  had another solid quarter  and the quarter also contained higher mortgage prepayments  For full year 2019  VII was  1 2 billion pre tax and above our 2019 guidance range of  800 million to  1 billion  As a reminder  our 2020 VII target range remains  900 million to  1 1 billion  With regards to recurring investment income  our new money rate was 3 45  versus a roll off rate of 4 17  in the quarter  This compares to a new money rate of 4 24  and a roll off rate of 4 4  in 4Q  18  Lower interest rates have pressured this relationship  As we have noted previously  we would not expect parity to occur until we have a sustained U S  10 year treasury yield of roughly 3  to 3 25   Turning to Page 8  This chart shows our direct expense ratio from 2015 through 2019  We have made consistent progress toward achieving our UCI target by 2020  2019 marks another 30 basis point improvement versus 2018  and 170 basis point improvement overall from the baseline of 14 3  in 2015  The 4Q  19 direct expense ratio  excluding notable items and PRTs  came in above trend at 13 7   As we ve indicated  our expenses tend to be seasonally higher in the fourth quarter due to higher enrollment and other costs incurred prior to receiving premiums in our group benefits business  In addition  the higher direct expense ratio reflects roughly 50 to 60 basis points of unfavorable items  primarily driven by higher employee benefit costs and higher corporate initiatives in the quarter  Despite the higher 4Q expenses  we are quite pleased with the overall progress that we have made in driving down the company s direct expense ratio  as demonstrated by the improvement of our full year results  We are on track to deliver a direct expense ratio of approximately 12 3  for full year 2020  which equates to an incremental  100 million of profit margin improvement over our original commitment  I will now discuss our cash and capital position on Page 9  Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately  4 2 billion at December 31  which is up from  3 5 billion at September 30   700 million increase in cash in the quarter reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends  share repurchases  payment of our common dividend  as well as holding company expenses  In 2019  we returned approximately  4 billion of capital to shareholders  and our average 2018 and 2019 free cash flow ratio was 72  and within our 65  to 75  guidance  We remain committed to maintaining a 65  to 75  two year average free cash flow ratio over the near term  This target still holds with a 10 year treasury between 1 5  and 4 5   Next  I d like to provide you with an update on our capital position  For our U S  companies  we estimate that our combined NAIC RBC ratio will be above our 360  target  For our U S  companies  preliminary 2019 statutory operating earnings were approximately  4 5 billion and net earnings were approximately  4 1 billion  Statutory operating earnings increased by  164 million from the prior year  primarily due to lower VA rider reserves and improved underwriting results  These were mostly offset by the impact of a prior year dividend from an investment subsidiary  We estimate that our total U S  statutory adjusted capital was approximately  18 6 billion as of December 31  2019  up 1  compared to December 31  2018  The increase in operating earnings was partially offset by dividends paid to the holding company and derivative losses  Finally  the Japan solvency margin ratio was 904  as of September 30  which is the latest public data  Overall  MetLife delivered another solid quarter to close out a very strong 2019  Our ability to leverage our diverse market leading businesses to drive capital efficient growth  while maintaining expense discipline across the firm  has led to a strong  consistent level of results in 2019  We grew book value per share by 10  year over year  while generating an adjusted ROE of 13   excluding notable items  In addition  our cash and capital position  as well as our balance sheet remain strong and resilient  Finally  we are confident the actions we are taking to become a simpler and more focused company will continue to create long term sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders  And with that  I will turn the call back to the operator for your questions  Questions   Answers  OperatorThank you   Operator instructions  Your first question comes from the line of Andrew Kligerman from Credit Suisse  Please go ahead Andrew Kligerman    Credit Suisse    Analyst Hey  good morning  My first question is around the group benefits  So you mentioned that PFO  up 6   sales  up 11   the life benefits ratio was 85 4  against guidance of 85  to 90  and the Non Med was 71 4  under the 72  to 77   so it s clearly phenomenal  And it seems like quarter in  quarter out  you re doing this  So I want to get a sense of what s the pricing environment like right now  And when is it going to get a little uglier or get ugly at some point because it always does in insurance Ramy Tadros    President  U S  Business Good morning  Andrew  it s Ramy here  Phenomenal  I think we would say  it s a very strong quarter for us  and we re extremely pleased with those results  To give you some context around your question  if you think about this into 2020 and beyond  I would say a few things  One is that we are very confident in our fundamentals here  This is an attractive market  It has structural characteristics that make it attractive that we talked about  And we are a market leader here  and we do have sustainable competitive advantages that we continue to press  If you think about the specific results on the underwriting ratio  like you said  remember  this is an insurance business  So you do expect these ratios to fluctuate quarter to quarter  they do have some seasonality to them  with first quarter typically being a bit elevated  The other thing you should think of as an insurance business is that the results that we re seeing are entirely within our expected range of outcomes in the context of our business  So if you look at 2020  our view of those ranges have not changed from the ones we ve given you in December and our expectations for the full year remain the same and are toward the middle of that range  From a competitive environment  it is competitive  It s not irrational  We seek to differentiate on a lot of factors beyond price  And the other thing I would say  there s a lot of white space in this business  and we talked about the voluntary opportunity in particular  where we see white space for further growth Andrew Kligerman    Credit Suisse    Analyst Great  Thank you  Ramy  And then just on RIS  I guess  spreads were within the guided range of 90 to 115 at 106  as you said earlier  John  And I guess  could you share with us what the annual portfolio turnover is on that business  And what kind of new money yields you re getting as you move forward against the portfolio yield John McCallion    Chief Financial Officer Good morning  Andrew  It s John  Yeah  maybe I ll start with the beginning part there and just say  this is consistent with what we expected  and we mentioned previously on the third quarter call  we started to see a bottoming of spreads  partly due to the anticipation of the benefit of two fed rate cuts and that s kind of starting to get fully absorbed in the market  And so that was one  And also  we saw the dislocation and the repo markets subside  So we ve seen some bottoming of the kind of spread decline happen over the last couple of quarters  And as we said  we think that s a pretty good run rate for the near term  In terms of turnover in this particular RIS book  I don t think we have that handy here  But again  you can talk to IR off line  We talk about overall the roll off reinvest with regards to rate for the firm  A lot of that  obviously  mix matters there  and it s hard to read into that specifically  But I think I would go back to what we ve said  which is that the spreads here have started to bottom  You see the benefit of two full rate cuts  You can see that in our crediting rate  It s kind of dropped faster than our investment yield in this business  and that s because we have a lot of floating rate liabilities in that business  And it does take some time for that to fully get recognized because three month LIBOR  it has to take a few months before it s fully recognized there  So I ll let Steve add some color Steve Goulart    Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer  MetLife  Inc   and President  MetLife Investment Management I ll just add a little bit of color  Steve Goulart  good morning  Andrew  But just reminding you of our capital markets business  which I think is where you re going with that question  In general  it is a shorter duration business  and there isn t a lot of mismatch  So even when there s rollover on the asset side  we re also managing rollover on the liability side  So it s a reasonably matched business  and that protects us Andrew Kligerman    Credit Suisse    Analyst OK  Thank you OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo  Please go ahead Elyse Greenspan    Wells Fargo Securities    Analyst Hi  Thanks  Good morning  My first question  it seems like there were some good PRT momentum to end the year  If you could just give us a little bit of an update on the sales pipeline  And what you re seeing with that business  And I guess  interest rates went up in the fourth quarter  and then they ve been down this year  Have you seen any impact from interest rates on the pipeline there Ramy Tadros    President  U S  Business Good morning  Elyse  It s Ramy here  We re clearly very pleased with our PRT results  both for the quarter and for the year  The quarter was a  2 5 billion quarter  and as Michel mentioned  it s a  4 3 billion a year for us  Remember  from a pipeline perspective  we are focusing on the larger end of the market  So these are big pension plans  mid single digits  but sometimes even higher with respect to the size of these plans  That s the part of the market where we have a competitive advantage with respect to our rating  our investment capability and our scale of the balance sheet  And when you think about those plans  they are on a derisking journey  right  So this is not something that s a trade that they make overnight  And this derisking journey ends up taking a number of years  And therefore  for any one of them  the current rate position is only an input because it depends on their overall ALM position and it depends on their equity allocation  So having said all of that and given the market we re focused on  we re still seeing a very robust 2020 in that segment that we re looking at Elyse Greenspan    Wells Fargo Securities    Analyst OK  Thank you  And then my next question  within your P C business  you guys called out higher BI severity trends in the quarter  impacting both current accident year  as well as prior accident years  If you could just give a little bit more color on what you re seeing  And as you think of 2020  does getting within your guide assume that the severity trends might remain elevated at least for part of this year Ramy Tadros    President  U S  Business Sure  So clearly  it s been a challenging quarter for the P C business  And the headline here  as you ve mentioned  is a bodily injury severity  And as you know  it s a trend that we re seeing in the marketplace  We saw some initial indication of deterioration in the third quarter  and we took some reserve strengthening then  And those indications worsened in the fourth quarter  which warranted additional strengthening  And that s a combination of PYDs  as well as out of period strengthening for  19  As we look forward  I can tell you  we re looking at these trends very closely  We re pulling a range of levers  which are at our disposal  beginning with rate actions where we ve accelerated some of the rate actions into early 2020  but we re also looking at underwriting and claims practices  So we re on top of this  I could say with respect to the auto line  in particular  where we stand today  our expectations are that we would remain within our overall guidance range for auto  albeit toward the upper end of that range  So if you recall  that s a 93  to 98  for the auto business Elyse Greenspan    Wells Fargo Securities    Analyst OK  Thank you  And John  one just quick numbers question  The derivative loss in the quarter  you said that that was driven off of the move in interest rates  Given that interest rates have been down to start 2020  should we think about that reversing in the first quarter this year John McCallion    Chief Financial Officer Yeah  directionally correct  Yes Elyse Greenspan    Wells Fargo Securities    Analyst Thank you OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher from ISI  Please go ahead Tom Gallagher    Evercore ISI    Analyst Good morning  Just one follow up on property casualty  The current accident year auto loss ratio was 82   And I guess  the question is  is that a just 4Q pick  Or is that a current accident year catch up for the prior quarters as well  Like what would a better trend loss ratio be  Because I assume it s not a 107 combined as the way we should think about normalized heading into 2020 Ramy Tadros    President  U S  Business Yeah  I mean  if you look at the fourth quarter  if you exclude the PYDs in the quarter  I would say  remember  that the fourth quarter is typically seasonally higher for auto for us  So if you think about that fourth quarter results  excluding PYD  it s 98 9   And again  there s some elevation because of seasonality here Tom Gallagher    Evercore ISI    Analyst Gotcha  And then just a question on capital management  So buybacks were lighter this quarter and your buildup of cash at the holding company is now  4 2 billion  So that s slightly above your target for the first time in a while  Any reason why you dialed it back this quarter despite having the excess cash to use Michel Khalaf    President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah  hey  Tom  it s Michel  As we mentioned  we are comfortable with the  3 billion to  4 billion buffer at the HoldCo  slightly above this for the fourth quarter  Mostly  I would say  timing related in terms of dividends to the HoldCo  I would look at our sort of cash buyback activity in the fourth quarter in tandem with the third quarter  We had mentioned then that we had pulled forward some of the share repurchases  We tend to be opportunistic in that respect  So nothing more to read into that  I would say Tom Gallagher    Evercore ISI    Analyst And Michel  just as a follow up  how are you thinking right now in terms of the balance or trade off between M A and buybacks Michel Khalaf    President and Chief Executive Officer No change also in terms of our capital management philosophy  I think we talked before about M A opportunities  how we view those strategic fit accretive  And we sort of also consider alternative uses of capital  So I would say no change in terms of our capital management philosophy  Excess capital belongs to the shareholders  and absent M A activity  we ll return it in the form of dividends and share repurchases Tom Gallagher    Evercore ISI    Analyst Thank you OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JP Morgan  Please go ahead Jimmy Bhullar    J P  Morgan    Analyst Hi  good morning  I just had a question first on what you re seeing in terms of the operating environment in the Latin America business  and specifically  in Chile  where your sales were weak this quarter  There s also a lot of talk about political uncertainty and potential changes in the pension business Oscar Schmidt    President  Latin America Yeah  Hi  Jimmy  this is Oscar  So let me start with the social situation  As I said in December  the magnitude of the profits was a surprise to everybody  But I have to say it s getting better  And remember that  in summer  in Chile  the flow activity  January and February  we ll need to see what happens in March when the year really starts there  But so far  the social environment has been much better  In terms of the business  to date  we have not seen a significant impact on our business through January from the situation there  But facts and circumstances may change  of course  as the situation evolves  So let me talk about the reform  which  I think  is your other question  The government finally managed to present a project in the Congress for pension reform  and they were able to make it to be approved in the house  in the lower chamber  Now it has to go to the Senate  February is    there s no Congress activity  So we need to wait until March to see what happens in the Senate  I have to say  it s too early to say in the legislative process what s going to happen  It s possible that there will be more changes  right  to be introduced before the project ends up enacted as a law  But we cannot say what is the final impact  But based on the facts  not today  which is the version of the project that is being discussed  we don t anticipate material financial impact to the region  I would say  it s a good step forward for the people of Chile in terms of the kind of pension improvements that introduces  and hopefully  will help to ease the social situation there if the project is approved  So we really support the government pension reform efforts  I hope that answers your question Jimmy Bhullar    J P  Morgan    Analyst And the potential impact on your business as of the proposal as you see it currently Oscar Schmidt    President  Latin America As it stands today  it s not big  right  Now I have to say we ve got to be prudent because we don t know how it s going to end  It still has to go through senate and the executive power has to approve it  but the version that is being discussed today  we think it s good for people  and the impact on our business is not that big Jimmy Bhullar    J P  Morgan    Analyst OK  And then if I could ask one more of John McCallion  Just on the changes in accounting that are coming through in 2022 on long duration contracts  you haven t disclosed any sort of potential impact on your business either as anybody else  Are you expecting to start quantifying more of the impact in the next few quarters  Or would you wait until your even closer to the rules being implemented  so maybe next year John McCallion    Chief Financial Officer Yeah  hard to tell in terms of time line at this point  We re still working through it  So we don t really have a projected or estimated time line in terms of when we would share that information Jimmy Bhullar    J P  Morgan    Analyst Thank you OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger from KBW  Please go ahead Ryan Krueger    KBW    Analyst  Technical difficulty  Just from reinsurers on pieces of MetLife Holdings at the December Investor Day  Can you give an update on that  And are you still seeing the same amount of interest following the decline in interest rates this year John McCallion    Chief Financial Officer Ryan  at the beginning of your question  you cut off  but I think it had to do with just any updates on just activity from reinsurers with regards to holdings  is that right Ryan Krueger    KBW    Analyst That s right  And have you seen any impact from lower interest rates as well John McCallion    Chief Financial Officer Yeah  I would actually maybe refer to the way that Ramy described PRTs  It s not something that they can turn on  turn off  Given the size and the complexity  sometimes it just requires people to spend time on these things for some time  So I don t think they react to movements in interest rates as much  So I would say it s no change at this point  There s still kind of a good supply of capital out there  but I d say the bid ask spread is still fairly wide  but there s a number of folks that have entered the space over the last few years  and we re seeing that Ryan Krueger    KBW    Analyst Thanks  And then on the expenses  there was a lot of seasonality  I guess  in 2019  Can you give us any sense of  I guess  how to think about normal seasonality with the direct expense ratio John McCallion    Chief Financial Officer Yeah  I will try  And I make that point only because we have talked about that there is seasonality from quarter to quarter  which is why we focus on the annual direct expense ratio  Having said that  let me just kind of recall a few things  So we did say that  and we ve called out previously  that the third and fourth quarter tend to be elevated due to the cost  as I mentioned  in my opening remarks for the enrollment of group customers  and we don t get those premiums in until the following year  so this tends to be an elevated  And even this year  if you recall  we didn t see that come through in the third quarter  So there was even some slippage into 4Q  On top of that seasonality  there were some additional one time costs in the quarter that we would not expect to recur  We had some elevated employee benefit costs  Remember in the earlier three quarters  we had employee benefit costs going the other way  So they ve kind of washed or kind of neutralized each other out  And then we also had some additional corporate initiatives spend in the quarter  in 4Q  that was elevated  So we estimate 50 to 60 basis points above what normal trend would be for kind of the fourth quarter  And so you can kind of think of that as what we had expected in the quarter and the additional one time costs that came through Ryan Krueger    KBW    Analyst Got it  Thanks a lot OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Humphrey Lee from Dowling   Partners  Please go ahead Humphrey Lee    Dowling and Partners    Analyst Thanks  Good morning  Thank you for taking my questions  Just want to follow up on that expense  But looking back specifically in group benefits  just looking back  I don t really see there s a seasonality that you talked about in 3Q and 4Q  And then  obviously  this year  we see the bonds of it in the fourth quarter  So I was just wondering  is there anything constructionally different this year compared to years past John McCallion    Chief Financial Officer Well  remember also  I mean  we ve been growing a lot  right  in the last few years  So you re seeing there is kind of a pickup as a result of just sheer growth  but I would say that s the case  We ll look again  but it s there  And there s other things that go into this  right  I mean  there s other investments being made  So sometimes  it s hard  And I think  last year  there might have been employee benefit costs that offset that  So the volatility and some of the market impacts from unemployed benefit costs can impact the segments as well  So you might see a little offset  but you can be assured  it s in there Humphrey Lee    Dowling and Partners    Analyst OK  Got it  And then just a follow up question on the tax rate  So I think in your prepared remarks  you talked about the effective tax rate was 18 5   I m a little bit struggling to get to that number based on the tax items that you called out  I think you may have some additional tax items  too  but maybe if you can help me to think about like the tax rate  what contributed to the reported number and then versus your effective tax rate John McCallion    Chief Financial Officer Yeah  So if you adjust the notable items  you come to something closer in the 13s in terms of effective tax rate  So we did have some additional positive items that were not called out as notable just because of the size and  call it  our kind of approach to notables of anything over a  50 million impact  So it s a series of a few items  One is there were some revision to the rules on the GILTI tax in the fourth quarter  and I think it was early December  maybe late November  which ultimately provided a company s ability to use some additional foreign tax credits  So that came through in the fourth quarter  And then the remaining amount is effectively just some return to provision true ups and some other year end tax estimate refinements  So if you exclude those items  it s  call it   65 million impact  you get to 18 5   And so that s how you reconcile the quarter ETR Humphrey Lee    Dowling and Partners    Analyst Thank you OperatorYour next question comes from the line of John Barnidge from Piper Sandler  Please go ahead John Barnidge    Piper Sandler    Analyst Yeah  Thanks  Sorry  I was muted  Have you seen any change in the operating environment in EMEA following the favorable U K  election and subsequent Brexit certainty Michel Khalaf    President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah  hi  John  I would say not much  I mean  our business in the U K

we ve taken under 2  in rate  just for Q1 of 2020  and we re clearly going to be watching this carefully  We expect to take additional rate as warranted OperatorAnd I d now like to turn the call back

174736,396252,MET,3 Top Dividend Stocks To Maximize Your Retirement Income   January 31  2020,opinion,"Strange but true  seniors fear death less than running out of money in retirement 
And retirees have good reason to be worried about making their assets last  People are living longer  so that money has to cover a longer period  Making matters worse  income generated using tried   and   true retirement planning approaches may not cover expenses these days  That means seniors must dip into principal to meet living expenses 
In today s economic environment  traditional income investments are not working 
For example  10 year Treasury bonds in the late 1990s offered a yield of around 6 50   which translated to an income source you could count on  However  today s yield is much lower   currently under 2  and probably not a viable return option to fund typical retirements 
That means if you had  1 million in 10 year Treasuries  the difference in yield between 1999 and today is more than  1 million 
Today s retirees are getting hit hard by reduced bond yields   and the Social Security picture isn t too rosy either  Right now and for the near future  Social Security benefits are still being paid  but it has been estimated that the Social Security funds will be depleted as soon as 2035 
So what can retirees do  You could dramatically reduce your expenses  and go out on a limb hoping your Social Security benefits don t diminish  On the other hand  you could opt for an alternative investment that gives a steady  higher rate income stream to supplant lessening bond yields 
Invest in Dividend Stocks
Dividend paying stocks from low risk  high quality companies are a smart way to generate steady and reliable attractive income streams to replace current low risk  low yielding Treasury and bond options 
For example  AT T  NYSE T  and Coca Cola  NYSE KO  are income stocks with attractive dividend yields of 3  or better  Look for stocks like this that have paid steady  increasing dividends for years  or decades   and have not cut their dividends even during recessions 
A rule of thumb for finding solid income producing stocks is to seek those that average 3  dividend yield  and positive yearly dividend growth  These stocks can help combat inflation by boosting dividends over time 
Here are three dividend paying stocks retirees should consider for their nest egg portfolio 
MetLife  NYSE MET  is currently shelling out a dividend of  0 44 per share  with a dividend yield of 3 43   This compares to the Insurance   Multi line industry s yield of 2 21  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 77   In terms of dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  1 76 is up 4 76  from last year 
Navient  NAVI  is paying out a dividend of 0 16 per share at the moment  with a dividend yield of 4 3  compared to the Financial   Consumer Loans industry s yield of 0  and the S P 500 s yield  Taking a look at the company s dividend growth  its current annualized dividend of  0 64 is flat compared to last year 
Currently paying a dividend of 0 28 per share  Corporate Office Properties  OFC  has a dividend yield of 3 65   This is compared to the REIT and Equity Trust   Other industry s yield of 4  and the S P 500 s current yield  Looking at dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  1 1 is flat compared to last year 
But aren t stocks generally more risky than bonds 
It is true that stocks  as an asset class  carry more risk than bonds  but high quality dividend stocks not only have the ability to produce income growth over time but more importantly  can also reduce your overall portfolio volatility relative to the broader stock market 
An upside to adding dividend stocks to your retirement portfolio  they can help lessen the effects of inflation  since many dividend paying companies  especially blue chip stocks  generally increase their dividends over time 
Thinking about dividend focused mutual funds or ETFs  Watch out for fees 
If you re interested in investing in dividends  but are thinking about mutual funds or ETFs rather than stocks  beware of fees  Mutual funds and specialized ETFs may carry high fees  which could lower the overall gains you earn from dividends  undercutting your dividend income strategy  Be sure to look for funds with low fees if you decide on this approach 
Bottom Line
Whether you select high quality  low fee funds or stocks  seeking the steady income of dividend paying equities can potentially offer you a path to a better and more stress free retirement 
Generating income is just one aspect of planning for a comfortable retirement

174738,396254,MET,UDR To Report Q4 Earnings  What s In Store For The Stock ,opinion,UDR Inc    NYSE UDR   is slated to report fourth quarter and full year 2019 results on Feb 11  after market close  The company s performance is expected to reflect year over year growth in revenues and funds from operations  FFO  per share In the last reported quarter  this Denver  CO based residential real estate investment trust  REIT  delivered an in line performance in terms of FFO per share  Results reflected year over year growth in same store net operating income  NOI  and weighted average same store physical occupancy In the trailing four quarters  the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on two occasions for as many in line performances  delivering an average positive surprise of 1 01  United Dominion Realty Trust  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise    Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement Factors to ConsiderFollowing a robust prime leasing season in 2019  the U S  apartment rental market put up a decent show in the December end quarter  despite demand for apartments generally slowing down during the colder months as renters usually prefer less to move in winters Per the latest  from real estate technology and analytics firm RealPage  Inc   RP   occupancy at the end of fourth quarter 2019 remained as high as 95 8   reflecting an expansion of 40 basis points  bps   year on year  Moreover  rents for new resident leases were up 2 8  in 2019  hovering around the 3  level that the apartment market has been witnessing since late 2016 Banking on the favorable rental housing trend  UDR has been focused on enhancing its overall portfolio by acquiring  developing and redeveloping properties in core operating markets and divesting the company s non core assets  Moreover  favorable demographics  household formation and job market gains are anticipated to have been key demand drivers for the company s properties in the fourth quarter as well UDR has also been steadily implementing its Next Generation operating platform consisting of SmartHome installations and other infrastructure buildouts  These efforts are expected to have driven margin expansions and supported the company s operational platform during the December end quarter  These  in turn  are likely to have supported the company s performance in the quarter The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter revenues is currently pegged at  296 6 million  indicating 12 04  year over year growth However  new supply of apartment properties was elevated in the quarter under review  in a number of the company s markets  Therefore  we remain apprehensive about UDR s performance as elevated levels of supply limits a landlord s ability to demand more rents  results in lesser absorption and leads to increased concession activity  Particularly  new lease rate growth might have been adversely impacted Also  prior to the fourth quarter earnings release  there is lack of any solid catalyst for becoming overtly optimistic about the company s business activities and prospects  As such  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the October December quarter FFO per share remained unchanged at 54 cents  over the past 30 days  Nonetheless  it suggests year over year growth of 8   The company projects FFO as adjusted per share at 53 55 cents For full year 2019  the company forecasts FFO as adjusted per share of  2 07  2 09  Moreover  it anticipates same store NOI growth of 4 4 4  for 2019  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for full year FFO per share is currently pinned at  2 08  indicating 6 1  year over year growth on revenues of  1 13 billion Key Development in Q4In December  UDR announced that it closed a  1 76 billion transaction with MetLife  NYSE MET  Investment Management  The move  which lowered the size of the UDR MetLife Investment Management joint venture  JV   is projected to be 1 2 cents accretive to the company s 2020 FFO as adjusted per share As part of the transaction  the company acquired roughly 50  stake in 10 JV operating communities  comprising 3 321 apartment homes in total  one community under development and four accretive development land sites  These acquisitions were valued at an aggregate of  1 1 billion  or  557 million at UDR s share Here is what our quantitative model predicts Our proven model does not conclusively predict a positive surprise in terms of FFO per share for UDR this season  The combination of a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  increases the odds of a FFO beat  But that s not the case here  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Although UDR carries a Zacks Rank of 3  its Earnings ESP of 0 00  makes surprise prediction difficult Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few stocks in the REIT sector that you may want to consider  as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to report a positive surprise

174757,396273,MET,NFL notebook  Newton reportedly has Lisfranc injury,news,"Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton is dealing with a Lisfranc injury and could require surgery  per multiple reports Tuesday 
Newton is hoping rest and rehab will keep him out of a procedure for a second time in 2019  He had shoulder surgery in January 
Newton was sidelined after an 0 2 start during which he struggled with accuracy and did not run often  The injury by definition is displacement of the metatarsal bones  which often requires surgery and a lengthy recovery process that includes a hard cast for up to two months 
NFL Network  seconding a report from Joseph Person in Charlotte  reported that Kyle Allen is likely to be the starter for several weeks  Allen threw four touchdown passes and guided the Panthers to their first win of the 2019 season on Sunday at Arizona 
  Washington Redskins coach Jay Gruden told reporters that he isn t concerned about job security  one day after his team lost its third straight game to start the season

Gruden  however  said he doesn t feel as though he is coaching on a week to week basis   No  I haven t felt like that  But who knows   the 52 year old Gruden said 
  Philadelphia Eagles head coach Doug Pederson told reporters he expects wide receiver Alshon Jeffery and tight end Dallas Goedert to play Thursday at Green Bay

On top of the Zacks Rank  investors can also look at our innovative Style Scores system to find stocks with specific traits  For example  value investors will want to focus on the  Value  category  Stocks with high Zacks Ranks and  A  grades for Value will be some of the highest quality value stocks on the market today 
One stock to keep an eye on is MetLife  NYSE MET   MET is currently holding a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  and a Value grade of A  The stock has a Forward P E ratio of 7 93  This compares to its industry s average Forward P E of 8 98  MET s Forward P E has been as high as 8 99 and as low as 6 84  with a median of 8 04  all within the past year 
We also note that MET holds a PEG ratio of 0 95  This popular metric is similar to the widely known P E ratio  with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company s expected earnings growth rate  MET s PEG compares to its industry s average PEG of 1  Over the past 52 weeks  MET s PEG has been as high as 1 05 and as low as 0 54  with a median of 0 93

174788,396304,MET,Why MetLife  MET  Could Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well positioned to maintain its earnings beat streak in its upcoming report  It is worth considering MetLife  NYSE MET   which belongs to the Zacks Insurance   Multi line industry 
This insurer has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 9 59  
For the last reported quarter  MetLife came out with earnings of  1 38 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 31 per share  representing a surprise of 5 34   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  1 30 per share and it actually produced earnings of  1 48 per share  delivering a surprise of 13 85  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for MetLife lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
MetLife currently has an Earnings ESP of  0 28   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on October 30  2019 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-10-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-metlife-met-could-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200476933,200476933
174789,396305,MET,MetLife  MET  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"The market expects MetLife  NYSE MET  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on October 30  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This insurer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 41 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  2 2  
Revenues are expected to be  16 37 billion  down 0 2  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 35  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for MetLife 
For MetLife  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 28  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that MetLife will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that MetLife would post earnings of  1 31 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 38  delivering a surprise of  5 34  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
MetLife appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-10-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/metlife-met-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200476747,200476747

MetLife shares have added about 13 7  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 21 1  
What s Next for MetLife 
While MetLife has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for MetLife was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

174821,396337,MET,This Is Why MetLife  MET  Is A Great Dividend Stock,opinion,"Getting big returns from financial portfolios  whether through stocks  bonds  ETFs  other securities  or a combination of all  is an investor s dream  But when you re an income investor  your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments 
Cash flow can come from bond interest  interest from other types of investments  and of course  dividends  A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  and investors often view it by its dividend yield  a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long term returns  with dividend contributions exceeding one third of total returns in many cases 
MetLife  NYSE MET  in Focus
Based in New York  MetLife  MET  is in the Finance sector  and so far this year  shares have seen a price change of 23 09   The insurer is currently shelling out a dividend of  0 44 per share  with a dividend yield of 3 48   This compares to the Insurance   Multi line industry s yield of 2 25  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 89  
In terms of dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  1 76 is up 6  from last year  MetLife has increased its dividend 4 times on a year over year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 4 28   Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  MetLife s current payout ratio is 30   This means it paid out 30  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Looking at this fiscal year  MET expects solid earnings growth  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  5 60 per share  representing a year over year earnings growth rate of 3 90  
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits  It s important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout 
High growth firms or tech start ups  for example  rarely provide their shareholders a dividend  while larger  more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  With that in mind  MET is a compelling investment opportunity  Not only is it a strong dividend play  but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3  Hold  ",2019-07-08,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/this-is-why-metlife-met-is-a-great-dividend-stock-200438085,200438085
174822,396338,MET,MetLife  MET  Tops Q2 Earnings Estimates,opinion,"MetLife  NYSE MET  came out with quarterly earnings of  1 38 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 31 per share  This compares to earnings of  1 30 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 5 34   A quarter ago  it was expected that this insurer would post earnings of  1 30 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 48  delivering a surprise of 13 85  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
MetLife  which belongs to the Zacks Insurance   Multi line industry  posted revenues of  16 45 billion for the quarter ended June 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 25   This compares to year ago revenues of  21 22 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
MetLife shares have added about 21 8  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 20 2  
What s Next for MetLife 
While MetLife has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for MetLife was unfavorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  1 40 on  16 47 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  5 59 on  64 48 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year 
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  Insurance   Multi line is currently in the top 40  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2019-07-31,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/metlife-met-tops-q2-earnings-estimates-200448545,200448545

Mexico and Canada after FIFA s Congress voted overwhelmingly on Wednesday to support the joint bid over Morocco  despite reluctance in some countries to choose North America while President Donald Trump was in office and souring U S  relations with its neighbors  Trump  who has called for a wall to be built on the U S  southern border with Mexico to stem illegal immigration and just days ago attacked Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on trade issues  praised the outcome as the result of  a great deal of hard work  on his Twitter feed  Under Trump  relations between the United States  Canada and Mexico have plumbed new lows thanks to a dispute over the North American Free Trade Agreement  NAFTA   a  1 1 trillion trade pact that ties the three countries  economies together  The North Americans pledged their tournament would generate an  11 billion profit  which would be a financial shot in the arm for soccer s world governing body FIFA which has been rocked by a corruption and bribery scandal in the last three years that ensnared top officials  Morocco  which has now failed in five bids to host the World Cup  said theirs would make  5 billion  Although it will be the first World Cup to be hosted by three nations  the vast majority of matches will be held in the Unites States  As part of the bid  Trump pledged that those traveling to the United States for the tournament would not be subject to stringent visa restrictions  Even if Trump were to be elected for a second four year term in 2020 he would not be president when the World Cup kicks off in 2026  Trump had earlier warned that countries voting against the North American bid would suffer consequences  The president has regularly assailed world leaders like Germany s Angela Merkel and France s Emmanuel Macron for  ripping  America off over trade  On Twitter Trudeau said   Good news this morning  The 2026 FIFA World Cup is coming to Canada  the US and Mexico  Congratulations to everyone who worked hard on this bid   it s going to be a great tournament   The United States  Canada and Mexico were expected to qualify automatically for the tournament as has been the tradition for all World Cup host nations  After the bid some observers expressed hope that the  NAFTA World Cup  would rebuild cooperation between the three countries  Trump will be gone from office when the tournament does take place   See  Always better when we work together   Roberta Jacobson  ambassador to Mexico until May  wrote on her Twitter feed  The North American bid collected 134 votes to the 65 for Morocco

team event which begins in Russia on Thursday  Both bids were given a last chance to make their case with 15 minute presentations in front of the Congress at the Moscow Expocentre  Of the 80 games  60 will be held in the United States with 10 each in Canada and Mexico  The final will be played at MetLife  NYSE MET  Stadium in New Jersey  home to the National Football League s New York Giants and New York Jets  Ten of the eventual 16 chosen venues for the tournament will be in the United States with Mexico and Canada having three venues each  The U S previously hosted the World Cup in 1994 while Mexico staged it in 1970 and 1986  Canada has never staged a men s World Cup but it did hold the women s tournament in 2015  A U S  bid lost out in the vote eight years ago for the 2022 World Cup  which was handed to Qatar  and U S Soccer Federation president Carlos Cordiero said it had been a long road to get the tournament back to the country   It was overwhelmingly emotional for everyone  not just for myself  A lot of very hard work and effort has gone into this campaign    You know  we ran and lost eight years ago  We appreciated that as much as you can do  you are not guaranteed victory   he said  The Moroccan bid had expected a closer result and some of their backers felt they had been let down by potential allies   Of course  it s really sad because we were counting on our friends  the countries that are close to us  that are long time friends  And today they betrayed us   Moroccan Olympic champion runner Hicham El Guerrouj  who was active with the bid team  told Reuters   The last time FIFA voted on World Cup hosting rights was in 2010  the decision then resting with the old executive committee which chose Russia to host the 2018 finals and Qatar for 2022  Several members of that committee were later banned from the sport after they were caught up in the corruption scandal that engulfed world football s governing body in 2015  Under FIFA s new system for choosing the host  all eligible football federations who attend Congress were given a vote  The result has been a jet setting campaign from both bids  whose team members have traveled the globe in an attempt to win over the worldwide electorate  Cordeiro has said his bid would generate  14 billion in revenue and make an  11 billion profit for FIFA  The bid also expects record ticket

174836,396352,MET,Is MetLife  MET  Stock Undervalued Right Now ,opinion,"While the proven Zacks Rank places an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find strong stocks  we also know that investors tend to develop their own individual strategies  With this in mind  we are always looking at value  growth  and momentum trends to discover great companies 
Considering these trends  value investing is clearly one of the most preferred ways to find strong stocks in any type of market  Value investors rely on traditional forms of analysis on key valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are undervalued  leaving room for profits 
On top of the Zacks Rank  investors can also look at our innovative Style Scores system to find stocks with specific traits  For example  value investors will want to focus on the  Value  category  Stocks with high Zacks Ranks and  A  grades for Value will be some of the highest quality value stocks on the market today 
One company value investors might notice is MetLife  NYSE MET   MET is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   as well as an A grade for Value  The stock is trading with a P E ratio of 8 33  which compares to its industry s average of 9 18  Over the last 12 months  MET s Forward P E has been as high as 9 04 and as low as 6 84  with a median of 8 14 
We also note that MET holds a PEG ratio of 0 99  This figure is similar to the commonly used P E ratio  with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company s expected earnings growth rate  MET s PEG compares to its industry s average PEG of 1  Within the past year  MET s PEG has been as high as 0 99 and as low as 0 54  with a median of 0 72 
Another notable valuation metric for MET is its P B ratio of 0 79  The P B is a method of comparing a stock s market value to its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  MET s current P B looks attractive when compared to its industry s average P B of 1 47  Over the past 12 months  MET s P B has been as high as 0 92 and as low as 0 71  with a median of 0 83 
Value investors also love the P S ratio  which is calculated by simply dividing a stock s price with the company s sales  Some people prefer this metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement  This means it could be a truer performance indicator  MET has a P S ratio of 0 67  This compares to its industry s average P S of 1 04 
Value investors will likely look at more than just these metrics  but the above data helps show that MetLife is likely undervalued currently  And when considering the strength of its earnings outlook  MET sticks out at as one of the market s strongest value stocks ",2019-06-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-metlife-met-stock-undervalued-right-now-200432213,200432213
174837,396353,MET,MetLife Looks To Utilize Blockchain,opinion,"MetLife  NYSE MET    the largest player in a  2 7 trillion life insurance industry  recently announced a trial run of a completely revamped claims process  Blockchain  the technology underpinning cryptocurrency  will be utilized by MetLife in this significant procedural change  This may have a large impact  as the company has over 90 million customers in over 60 countries 
The Change
The company may be using the Ethereum blockchain to redo its life insurance claims network  This project is being run by and was developed at MetLife s incubator LumenLab in Singapore  LumenLab is partnering with Singapore Press Holdings and NTUC Income for the trial run 
A large problem with current life insurance is families with recently deceased loved ones forgetting to file for life insurance claims  or not knowing that their loved ones had a life insurance policy at all  This lack of information on both sides of the insurance policy is not beneficial for insurers or claimants 
MetLife s trial system looks at obituaries placed with Singapore Press Holdings  then takes the deceased s National Registration Identity Card number from the death certificate and encrypts it into the blockchain  NTUC then searches this number against its records to check for a policy match  If one is found  the family will be notified within one working day and an automatic email will be sent to the insurer to initiate the claims process 
Benefits
The efficiency and transparency of this claims process could result in huge benefits to consumers  Families of policy holders would likely be paid out quicker and with a higher rate of fulfilled claims  Using blockchain is also much more secure  as no piece of information in a block can be altered 
However  the benefit that the market would care about is that of profit margins  Using blockchain to process claims and notify families is much cheaper than the manual alternative  This could allow MetLife to spend less on administrative costs  and therefore generate greater earnings 
MetLife is currently a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  with style scores of A in Value and B in Momentum  Zacks Estimates projects strong year over year earnings growth of 4 08  for 2019 and 8 35  for 2020  Most analysts covering MetLife have revised up their earnings estimates for this year and next as well 
Also  important for long run benefits is the ease of expanding a decentralized network like the blockchain  MetLife could easily add other key stakeholders to the network  like the government or other insurance providers like Prudential  NYSE PUK   or Allianz  OTC AZSEY    However  one challenge with expanding is the potential need to utilize other blockchains like Bitcoin or Ripple due to the Ethereum currently only being able to handle an average of 13 transactions per second 
Long term Effects
With large companies like MetLife starting to experiment with and adopt blockchain technologies  it will likely further legitimize the blockchain and the cryptocurrencies based on it  One could even see a future where cryptocurrency is used to payout claims over the blockchain as well  Eventually  the entire insurance claims and payouts process could be completed over the blockchain in an efficient and completely secure manner

price to sales ratio is 1  it means that investors are paying  1 for every  1 of revenues generated by the company  So  it goes without saying that a stock with a price to sales below 1 is a good bargain  as investors need to pay less than a dollar for a dollar s worth Thus  a stock with a lower price to sales ratio is a more suitable investment than a stock with a high price to sales ratio When considering valuation metrics  price to earnings ratio has always been the obvious choice  This is because calculations based on earnings are easy and come in handy  However  price to sales has emerged as a convenient tool to determine the value of stocks that are incurring losses or are in an early cycle of development  generating meager or no profits While a loss making company with a negative price to earnings ratio falls out of investor favor  its price to sales could indicate the hidden strength of its business  This underrated ratio is also used to identify a recovery situation or ensure that a company s growth is not overvalued Price to sales is often preferred over price to earnings as companies can manipulate their earnings using various accounting measures  However  sales are harder to manipulate and are relatively reliable However  one should keep in mind that a company with high debt and low price to sales is not an ideal choice  The high debt level will have to be paid off at some point  leading to further share issuance  rise in market cap and ultimately a higher price to sales ratio In any case  the price to sales ratio used in isolation cannot do the trick  One should also analyze other ratios like Price Earnings  Price Book and Debt Equity before arriving at any investment decision For the rest of this Screen of the Week article please visit

174851,396367,MET,MetLife  MET  Surpasses Q1 Earnings Estimates,opinion,"MetLife  NYSE MET  came out with quarterly earnings of  1 48 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 30 per share  This compares to earnings of  1 36 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 13 85   A quarter ago  it was expected that this insurer would post earnings of  1 30 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 35  delivering a surprise of 3 85  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
MetLife  which belongs to the Zacks Insurance   Multi line industry  posted revenues of  16 17 billion for the quarter ended March 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 33   This compares to year ago revenues of  15 14 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
MetLife shares have added about 12 4  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 17 5  
What s Next for MetLife 
While MetLife has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for MetLife was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  1 36 on  16 38 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  5 48 on  64 36 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year

174853,396369,MET,MetLife  MET  Is A Top Dividend Stock Right Now  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Getting big returns from financial portfolios  whether through stocks  bonds  ETFs  other securities  or a combination of all  is an investor s dream  But when you re an income investor  your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments 
Cash flow can come from bond interest  interest from other types of investments  and of course  dividends  A dividend is the distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  it s often viewed by its dividend yield  a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long term returns  and in many cases  dividend contributions surpass one third of total returns 
MetLife  NYSE MET  in Focus
Headquartered in New York  MetLife  MET  is a Finance stock that has seen a price change of 16 02  so far this year  The insurer is currently shelling out a dividend of  0 44 per share  with a dividend yield of 3 69   This compares to the Insurance   Multi line industry s yield of 2 39  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 95  
In terms of dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  1 76 is up 6  from last year  MetLife has increased its dividend 4 times on a year over year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 4 22   Looking ahead  future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  MetLife s current payout ratio is 30   meaning it paid out 30  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
MET is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  5 61 per share  representing a year over year earnings growth rate of 4 08  
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for many reasons  they greatly improve stock investing profits  decrease overall portfolio risk  and carry tax advantages  among others  But  not every company offers a quarterly payout 
Big  established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  but it s fairly uncommon to see high growth businesses or tech start ups offer their stockholders a dividend  Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  With that in mind  MET is a compelling investment opportunity  Not only is it a strong dividend play  but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3  Hold  ",2019-05-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/metlife-met-is-a-top-dividend-stock-right-now-should-you-buy-200422542,200422542

174858,396374,MET,Should Value Investors Consider MetLife  MET  Stock Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put MetLife  Inc    NYSE MET   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  MetLife has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 8 77  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 17 77  If we focus on the long term PE trend  MetLife s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  Moreover  the current level is fairly below the highs for this stock  suggesting it might be a good entry point Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 14 25  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that MetLife has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 8 61  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for MetLife stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  MetLife has a P S ratio of about 0 67  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 21 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  MET is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  MetLife currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes MetLife a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for MetLife is just 1 02  a level that is lower than the industry average of 1 13  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Additionally  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 9 40  which is slightly better than the industry average of 9 66  Clearly  MET is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though MetLife might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of D and a Momentum score of C  This gives MET a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days compared to two lower  while the full year estimate has seen five upward and zero downward revisions in the same time period As a result  the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen by 1 5  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has increased 2 4   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below MetLife  Inc  Price and Consensus    Despite this somewhat mixed trend  the stock has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  on the back of its strong value metrics and this is why we are expecting outperformance from the company in the near term Bottom LineMetLife is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Furthermore  a robust industry rank  among the Top 4   and a solid Zacks Rank instills investor confidence However  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall as over the past two years  the industry has underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates  analyst sentiment and broader factors to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Breakout Biotech

174872,396388,MET,Why MetLife  MET  Is A Great Dividend Stock Right Now,opinion,"All investors love getting big returns from their portfolio  whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  But for income investors  generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus 
Cash flow can come from bond interest  interest from other types of investments  and of course  dividends  A dividend is the distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  it s often viewed by its dividend yield  a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long term returns  with dividend contributions exceeding one third of total returns in many cases 
MetLife  NYSE MET  in Focus
MetLife  MET  is headquartered in New York  and is in the Finance sector  The stock has seen a price change of 8 55  since the start of the year  The insurer is paying out a dividend of  0 42 per share at the moment  with a dividend yield of 3 77  compared to the Insurance   Multi line industry s yield of 2 18  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 96  
Looking at dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  1 68 is up 1 2  from last year  Over the last 5 years  MetLife has increased its dividend 4 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 5 76   Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  MetLife s current payout ratio is 31   meaning it paid out 31  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Looking at this fiscal year  MET expects solid earnings growth  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  5 48 per share  which represents a year over year growth rate of 1 67  
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits  It s important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout 
For instance  it s a rare occurrence when a tech start up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend  It s more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends  During periods of rising interest rates  income investors must be mindful that high yielding stocks tend to struggle  With that in mind  MET is a compelling investment opportunity  Not only is it a strong dividend play  but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3  Hold  ",2019-03-11,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-metlife-met-is-a-great-dividend-stock-right-now-200396831,200396831
174873,396389,MET,Will MetLife  MET  Beat Estimates Again In Its Next Earnings Report ,opinion,"If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report  you should consider MetLife  NYSE MET   This company  which is in the Zacks Insurance   Multi line industry  shows potential for another earnings beat 
This insurer has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 7 12  
For the most recent quarter  MetLife was expected to post earnings of  1 30 per share  but it reported  1 35 per share instead  representing a surprise of 3 85   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  1 25 per share  while it actually produced  1 38 per share  a surprise of 10 40  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for MetLife lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
MetLife has an Earnings ESP of  2 79  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on May 1  2019 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate

MetLife  NYSE MET  in Focus
MetLife  MET  is headquartered in New York  and is in the Finance sector  The stock has seen a price change of 11 69  since the start of the year  The insurer is currently shelling out a dividend of  0 42 per share  with a dividend yield of 3 66   This compares to the Insurance   Multi line industry s yield of 2 3  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 89

Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits  But  not every company offers a quarterly payout

174876,396392,MET,Earnings Preview  MetLife  MET  Q1 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when MetLife  NYSE MET  reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on May 1  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This insurer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 30 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  4 4  
Revenues are expected to be  16 23 billion  up 7 2  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 74  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for MetLife 
For MetLife  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 11  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that MetLife will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that MetLife would post earnings of  1 30 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 35  delivering a surprise of  3 85  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
MetLife doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-metlife-met-q1-earnings-expected-to-decline-200410252,200410252

The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
MetLife shares have added about 12 4  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 17 5  
What s Next for MetLife 
While MetLife has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for MetLife was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  1 36 on  16 38 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  5 48 on  64 36 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year

174898,396414,MET,Sesame Street goes global to teach kids about money,news,"By Chris Taylor NEW YORK  Reuters    Translating money messages to 100 million kids around the world is not a feat for ordinary humans   you need monsters   Elmo and Cookie Monster  to be specific   These two and their furry band of Muppets have been part of Sesame Workshop s  Dream  Save  Do  program  a joint venture of Sesame Street and the MetLife  NYSE MET  Foundation  Operating for the last four years  the initiative has been leveraging famous Sesame characters to foster financial empowerment for families in nine countries  Mexico  Brazil  Chile  China  Japan  India  Bangladesh  Egypt and the U A E  The outreach has so far been a whopping success in terms of the numbers reached  Sesame Workshop concluded at a summit last month that brought together country directors  The most difficult challenge they identified was how hard it was to translate money messages across different countries and cultures  One example  A Cookie Monster cartoon about the concept of delayed gratification   which involved waiting for an apple pie to bake   did not make much sense in the Chinese diet  So what did they do  They changed the desired object to dumplings   and it was a hit  In India  the idea of  work  was conveyed by the image of a woman sewing  in Brazil  it was someone answering a phone in an office  In some countries  water  was a tap in a crowded alley  in others it was a sink in a home  In China  there is no huge need to teach kids about the concept of saving   because all of them are doing it  Many  even at extremely young ages  are planning for college or thinking about their first house  So instead of focusing on saving  local course designers in China tacked towards teaching other financial behaviors like sharing or donating   Every lesson has core common elements  but it also tailored to the local market  which is the real magic of it   said April Hawkins  an assistant VP at the MetLife Foundation who helps steward the program  Sesame Workshop also had to be flexible about how it got the word out  For instance  in the slums of India s New Delhi  a typical structured classroom setting just was not going to be possible   So in the narrow alleyways of Delhi  we ended up using vegetable carts   said Shari Rosenfeld  Sesame Workshop s Senior VP for international social impact   We set up DVD players to broadcast our materials  hooked them up to car batteries  loaded them onto carts  and kids and their families would all gather around   RESTORING HOPE In some countries  even the name of the program itself was changed  In areas where there is not a lot of money kicking around  and poor kids might not be able to  save  much of anything  the program title was altered to  Dream  Plan  Do   And which characters  exactly  were tapped to spread the money messages  Not The Count  as you might expect  given his obvious passion for numbers  Instead  Sesame Street already has an entire cast of popular foreign characters at their disposal  There are existing stars like Lola in Mexico  Chamki in India  Bel in Brazil and Lily in China   all smart  confident young female characters  In one popular piece of content  all those girl characters from around the globe gathered to sing a song about female empowerment  goal setting and achievement  So what is next for Dream  Save  Do  It could very well be the global refugee crisis  Many children have lost everything  so what do you tell a child like that   
 Hope is often lost in communities that have experienced such trauma and distress   says Nada Elattar  Sesame Workshop s director of educational programs   So that is something we have to focus on next  The idea of having dreams for yourself  and setting goals  as a way to restore hope  ",2017-11-13,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/sesame-street-goes-global-to-teach-kids-about-money-850842,850842

174902,396418,MET,Dollar Drives Higher,opinion,"Wednesday  February 6  Five Things The Markets Are Talking About 
European equities are on the back foot after a surprise drop in German factory orders this morning added to signs that the region s strongest economy is struggling  The EUR   1 1380  has fallen to its lowest level outright in a fortnight on the news after German manufacturing orders had dropped by  1 6  from November  This has confused market consensus  who were expecting a  0 3  rise 
Even U S  stock futures seem unfazed by President Trump s State of the Union address last night  which has proved  fairly uneventful   Nevertheless  the  big  dollar has extended its gains alongside U S  Treasuries 
Asia overnight saw another muted session  with trading rested mostly by the Lunar New Year holidays  Down under  Australia s dollar tumbled after the RBA s Governor Lowe indicated a shift to a  neutral  stance on monetary policy 
Later this evening  capital markets will be looking for some directional clues from Fed Chair Powell s first public comments  07 00 pm EDT  following last month s monetary policy meeting and interest rate  decision 
On Tap  Earnings season continues  with reports from Twitter Inc  NYSE TWTR  and MetLife  NYSE MET  
1  Stocks Battered And Bruised
Markets were closed in China  Hong Kong  Korea  Malaysia  Singapore  Taiwan and also in New Zealand 
In Japan  the Nikkei edged a tad higher overnight despite investors barely reacting to Trump s State of the Union address  Their attention remains on corporate earnings  The Nikkei share average rallied  0 1  while the broader Topix declined  0 1  
Down under  Aussie shares edged higher as fears of an iron ore supply shortage supported mining stocks  but gains were capped by a profit miss from one of the country s top financial lenders   Commonwealth Bank of Australia   the S P ASX 200 index closed up  0 3   The benchmark surged  2  on Tuesday 
Note  the U S  and Chinese officials are poised to start another round of trade talks in Beijing next week to try and avert a March 2 increase in U S  tariffs on Chinese goods

2  Oil Higher  But Global Outlook Caps Gains  Gold Little Changed
Oil prices are a tad higher for the first time in three sessions ahead of the open stateside  although market concerns over the outlook for the global economy have capped gains

Analysts note that there are currently little signs of any overhang in the market now that the U S  has imposed sanctions on Venezuela  on top of the reduced supply from Saudi Arabia 
Note  Last week  the U S  administration announced export sanctions against state owned oil firm Petroleos de Venezuela SA  approx   500k bpd    this has led to some disruption for oil refineries on the Gulf coast  They have had to seek alternative heavy crude supplies from Canada 
OPEC supply fell this month by the largest amount in two years  which has helped to offset limited compliance so far by non OPEC Russia 
Nevertheless  API data yesterday showed that U S  crude stocks rose last week even as refineries boosted output  while  gasoline and distillate stocks also increased   crude inventories rose by  2 5M barrels in the week ended Feb  1 to  448 2M  compared with expectations for an increase of  2 2M barrels 
Ahead of the open stateside  gold prices are holding firm after U S  President Trump in his State of the Union speech again promised to build a border wall and gave little clarity over the ongoing trade discussions with China  However  the  yellow  metals gains have been somewhat offset by a stronger U S  dollar  Spot gold is steady at   1 314 per ounce  while gold futures are also steady at   1 318 an ounce 

3  Reserve Bank of Australia  RBA  Shifts To  Neutral 
The AUD  A 0 7136  has been hit hard in the overnight session on news the RBA has adopted a neutral policy bias  stating that the Australian economy  could be weaker than it thinks and that the risks to the economic outlook are more balanced  
Nevertheless  Governor Lowe remains upbeat on the Aussie job market but has given the RBA the latitude to cut interest rates should growth fall short of expectations and the unemployment rate start to rise 
Elsewhere  the yield on 10 year Treasuries has decreased by  2 bps to  2 68   In Germany  the 10 year Bund yield has fallen  1 bps to  0 16   while in the U K  the 10 year Gilt yield has dipped  2 bps to  1 209   In Japan  the 10 year JGP yield has declined less than  1 bps to  0 013  

4  Dollar Drives Higher 
EUR USD   1 1395  is a tad softer by  0 2  and holding below the psychological  1 14 level  The  single  unit of choice has come under pressure after Germany December Factory Orders  see below  continued the string of disappointing European data

AUD USD  A 0 7136  is on track for its biggest decline in 12 months after the RBA tweaked its forward rate guidance to a more  dovish  stance  RBA now sees its rate outlook as more  evenly balanced  compared to the prior view that next rate move was likely to be higher 

5  German manufacturing orders collapsed in December

174904,396420,MET,Why MetLife  MET  Is A Top Dividend Stock For Your Portfolio,opinion,"Getting big returns from financial portfolios  whether through stocks  bonds  ETFs  other securities  or a combination of all  is an investor s dream  But for income investors  generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus 
While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments  income investors hone in on dividends  A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  and investors often view it by its dividend yield  a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long term returns  with dividend contributions exceeding one third of total returns in many cases 
MetLife  NYSE MET  in Focus
Based in New York  MetLife  MET  is in the Finance sector  and so far this year  shares have seen a price change of 10 08   Currently paying a dividend of  0 42 per share  the company has a dividend yield of 3 72   In comparison  the Insurance   Multi line industry s yield is 2 14   while the S P 500 s yield is 1 97  
Looking at dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  1 68 is up 1 2  from last year  Over the last 5 years  MetLife has increased its dividend 4 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 5 76   Looking ahead  future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  MetLife s current payout ratio is 33   meaning it paid out 33  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Earnings growth looks solid for MET for this fiscal year  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  5 53 per share  with earnings expected to increase 2 60  from the year ago period 
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for many reasons  they greatly improve stock investing profits  decrease overall portfolio risk  and carry tax advantages  among others  But  not every company offers a quarterly payout 
Big  established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  but it s fairly uncommon to see high growth businesses or tech start ups offer their stockholders a dividend  During periods of rising interest rates  income investors must be mindful that high yielding stocks tend to struggle  With that in mind  MET is a compelling investment opportunity  Not only is it a strong dividend play  but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3  Hold  ",2019-02-06,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-metlife-met-is-a-top-dividend-stock-for-your-portfolio-200385225,200385225

174915,396431,MET,U S  Treasury pushes back on bank like rules for asset managers  insurers,news,By Michelle Price and Pete Schroeder WASHINGTON  Reuters    The U S  Treasury on Thursday rejected the idea of singling out specific asset management and insurance firms as systemically risky  indicating that they are unlikely to be designated as  too big to fail  and slapped with additional oversight under the administration of President Donald Trump  The report will be cheered by the likes of BlackRock BLK N  Vanguard  Fidelity FGL  and Pimco  which have pushed back on attempts by regulators to impose bank like  systemically risky  labels on asset managers simply because they hold trillions of dollars in assets under management  The Treasury s 176 page report shines a spotlight on two massive financial industries that have attracted less political and regulatory scrutiny in the wake of the global financial crisis than the banking industry  In its recommendations  Treasury broadly rejected the idea those companies should be regulated like banks  It also encouraged regulators  both domestic and international  to streamline rules across both industries and to encourage consumer access to products and services   We are recommending more efficient and effective regulation to give consumers access to the products they need while providing individuals with opportunities to save for retirement   Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement  The report is the third of four expected from Treasury as it completes a comprehensive review of existing financial rules  as mandated by an executive order from President Donald Trump in February  The previous two reports focused on banks and capital markets  The Treasury does not directly oversee asset managers or insurers  which are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission  SEC  and at a state level respectively  but the report is likely to influence regulators  approach to the industries  DESIGNATION FIGHT In the wake of the global financial crisis  regulators drew up a list of big banks and insurers that posed a risk to the broader financial system and subjected them to greater scrutiny  The development sparked a fierce debate over whether asset managers such as BlackRock should be added to the list  The Financial Stability Oversight Council  charged with monitoring systemic risks  opted in 2014 not to designate asset managers as systemically risky following fierce pushback from large firms  On Thursday  the Treasury said the company focused designation approach is not suited to the asset management and insurance industries  arguing instead that regulators should focus on risky activities  Its finding effectively shuts the door on the U S  asset management debate and should boost insurers  efforts to shake off the label  Currently   Prudential   LON PRU  FinancialPRU N is the only insurance company designated as  systemically significant  after the council voted in September to remove that label from American International GroupAIG N  MetLife  NYSE MET  successfully contested its label in court in 2016  and the government s appeal in that case is on hold awaiting the Treasury s review  Thursday s report suggested the government may drop that case  The Treasury on Thursday also pushed back on international efforts to more closely scrutinize asset managers  It called for the Financial Stability Board   the global body comprised of central banks that had pushed for managers to be deemed systemically risky   to stop describing asset management as  shadow banking   which could suggest the sector is lacking in oversight  While Treasury seemed to endorse SEC rules introduced following the crisis to mitigate liquidity crunches in the fund management industry  it rejected further measures including the idea that managers should be subject to  stress tests  similar to banks  In a recommendation that could spark a minor shake up in the SEC s investment management division  the Treasury recommended the SEC move to a single streamlined process for approving exchange traded funds  The Treasury also recommended the Labor Department continue to delay its  fiduciary rule  that sets higher standards for investment advisers  That rule  finalized under President Barack Obama  has been put on hold by the Trump administration and is being revised after industry pushback ,2017-10-27,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/us-treasury-pushes-back-on-banklike-rules-for-asset-managers-insurers-548904,548904

174918,396434,MET,MetLife  MET  Gains As Market Dips  What You Should Know,opinion,"MetLife  NYSE MET  closed the most recent trading day at  43 72  moving  0 81  from the previous trading session  This move outpaced the S P 500 s daily loss of 0 02   Elsewhere  the Dow lost 0 03   while the tech heavy Nasdaq lost 0 21  
Prior to today s trading  shares of the insurer had gained 9 74  over the past month  This has outpaced the Finance sector s gain of 0 62  and the S P 500 s loss of 1 4  in that time 
MET will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release  which is expected to be February 12  2019  In that report  analysts expect MET to post earnings of  1 31 per share  This would mark year over year growth of 18 02   Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of  16 33 billion  up 3 41  from the year ago period 
Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for MET  These revisions typically reflect the latest short term business trends  which can change frequently  As a result  we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company s business outlook 
Based on our research  we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near team stock moves  We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon  Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear  actionable rating model 
The Zacks Rank system  which ranges from  1  Strong Buy  to  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive outside audited track record of outperformance  with  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  Over the past month  the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0 46  higher  MET is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  
Looking at its valuation  MET is holding a Forward P E ratio of 7 77  Its industry sports an average Forward P E of 10 91  so we one might conclude that MET is trading at a discount comparatively 
We can also see that MET currently has a PEG ratio of 0 62  This popular metric is similar to the widely known P E ratio  with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company s expected earnings growth rate  The Insurance   Multi line industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 0 98 as of yesterday s close 
The Insurance   Multi line industry is part of the Finance sector  This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 46  putting it in the top 18  of all 250  industries 
The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups  Our research shows that the top 50  rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1

174921,396437,MET,MetLife  MET  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when MetLife  NYSE MET  reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 6  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This insurer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 30 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  17 1  
Revenues are expected to be  16 33 billion  up 3 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 28  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for MetLife 
For MetLife  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 49  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that MetLife will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that MetLife would post earnings of  1 25 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 38  delivering a surprise of  10 40  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
MetLife doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-29,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/metlife-met-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200381232,200381232

174940,396456,MET,6 Promising Price to Book Value Stocks To Buy Now,opinion,Value analysis is the best approach to identify great bargains  Though price to earnings  P E  and price to sales  P S  valuation tools are more commonly used for stock selection  the price to book ratio  P B ratio  is also an easy to use metric for identifying low priced stocks with high growth prospects The P B ratio  sometimes called the market to book ratio  is used to calculate how much an investor needs to pay for each dollar of book value of a stock  It is calculated by dividing the current closing price of the stock by the latest quarter s book value per share P B ratio   market capitalization book value of equityWhat is Book Value There are several ways by which book value can be defined  Book value is the total value that would be left over  according to the company s balance sheet  if it goes bankrupt immediately  In other words  this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off its liabilities It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company  In most cases  this equates to the common stockholders  equity on the balance sheet  However  depending on the company s balance sheet  intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine the book value Understanding P B RatioBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price  we get an idea of whether a company is under  or overpriced  However  like P E or P S ratio  it is always better to compare P B ratios within industries  A P B ratio less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value  or the stock is undervalued and therefore a good buy  Conversely  a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive For example  a stock with a P B ratio of 2 means that we pay  2 for every  1 of book value  Thus  the higher the P B  the more expensive the stock But there is a caveat  A P B ratio less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets  or that the assets are overstated  in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value  Conversely  the stock s price may be significantly high   thereby pushing the P B ratio to more than one   in the likely case that it has become a takeover target  a good enough reason to own the stock Moreover  the P B ratio isn t without limitations  It is useful for businesses   like finance  investments  insurance and banking or manufacturing companies   with many liquid tangible assets on the books  However  it can be misleading for firms with significant R D expenditure  high debt  service companies or those with negative earnings In any case  the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number  One should analyze other ratios like P E  P S and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision Screening ParametersPrice to Book  common Equity  less than X Industry Median  A lower P B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain Price to Sales less than X Industry Median  The P S ratio determines how much the market values every dollar of the company s sales revenues   a lower ratio than the industry makes the stock attractive Price to Earnings using F 1  estimate less than X Industry Median  The P E ratio  F1  values a company based on its current share price relative to its estimated earnings per share   a lower ratio than the industry is considered better PEG less than 1  PEG ratio links the P E ratio to the future growth rate of the company  PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P E ratio  A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and investors need to pay less for a stock that has bright earnings growth prospects Current Price greater than or equal to  5

174979,396495,MET,7 Valuable Price to Sales Stocks For A Winning Portfolio,opinion,When considering valuation metrics  price to earnings ratio has always been the obvious choice  This is because calculations based on earnings are easy and come in handy  However  price to sales has emerged as a convenient tool to determine the value of stocks that are incurring losses or are in an early cycle of development  generating meager or no profits While a loss making company with a negative price to earnings ratio falls out of investor favor  its price to sales could indicate the hidden strength of its business  This underrated ratio is also used to identify a recovery situation or ensure that a company s growth is not overvalued A stock s price to sales ratio reflects how much investors are paying for each dollar of revenues generated by the company If the price to sales ratio is 1  it means that investors are paying  1 for every  1 of revenues generated by the company  So  it goes without saying that a stock with a price to sales below 1 is a good bargain  as investors need to pay less than a dollar for a dollar s worth   Thus  a stock with a lower price to sales ratio is a more suitable investment than a stock with a high price to sales ratio Price to sales is often preferred over price to earnings as companies can manipulate their earnings using various accounting measures  However  sales are harder to manipulate and are relatively reliable However  one should keep in mind that a company with high debt and low price to sales is not an ideal choice  The high debt level will have to be paid off at some point  leading to further share issuance  rise in market cap and ultimately a higher price to sales ratio In any case  the price to sales ratio used in isolation cannot do the trick  One should also analyze other ratios like Price Earnings  Price Book and Debt Equity before arriving at any investment decision Screening ParametersPrice to Sales less than Median Price to Sales for its Industry  The lower the price to sales ratio  the better Price to Earnings using F 1  estimate less than Median Price to Earnings for its Industry  The lower  the better Price to Book  common Equity  less than Median Price to Book for its Industry  This is another parameter to ensure the value feature of a stock Debt to Equity  Most Recent  less than Median

174993,396509,MET,U S  Treasury chief defends Dodd Frank s regulator council,news,"By Lisa Lambert
WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  Treasury Secretary Jack Lew on Wednesday offered a heartfelt defense of the Financial Stability Oversight Council made up of the heads of the major regulatory agencies  which is often criticized by Republicans and could be under threat next year 
The council was created to respond to threats to the financial system in 2010 s Dodd Frank Wall Street reform law  which President elect Donald Trump has said he wants to revise  Its powers would be severely limited under legislation from Republican Representative Jeb Hensarling that Trump is expected to use as a blueprint for overhauling Dodd Frank after he assumes office on Jan  20 
At the council s final public meeting of the year  Lew  who serves as its chair  said it was fundamental to protecting the safety and soundness of the financial system and that the council has made the federal government better equipped to respond to risks and potential financial shocks 
 We ve been fact based and analytical in our approach  And we ve acted only occasionally but prudently and cautiously when risks have required a response   he said   We must resist complacency and remain vigilant to future unrest  I expect the council to continue its mission with skill  care and diligence  
The most powerful public officials in the U S  financial universe are among the council s members  including Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Mary Jo White and Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen 
Even if Trump does not strip its authorities  the council s character will change under his administration when he selects a new Treasury Secretary and replaces the agency heads 
Republicans have said the council is secretive and unwilling to share information 
Moreover  they are concerned about its authority to label non banking companies as  too big to fail   which triggers additional capital requirements 
Currently  the council is appealing a federal court decision that it used an arbitrary and capricious process in deciding major insurer MetLife Inc  N MET  could devastate the financial system if it were to collapse

174994,396510,MET,Wall St  lawyers say retiree investment rule violates free speech,news," This Nov  22 story corrects title of Eugene Scalia in paragraph 16 to co counsel  not lead plaintiff s attorney  By Elizabeth Dilts NEW YORK  Reuters    A group of lawyers representing insurance and securities brokerages have made a curious argument for why a federal court should kill a rule aimed at protecting retirement savers  It restricts Wall Street s First Amendment rights  In front of a packed federal courtroom in Dallas last week  plaintiffs attorneys fighting the Labor Department s fiduciary rule said it hinders free speech because it restricts what individuals selling retirement products will be able to say  The rule requires that brokers who give retirement advice act in their clients  best interest  The Labor Department  which regulates pension funds and other retirement income  devised the rule in order to protect retirement savers from receiving biased advice or being sold products they don t need  David Ogden  lawyer for the American Council of Life Insurers  argued in court that the rule would prevent simple sales pitches like   Buy my product  it s a good product  here s what it will do for you   The insurance industry would be affected by the rule because insurers sell annuities  Big business has used similar tactics in cases related to product labeling  pharmaceutical sales and securities disclosures  with mixed success  Experts said the First Amendment argument may be persuasive in this case  which may eventually come before the Supreme Court  because the burdens of the rule will force even honest salespeople to limit what they say to clients   Recent cases have made clear that the First Amendment provides broad protection for commercial speech that is truthful and non misleading   said Floyd Abrams  a leading First Amendment rights lawyer with Cahill Gordon   Reindel  who successfully defended The New York Times in landmark litigation   It s a close case   The fiduciary rule has been a contentious subject for nearly six years  and its release in April led Wall Street to quickly file several lawsuits to block its implementation  It is set to take effect in April next year  Regulators and consumer advocates have argued that the rule is important and necessary  Financial firms have countered that it is overly burdensome and expensive  Other lawsuits have largely relied on the notion that the Labor Department overreached in creating the rule  The Dallas plaintiffs also use those arguments  but are the only ones to mention First Amendment obstacles  Labor Department lawyers argued the fiduciary rule only governs conduct  not speech  Even if it did regulate speech  they said  it only covers misleading and conflicted statements  which are not protected by the First Amendment  U S  District Judge Barbara Lynn pressed the government on its position  saying the fiduciary rule appears to regulate more than just misleading speech   They can recommend any products they like  as long as they re not recommending products that aren t in the investor s best interest   Labor Department defense attorney Emily Newton responded  The agency estimates bad advice will cost investors  95 billion over the next 10 years if the fiduciary rule is not implemented  Among the lawyers representing the industry is Eugene Scalia  who has successfully argued for corporations and trade groups in other high profile cases  Earlier this year he convinced a federal judge to strike down MetLife  NYSE MET  Inc s designation as a financial company that is  systemically important   which would subject it to tougher regulation  His father was the late U S  Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia  a conservative who often sided with big business in landmark cases that protected or created corporate rights  Lawyers said the outcome of the various fiduciary rule proceedings is far from clear  If the judge in Dallas decides in Wall Street s favor  it could create a split among circuit courts  That might put the case on a path to the Supreme Court  which currently has a vacant seat  
The court may or may not accept the case  Advisers to President elect Donald Trump have indicated he will appoint a justice who wants to abolish the rule ",2016-11-24,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/wall-street-lawyers-say-retiree-investment-rule-violates-free-speech-443124,443124

175009,396525,MET,This Is Like Buying In March 2009 And Knowing What Happens Next,opinion,"Today I m going to show you how to tap safe dividends so massive  they were only available once before in in our lifetimes and even then for mere days 
The dividend yields I m talking about are more than enough to transform your retirement  with reliable payouts of 7 5   8 0  even 10  and up 
I ll also show you a one step indicator that reveals  quickly and easily  just how safe your stocks  payouts are  It s so reliable it held strong in the toughest battleground you could ask for  the 2008 09 meltdown 
A Battle Tested  1 Click  Strategy for Finding Safe Dividends
When most dividend investors think of early March 2009  they don t see it as a golden age for income 
But it was 
And that s not because the market has delivered a 320  price gain since March 9 of  09 the day the S P 500 bottomed out after the Great Recession  though there s certainly nothing wrong with more than tripling your money in 9 years   
What I really want to bring up from that time is the immense dividends that were on sale 
Because back in early March 2009  the S P 500 s average dividend yield spiked all the way up to 4 0   its highest level since at least 1994  and likely way before   when the ultra popular SPDR S P 500 ETF  NYSE SPY  launched 
A Dividend Yield for the Ages
And that 4 0  was just what the ETF paid  Buying any one of a who s who of S P names in March  09 would have triggered a cash geyser that was double or even triple what the same stocks pay today 
An Income Investor s Paradise
Why am I telling you this now 
For one  because I ve found a secret way for you to  force  blue chip names just like these to pay you massive  2009 style dividend yields today 
It s true  More on that in just a second  though 
First  I want to get back to that crash proof dividend safety indicator I told you about off the top  Back in 2009  when everyone was fleeing in terror  it told us that each of the 5 seemingly too good to be true payouts above was safe and ripe for buying 
2009 s Vital Lesson for Dividend Investors
Before I show you what this indicator is  let s take a step back and quickly look at how dividend yields are calculated 
You get the dividend yield by dividing the current annual dividend into the share price  so there are only two reasons why a dividend would spike  like the payouts of many stocks did back in  09 
 A company hikes its payout  and the share price hasn t caught up to the increase yet 
As I wrote in  10 Dividend Doublers Ready to Soar   share prices eventually march upward with a rising dividend  which is why the dividend yield on your favorite stocks tends to remain in a tight range  If you spot a stock whose price lags its rising dividend  it s likely a terrific buying opportunity  Or  
 The stock price craters  This one requires more investigation  If  for example  we were to find ourselves in a situation like 2009  where great companies are getting tossed out with the bad  it s time to buy 
But how do you tell which dividends are safe when everyone is running for the exits with their hair on fire 
One simple indicator  the cash dividend payout ratio or the percentage of free cash flow  FCF  headed out the door as dividends 
Why free cash flow 
Because unlike net income  which can be manipulated   FCF is a snapshot of the amount of cash a company is generating once it s paid the cost of growing and maintaining its business  You calculate it by subtracting capital expenditures from cash flow from operating activities  you can find both figures under the  Financials  tab on Yahoo Finance  
And if you d glanced at this one key indicator in  09  you would have quickly seen that all 5 of the high yields above were reliable  with ratios right around  or well below  my  half cash flow  half payouts  rule of safety  meaning I prefer to see this ratio under 50   
Safe Payouts  Then and Now
And how did these five dividends hold up over the last 9 years 
Our 5 low FCF payers in  09 did just fine  thank you very much  rewarding investors with steady dividend growth on top of their high yields  with zero dividend cuts 
If that s not a solid demonstration of the power of the FCF payout ratio  I don t know what is   Note that the reduction you see from MetLife  NYSE MET  below stems from a switch from annual to quarterly payouts the yearly rate has actually risen 127   
Payout Ratio Bet Pays Off
The bottom line 
While you shouldn t rely on just one indicator to predict dividend safety  other cues  such as low debt  rising cash flow and a firm s dividend history are also key   the FCF payout ratio is the most powerful indicator there is and a great place to start

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 10 40   A quarter ago  it was expected that this insurer would post earnings of  1 17 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 30  delivering a surprise of 11 11  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
MetLife  which belongs to the Zacks Insurance   Multi line industry  posted revenues of  16 40 billion for the quarter ended September 2018  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1 65   This compares to year ago revenues of  16 78 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
MetLife shares have lost about 18 5  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 1 4  
What s Next for MetLife 
While MetLife has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for MetLife was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

175032,396548,MET,Zacks com Featured Highlights Include  United Natural  Metlife  ArcelorMittal  Louisiana Pacific And Domtar,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   May 29  2018   Stocks in this week s article United Natural Foods  Inc    NASDAQ UNFI    Metlife Inc    NYSE MET    ArcelorMittal   NYSE MT    Louisiana Pacific Corp    NYSE LPX   and Domtar Corporation   TO UFS   Valuable Low Price to Sales Stocks to Garner Good ProfitsA stock s price to sales ratio reflects how much investors are paying for each dollar of revenues generated by the company If the price to sales ratio is 1  it means that investors are paying  1 for every  1 of revenues generated by the company  So  it goes without saying that a stock with a price to sales below 1 is a good bargain  as investors need to pay less than a dollar for a dollar s worth   Thus  a stock with a lower price to sales ratio is a more suitable investment versus a stock with a high price to sales ratio When considering valuation metrics  price to earnings ratio has always been the obvious choice as calculations based on earnings are easy and come in handy  However  price to sales has emerged as a convenient tool to determine the value of stocks that are incurring losses or are in an early cycle of development  generating meager or no profits While a loss making company with a negative price to earnings ratio falls out of investor favor  price to sales could indicate the hidden strength of its business  This underrated ratio is also used to identify a recovery situation or ensure that a company s growth is not overvalued Price to sales is often preferred over price to earnings as companies can manipulate their earnings using various accounting measures  However  sales are harder to manipulate and are relatively reliable However  one should keep in mind that a company with high debt and low price to sales is not an ideal choice  The high debt level will have to be paid off at some point  leading to further share issuance and a rise in market cap and ultimately a higher price to sales ratio In any case  the price to sales ratio used in isolation can t do the trick  One should also analyze other ratios like Price Earnings  Price Book and Debt Equity before arriving at any investment decision For the rest of this Screen of the Week article please visit Zacks com at Disclosure  Officers

175035,396551,MET,7 Low Price to Sales Stocks To Strengthen Your Portfolio,opinion,When considering valuation metrics  price to earnings ratio has always been the obvious choice as calculations based on earnings are easy and come in handy  However  price to sales has emerged as a convenient tool to determine the value of stocks that are incurring losses or are in an early cycle of development  generating meager or no profits While a loss making company with a negative price to earnings ratio falls out of investor favor  price to sales could indicate the hidden strength of its business  This underrated ratio is also used to identify a recovery situation or ensure that a company s growth is not overvalued A stock s price to sales ratio reflects how much investors are paying for each dollar of revenues generated by the company If the price to sales ratio is 1  it means that investors are paying  1 for every  1 of revenues generated by the company  So  it goes without saying that a stock with a price to sales below 1 is a good bargain  as investors need to pay less than a dollar for a dollar s worth   Thus  a stock with a lower price to sales ratio is a more suitable investment versus a stock with a high price to sales ratio Price to sales is often preferred over price to earnings as companies can manipulate their earnings using various accounting measures  However  sales are harder to manipulate and are relatively reliable However  one should keep in mind that a company with high debt and low price to sales is not an ideal choice  The high debt level will have to be paid off at some point  leading to further share issuance and a rise in market cap and ultimately a higher price to sales ratio In any case  the price to sales ratio used in isolation cannot do the trick  One should also analyze other ratios like Price Earnings  Price Book and Debt Equity before arriving at any investment decision Screening ParametersPrice to Sales less than Median Price to Sales for its Industry  The lower the price to sales ratio  the better Price to Earnings using F 1  estimate less than Median Price to Earnings for its Industry  The lower  the better Price to Book  common Equity  less than Median Price to Book for its Industry  This is another parameter to ensure the value feature of a stock Debt to Equity  Most Recent  less than Median Debt to Equity for its Industry  A company with less debt should have a stable price to sales ratio Current Price greater than or equal to  5  The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of  5 or higher Zacks Rank less than or equal

Naturally  the generally upbeat global rally reduced bets that the VIX would climb  This allowed the volatility index  also sometimes referred to as the fear gauge  to subside  However  at almost 27  it is still at its highest level since June 23 2016  when the UK s Brexit vote raised anxiety of a disruption to the global financial system 
These ongoing  elevated levels demonstrate that traders are still shaken up from the recent stock market rout  which wiped out  2 trillion from US equity markets 

The trigger for the recent Treasury selloff and spike in yields was the higher reading in wage growth  This is a leading indicator of an uptrend in inflation  which in turns increases the outlook for faster interest rate hikes  Higher rates would push yields up  thus favoring a rotation of funds out of stocks and into bonds  albeit mostly short term notes   Read here for a more extensive explanation  
It is thus only natural that investor attention is now laser focused on upcoming US consumer price data  which will be released Wednesday  Buckle up  Good or bad it could get bumpy 
Meanwhile  Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan Chase have advised clients to stock up and buy the dip  Even Michael Wilson  Morgan Stanley  s chief US equity strategist  who last week warned investors against buying the dip    forecasting a 10 percent rise from current prices on the back of  one last surge of euphoria   

To a lesser degree than falling Treasury yields  a second day decline in the dollar also supports USD denominated stocks  since they are rendered cheaper by the weaker currency  This second day slide confirms the falling channel  implied a retest of the 88 50 level 

A weakening dollar also supports commodities  pushing metals and WTI crude higher  However  the IEA report stating that US led global oil production will probably  this year pushed prices back down  Technically  Friday s intraday WTI low found support by the November December congestion  and its closing price was supported by the congestion s November 24 peak  At the time  the consolidation provided support  as all market participants and observers will remember that it was followed by an impressive 15 percent spike 
WTI price remains little changed today  after yesterday s inverted hammer  bullish upon a confirmation  when the price closes above its real body  price range between open and close  disregarding outside prices  marked by shadows   However  investors should note that the price has fallen below its uptrend line since September 2017 

Meanwhile  Brent crude extended a decline for an eighth consecutive day  after it had advanced on a weaker dollar following the release of the IEA report  Its technical picture is worse than that of WTI  as it has fallen below both its 100 dma  blue  and its uptrend line all the way from June  WTI is well above both thresholds  specially its June uptrend line 

South Africa s rand climbed as the country s ruling party  the African National Congress  decided to order President Jacob Zuma   However  the emerging market currency may have already provided a downside breakout to a bearish Rising Flag  with an implied 5 percent downside target 

In alt currency news  Pantera Capital s founder and CEO Dan Morehead made a bullish call on Bitcoin  The digital token entered the 53rd day of what s claimed to be its average 71 day bear market   So  it seems like another couple of weeks and everything will be kind of normal and it could start grinding back up   Morehead told CNBC s Fast Money on Monday 
Technically  BTC has continued to remain beneath supply pressure at the  9 000 level  its Saturday peak 

Ripple got a legitimacy boost from a partnership with the UAE Exchange  which will use the alt currency for cross border payments  The Middle East based exchange aims to bring its current 6 75 percent market share up to a 10 percent slice  The cryptocurrency climbed back above the  1 00 key level  As opposed to Bitcoin  it has provided a meaningful upside breakout to its downtrend line  signaling an upside reversal

175073,396589,MET,Stress and the City  Britain s bank workers buckle under pressure,news,"By Sinead Cruise and Anjuli Davies LONDON  Reuters    Dwindling job security  heavier workloads  regulatory upheaval and the poor public image of the banking sector are taking a toll on the mental health of Britain s bank workers  Eight years after the global financial crisis  stress in the industry has pushed up demand for insurance to protect revenues against the cost of paying staff too sick to work  insurance data show    The problem has gone into a new stratosphere since the financial crisis     Those who still have a job are vilified   said Jagdev Kenth  director of risk and regulatory strategy in the financial institutions group at Willis Towers Watson    Most haven t had anything to do with the scandals  They re working longer hours  doing two to three jobs  under greater pressure  Something has to give   Once havens for prestigious  highly paid and lifelong careers  banks have undergone rapid cultural and structural change at the behest of regulators tasked with reining them in  Tougher capital rules  hefty misconduct fines  and the closure of riskier business lines have forced banks to slash staff  Ten of Europe s largest lenders have axed 130 000 jobs since June  Reuters data shows   The impact of stress has reached all the way up to the higher echelons of the banking industry  In 2011  Lloyds Chief Executive Antonio Horta Osorio took two months off after suffering sleep deprivation and exhaustion  Two years later senior British banker Hector Sants  at the time head of compliance at  Barclays   was signed off on medical after suffering stress  Sants subsequently resigned  As risks of a global recession mount  investors want banks to slim down further  Almost three out of four bank employees admitted to workplace stress manifested by anxiety attacks  insomnia  headaches and depression  a survey conducted by trade union Unite between September and December showed  Some 85 percent of respondents  mainly working in retail and back office roles at Lloyds Banking Group  L LLOY   Royal Bank of Scotland  L RBS   HSBC  L HSBA  and TSB  MC SABE   said they worked additional unpaid hours last year  Lloyds  RBS and TSB referred requests for comments to trade body the British Bankers  Association  which represents all the banks covered by the Unite survey  Around two thirds of respondents cited heavier workloads and around a fifth blamed pressure to perform  Seventy two percent said they were considering quitting their jobs as a result   Work related stress is a very serious and increasing problem   said Dominic Hook  the union s National Officer for Finance  responsible for 130 000 members in financial services    We are working with employers to tackle the issues that cause stress  such as long working hours and the effect of long term staffing reductions   he said  adding that a separate survey covering staff at Barclays  L BARC  was under way   PREVENTION BETTER THAN CURE The British Bankers  Association said protecting staff s physical and mental wellbeing was  a top priority  for its members  who are devising more innovative ways to prevent problems occurring  These include in house counselors  mental health  first aid  courses  yoga sessions for traders  and more comprehensive mental healthcare plans   HSBC said it had a number of initiatives to reduce stress related illnesses    These include providing a healthcare plan to all employees with a comprehensive mental health benefit for employees and their family   it said   Several UK lenders have teamed up with the Bank Workers Charity to provide training for line managers on supporting stressed staff more sensitively    Banks are conscious that there are trends that make life stressful for their employees     they are focusing on wellbeing in a way that they weren t 10 years ago   Paul Barrett  head of wellbeing at the Bank Workers Charity  told Reuters   There is some way to go  but they are being more proactive    Health and Safety Executive statistics show jobs in financial services are 44 percent more likely to lead to stress related illnesses than the average UK job  meaning employers are also taking steps to control the hit to their finances caused by staff absences   Demand for special insurance products known as Group Income Protection  GIP  policies is rising steadily among financial sector employers  according to global insurer MetLife   Tom Gaynor  Employee Benefits Director at MetLife UK  N MET   said the average employer paid the equivalent of 1 to 1 5 percent of annual payroll to insure themselves against the cost of staff sick leave   In the UK  about 12 13 percent of companies take up GIP  In banking that figure is close to 100 percent  I don t know an investment bank that doesn t do it   he said  Data from MetLife s core U S  market showed investment banks are up to 30 percent more likely to make claims for staff suffering mental and psychological conditions than other policyholders on its books  HUMAN COST OF CRISIS Suicide mortality rates per 100 000 of population in the City of London  home to the historic Square  N SQ  Mile financial district  have consistently outnumbered any other London borough since 2009  government data accurate to end 2013 shows   Part of the problem is that we are an industry that downsizes all the time   said one banker who has been made redundant several times in a career spanning more than three decades    London is also the first place people cut  There s a constant threat of being axed in London   he said  speaking on condition of anonymity as he is still seeking work in the sector   Those suffering from stress in the workplace were reluctant to talk on the record to Reuters given the sensitive nature of the topic  This may also mean many cases go unreported as employees fear telling their line managers or colleagues   New patient assessments at a specialist wellbeing clinic operated in the City by private mental healthcare firm The Priory are up 106 percent in the year to Jan  31  with more than 70 new patients registering on average each month   People are feeling overwhelmed with the vast change in this business and in their careers   said consultant adult psychiatrist Dr Paul McLaren    Some people may thrive on that but many more struggle and this increases the chances of them developing a mental illness  particularly if they have a vulnerability   A soon to be published survey by Willis Towers Watson found a dislocation between what employers believe are the root causes of workplace stress and what their staff are actually stressed about  The biennial Staying Work Survey  which covers around 1 700 companies worldwide  showed more than four fifths of employers thought a lack of work life balance and excessive organizational change were the biggest burdens on staff  But 69 percent of employees said their top concern was inadequate staffing  followed by 65 percent who identified poor pay  That means prospects for a major rebound in mood and morale among bank workers look remote    It s very difficult in an industry that is downsizing and shrinking and doesn t know where it is going  It s perpetual boom and bust   the banker said

175092,396608,MET,Fed Hikes Rate  4 Stocks To Add Value To Your Portfolio,opinion,"You must have braced yourself for a rate hike  if you have followed the tide  As widely expected  the Federal Reserve raised the benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point for the third time this year to a range of 1 25 1 5   This clearly signals that the economy is in good health with inflation gradually crawling toward the desired 2  target and job market remaining robust  Together  these have set the stage for a rate hike 
The policy makers had trimmed the rate at a time when the economy had slipped into recession  and since then it has been treading cautiously and considering all the economic aspects before arriving at a decision over the rate hike  This is the fifth time that the Fed officials have raised the interest rate  since the financial crisis 
The Fed  who have chalked out a detailed plan to shrink  4 5 trillion portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage backed securities  continue to advocate three more hikes next year on expectations of strengthening job market  We noted that the U S  economy added a robust 228 000 jobs in November  while the unemployment rate continues to hover around at its 17 year low rate of 4 1  
The Chairperson expects the unemployment rate to be around the current level at the end of 2017 but anticipates the same to dip 20 basis points to 3 9  in 2018  Industry experts believe that the labor market is likely to get a major boost from Trump s tax reform policy  The new tax code once implemented will lower the burden of corporates  spur domestic investments and stimulate economic growth 
Janet Yellen  whose term ends in February  pointed that any rational tax reform that triggers economic activities  helps create jobs and increase wages are always welcome  The Fed now envisions economy to grow at a rate of 2 5  in both 2017 and 2018  up from its previous forecast of 2 4  and 2 1   respectively 
Certainly  things are looking well placed at the very moment unless an unprecedented event disrupts the same  So  let s focus on sectors that are likely to benefit from the move and pick some value intrinsic stocks  Here we have highlighted four value stocks from consumer discretionary and financial sectors that have a favorable combination of a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and a  of A or B

to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  MetLife has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 9 8   as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 21 5  If we focus on the long term PE trend  MetLife s current PE level puts it above its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the broader industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 14 3  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that MetLife has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 11 5  which is tad higher than the current level  So it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near term P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  MetLife has a P S ratio of about 0 9  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 4x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  MetLife currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20   of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes MetLife a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though MetLife might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of Fand a Momentum Score of F  This gives MET a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of D   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been favorable  The current quarter has seen three estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to one lower  while the full year estimate has seen two up and no down in the same time period This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 0 9  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has increased 2 3   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below MetLife  Inc  Price and Consensus    The stock has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineMetLife is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  among Bottom 36  of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the broader industry has clearly underperformed the market at large  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest StrategiesIt s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But while the market gained  18 8  from 2016   Q1 2017  our top stock picking screens have returned  157 0    128 0    97 8    94 7   and  90 2  respectively And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon  Over the years it has been remarkably consistent

175097,396613,MET,The next NFL drama  Rams and Chargers negotiate to share L A  stadium,news,"By Robin Respaut and Mark Lamport Stokes SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters    The National Football League s decision this week on Los Angeles relocations ended one long running drama but started another   The league approved the St  Louis Rams  move to L A  but only gave conditional approval for the Chargers to join them  But that won t happen unless the teams can cut a stadium sharing deal   The unique dynamic sets up a fresh round of brinkmanship involving the Rams  the Chargers and San Diego that could drag on another year   Will the Chargers get a better deal from Rams owner Stan Kroenke  or from public officials in San Diego  And does Kroenke want to share his dramatic new stadium   and the coveted Los Angeles market    It s certainly not over   said Roger Noll  a Stanford University economist who studies the business of sports   The decision follows years of contentious talks between three cities and their teams  the Rams  the Chargers  and the Oakland Raiders  All three applied to be the first Los Angeles NFL team since 1995  The Rams and Chargers   if they can come to terms   would both play at a stadium that could cost as much as  2 billion in Inglewood  a suburb southwest of Los Angeles   Should the Rams Chargers talks fail  the Raiders could then try to work out their own deal with Kroenke and the Rams  Mark Fabiani  special counsel to the Chargers  said the team and its chief executive  Dean Spanos  were  working with the NFL and the Rams on a potential deal framework    The League gave the Chargers and Rams until January 2017 to make a deal   STICKY NEGOTIATIONS In the NFL  only MetLife  N MET  stadium in New Jersey pairs two teams   the New York Giants and the New York Jets  The teams worked together to privately finance the stadium   By contrast  the Rams and Chargers  until now  have been rivals with competing L A  stadium plans  The Chargers had proposed to share a stadium with the Oakland Raiders in Carson  another suburb   That and other factors complicate the negotiations ahead  For the Rams  the obvious advantage to sharing the stadium is splitting the costs   in this case  the cost of the most expensive stadium in league history  The Chargers  for their part  would get to play in a better venue in a bigger market   But the talks could get sticky from there  Kroenke s plans include much more than a stadium   His development company  the Kroenke Group  will have a major stake in the ambitious real estate project and entertainment complex surrounding the proposed stadium  The company is partnering with Stockbridge Capital Group  which was developing the site before Kroenke planned to move his team there   The glass roofed  80 000 seat stadium would be surrounded by a 6 000 seat performance venue  890 000 square feet of retail space  780 000 square feet of office space  2 500 residences  a 300 room hotel and 25 acres of parks and open spaces  according to Stockbridge   Kroenke will invest more than  800 million in the Inglewood project  according to documents filed by the Rams to the NFL earlier this month  The Kroenke Group and Stockbridge declined to comment  The Rams did not respond to requests for comment  A key question is how such sprawling plans will play into the talks between the Chargers and the Rams   If you re the Chargers  you don t want to pay a full half of the money to build the stadium without getting half of the benefits from the development deal   said Victor Matheson  an economics professor who studies sports business at College of the Holy Cross in Massachusetts   The Inglewood stadium project will be privately financed  making it a steep buy in for the Chargers   Kroenke chose to spend his own money in L A  instead of accepting a proposed  400 million public contribution for a new St  Louis stadium  But the Chargers face a tougher calculation   The Chargers don t have as much money  and they re not participating in this grander development   said Noll   So their willingness to pay for the stadium cost in Inglewood is much less than the Rams   According to Forbes  Chargers owner Alex Spanos and family have a net worth of  1 69 billion   compared to  7 4 billion for Kroenke   ASSET APPRECIATION A move to Los Angeles could nearly double the value of the Chargers  from about  1 5 billion in San Diego to more than  3 billion over time  said Marc Ganis  president of Sportscorp Ltd   a Chicago based sports business consulting form    There s a high location premium for Los Angeles   Ganis said   And high upfront costs  The team would also have to pay the league a  550 million relocation fee    I can t imagine that Dean Spanos would pay half of a  2 billion stadium   plus the league fee  said Andrew Zimbalist  a Smith College sports economist   Even if Spanos wanted to split the costs  it s questionable whether Kroenke would want to split the stadium  its revenues and the L A  market   where the NFL hasn t tested fan enthusiasm in two decades   The league may have to apply pressure or offer incentives to get the Rams owner on board  said Neil deMause  editor of Field of Schemes  a website that tracks stadium subsidies   Kroenke has pretty much no motivation to allow a second team into Inglewood   deMause said  Asked whether the league had any preference for two teams over one  NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said   That is up to the 32 owners  We ve said all along that any stadium development should be prepared to accommodate two teams   ENDLESS TALKS The other pivotal question is whether the league s conditional approval gives the Chargers new leverage to wring more public money out of San Diego   where stadium talks have already dragged on for 14 years  The current offer on the table calls for the city and the county to contribute  350 million toward a new  1 1 billion stadium  San Diego voters would need to approve that subsidy in an election yet to be scheduled  San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer spoke of a fresh start during a Wednesday news conference   Now we re waiting to hear from the Chargers   said San Diego County Board of Supervisors Chairman Ron Roberts  The city s plan for a new  67 500 seat stadium calls for the Chargers to pay  363 million  a fraction of their potential share of Kroenke s planned L A  stadium  The NFL would contribute  200 million  and the team would raise another  187 million from the sale of personal seat licenses   Of course  the Chargers could also stay in their current home  Qualcomm  O QCOM  Stadium  Matheson said  
 It s not as if their stadium is obsolete   he said   It just isn t as fancy as some of these others   and they have a case of stadium envy  ",2016-01-15,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/the-next-nfl-drama:-rams-and-chargers-negotiate-to-share-l.a.-stadium-380245,380245

	Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations     

Here are highlights from Tuesday s Analyst Blog  

Top Stock Reports for Wednesday  GILD  BP  DOW   More 

	The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Gilead  NASDAQ           BP  NYSE          and Dow Chemical  NYSE           These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today  You can see   

Gilead  shares have been laggards lately  on persistent fears about drug pricing and other regulatory issues that haven t eased up even after the November election  The stock has lost  25 2  of its value over the last year vs  the  9 6  decline for the Zacks Biotech industry  Gilead s HIV franchise maintains momentum driven by the rapid adoption of TAF based regimens which now represent 42  of total Gilead HIV prescription volume  Strong uptake for Truvada for use in the pre exposure prophylaxis setting should also boost sales as the company saw a significant uptick in PrEP usage in 2017  However  Gilead will lose exclusivity for Viread this year in some countries outside the U S   which should impact sales  Additionally  the HCV franchise continues to be undercompetitive and pricing pressure is leading to a massive decline in Harvoni and Sovaldi sales   You can      

BP  share have gained  9 1  over the past 12 months  outperforming the Zacks Oil   Gas International Integrated industry which has lost  0 8  over the same period  as well as rival Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa   up  5 1    The Zacks analyst stresses that the petroleum giant s upstream projects are expected to generte significant cash flows starting 2020 and beyond  Moreover  the company s drilling operations are becoming efficient as reflected by the steady decline in non productive time since 2012  However  the oil spill incident of 2010 in the BP operated Macondo Prospect continues to affect the company  Although BP has cleared substantial litigation expenses related to the spill  it had to divest some of its best operating properties  The analyst sees the company s dividend to generally safe  but the high yield  currently yielding 6 6   indicates some market nervousness   You can      

Dow Chemical  shares have gained  11 1  over the past six months  outperforming the Zacks Chemicals Diversified industry  up  7 5  over the same period   The Zacks analyst likes the planned merger with DuPont  NYSE DD   which is expected to create significant synergies  Dow should also gain from cost synergies associated with Dow Corning Silicones business and its strategic investments in the U S  Gulf Coast and the Middle East  However  Dow s agriculture business remains affected by depressed crop commodity prices  The company also faces pricing headwinds  feedstock cost pressure as well as weak demand in the energy market   You can      

	Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include America Movil  NYSE         and MetLife  NYSE

175180,396696,MET,Zacks Value Investor Highlights  Tyson Foods  Thor Industries  Nasdaq  MetLife And Celanese,opinion,"For Immediate Release

	Chicago  IL   June 16  2017   Zacks Value Investor is a podcast hosted weekly by Zacks Stock Strategist Tracey Ryniec  Every week  Tracey will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks  bonds and ETFs and how it impacts your life  To listen to the podcast  click here      

The Greatest Buy   Hold Investor of All Time

	Welcome to Episode  46 of the Value Investor Podcast



	Every week  Tracey Ryniec  the editor of Zacks    shares some of her top value investing tips and stock picks 

	Recently  the  wrote about 98 year old Russ Gremel  a Chicago attorney who had donated  2 million to the Illinois Audubon Society 

	The catch 

	He obtained the money by investing  1 000 in Walgreens stock 70 years ago 

	Mr  Gremel may be one of the greatest  buy and hold  investors of all time 

	The average length of time most investors hold onto a stock or a mutual fund is just 3 years  If you ve even held a decade  that is considered a long term shareholder 

	He held through the super bear market of the 1970s  the 1980s 90s mega bull and then the recent Great Recession sell off  That takes a lot of guts 

Luck or Skill 

	Mr  Gremel s story is a feel good story because the investment turned out well  Walgreens is still in business all these years later  when many of its peers are not 

	Additionally  according to YahooFinance  the stock is up over 8 000  since 1985 

	Was Mr  Gremel a good investor  or did he just get lucky when he chose Walgreens 

	Luck does play a part in investing  of course  But for every Walgreens there is a Montgomery Wards  That s why you should keep a diverse portfolio  Holding onto just one stock for 70 years would be considered a risky strategy 

Can You Buy and Hold a Stock for Forever 

	Like any stock investment  you should always be evaluating your companies no matter how long you intend to hold them 

	Use the Zacks Rank to look for rising earnings estimates  Check to make sure earnings are growing  Listen to conference calls and stay up to date on company news 

	Businesses change  Just ask Kodak and Sears 

	Don t get caught unaware 

5 Companies That Fit the Buy and Hold Criteria

	Tracey did a screen for Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy    2  Buy  and  3  Hold  stocks with P Es under 18  She also sought EPS growth of at least 10  and a dividend over 1  

	Dividends are a key component to buy and hold because  if they re re invested  they compound 

	1  Tyson Foods  NYSE TSN   NYSE        is one of the largest beef  pork and poultry producers in America  It trades with a forward P E of just 12 2 and is expected to grow earnings by 14  this year 

	2  Thor Industries  NYSE        just had a record third quarter as RV sales were up 56 9   Earnings are expected to jump 33  this year 

	3  Nasdaq  NASDAQ        just increased its quarterly dividend by 19   It yields 1 8   Earnings are expected to rise 11 8  in 2017 

	4  MetLife  NYSE MET   NYSE        was founded in 1868 yet it s still expected to grow earnings by 16 5  this year  It s cheap  with a forward P E of just 9 9 and it pays a dividend yielding 3  

	5  Celanese  NYSE        is over 100 years old but is expected to grow earnings by 10 5  this year  The specialty chemical maker has a forward P E of just 12 3 

	If you re going to buy and hold  buy companies in the basics like the examples above  food  insurance  chemicals  finance 

	And remember  past performance is no guarantee of future results

   About 10 banks seen in race   sources
   Alico IPO may come after AIA offering   source
  Adds details  bank comments  background  byline 
 By Paritosh Bansal
 NEW YORK  Sept 8  Reuters    American International Group
Inc is interviewing banks this week to manage a planned initial
public offering of life insurance unit American Life Insurance
Co  sources familiar with the matter said 
 An IPO could fetch as much as  5 billion for Alico 
depending on the size of the stake that is sold  the sources
said  AIG has said it plans to list the company in New York 
 About 10 banks  including UBS AG  Deutsche Bank AG 
Citigroup Inc  Credit Suisse Group AG and Goldman Sachs Group
Inc  are expected to be interviewed for the job  the sources
said on Tuesday 
 Morgan Stanley is expected to get a lead role as it has
been guaranteed such a position by the Federal Reserve Bank of
New York for any IPO of AIG units  the sources said 
 An IPO of Alico is expected only after the public offering
of shares in another major AIG property  American International
Assurance Co Ltd  which has been slated for early next year 
one of the sources said 
 Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank have been selected as
global coordinators for the AIA offering 
 AIG  Citigroup  Deutsche Bank  Credit Suisse and Goldman
declined to comment  UBS and Morgan Stanley could not be
reached immediately for comment  The sources declined to be
identified because the process is not public 
 Alico sells life insurance and retirement products to 19
million customers through a distribution network that includes
40 000 agents  It operates in 54 countries but generates more
than half of its revenue in Japan 
 In July  another source told Reuters that AIG was in talks
with MetLife Inc for a possible sale of Alico  The status of
those talks could not be determined on Tuesday 
 Late last month  AIG s new chief executive  Robert
Benmosche  said the company was still planning IPOs for Alico
and AIA  preparing them from an eventual sale when the time was
right 
 The divestitures are part of the insurer s efforts to repay
U S  taxpayers the roughly  80 billion it received as part of a
larger federal rescue 
 Separately  Credit Suisse downgraded AIG to  underperform 
from  neutral   saying near term sale of businesses would leave
little to no value for common equity holders 
 AIG s shares were off  3 77  or 9 4 percent  at  36 28
during afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange

175182,396698,MET,FACTBOX Calpers  love affair with the exotic  untapped,news," This is part of a package on risk at Calpers  to see other
stories and graphics double click on   ID nN2254816  
 NEW YORK  Oct 23  Reuters    It is little wonder that the
California Public Employees  Retirement System is considered
the most important public pension fund in the United States as
it oversees  200 billion in assets  roughly twice the size of
the Golden State s annual budget 
But it s not only its sheer size that s garnered attention 
Calpers has been the vanguard of pension investing 
sometimes aggressively in exotic and hard to comprehend
projects and securities 
 The following provides a taste 
 1993 
 Calpers approached Enron about a joint venture called JEDI 
or the Joint Energy Development Investments  Calpers invested
 250 million in the partnership  Fortunately  Enron in 1997
bought back its stake in JEDI from Calpers for  383 million and
immediately sold it to another limited partnership called
Chewco  named after the Chewbacca character in  Star Wars  
 1998 
 Calpers entered another private equity limited partnership
with Enron  called JEDI 2  Calpers committed  500 million to
that deal but only invested  156 million  In June 2000  around
the time the energy crisis broke out  Calpers stopped investing
in JEDI 2  Calpers recouped  171 million from JEDI 2 
 1999 
 Calpers becomes one of the few pension funds in the
high end wine vineyard industry  In 2002 and 2004  Calpers made
initial investments of  100 million each in Pacific Vineyard
Partners and Meriwether Farms  But as of Sept  30  2006  the
total amount invested in land  vineyards and vineyard
development with Pacific Vineyard was valued at  76 3 million 
while Meriwether Farms at  57 1 million  according to Calpers 
Those investments made a comeback in the ensuing years  as of
March 31  2009  Pacific Vineyard was  94 9 million while
Meriwether was  77 9 million 
 2002 
 Calpers begins investing in hedge funds in April of that
year  with the goal of diversifying its investment portfolio 
managing risk  and adding value to the fund   it said in a
press release  Its risk managed absolute return strategies  RM
ARS  program was down 27 percent for the year ending June 30 
2009  Its five year return ending June 30  2009  stood at  0 7
percent 
 2006 
 Calpers commits  500 million in equity to a sprawling
apartment property on Manhattan s East Side  called Peter
Cooper Village and Stuyvesant Town  Calpers made the investment
in a joint venture led by closely held developer Tishman Speyer
and BlackRock Realty Advisors    shortly after the venture
purchased the 56 building complex from MetLife Inc  for  5 4
billion 
 On October 22  2009  Tishman Speyer and its partners moved
closer to a default on  3 billion in debt on the Peter Cooper
Village Stuyvesant Town complex after a New York court ruled
the owners illegally raised rents on thousands of tenants 
 For story  please see  nN14268606 
 2007 
 Calpers completes a real estate venture known as
LandSource  a  2 5 billion deal  It became one of the priciest
U S  residential land transactions ever as LandSource filed for
bankruptcy protection in early 2008

175197,396713,MET,5 Trade Ideas For Monday  AZN  IP  MET  RY  WMB,opinion,"Astrazeneca  NYSE AZN 
AstraZeneca   moved lower with pace starting in September  It crossed down through its 200 day SMA in October and continued until finding a bottom in December  Since then it has crept higher in a series of higher highs and higher lows  Friday saw it make another higher high and peek above its 200 day SMA  The RSI is bullish and rising while the MACD is flat  Look for continuation to participate higher   
International Paper Company  NYSE IP 
International Paper  moved higher out of consolidation in July  That move stalled out in September and it pulled back to the prior consolidation area  It settle for a few days before surging higher  making a higher high in December  before consolidating  A failed break to the upside in January came back to that consolidation and held there since  Last week saw a move to the top of the range with the RSI pushing through the mid line and the MACD crossing up and rising  Look for continuation to participate higher   
MetLife  NYSE MET 
MetLife  started higher in July finding a top 60  higher in December  Since then it has pulled back in a falling channel  Last week saw it touch the 100 day SMA and bounce higher  It ended the week at the top of the channel with the RSI rising and on the edge of a move into the bullish zone while the MACD is turning up  Look for a push above the channel to participate higher   
Royal Bank Of Canada  NYSE RY 
Royal Bank of Canada pulled up from consolidation in November  It has been moving higher ever since  It made a short term top in February and pulled back to support  where it enters the new week  The RSI is turning back higher but the MACD is falling  Look for confirmation higher to participate   
Williams Companies Inc  NYSE WMB 
Williams  had a strong run higher from a low last April  That met resistance in September and consolidated with a slight upward drift for the next 4 months  In January it gapped lower and held there in consolidation until breaking higher Friday  The RSI is making a new high as it rises as well and the MACD is crossed up and rising  Look for continuation to participate higher   
Up Next  Bonus Idea
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad  picture reviewed Friday which heading into the first full week of March sees the equity markets have entered more like a lion than a lamb 
Elsewhere look for Gold to continue the pullback in its uptrend while Crude Oil consolidates with a bias for a break to the downside  The US Dollar Index looks to continue higher short term while US Treasuries continue to consolidate in their downtrend  The Shanghai Composite continues to drift higher while Emerging Markets pullback in their uptrend 
Volatility looks to remain at abnormally low levels keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETF s SPY  NYSE SPY   iShares Russell 2000  NYSE IWM  and PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1  NASDAQ QQQ   Their charts show continued strength in the SPY and QQQ  especially on the longer timeframe  with the IWM in consolidation mode again on both timeframes  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

175198,396714,MET,Financial Insecurity,opinion,"Last week  I discussed the primary issue that has led to the  in America  To wit 

 Using faulty assumptions is the lynchpin to the inability to meet future obligations  By over estimating returns  it has artificially inflated future pension values and reduced the required contribution amounts by individuals and governments paying into the pension system  

This is a critically important point to understand  Why  Because you may well be in the same  quicksand  as pension funds and just don t realize it 
For years  Wall Street has continued to espouse the  myth of compounded average returns   This is the same myth which has not only infected pension funds  but has led to the same false sense of future financial security in personal retirement planning nationwide  An  further perpetuates this myth 

 What determines how much savings is enough by a certain age  with a particular income 
J P  Morgan says  enough  means the nest egg is big enough to have at least an 80  chance of surviving 30 years in retirement   So  20  of the time you d need to course correct   by boosting something like your savings rate or cutting your retirement spending   to avoid running out of money in the long run  But 80  of the time  you would not need to make any changes to avoid running out of money  
The financial firm s number crunchers also assume that  before retirement  you keep kicking in 10  of your income each year to your nest egg  In addition  they assume that your retirement portfolio grows an average of 6  a year before retirement and 5  a year in retirement  


And there it is   The biggest mistake you are making in your retirement planning by buying into the  myth  that markets  compound returns  over time 
They don t  They never have  They never will 
I have adjusted the chart I showed you last week to show a compound return rate of 6    5000 annual  made monthly  contributions  10  of  50 000 which is roughly the median wage  and using variable rates of return from current valuation levels   Chart assumes 35 years of age to start saving and expiring at 85 

As you can see  markets do not compound average returns over time 
Most importantly  just as with  pension funds   the issue of using above average rates of return into the future suggests one can  save less  today because the  growth  will make up for the difference 
Unfortunately  it just doesn t work that way 
But there is more to this equation that is not being discussed 
The Missing Ingredients
But there is another problem that is overlooked by IBD in their analysis above  The impact of taxes and fees during the drawdown period  not to mention fees    
In a report entitled  I used the follow example 

 For instance  imagine a retiree who has a  1 000 000 balanced portfolio  and wants to plan for a 30 year retirement  where inflation averages 3  and the balanced portfolio averages 8  in the long run  To make the money last for the entire time horizon  the retiree would start out by spending  61 000 initially  and then adjust each subsequent year for inflation  spending down the retirement account balance by the end of the 30th year  

I have taken that example and adjusted it for a 6  average return and then included scenarios a  50 000 annual withdraw rate adjusted for inflation and taxes 

Unfortunately  once you account for taxes and inflations  the time to depletion accelerates rapidly 
But hold on   It actually gets worse 
The above example uses the  pension fund  model of 6  compounded annual average returns  Let s remodel forward returns using the average returns of the markets historically over the subsequent 30 year period from where the index hit 20x valuations  This is shown in the chart below 

If we take the average returns of those years and apply them to our spend down model  as shown above  the depletion rate of retirement savings grows sharply 

The analysis above reveals the important points individuals should consider given current valuation levels and a Fed driven bull market advance over the last 8 years 
Expectations for future returns and withdrawal rates should be downwardly adjusted 
The potential for front loaded returns going forward is unlikely 
The impact of taxation must be considered in the planned withdrawal rate 
Future inflation expectations must be carefully considered 
Drawdowns from portfolios during declining market environments accelerates the principal bleed  Plans should be made during rising market years to harbor capital for reduced portfolio withdrawals during adverse market conditions 
The yield chase over the last 8 years  and low interest rate environment  has created an extremely risky environment for retirement income planning  Caution is advised 
Expectations for compounded annual rates of returns should be dismissed in lieu of plans for variable rates of future returns 
Financial Insecurity   Or   You Aren t Saving Enough 
I get it 
Asking people to save  more  really isn t an option given the recent study published 

 Some 50  of people is woefully unprepared for a financial emergency  new research finds  Nearly 1 in 5  19   Americans have nothing set aside to cover an unexpected emergency  while nearly 1 in 3  31   Americans don t have at least  500 set aside to cover an unexpected emergency expense  according to a survey released Tuesday by HomeServe USA  a home repair service   by insurance company MetLife  NYSE MET  found that 49  of employees are  concerned  anxious or fearful about their current financial well being  

The lack of savings  of course  is directly related to the rising cost of living versus the lack of wage growth over the last 35 years which led to a massive surge in debt to maintain the standard of living 

Fidelity provided some further insights into the savings problem for Generation X ers and Millennials 

 Generation X is squarely in middle age and beset on all sides by bills  Many in Generation X have dependents at home 84  in the survey said they have at least one  They may also still be paying off their own student debts just more than one in four survey respondents from Generation X says he or she is still paying for his or her own education  
There are all kinds of money problems  but the solutions are generally the same  Save more  spend less  or find a higher paying job or maybe all three  But this is easier said than done  


The massive shortfall in  savings  is going to be a problem in the future given the shortfall that currently exists for a large number of Americans 
You cannot INVEST your way to your retirement goal  As the last decade should have taught you by now  the stock market is not a  get wealthy for retirement  scheme  You cannot continue to under save for your retirement hoping the stock market will make up the difference  As stated  this exactly the same trap that pension funds all across this country have fallen into and are now paying the price for 
Chasing an arbitrary index that is 100  invested in the equity market requires you to take on far more risk that you most likely want  Two massive bear markets over the last decade have left many individuals further away from retirement than they ever imagined  Furthermore  all investors lost something far more valuable than money   the TIME that was needed to prepare properly for retirement 
Investing for retirement  no matter what age you are  should be done conservatively and cautiously with the goal of outpacing inflation over time  This doesn t mean that you should never invest in the stock market  it just means that your portfolio should be constructed to deliver a rate of return sufficient to meet your long term goals with as little risk as possible 
The only way to ensure you will be adequately prepared for retirement is to  save more and spend less   It ain t sexy  but it will absolutely work  
You Will Be WRONG  The markets cycle  just like the economy  and what goes up will eventually come down  More importantly  the further the markets rise  the bigger the correction will be  RISK does NOT equal return    RISK   How much you will lose when you are wrong  and you will be wrong more often than you think 
Don t worry about paying off your house  A paid off house is great  but if you are going into retirement house rich and cash poor you will be in trouble  You don t pay off your house UNTIL your retirement savings are fully in place and secure 
In regards to retirement savings   have a large CASH cushion going into retirement  You do not want to be forced to draw OUT of a pool of investments during years where the market is declining   This compounds the losses in the portfolio and destroys principal which cannot be replaced 
Plan for the worst  You should want a happy and secure retirement   so plan for the worst  If you are banking solely on Social Security and a pension plans  what would happen if the pension was cut  Corporate bankruptcies happen all the time and to companies that most never expected  By planning for the worst  anything other outcome means you are in great shape 
Most likely what ever retirement planning you have done  is wrong  Change your assumptions  ask questions and plan for the worst  There is no one more concerned about YOUR money than you and if you don t take an active interest in your money   why should anyone else ",2017-04-10,Lance Roberts,https://www.investing.com/analysis/financial-insecurity-200181936,200181936

S P 500 continues to test its Broadening Top formation 

SPX has been challenging its Orthodox Broadening Top and weekly Cycle Top resistance at 2178 01 for the past four weeks  This week it doubled its trading range for the first time in a month  SPX has fulfilled all its requirements for a completed uptrend In fact  the Wave  5  fractal target was 2157 71  a target that was achieved nearly a month ago 

 ZeroHedge  The latest note from Citi strategist Robert Buckland is a perfect example of the schizophrenia that has gripped investors in a market that continues to rise  defying all logic  On one hand  Citi calls the S P rally  unstoppable  adding that  this US bull market just won t die   urging clients  don t underweight the S P   while on the other it openly admits the market  on a fundamental basis is very overstretched  admitting that  since 2011  the US market has re rated from a trailing PE of 17x to 23x

The Euro declines back to the trendline 

The Euro declined back to the trendline of its Broadening Wedge formation and Long term support at 110 81 The head   Shoulders formation may still be valid  so a second break of the trendline may put the Euro back into a possible bear market with the loss of that key support 

 FT  The euro has few friends  It is attacked both by nationalists and internationalists  paradoxically unified in their conviction that Europe s monetary union was flawed from the moment of its birth in 1999  The latest  j accuse  comes from Joseph Stiglitz  whose critique of the euro aligns itself unabashedly with the anti establishment left  Yet there is much in this new book by the Nobel Prize winning economist with which the Eurosceptic right will agree 

Euro Stoxx 50 declines from the trendline

The Yen is repelled by the Cycle Top 

The Yen was repelled from Cycle Top resistance at 99 24 this week The Yen may have another go at the top once it completes a consolidation above Short term support at 96 68  The probable new period of strength may last through late September  A breakout above the Cycle Top appears to be probable 

 ZeroHedge  One of the main reasons for the failure of Abenomics is that while Abe has been largely successful in boosting import prices as a result of the collapse in the Yen  his policies have been a failure when it comes to achieving the only thing that truly matters for achieving benign inflationary pressures  pushing wages higher We first pointed this out all the way back in late 2014 in a post titled  The Abenomics Devastation  Japanese Real Wages Decline For Record 16 Consecutive Months

 Bloomberg  Renewed strength in the U S  labor market is threatening to derail the gold rally that sent futures to the best first half in almost four decades 

Employment jumped in July for a second month and wages climbed  boosting bets that the Federal Reserve may raise U S  interest rates this year and sending gold to its biggest loss in more than 10 weeks 
Bullion has extended gains this quarter  helped by low interest rates and pledges by central banks from Europe to Japan to continue to crank up stimulus spending  Low rates are a boon for gold because they keep the metal more competitive against assets like bonds that pay interest

As a 12 year old child he learned what it was like to live without a bailout plan when his father died suddenly  leaving behind a debt in today s dollars of about  2 2 million that he had borrowed to build a motel in Monticello  New York  Keeping up with the payments became a family affair  and Bob  the eldest of four children  helped out managing the motel and stocking shelves in a local supermarket  A rambunctious boy with little interest in school  in his sophomore year he was shipped off to military school the same school Donald Trump attended  a year behind Benmosch    With hand me down threads  a job in the academy s dining room and a restless spirit   he started a new chapter in his life  though with the same aversion to academics  What interested him was making money  achieving financial freedom  What he became good at was tackling complex business issues and pointing employees in the direction of a positive outcome 
Fast forward through his years at Alfred University and various jobs at consulting firms  banks  brokerages  and eventually as CEO of MetLife  NYSE MET   He retired at the age of 62 with the prospect of spending his golden years in the villa on the Dalmatian coast he had refurbished  tending to his vineyards in Dubrovnik and managing his investments via Yahoo  Finance 
But then came AIG  That Benmosch  managed to turn AIG around was something of a miracle  He had the government breathing down his neck  wanting him to sell assets quickly  even if at fire sale prices  He had an uncooperative board and a hostile chairman  The press was scrutinizing and criticizing his every move  AIG s employees were demoralized  some had already left what they considered a sinking ship 
Benmosch  called on his outsize personality  he was called crazy  scary  bombastic  and his keen business acumen to navigate the treacherous corporate and government waters  A more restrained CEO could never have made the company s lenders whole

175291,396807,MET,SEC Adopts More Transparency,opinion,"On Aug  27  the Securities and Exchange Commission adopted revisions to its rules concerning asset backed securities  changes inspired by the losses suffered by holders of ABS in 2008 
As the SEC said in the  that accompanied the new rules  the 2008 losses  revealed that many investors in the securitization market were not fully aware of the risks underlying the securitized assets and over relied on ratings assigned by credit rating agencies   
These rules have been in the oven for a long time  proposed four years ago  several rounds of comments have come and gone since then  There are two key features to the changes  enhanced disclosure one the one hand and new requirements for shelf offerings of ASB on the other 
Enhanced Disclosure
On the first of those points   adopt standardized asset level  as distinct from pool level  disclosure  to be offered both at the time of offering and later  on an ongoing basis  The disclosures  required to appear in a standardized XML format  include 
Data about the payment stream related to a particular asset  contractual terms  scheduled payment amounts  the basis for interest rate calculations  whether and how payment terms will change over time  
Data about the collateral related to the asset  such as the geographical location of the property and its loan to value ratio 
Data about the performance of each asset over time  such as whether an obligor is making payments as scheduled  and
Data about loss mitigation efforts by the servicer 
All this may allow investors to do what many of the burned former investors in the area would no doubt claim  the credit rating agencies should have been doing in the opening years of this century but conspicuously weren t 
Some of the commenters in the various above mentioned rounds raised an issue about the privacy of the obligors  Should the SEC really require so much disclosure as to allow inquiring minds to figure out  to  re identify   who the obligors are  The SEC on reconsideration decided not  It omitted or modified  certain asset level disclosures for RMBS and securities backed by auto loans and leases   to reduce the potential risk that the obligors could be re identified  
One example of this conflict arises from the desire of investors to have data about the geographical location of collateral  That is a natural desire  legend has it real estate is all about  location  location  and location   Still  wouldn t a rule supplying the public in general with the five digit zip code of such a property prove too granular  allowing re identification 
The final rule requires the disclosure only of a 2 digit zip code 
Shelf Registration
The SEC agrees with the industry that shelf registration is a good thing  worth preserving  given its  significant flexibility and timing benefits  
BUT   the SEC also says that this value must be balanced against  investors  need for adequate information and time to make informed investment decisions   Accordingly  much of the new rule creates new eligibility standards for the shelf  I ll mention just two key points here  there must be independent third party review of representations and warranties  and the chief executive officer of the depositor at an offering must sign a new certification 
Considering Consequences 
In a discussion of the likely consequences of its new rule  the SEC observed that it doesn t know  who will ultimately bear  the  direct compliance costs  imposed by the rule changes  They will be borne in the first instance by the sponsors of ABS  but there are various ways in which sponsors may be able to pass those costs to other market participants  depending on market conditions  the competitiveness of the different links in the securitization chain  and the availability of alternative forms of credit 
What might the issuers do if they prove unable to pass along costs to borrowers or investors  They could issue unregistered offerings of course  or register through Form SF 1  Either such decision could  have the effect of reducing efficiency and  impeding  capital formation   that is  of undermining the reasons why shelf registration exists as an option 
On the other hand  the SEC observed that some of the investor commentators on this proposal  notably MetLife II  NYSE MET  have argued that sponsors are over stating the costs and burdens of the newly required disclosures ",2014-09-04,AllAboutAlpha,https://www.investing.com/analysis/sec-adopts-more-transparency-224695,224695
175292,396808,MET,MetLife  Attractive Value With Growth,opinion,"MetLife  NYSE MET   the largest U S  life insurer  announced a 68  profit increase for Q1 2015 on February 11th  Since then  its share price has remained relatively stagnant  just a  1 increase  
MET continues to trade at 80 cents on the dollar despite being a growing  undervalued company  The reason for this is regulatory uncertainty  the recent SIFI  systemically important financial institution  designation  and fear of low yield curves becoming the norm  We believe these fears are overblown  and that MET is a buy because it is extremely undervalued  there is institutional confidence in the company  and the recent uptrends in yields have already started to pump the stock up  For investors willing to wait for interest rates to come up  and they will eventually   MET is a clear buy  We ll start this article with a quantitative breakdown of the company s relative value  then analyze its growth profile  followed by an analysis on how the  smart money  is playing the stock  before concluding with some qualitative analysis and conclusions 
Valuation Breakdown
We take a quantitative approach to investing  preferring to focus our analysis on a certain set of metrics that have a strong predictive ability  We ll start by analyzing MetLife s value profile  This is important to look at as Nobel laureate Eugene Fama   Value stocks  with low ratios of price to book value  have higher average returns than growth stocks  high price to book ratios    MET s valuation profile is shown below 

On every important measure of value  MET is attractively priced  Its sales yield  TTM Revenue   Market Cap  at 125  is essentially twice the average for the insurance group  62 6    and nearly five times the financials sector average  24 6    It also means that an investor can currently get  1 25 of revenue for every  1 00 they invest in a company that makes money and is rapidly growing  EPS growth of 172  this year   This type of value is very hard to find in a profitable and growing company  especially in an otherwise expensive market 
MetLife s earnings yield of 9 51  places it in the 91st percentile of the market  the 86th percentile of the financials sector  and the 69th percentile of the insurance group  Its price to book ratio of 0 82 implies that you can buy the stock at a near 20  discount on book value  providing plenty of downside protection should anything drastic happen  Not only that  but by the end of 2014  MetLife reported a near 17  year over year growth in total book value per share   reflecting the opportunity to invest in a company that is growing aggressively Where MET becomes even more attractive is when its price to free cash flow ratio is considered  At 4 34  MET has a more attractive price to free cash than 97  of the market  and the fifth best P FCF of all large cap   10B    100B  stocks  The company s relatively average dividend yield  1 02   is the lone weak spot  though we believe the company should be bought for capital appreciation rather than income generation  Given these five valuation metrics  we rate MET as strongly undervalued and expect them to generate significant outperformance  13 6   over the market due to it 
Growth Breakdown
There are a number of different growth metrics that have been academically proven to predict stock returns  Most important among them is price momentum  Winning stocks   and losing stocks tend to keep losing  While we believe MET should be bought because of its value  one should never ignore metrics that have been proven to have predictive ability  MET s growth profile is shown below 
Although MET s 6 month and 12 month price performance has been relatively weak  investors have reason to be optimistic as MET s price has risen 10  in less than a month since the uptick in the 10yr treasury yield that started on Feb  2  2015  Though MET is relatively weak by traditional measures of momentum  the short term activity in treasury yields should prove hopeful for investors  As we touched on above  its earnings growth of 172  is fantastic relative to any segment of the market  Finally  while ROE and ROA remain low  they have also both seen dramatic increases in the past year  Overall  we rateMetLife as a weak growth company and predict its growth metrics to have a negligible effect on driving its stock price 
 Smart Money  Breakdown
In addition to value and momentum  we will also analyze how the  smart money  on the Street is playing MetLife   Smart money  stakeholders are short sellers  company insiders  and institutions  Each of these stakeholders tends to be much more sophisticated than the average investor due to their inherent advantages  Company insiders know their company inside out while institutions and short sellers spend millions of dollars on research  We have found loads of academic research showing that   company insiders  and  all predict stock returns  MetLife s  smart money  breakdown is shown below 

Though none of these metrics provide any definitive answers on MET  the relatively low short float and moderate institutional buying are definite positive signs  A negative insider transaction number  implying that insider ownership is decreasing  is usually a red flag  however when compared with the market average of  10 03   MetLife s  5 17  change in insider ownership appears to be less concerning  Overall  we rate the  smart money  as being moderately bullish on the stock  which is a good sign for the stock s future performance 
Qualitative Analysis and Conclusions
It s clear from these metrics that MetLife is greatly undervalued  and the reason is most likely due to regulatory uncertainty surrounding the company and industry in the past couple of years  One such concern is the SIFI designation that MetLife received on December 18th  2014 by the Financial Stability Oversight Council 
Though it s not exactly clear as to what extent this designation will affect MetLife internally  the consensus is that it will limit MetLife s ability to dish out dividends as capital has to be tied up in reserves MetLife is fighting the designation in court  though its unclear what the outcome will be  More importantly though  low yield curves and low interest rates are the main reasons for MetLife s undervaluation  While obviously hard to predict  it s clear that interest rates will be coming up sooner rather than later  with the consensus predicting next September   Given the company s confidence in its  1B increase to its share repurchasing program  the growth in institutional purchasing  and most importantly  it s undervaluation  now is a good time to bet on MetLife in the next year ",2015-02-26,Quantified Alpha,https://www.investing.com/analysis/metlife-combines-an-attractive-value-with-growth-243244,243244
