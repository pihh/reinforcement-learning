6806,228321,WFTLF,Weatherford  WFT  Posts Wider Q1 Loss  revised ,opinion,"Weatherford International plc   NYSE WFT   reported first quarter 2019 adjusted loss of 48 cents per share  wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 13 cents  The figure was also wider than the year ago loss of 25 cents 
Total revenues of  1 346 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 348 million  Also  the figure declined from  1 423 million in the year ago quarter 
Weak results in the first quarter were attributed to a plunge in operating income from its Western Hemisphere segment  Lower activity levels and operating margin  which resulted from reduced product sales in Canada  affected the company s bottom line 
Chapter 11 in the Company s Future 
Weatherford has not filed for Chapter 11  The company has a restructuring support agreement  RSA  in place with a group of its senior noteholders  which is expected to allow Weatherford to eventually pursue a Chapter 11 filing through a  pre packaged  process  It has been more than four years since the company reported a profit  Notably  the stock plunged around 60  in the pre market trading session Weatherford International PLC Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

   Operational Performance
Total operating loss in the quarter came in at  301 million compared with the year ago loss of  39 million 
In the first quarter  segmental operating income in the Western Hemisphere was  9 million  down 63  year over year primarily due tolower activity levels and operating margin  which resulted from reduced product sales in Canada  Moreover  start up costs of projects in Latin America and employee retention expenses added to the woes  The negatives were partially offset by improved results from higher integrated service project activity in Latin America 
Segmental operating income in the Eastern Hemisphere was  20 million  up 25  year over year  supported by lower direct expenses and cost improvements from the company s transformation program 
Total costs and expenses surged from  1 462 million in the year ago period to  1 647 million in first quarter 2019  primarily due to the incurrence of a  229 million goodwill impairment charge 
Balance Sheet 
As of Mar 31  2019  Weatherford had only  598 million of cash and cash equivalents  and  7 6 billion in long term debt 
Zacks Rank and Stocks to Consider

6814,228329,WFTLF,The Best And Worst Stocks Of The 10 Year Bull Market,opinion,It has been 10 years since the U S  stock market touched its post financial crisis nadir on Mar 9  2009  Since then  American stocks have gained despite concerns about global economic growth  anxieties related to central bank policies and tit for tat trade war threats  Having said that  the United States and China s initiative to reach a deal  stabilize interest rates and an uptick in consumer confidence have surely provided the required impetus to stocks The current bull run has lifted both the S P 500 and the Dow Jones index by more than 400   Since the financial crisis  increase in share prices and dividends helped the broader S P 500  in particular  add nearly  21 trillion to its value  per the S P Dow Jones Indices In the meantime  the tech laden Nasdaq has risen more than 500   mostly led by fast growing tech bigwigs including the FAANGs  For instance  Apple Inc    NASDAQ AAPL   has given its shareholders a 1 373 7  return since the financial crisis  while Netflix  Inc    NASDAQ NFLX   returned 6 396 7   In other words  if you had bought  100 000 in Netflix stock on Mar 9  2009  you would have been a millionaire by now Not all stocks  however  have performed well over the course of the past decade  And the disparity between the top performers and the worst is rather shocking  Some companies  in fact  saw their shares tumble around 90   Let us take a look at some of the market s top and bottom dwellers during the 10 year bull phase Top Stocks of the Past DecadeThe biggest gainer in the past decade  a whopping 23 296 6   is none other than Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc   NASDAQ JAZZ    Around 10 years back  the company was struggling to get approval for its drugs  Its antidepressant Luvox was encountering hurdles  while narcolepsy drug Xyrem needed to gain traction  And how can we forget that the company was compelled to trim 24  of its workforce in 2008 due to earnings pressure But things have changed for the better  Xyrem is now the company s primary brand and Defitelio used for cancer treatment is picking up  Jazz Pharmaceuticals also bought the rights to Defitelio in 2014 The company currently has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   In the past 60 days  Jazz Pharmaceuticals has seen nine earnings estimates move up  while none moved down for the current year  The

month  more than the  industry s rise of 2 7  Lululemon Athletica Inc  s   NASDAQ LULU   shares in the past 10 years scaled an amazing 6 541   But  the company had its share of ups and downs  It had to recall a few of its black yoga pants due to transparency issue in 2013  compelling the then CEO Chip Wilson to step down  However  the company managed to notch double digit growth  purely on brand

introducing the first artificial heart to the market  And the company saw its shares jump an incredible 6 108  over the past decade  with the rally picking up in 2017  Impella s sales growth was predominantly responsible for the rally The company currently has a Zacks Rank  2  In the past 60 days  ABIOMED has seen six earnings estimates move up  while one moved down for the current year  The

Schlumberger to Kick Off Oil Service Q1 Earnings  What s Next 
Teaser Conservative spending by explorers and producers is likely to hurt demand for oil service firms despite favorable Q1 crude price 
Schlumberger Limited will be the first oil service firm to release earnings for the March quarter of 2019 tomorrow  The release will give investors a brief idea of how other energy companies could fare this earnings season 
Halliburton Company is set to report next week  offering more clarity 
About Oilfield Service Business
The oilfield service players offer technologies to oil and natural gas drillers for efficient drilling and setting up of wells  Among the services offered are manufacturing and mending of equipment that are utilized for extracting crude from wells 
Notably  drillers are specializing in horizontal or angled drilling since explorers and producers are not finding it profitable to employ vertical drilling techniques to many wells  It is the responsibility of oilfield service firms to help explorers drill horizontal wells more efficiently 
Overall  the fate of all oil service firms is positively correlated to crude prices and also to the capital investment decisions of drillers 
Q1 Oil Prices Favorable  Conservative Spending Hurts
The recovery in oil price  roughly 30  for West Texas Intermediate crude  through the March quarter of 2019 is likely to influence results for all oilfield service giants  Tightening of crude supplies  thanks to production cut by the OPEC  and a favorable global economy back the commodity s record first quarter gain 
The general theory of economics is that favorable oil price encourages explorers and producers to ramp up upstream operations  which may result in more Q1 contracts for oil service firms  This time around  the scenario was different for the March quarter of 2019 
Explorers and producers kick started 2019 with a conservative capital budget as they witnessed massive crude downturn during the fourth quarter of 2018  Moreover  explorers are more bothered about bottom line growth   being forced by investors following years of dull returns  than oil and gas production  Hence  conservative spending by explorers and producers is likely to hurt demand for oil service firms despite favorable crude price in Q1

6825,228340,WFTLF,National Oilwell  NOV  Hits 52 Week High  More Growth Ahead ,opinion,National Oilwell Varco  Inc  s   NYSE NOV   shares have scaled a 52 week high of  40 92 in yesterday s trading session  before eventually closing at  40 64  generating a healthy year to date rate of more than 12 8   Notably  the stock has had a good run on the bourses over a year with its shares moving up 7 7   handily outperforming its  s decline of more than 11 6  in the same time frame This Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock has the potential for further price appreciation with long term earnings growth expectation of 6  and looks poised to touch new highs in the coming period  You can see The company fared much better in 2017 compared with 2016  reporting a net loss of  237 million last year  significantly narrower than net loss of  2 412 million in 2016  National Oilwell Varco has also managed to post an average positive earnings surprise of 6 88  in the trailing four quarters  The Houston based energy equipment supplier expects to deliver year over year growth of 12  and 162  in its revenues and earnings  respectively  in 2018 Let s delve deeper to analyze what s driving the stock Crude Recovery to AidOil prices have finally recovered from their historic lows  settling at  60 46 per barrel at the end of 2017  up about 12 5  year over year  The improving energy landscape is attributed to tightening supplies  brighter demand outlook and OPEC deal extension talks  The energy equipment supplier is likely to realize the benefit of recovering commodity price environment Since the start of this year  with crude prices comfortably trading more than  60 and drilling activities on the mend  we expect to witness National Oilwell Varco s revenues  earnings and cash flow to grow gradually In particular  strong demand for the company s land related businesses in North America bode well for the energy equipment maker  With majority of its revenues generated from onshore markets  the company expects to return to profitability in 2018 Efficiency Strides Fuel EarningsSolid execution and cost cut initiatives helped the company to deliver  289 million increase in its Adjusted EBITDA  which stood at  611 million in 2017 compared with  322 million in 2016  We believe that National Oilwell s aggressive cost reduction and improved efficiencies  which have helped it wade through tough industry environment over the past few years  will continue to boost the company s results in the coming period Wellbore Technologies Segment Set for GrowthWellbore Technologies generated strong revenues of  2 577 million in 2017  driven by robust demand for the unit s services  products and technologies  The unit s adjusted EBITDA surged to  305 million in 2017 compared with  90 million in 2016 Robust performance from onshore levered Wellbore Technologies segment is likely to buoy the company s top line and earnings in the future as well  Notably  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the EBITDA of the Wellbore Technology segment for the to be reported quarter stands at  117 million compared with  107 million and  38 million in the prior quarter and year ago quarter  respectively Cutting Edge Technology to Drive PerformanceNational Oilwell is one of the biggest manufacturers of drilling equipment in the world  with an impressive business model  It is a global leader in solids control technology and waste management  Of late  the company embarked on a series of acquisitions including Remacut and Fjords Processing among others  expanding its directional drilling and diversifying the range of completion tools offering National Oilwell is well positioned to deliver fluids processing technologies  as the production shifts to unconventional basins  The company is also uniquely positioned to bring automation and big data solutions to the oilfield The company s joint venture with Saudi Aramco is also expected to support NOV s drilling technology franchise and contribute to earnings Strong Cash Flow Generation Bodes WellNational Oilwell s debt to capital ratio stands at around 16   which is much lower than most of its peers including Weatherford International plc   NYSE WFT    NOW Inc    NYSE DNOW   and Exterran Corporation   NYSE EXTN   among others  The company s current ratio also stands at 3 07  higher than most of its peers  Low leverage and high liquidity metrics increase National Oilwell s financial flexibility  helping the company to tap on various growth opportunities Free cash flow for the company was around  641 million in 2017  The newly enacted tax reforms will also help it to lower its cash taxes  boosting cash flow further Offshore Segment  A Spoiler Notably  late last year  National Oilwell combined two of its offshore levered segments  Rig Systems and Rig Aftermarkets  into a single unit named Rig Technologies  The strategy has enabled the company to reduce administration burden and better align the company with evolving market conditions However  we remain concerned about the offshore market that will likely lag the U S  land related market  Declining backlog associated with the Rig Technologies segment  due to lower activities and order cancellations  is a cause of concern Final ThoughtsWhile National Oilwell is facing a few challenges in its Rig Technologies segment  we expect the company to tide over this limitation on the back of its strong onshore focused Wellbore segment  superior technologies  robust financial metrics and operational efficiency Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply  one company stands out as

6849,228364,WFTLF,Can Completion   Production Boost Halliburton s Q4 Earnings ,opinion,"We expect Halliburton Company s   NYSE HAL   Completion and Production segment   which makes up around 65  of the oilfield service provider s total revenue and more than 80  of its operating income   to post improved results in fourth quarter 2017  This could help Halliburton notch its 14th consecutive quarterly outperformance when it reports on Monday  Jan 22 
 See more in     
The Completion and Production segment supplies cementing  stimulation  intervention and completion services  The unit comprises of production enhancement services  completion tools and services  and cementing services 
A Look at Halliburton s Completion and Production Performance in Q3
Completion and Production revenue grew 12 9  sequentially and 62 5  from the year ago level  Operating income from the segment was  525 million  significantly higher than the  24 million a year ago  The division also improved from previous quarter s income of  397 million  helped by better utilization and pricing in the North American land market    especially in Halliburton s pressure pumping  completion tools and cementing product service lines 
Oil Tailwinds to Boost Q4 Activity
With U S  rig count falling to record levels in 2016  oilfield services players  like Halliburton  were hit hard  Unprecedented declines in activity levels and a sharp fall in upstream spending led to lower revenues and pricing headwinds  However  as commodity prices steadily improve and drilling activities pick up  the market for services companies is on the mend 
The U S  oil benchmark wrapped up a strong quarter amid continued declines in domestic inventories and an improving supply demand narrative  With fundamentals pointing to a tighter market  oil ended 2017 at  60 42 per barrel   the first settlement above  60 since June 2015  A year ago  crude futures hovered around the  53 per barrel mark 
Though we are still not anywhere near the activity highs seen in 2014  spending on exploration projects have experienced a much awaited rebound  The energy explorers  buoyed by the jump in commodity prices  are set for improving sales and earnings   a part of which is likely to be pocketed by the long struggling oilfield service providers 
In particular  the North American land market is improving rapidly  driven by increased utilization and pricing    particularly for pressure pumping 
Completion and Production Unit to Benefit
Consequently  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Halliburton s largest segment s fourth quarter revenue is pegged at  3 641 million  60 5  higher than the reported figure in the corresponding quarter of 2016 and up 3  sequentially 
And with the Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company seeing continued pricing strength  its operating income for the division is expected to jump to  570 million from just  85 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and representing a 9  sequential increase 
 You can see   
Overall Earnings   Revenue Projections
Notably for the world s second largest oilfield services company after Schlumberger   NYSE SLB    the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 46 cents reflects a massive growth from the prior year quarter profit of 4 cents  Also  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of  5 574 million indicates a 38 6  increase on a year over year basis 
Our Take
The improving oil price outlook and strengthening North American market conditions have led to strong demand for Halliburton s completions equipment and services  This will support the company s top and bottom line growths 
Earnings Schedules of Other Major Oilfield Service Providers
Among the major players  Schlumberger is scheduled to release today  while Baker Hughes  a GE company   NYSE BHGE   will report on Jan 24  Weatherford International plc   NYSE WFT    another biggie  will report fourth quarter earnings early next month

A rough 2017 
Weatherford had a particularly rough year  with share prices continuing to follow a trend of gradual and serious decline  The company s fate has largely mirrored that of crude oil prices  which remain lackluster  The global oil industry had early hopes that it would be buoyed by the election of gas and crude oil friendly president Donald Trump  but executives at Weatherford may have invested too much confidence in the future of crude 
Regardless of what broader trends are saying about the oil market  investors interested in Weatherford in particular will want to know how the company has shaped up in the past few years  Investigating its recent performance  financial backers of Weatherford will find themselves seriously wanting  stocks have   plunging in 2016 and 2017 in particular  and corporate shakeups have done little to bring in increased revenue figures 
Some still remain confident in Weatherford s future  however  insisting that future ventures by the company could reap in high profits for decades to come  providing it finds the right field or project  After news recently surfaced that Weatherford decided to   however  some may be worried that the company s future prospects are looking grimmer by the month 
For Weatherford to continue to enjoy the financial backing of Wall Street  it will need to do more to show it s eagerly exploring ventures that can help it out of its current straits  The company will soon find it s entirely uncompetitive against its leading contenders if it fails to get any large projects rolling by the end of the year  at the absolute latest  With share prices grimly staring at investors  serious clout will be put on executives to make large changes as soon as possible 
Can crude make a comeback 
Many of the same questions that dog Weatherford s future prospects can also be applied to the broader oil industry it s a part of  As more ecofriendly energy alternatives like solar and wind become cheaper and more widely adopted  companies like Weatherford will struggle to generate the kind of demand oil has created in the past  The company s wise investing in future energy systems  then  could be its ticket to long term success despite its current woes and  
Having to contend with some serious competition from increased natural gas drilling in recent years  however  particularly with fracking becoming so popular in states like Pennsylvania  Weatherford may yet find itself in a corner  Until some solution can be figured out to oil s existing price problems  companies like Weatherford may find themselves financially stranded 
With Weatherford having recently sold its hydraulic fracturing business to Schlumberger  a serious  and much larger  rival  analyst may be left exasperated and unclear of what else the company can do to rescue itself  The energy market is entirely unforgiving to non entrepreneurial companies that fail to develop long term ambitions that can seriously become a reality  and Weatherford s lack of an existing joint venture or game plan to overcome existing energy crises seems worrying to many onlookers 
The company is also seriously straddled by its debt  too  Weatherford has nearly  8 billion in debt  a figure that could climb in coming years if oil prices remain low and it fails to scratch together any ventures with competitors  While the company can sell units to raise cash in order to pay off that mountain of debt  investors will be looking for increased revenues to show that its debt dilemma is nothing more than a temporary rut 
Furthermore  for Weatherford to find success in its industry  it will need the proper tools and employees for the job  Skilled workers and drilling equipment are in incredibly high demand currently  and Weatherford s existing equipment is rapidly growing older and in need of tune ups before it can be safely used  Before it can climb out of its rapidly deepening debt hole  then  Weatherford will need to refurbish its equipment and ensure its workers possess the necessary skills to make it in today s rapidly evolving energy market 
Weatherford s grave hasn t been entirely dug for it yet  and the company could yet strike black gold in an oilfield that could see it mount an impressive comeback  It s nonetheless chained down by debt and facing serious competition in an industry it doesn t seem prepared to evolve with  however  and there s little reason to believe its share prices will spike up soon  For Weatherford to survive 2018  it needs to shape up quickly ",2018-01-05,Alex Newman,https://www.investing.com/analysis/weatherford-international-shares-stumble-into-2018-200278000,200278000

6866,228381,WFTLF,In Mexico s shale patch  cartel violence scares off drillers,news,By Adriana Barrera REYNOSA  Mexico  Reuters    The oil and gas fracking boom has lured scores of drillers to the Eagle Ford region of South Texas  the second largest U S  oil patch  as new production technology opened access to billions more barrels  The play extends across the Mexican border  where its name changes to the Burgos Basin   an equally fertile shale region where the oil and gas sit mostly idle underground in a region terrorized by criminal gangs  The violence here threatens to derail the country s first ever auction of exploration and production rights to its shale fields in February   one that could prove pivotal to its hopes for reversing a national decline in crude and natural gas output to two decade lows  Despite an energy reform push that has aimed to lure investments from foreign oil firms since 2014  only Mexico s state run oil firm Pemex has tried fracking the country s shale reserves  and only experimentally  even as fields that are accessible with traditional drilling methods are drying up  The nine shale oil and gas blocks up for auction are all within Burgos  in the northern state of Tamaulipas  where the Gulf and Zeta cartels have waged a war for control of drug and human trafficking routes since 2010  As security unraveled  at least two Pemex workers were killed and 16 were kidnapped as gangs demanded protection money from oil firms and blocked work crews from accessing wells and pipelines  A manager with Weatherford International Ltd  N WFT   the Switzerland based oilfield services firm  was also murdered   In April  a Pemex security worker guarding installations against fuel thieves was killed and another was shot in an ambush in the Tamaulipas city of Matamoros after gunmen fired some 60 rounds into a vehicle  The Burgos Basin contains about two thirds of the country s technically recoverable shale reserves  estimated at 545 trillion cubic feet  TCF  of gas and 13 1 billion barrels of oil and condensate  compared to the 665 TCF of gas and 58 billion barrels of oil and condensate in the United States  according to the U S  Energy Information Administration   Companies that are already fracking across the border in Texas would likely expand into Mexico if the government could address the violence  oil executives said  Mexican government officials often field questions about security in gatherings where they promoted the nation s drilling opportunities to oil firms   In every meeting I was able to attend  there were questions about security   said Jorge Rios  vice president of operations for Latin America with Precision Drilling  a Canadian company that operates in the Eagle Ford and has drilled in Mexico in the past   The response was not firm    Mexico s energy and interior ministries did not respond to requests for comment  Pemex declined to comment  Repsol  MC REP   a Spanish oil major  left the Burgos Basin in 2014 as the violence escalated  ending operations it began in 2004 as the first foreign firm to drill in Mexico since it nationalized the industry in 1938  The company  which has shale operations in Eagle Ford  would require  very big changes  before it considered returning to the Burgos  a Repsol executive told Reuters on condition of anonymity    In 2014 the situation was difficult to manage   the executive said   Now it s worse   Repsol declined to comment through its Mexican public relations agency on the executive s version of events  GOVERNMENT SILENCE  Mexico s natural gas output fell for third year in a row to 4 240 million cubic feet per day last year  increasing the need of imported gas   almost entirely from the United States   to 84 percent of the nation s consumption  The growing dependence on foreign gas prompted the government to hold a conference for energy companies in the city of Reynosa in Tamaulipas to promote the upcoming shale auction   The cheerfully colored Parque Cultural Reynosa conference center was guarded by soldiers and police armed with automatic weapons  But inside the conference in February  panelists carefully avoided any mention of murders or kidnappings  One panelist told Reuters he had specifically been asked by Tamaulipas state officials to avoid mentioning violence   The government was in promotional mode  They weren t going to talk about the bad things   said another conference participant   Tamaulipas  state energy commission and local officials  which helped organize the conference  did not respond to a request for comment  Security problems were nonetheless top of mind for attendees   who were greeted by the news of crackling shootouts in the crime infested border city  Delegates stayed at a heavily fortified hotel and waited for rides to the conference in armored vehicles guarded by soldiers   In the days leading up to the conference  about a dozen bodies were left in the streets as cartel linked to the Gulf and Zeta cartels mounted roadblocks and battled security forces  Two weeks before  in the nearby city of Nuevo Laredo  a gun battle broke out within meters of where the mayor was giving a speech   Another conference participant   a Houston area businessman   said the Mexican government had taken a head in the sand approach to the violence  one he compared unfavorably to Colombia  where senior security officials showed up at energy conferences a few years ago to reassure investors of progress in fighting armed rebels    If Mexico had a solution   he said   they would have talked about it     THAT S WHAT MADE US LEAVE   In 2003  Repsol was awarded a service contract by Pemex in the Burgos Basin to develop several conventional natural gas fields along the Reynosa Monterrey area for 10 years  Repsol increased production at the region after an initial investment of  170 million  but returned the installation to the state run firm in early 2014  When Repsol started  the Reynosa region was relatively calm  but within a couple of years it plunged into chaos after President Felipe Calderon went on the offensive against drug cartels  The Repsol executive said oil firms had to guard against kidnappings  extortion and having workers caught in crossfires between rival gangs  along with is now Mexico s fastest growing organized crime   fuel theft  The firm invested in private security  the executive said  but it wasn t enough   That s what made us leave   the executive said  A senior Pemex executive compared the current situation in Tamaulipas to Iraq and Colombia during their years of conflict  saying oil companies could operate with appropriate safety measures    You can work  perhaps not as efficiently as we would like  but you don t lose money  either   the executive said  Other companies including Newpek  a unit of Mexico s Alfa  MX ALFAA   and a consortium of Mexico s Jaguar Exploraci n y Producci n with a unit of Canada s Sun God Resources  came to drill in Tamaulipas state after the 2014 government oil reforms   By the time they arrived  strict protocols had been introduced by operators and service firms in the area  keeping employees inside between 4 p m  and 8 a m  and coordinating with the military before moving into the field  To avoid dangerous misunderstandings  cars are clearly marked with company logos and employees avoid wearing clothes that the criminals could mistake for security forces  two oil workers told Reuters  They practice defensive driving  move in convoys and are told to respond honestly if interrogated by the cartel   Women are generally not permitted to work beyond the major urban areas   I was not allowed to go into the field because there is a high risk I could be raped   one female worker said   Liberty Oilfield Services  N LBRT   whose operations include the Eagle Ford  has not considered operating in Mexico in part because of safety concerns   The safety of our workers in Mexico would be a massive concern   said Liberty Chief Executive Officer Chris Wright   We d take some of our own actions for security and guards  but maybe that s not enough

6871,228386,WFTLF,Weak demand  falling prices signal new troubles for oilfield services,news,"By Liz Hampton HOUSTON  Reuters    The recent drop in U S  oil prices to around  46 a barrel and insufficient demand are throwing into doubt the prospects for oilfield service companies in 2019 and may portend a wave of restructuring and consolidation of an industry still recovering from the 2014 downturn in energy markets   Despite record U S  oil production and exports  producers are reducing their spending and learning to do jobs with fewer crews  There has not been the wholesale staff cutbacks such as the ones that occurred three years ago  but investors and analysts expect consolidation in the services sector as work dwindles and share prices fall   Even service companies that have strong businesses have been unable to get contract prices back to pre crash levels  At onshore driller Scandrill Inc  all of its 15 rigs are active in U S  oilfields  When two clients decided to stop drilling  new customers picked up the slack  However  the rates that Scandrill charges for its rigs are below where they were at the depths of the 2014 oil price crash  said President Paul Mosvold    We won t see an increase in daily operating margin or the daily rig contracting rate soon   he said in a phone interview this month   Some oil producers have cut services work  Diamondback Energy  N FANG  this month released two of its 10 hydraulic fracturing crews and next year plans to operate between 18 and 22 drilling rigs  down from 24 rigs at work earlier this month   Oilfield services company investors are cutting their holdings  The Philadelphia SE Oil Service Index  OSX   which tracks some of the largest oilfield service companies  this week fell below 81  the lowest since 2003 and below where it traded when oil prices crashed to near  26 a barrel in 2016  With oil prices at their lowest level in over a year  the services sector should brace for a wave of restructurings and consolidation  analysts and attorneys told Reuters in interviews    The oilfield sector has the largest group of struggling companies within the energy industry  I think these companies need to consolidate  no matter what   said Sean Wheeler  a mergers and acquisition attorney at law firm Kirkland   Ellis  Wheeler has been fielding inquiries from service providers wanting to evaluate options for restructuring if prices do not recover   Contract driller Parker Drilling  PK PKDSQ  in December filed for pre arranged bankruptcy after failing to earn an annual profit since 2014  when oil prices started a long decline   One problem is the number of companies operating in the market  attorneys and analysts said  Competition for fewer jobs is making it hard for service companies to raise prices   something that is benefiting shale producers    The availability of frac crews is great for us   said Bob Watson  chief executive of  Abraxas Petroleum  Corp  O AXAS   Watson said he was shocked recently when Abraxas received 15 bids for a one well frack job in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico    We got a very good price   he said   Things are slowing down on the completions side   The weaker outlook is pressuring shares of top oilfield firms  Schlumberger NV  N SLB  and  Halliburton Co   N HAL  are trading below levels seen during the last oil price downturn  and Weatherford International Plc  N WFT  recently warned investors its shares could be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange if it can not lift its stock price above  1

6873,228388,WFTLF,More Rigs Gather At Permian Basin As Oil   Gas Prices Recover,opinion,In its weekly release  Houston based oilfield services player Baker Hughes  a GE company   NYSE BHGE    reported an increase in natural gas rig count in the United States  The number of rigs exploring oil remained in line with the prior week DetailsWeekly Summary  Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 915 in the week ended Nov 17   higher than the prior week s 907  This marked an increase in total rig count for two consecutive weeks after the tally fell for five weeks in a row Since it slipped to an all time low of 404 last May  rig count has been rising rapidly in U S  shale resources  Punctuated by a few pauses  the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior year level of 588 For the week in discussion  the rise in rig count can be attributed to increased onshore and offshore operations  The count of rigs engaged in offshore works rose from 18 to 21  while the tally for onshore activities jumped to 893 from 888 The number of rigs for inland waters remains flat with the previous week Oil Rig Count  Oil rig count of 738 is in line with the prior week mark  Also  the current tally  though far from the peak of 1 609 attained in October 2014  is significantly above the previous year s count of 471 Natural Gas Rig Count  The natural gas rig count   which plunged to its lowest last August   increased by eight units to 177  Like oil  the count of rigs for gas exploration sits comfortably above the year ago tally of 116 As per the most recent report  the number of natural gas directed rigs is almost 89  below the all time high of 1 606 achieved in late summer 2008 Rig Count by Type  The number of vertical drilling rigs increased by six units to 63  while the horizontal directional rig count  encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations  also known as shale formations  increased by two units to 852 Gulf of Mexico  GoM   The GoM rig count stands at 21 units   17 of which were oil directed   higher than the prior count of 18 Details of the Weekly Rig CountBaker Hughes  data  issued since 1944 at the end of every week  helps energy service providers gauge the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry Change in Baker Hughes  rotary rig count weighs heavily on demand for energy services like drilling  completion  production  etc   provided by companies like Halliburton Company   NYSE HAL    Schlumberger Ltd    NYSE SLB    Weatherford International plc   NYSE WFT    Diamond Offshore Drilling  Inc    NYSE DO   and Transocean Ltd    NYSE RIG   ConclusionThe number of rigs exploring natural gas in the United States has increased  while the count for oil remains the same as last week  Overall total oil and gas rig count has increased  primarily supported by the addition of five rigs in the Permian basin  Haynesville shale play witnessed two more rigs for upstream operations   A rise in total rig count  both from the year ago and prior week figures  were primarily supported by recovering oil and natural prices  Recently  crude and gas traded at  56 09 per barrel and  3 05 per million Btu respectively  higher than last year s average marks of  43 29 and  2 52   per The U S  Energy Information

6890,228405,WFTLF,International Recovery Drives Halliburton  HAL  Q4 Earnings,opinion,"Oilfield services behemoth Halliburton Company   NYSE HAL   reported higher than expected fourth quarter profit on robust international activity  This more than offset slowdown in the North American completion services demand that led to pricing pressure in the hydraulic fracturing business   
The world s second largest oilfield services company after Schlumberger   NYSE SLB   saw its adjusted income from continuing operations  excluding a tax benefit associated with change in the company s corporate structure  come in at 41 cents per share  ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 37 cents 
However  the bottom line was below the adjusted earnings of 53 cents in the year earlier quarter  Net income reported by Halliburton was  358 million  22 5  lower than the same period last year 
Meanwhile  revenues of  5 9 billion were approximately flat with the year ago quarter and scraped past the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a 1  
 Halliburton Company Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

    
Management s Outlook
The world s biggest provider of hydraulic fracking noted that for operators in North America  where oil production has reached record levels  it s more about the returns and not growth  The volatility in the commodity price has convinced explorers and producers to take a relatively conservative approach on capital expenditure programs  Meanwhile  Halliburton is witnessing steady recovery in its international business 
In response to the changing market dynamics  the company is looking to cut down on spending  develop sophisticated technologies and generate strong cash flow from operations 
Segmental Performance
Operating income from the Completion and Production segment was  496 million  10 5  below the year ago level of  554 million  The division s performance was affected by lower stimulation activity and pricing in North America 
However  the segment operating income bettered our consensus estimate of  466 million  The outperformance could be attributed to increased completions activity internationally and higher stimulation activity in Argentina 
Meanwhile  Drilling and Evaluation unit profit fell from  293 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 to  185 million in the corresponding period of 2018  The segment income was also below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  220 million  The underperformance was on account of lower drilling activity in the Western Hemisphere 
Balance Sheet
Halliburton s capital expenditure in the fourth quarter was  551 million  As of Dec 31  2018  the Zacks Rank  4  Sell  company had approximately  2 billion in cash cash equivalents and  10 4 billion in long term debt  representing a debt to capitalization ratio of 52 2

6896,228411,WFTLF,US Drillers Remove Oil   Gas Rigs From Shale Plays,opinion,"In its weekly release  Houston based oilfield services player Baker Hughes reported a decrease in oil and gas rig counts in the United States     
Details
Weekly Summary  Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 928 in the week ended Oct 13   lower than the prior week s 936  This marked a decline in rig count for seven times in the last 10 weeks    
Since it slipped to an all time low of 404 last May  rig count has been rising rapidly in U S  shale resources  Punctuated by a few pauses  the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior year level of 539 
For the week in discussion  the fall in rig count can be attributed to lower onshore and offshore operations  The count of rigs engaged in offshore works slipped from 22 to 20  while the tally for onshore activities fell to 907 from 913 
However  the tally for inland waters remained the same at one 
Oil Rig Count  Oil rig count fell by five to 743  It is to be noted that the rigs exploring crude decreased for five times in the last six weeks  But  the current tally  though far from the peak of 1 609 attained in October 2014  is significantly above the previous year s count of 432   
Natural Gas Rig Count  The natural gas rig count   which plunged to its lowest last August   declined by two units to 185  However  like oil  the count of rigs for gas exploration sits comfortably above the year ago tally of 105  As per the most recent report  the number of natural gas directed rigs is nearly 88 5   below the all time high of 1 606 achieved in late summer 2008   
Rig Count by Type  The number of vertical drilling rigs decreased by two units to 63  while the horizontal rig count  encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations  also known as shale formations  fell by six units to 786 
Gulf of Mexico  GoM   The GoM rig count stands at 20 units   17 of which were oil directed   lower than the prior count of 22 
Details of the Weekly Rig Count
Baker Hughes  data  issued since 1944 at the end of every week  acts as a yardstick for energy service providers in gauging the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry 
Change in Baker Hughes  rotary rig count weighs heavily on demand for energy services  drilling  completion  production  etc   provided by companies like Halliburton Company   NYSE HAL    Schlumberger Ltd    NYSE SLB    Weatherford International plc   NYSE WFT    Diamond Offshore Drilling  Inc    NYSE DO   and Transocean Ltd    NYSE RIG   
Conclusion
The number of rigs exploring oil and natural gas in the United States has decreased  thanks to the removal of six rigs from the Eagle Ford shale play  Moreover  the Barnett shale saw the removal of four rigs 
Declining rig count  helping reducing crude glut  helped oil price to settle above the  50 per barrel mark again   
Development in this front is likely to prove beneficial for oil and gas exploration and production companies  Two oil stocks that might make valuable additions to your portfolio now are Abraxas Petroleum  AXAS  and Cimarex Energy  XEC   Both the stocks carry a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see

6905,228420,WFTLF,US Gas Rigs Rise As Drillers Return To Shale Plays ,opinion,"In its weekly release  Houston based oilfield services player Baker Hughes  a GE company   NYSE BHGE    reported a rise in natural gas rig count in the United States 
Details
Weekly Summary  Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 944 in the week ended Sep 8   higher than the prior week s 943  This shows an increase in total rig count for two weeks in a row after four straight weeks of a decline 
Since it slipped to an all time low of 404 last May  rig count has been rising rapidly in the U S  shale resources  Punctuated by a few pauses  the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior year level of 508 
For the week in discussion  the rise in rig count can be attributed to increased activity in inland waters 
Rig count in both onshore and offshore operations is in line with the prior week  The respective rig counts for onshore and offshore drilling are 923 and 16 
Oil Rig Count  Oil rig count slipped by three to 756  It is to be noted that the rigs exploring crude has decreased five times in the last eight weeks 
The current tally  though far from the peak of 1 609 attained in October 2014  is significantly above the previous year s count of 414      
Natural Gas Rig Count  The natural gas rig count   which plunged to its lowest last August   jumped four units to 187  Like oil  the count of rigs for gas exploration sits comfortably above the year ago tally of 92  As per the most recent report  the number of natural gas directed rigs is nearly 89   below the all time high of 1 606 achieved in late summer 2008       
Rig Count by Type  The number of vertical drilling rigs rose by seven units to 75  while the horizontal directional rig count  encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations  also known as shale formations  was down by six to 869  
Gulf of Mexico  GoM   The GoM rig count stands at 16 units   13 of which were oil directed   in line with the prior count 
Details of the Weekly Rig Count
Baker Hughes  data  issued since 1944 at the end of every week  acts as an important yardstick for energy service providers in gauging the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry 
Change in Baker Hughes  rotary rig count weighs heavily on the demand for energy services  drilling  completion  production  etc   provided by companies like Halliburton Company   NYSE HAL    Schlumberger Ltd    NYSE SLB    Weatherford International plc   NYSE WFT    Diamond Offshore Drilling  Inc    NYSE DO   and Transocean Ltd    NYSE RIG   
Conclusion
The number of rigs searching for natural gas in the United States increased  while that for oil decreased  Overall  total oil and gas rigs increased as the drillers gathered in the U S  shale resources  Two rigs were added in each of the respective shale plays of Marcellus  Permian and Haynesville 
We are expecting more rigs to come online as refiners along the gulf coast  hit by Hurricane Harvey  are gradually restarting operations  In other words  more demand for raw crude from the GoM refiners   accounted for more than 45  of domestic oil refining capacity  per The U S  Energy Information Administration  EIA    might drive commodity prices and call for more rigs in the oil and gas patches 
Development in this front is likely to prove beneficial for oil and gas exploration and production companies  Two oil stocks that might make valuable additions to your portfolio are Range Resources Corporation  NYSE RRC  and Lonestar Resources US  LONE   Both the companies sport a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see  
Based in Fort Worth  TX  Range Resources is an independent oil and gas company  engaged in the exploration  development and acquisition of U S  oil and gas resources  We expect year over year earnings growth of almost 1 494 9  for Range Resources in 2017 
Headquartered in Fort Worth  TX  Lonestar explores oil and gas resources in the United States  The company is expected to witness 79 7  year over year earnings growth in 2017

The company s total revenue of  7 905 million improved from the year earlier level of  7 019 million but failed to surpass the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  7 910 million

6910,228425,WFTLF,U S  Tally Of Oil Rigs Flat Amid Harvey Uncertainty,opinion,"In its weekly release  Houston based oilfield services player Baker Hughes  a GE company   NYSE BHGE    reported a decline in rigs searching for crude and natural gas in the country  
Details
Weekly Summary  Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 943 in the week ended Sep 1   higher than the previous week s 940  This shows that the total rig count in the country has increased again after four straight weeks of a decline 
Since it slipped to an all time low of 404 last May  rig count has been rising rapidly in American shale resources  Punctuated by a few pauses  the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior year level of 497 
For the week in discussion  the improvement in rig count can be attributed to higher onshore activities 
Rig count in the onshore business increased by three units  while units engaged in offshore operations fell slightly to 16 from 17 in the prior week   
Oil Rig Count  Oil rig count was in line with the count of 759 recorded in the previous week  It is to be noted that the rigs exploring crude has decreased four times in the last seven weeks 
The current tally  though far from the peak of 1 609 attained in October 2014  is significantly above the previous year s count of 407  
Natural Gas Rig Count  The natural gas rig count   which plunged to its lowest last August   jumped three units to 183  Like oil  the count of rigs for gas exploration sits comfortably above the year ago tally of 88  As per the most recent report  the number of natural gas directed rigs is nearly 89   below the all time high of 1 606 achieved in late summer 2008

Conclusion
The number of rigs searching for natural gas in the United States increased  while that for oil remained flat  This shows that Hurricane Harvey  which was responsible for heavy downpour in the Texas and Louisiana states of the Gulf of Mexico  GoM  area  failed to lower exploration activities 
Although rig count in Texas fell by one unit and the count in Louisiana was flat as compared to the prior week  it seems that the storm has not been felt as much as apprehended 
However  the counts might not be exact as the storm kept Baker Hughes from confirming the increase or decrease in the number of rigs in almost 47 counties of South Texas

6920,228435,WFTLF,Q2 Earnings Overview For Oilfield Service Industry,opinion,"We have already seen a few releases from S P 500 companies in the Q2 earnings season  Major oilfield services companies will start reporting results starting Jul 21  Although our report shows that the Oil Energy sector might post the healthiest earnings performance among all the 16 Zacks sectors  the story for the Zacks categorized  industry is somewhat different 
The industry has been grappling with huge debt and low cash balances  On top of that  cash flow from core operations is getting weaker by the day  The April to June quarter of 2017 has not been able to reverse the unimpressive performance of the Oil   Gas Field Services industry over the last few quarters  Most importantly  during Q2  the industry underperformed the S P 500 index 
About the Oil   Gas Field Services Industry
Companies belonging to this industry primarily support drilling players in efficiently setting up oil and gas wells  These firms are mainly engaged in manufacturing  repairing and maintaining equipment required for pumping oil 
Halliburton Company   NYSE HAL    Schlumberger Ltd    NYSE SLB    Baker Hughes  a GE company   NYSE BHGE   and Weatherford International plc   NYSE WFT   are four premier oil field services companies  These companies are often referred to as the  Big Four  
Schlumberger  the largest player in the oilfield services industry  is expected to report Q2 earnings on Jul 21  while Halliburton   the second largest player in terms of market capitalization   will likely report on Jul 24  The companies carry a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  while the  for the respective firms are   6 67  and  15 79   respectively  Hence  our proprietary model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for the firms this quarter 
Past Performances Lack Luster
Declining Cash Flow  The industry has not been performing well since the beginning of 2015  Our proprietary model shows that net cash flows from core operations in the industry has declined nearly 55  over the last two years 

Huge Debt Load  The industry is faced with a high debt level  From  6000 million in long term debts at the end of 2013  the level scaled to  8 500 at 2016 end  Also  cash balance declined substantially last year to slightly above  4 500 million 


Industry Lags S P 500 
Pricing chart is generally referred to for analyzing the performance of any stock or industry over a period of time  The price chart clearly shows that the Oil   Gas Field Services industry has underperformed the S P 500 index throughout the second quarter 
During the aforesaid period  the index rose 2 7  while the industry declined 15 6  

 
It is to be noted that in terms of the   the Oil   Gas Field Services industry is among the weak performing industries  The industry is ranked  205 and lies in the bottom 20  of industries 
What s Behind the Bleak Scenario 
Oil   Natural Gas Prices Weak
Oil and gas prices have been low for almost three years now and during second quarter 2017  the prices of both the commodities slipped further  The prolonged weakness is owing to a persistently oversupplied commodity market 
During the April to June quarter of this year  oil and natural gas prices fell 8 4  and 5   respectively  Also  OPEC s historical production cut  deal until Mar 2018 has failed to drive oil 
Natural gas is also an oversupplied commodity as is reflected by its inventory level of 2 816 tcf   as of Jun 23   almost 7  higher than the five year average mark  as per The U S  Energy Information Administration  
Oilfield Services Players at a Disadvantage
Declining oil and gas prices act as a deterrent for exploration and production companies as it affects the cashflow  In fact  many upstream companies are cutting down on their capital investment for exploitation activities which has led to a decline in proved reserves 
These developments might reduce contracts for oilfield service companies

6924,228439,WFTLF,Companies  Governments Evacuating Expats In Iraq,news,"By    Foreign companies and governments are quickly moving their expat workers either out of Iraq or to the safer southern region as militant Islamists swarm the north and center of the country on their quest to conquer the capital Baghdad  
The evacuations follow reports of kidnappings and missing foreign workers that have highlighted the risks to doing business in the war torn country 
Terrorist group Islamic State of Iraq and Syria  ISIS  has kidnapped some 60 foreign workers who were building a hospital near Tikrit  a Turkish news agency reported Tuesday  Another 46 Indian nurses are stranded in Tikrit  a two and a half hour drive north from Baghdad  according to Indian newspaper The Hindu  In addition  Indian government officials fear that ISIS has abducted another 40 Indian construction workers from Mosul  a northern city  while they were fleeing to Baghdad  
 Despite best efforts we are not able to contact them yet  so  we  can t speculate on the situation in Iraq   external affairs ministry  MEA  spokesman Syed Akbaruddin told the Times of India newspaper on Wednesday   A 24 hour control room at MEA headquarters in New Delhi has been set up to monitor situation in Iraq  
Another 50 foreign employees working for Siemens Energy at an Iraqi power plant in Baiji  155 miles north of Baghdad  were flown to Erbil in the north and Baghdad on Sunday while armed men advanced toward Baiji  German English language newspaper The Local reported  
The ISIS insurgents took control of Iraq s biggest oil refinery  located at the same site in Baiji  on Wednesday  
While all expats in Iraq assume certain risks kidnapping and hostage situations are  relatively common  in Iraq  according to The Expat Hub  expats working for oil companies are more likely to encounter dangerous situations  as oil reserves and operations are more likely to become targets for terrorism 
Oil production in the south has so far remained unaffected as militant Islamists roam the northern and central region  Nonetheless  giant oil companies Exxon Mobil  NYSE XOM   BP  NYSE BP  and Petrochina  NYSE PTR  have begun evacuating staff from southern Iraq 
On Tuesday  BP s chief executive  Bob Dudley  told reporters in Moscow   We are just very vigilant in Iraq  Nonessential production people have left  but operations continue   U K  based BP is a major investor in Iraq through the giant Rumaila field  BP spokesman David Nicholas said Wednesday the company would not comment further at this time 
According to Dhiya Jaffar  the head of Iraq s state run South Oil Company  BP has evacuated 20 percent of its staff  and Texas based Exxon has carried out a  major evacuation  of its staff 
 I assure the companies that the current developments in the country have not affected and will not affect in any way the operations in the south    he said  He expects that Iraq s export level for June will be 2 7 million barrels per day  unaffected by the crisis in the north

ExxonMobil spokesman Richard Keil said Wednesday the company does not comment on security matters 
PetroChina  the single biggest investor in Iraq s oil sector  is also pulling staff  The company s joint secretary  Mao Zefeng  told Reuters some nonessential staff have been evacuated  without saying how many or if they were transported out of the country or into safe zones in Iraq  
The insurgents  capture of key cities in the north has highlighted the difficulty Iraq will have meeting its ambitious oil output target of 4 million barrels a day by the end of the year  up from its current 3 3 million barrels a day production  according to the London based macroeconomics think tank Capital Economics  

 The main risk I envision is kind of militia style attacks on oil infrastructure in the south   Tom Pugh  commodities economist for Capital Economics  said   The major facilities  in the south  are very well guarded  an all out invasion on them is unlikely  I think suicide style bombings are more likely  
Pugh said the removal of a few Western workers would not  lead to large economic impact   and added that Saudi Arabia should be able to increase oil production in a matter of  days or weeks rather than months  to offset any cuts in northern Iraqi production  
Foreign direct investment into Iraq is relatively small  equivalent to around 2 percent of GDP  most of which is directed to the oil sector  according to Jason Tuvey  Middle East economist for Capital Economics ",2014-06-18,International Business Times,"https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/companies,-governments-evacuating-expats-in-iraq-290408",290408
6929,228444,WFTLF,U S Rig Count Hits 27 Month Peak  2nd Week Of Steady Growth,opinion,"In its weekly release  Houston based oilfield services Baker Hughes Inc  reported a record high for rigs searching for crude in the country while rigs for natural gas declined   
Details
Weekly Summary  Rigs engaged in the exploration and production in the U S  totaled 952 for the week ended Jul 14  2017  The count is in line with the previous week s count  Last week  the count increased after the number of rigs in the country fell   following 23 successive increases   during the week ended Jun 30  2017 
Since plunging to an all time low of 404 last May  rig count has been rising rapidly in American shale production  Punctuated by a few pauses  the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior year level of 447 
For the week in discussion  the in line rig count could be attributed to higher onshore activity  now at 928 compared to last week s 927   while units engaged in offshore operations remained flat at 21  However  rigs involved in inland waters fell by one unit 
Oil Rig Count  Oil rig count jumped by two to 765  Most importantly  this emphasizes the highest mark for oil rig count since Apr 2015  Also  the current tally  though far off from the peak of 1 609 attained in Oct 2014  is significantly above the previous year s count of 357  
Natural Gas Rig Count  The natural gas rig count   which plunged to its lowest last August   inched down for the fifth time in 14 weeks to 187  a fall of two rigs from the previous week   Like oil  the count of rigs for gas exploration sits comfortably above the year ago tally of 89  As per the most recent report  the number of natural gas directed rigs is languishing nearly 89  below the all time high of 1 606 achieved in late summer 2008 
Rig Count by Type  The number of vertical drilling rigs rose by two units to 76  while the horizontal directional rig count  encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations  also known as shale formations  was down by two to 876

Details of the Weekly Rig Count
Baker Hughes  data  issued since 1944 at the end of every week  acts as an important yardstick for energy service providers in gauging the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry 
Change in Baker Hughes  rotary rig count heavily weighs on the demand for energy services   drilling  completion  production  etc    provided by companies like Halliburton Co    NYSE HAL    Schlumberger Ltd    NYSE SLB    Weatherford International plc   NYSE WFT    Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc    NYSE DO   and Transocean Ltd    NYSE RIG   
Conclusion
Although the number of rigs searching for natural gas in the U S  fell from the prior week  the rig exploring for crude reached a historical high despite persistently weak oil prices  In other words  shale drillers have proved that their operations are still profitable despite crude trading slightly above the  45 per barrel level  
Let s analyze the broader macro scenarios supporting the shale players  OPEC and 11 non OPEC players  including Russia  decided in the Vienna meeting on May 25  to  the production cut deal until Mar 2018  Thus  it is an ideal time for shale players to increase production at the expense of OPEC  especially because oil is trading way above the historical low of last February  No wonder  U S  shale producers have again started gathering to oil patches as they aim to sell the commodity at higher prices 
We should consider President Trump s exit from  as a factor encouraging drillers to continue pumping more oil  
Now  it will be prudent to wait and watch whether shale drillers continue to add rigs in oil resources

Analysis of the Data
Weekly Summary  Rigs engaged in exploration and production in the U S  totaled 952 for the week ended Jul 7  2017  This highlights an increase of 12 from the previous week s count  Last week  the count fell for the first time after rigs in the U S  rose for 23 weeks in a row 
Since plunging to an all time low of 404 last May  rig count has been rising on rapid growth in American shale production  As a result of the steady climb   punctuated by a few pauses   the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior year level of 440 
For the week in discussion  the 12 unit rise in rig count could be attributed to higher onshore activity  now at 927 compared to last week s 915   while units engaged in offshore operations and inland waters stayed flat at 21 and 4  respectively 
Oil Rig Count  The oil rig count jumped by 7 to 763  The current tally  though far off from the peak of 1 609 attained in Oct 2014  is significantly above the previous year s count of 351  
Natural Gas Rig Count  The natural gas rig count   which plunged to its lowest on record last August   inched up for the ninth time in 12 weeks to 189  a gain of 5 rigs from the previous week   Like oil  a string of weekly rig additions has meant that the present count sits comfortably above the year ago tally of 88  As per the most recent report  the number of natural gas directed rigs is languishing nearly 89  below the all time high of 1 606 achieved in late summer 2008

Conclusion

6954,228469,WFTLF,Oil Is On Its Way To A Comeback,opinion,"All On Board
Get on the OPEC non OPEC bandwagon  All other OPEC members are on board for the extension of production cuts leading to speculation that even a bigger cut might be in the works  Saudi Arabia s energy minister  Khalid A  Al Falih  said all producers have agreed extending cuts by another nine months until global supply is back to the 5 year average 
The Saudi oil minister also said he sees signs that the cuts are starting to have an impact  He noted drops in floating storage as well as the streak of falling crude supply in the U S  
Compared to the last time when OPEC met  there is a lot less skepticism about the cartel s ability to cut production  In fact  there has not only been record compliance by the cartel  now there is record belief by OPEC watchers that they will follow through with production cuts  The OPEC  along with its non OPEC co conspirators  have grudgingly earned respect from market watchers  You might be able to argue about the impact the cuts will have on supply  but you can t argue that the cartel is not serious about getting the market in balance 
This is one reason why we still believe that oil will head back to  60 00 a barrel and longer term to  73 00 a barrel  Prices probably would have been higher sooner but releases from the U S  Strategic Petroleum Reserve and floating storage kept oil inventories relatively high 
We also are seeing demand rebound  Many were worried about gasoline demand but as I said before  it was being overstated in part because we had bad weather  Now gas demand is soaring  In fact  AAA is predicting that we will see a surge in demand this Memorial Day weekend  the traditional kick off to the summer driving season  AAA says travel volume will be the highest since 2005  They project that 39 3 million Americans will travel 50 miles or more away from home   That is one million more travelers than last year taking to the roads  skies  rails and water  
Natural gas is making a big comeback  This comes even as weather driven demand is expected to sink to its lowest level of the year in late May according to Andrew Weissman of ECB Analytics  The June natural gas contract tested support near the 200 day moving average for the fifth time in the past week  After support held  the forward curve rebounded modestly  Weissman says that forecasts Sunday trended warmer  particularly in the 6 10 day window  creating the potential for the rebound to continue  As the Memorial Day holiday approaches  however  cash market prices for natural gas are likely to weaken considerably  limiting the upside potential this week  Power sector natural gas demand is likely to decline 1 5 bcf d this week as temperatures revert toward normal through out the nation 
Deal Maker in Chief    Present Donald Trump had a very successful trip to Saudi Arabia  In addition to a barrel load of deals for weapons  there were many deals cut with U S  energy companies  The energy industry will benefit and so will the American people because President Trump is bringing back energy jobs  Many thought this would hurt relations with the Saudis but in fact it has turned out to be the opposite  Instead of a production war  Trump s pro energy agenda has warmed the Saudis  heart  The state oil major  Saudi Aramco  signed contracts with a dozen U S  energy firms including Schlumberger  NYSE SLB   Halliburton  NYSE HAL   Baker Hughes  NYSE BHI   and Weatherford  NYSE WFT to help Saudi Arabia develop local production  They will also cut deals with General Electric  NYSE GE  and drilling companies National Oilwell  NYSE NOV   Nabors Industries  NYSE NBR  and Rowan Companies  NYSE RDC  and others according to a Reuters report  Put one in the win column for all ",2017-05-22,Phil Flynn,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-energy-report-05-22-17-200190563,200190563

6974,228489,WFTLF,Oilfield Services Clash  How Are SLB  HAL Placed Pre Q1 ,opinion,"With Q1 earnings season still picking up  oilfield services majors will start releasing their results this week  The year over year improvement in the oil pricing scenario during the quarter has increased optimism about the prospects of oilfield services companies  This is because the businesses of these firms are directly related to exploration and production activities 
In this context  the first quarter performance of Schlumberger Limited   NYSE SLB   and Halliburton Company   NYSE HAL   is likely to provide an indication about the industry as a whole 
Oil Price Movement in Q1
The market witnessed prolonged weaknesses in oil prices for more than two years owing to plentiful supply of the commodity  To combat the supply glut  OPEC decided to curb production last November   one of the most important steps taken in 2016  Non OPEC producers like Russia followed soon after  resulting in crude crossing the  50 per barrel physiological mark 
The first two months of 2017 were the most favorable for Energy firms as crude was almost consistently over the physiological level during this period 
Meanwhile  U S  shale producers started gathering to the oil patches to take advantage of improved oil prices  This  in turn  pushed the commodity in a comparatively bearish territory during March  In fact  oil traded below the  50 per barrel physiological during the major part of the month 
Although crude ended the January to March quarter of this year 5 8  lower but comparing from the year ago quarter the pricing environment of commodity prices was much healthier  courtesy of the historical OPEC agreement 
How Did Oilfield Services Companies Benefit 
The fate of oilfield services firms are positively correlated with oil prices as these companies help exploration and production firms in efficiently setting up oil and gas wells  In other words  the more exploitation of oil wells  the bigger the requirement for oilfield services 
Although crude displayed year over year improvement  the Zacks categorized  underperformed the S P 500 Index during the first quarter  The industry registered a deterioration of 12 6  during the quarter compared with 5 5  improvement for the S P 500 Index 

Nonetheless  a better oil price scenario raises optimism about the industry to recover from the downturn  Also  the earnings performance of the industry remains to be seen this time around 
Among oilfield service companies   Schlumberger  Halliburton  Baker Hughes Inc    NYSE BHI   and Weatherford International plc   NYSE WFT     are often referred to as the  the big four  to account for their size and scale of operations  Of these firms  Schlumberger is the largest in terms of market capitalization followed by Halliburton  Let s take a look at how Schlumberger and Halliburton are likely to fare in the Q1 earnings season

6978,228493,WFTLF,5 Energy Stocks To Turn It Around In Q4,opinion,"Oil prices moved to the  50 threshold Thursday as government figures showed a draw in crude stocks for the fifth straight week and investors clung on to optimism generated by a decision from the world s largest oil cartel to slash production targets 
Riding the bull run  West Texas Intermediate crude for Nov delivery gained  1 14  or 2 3   to settle at  49 83 a barrel in electronic trading yesterday   the best since Jun 29 
The Catalysts
OPEC Agreement  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries  OPEC   whose member nations supply around 40  of the world s crude  said it would cut production by as much as 750 000 barrels a day starting in November in order to keep oil prices from falling further  Most industry observers didn t have high expectations from the meeting 
OPEC s decision to cut oil production   made in a meeting in Algiers last Wednesday  Sep 28   took most analysts by surprise  The move  led by Saudi Arabia  aims to trim output to 32 5 33 0 million barrels per day from the current 33 5 million barrels per day 
Bullish EIA Numbers  The U S  Energy Department s inventory release showed that crude stockpiles declined for the fifth straight week  continuing to drag down the overall surplus 
The federal government s EIA report revealed that crude inventories fell by 2 98 million barrels for the week ending Sep 30  2016  following a decline of 1 88 million barrels in the previous week 
The analysts surveyed by S P Global Platts   the leading independent commodities and energy data provider   had expected crude stocks to go up some 2 million barrels  A drop in imports and production led to the surprise stockpile draw with the world s biggest oil consumer even as refinery activity slowed 
Following the fifth straight inventory reduction  the year over year storage surplus has narrowed down considerably 
Supportive for Stocks
Year to date   The Energy Select Sector SPDR  has gained an impressive 17 56   easily outperforming the broad based Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S P 500 index  which gained just 4 91  and 5 67   respectively  Most major oil stocks   including mega caps Exxon Mobil Corp    NYSE XOM    Chevron Corp    NYSE CVX   and Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa  plc    relocated in the green with gains of 11 61   13 64  and 12 49   respectively 
There s Still Room for Upside
It s true that record high inventories and tepid demand growth could still push the commodity to the depths of multiyear lows  But signs are emerging that oil prices are likely to stabilize and gradually pick up  Not only is global demand expanding but energy companies have significantly scaled back on plans to explore for and bring out more oil  This should lead to lower future production and supply demand rebalancing 
Secondly  while analysts remain deeply skeptical that the OPEC output curb would be carried through  the early reaction in energy stocks has been positive  Oil prices have jumped more than 10  since the members  meeting in Algeria  and should the ministers agree on production levels in Nov  even higher prices are a likely outcome 
Even as we cannot run down the chances of the market moving sideways and seeing high volatility  many analysts are not too bearish about oil in the remainder of 2016  In fact  some industry observers are of the view that crude prices would break through  50 per barrel yet again before then year end 
Look for Bargain Buys with Strong Fundamentals
If investors are eager to lap up opportunities  a prudent move would be to buy the beaten down stocks with encouraging fundamentals  Stressed valuations do not always indicate that the stock has lost all potential  In fact  some could actually make a great buy  But prospective investors need to do adequate research before betting one s hard earned money on such stocks

The world s No  2 oilfield services company s ninth consecutive quarterly outperformance was also helped by improved utilization on the back of growing North American rig count  The positive results sent Halliburton s shares up 3  in early trading to  48 50 
Halliburton s net income per share came in at 1 cent  contrary to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for a loss of 7 cents  However  revenues of  3 833 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 897 million amid the oil slump HALLIBURTON CO Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
 

   Oil services companies  like Halliburton    providers of technical products and services to drillers of oil and gas wells   are generally the first of the U S  energy firms to kick off an earnings season  The remaining three of the so called Big Four oilfield service and equipment providers   Schlumberger Ltd    NYSE SLB    Baker Hughes Inc    NYSE BHI   and Weatherford International plc   NYSE WFT      report third quarter earnings over this week and next 

Positive Sentiment to Boost Rig Count
Along the results  Halliburton also sounded optimistic in its view that the current industry upturn will boost rig count further  As it is  rig counts have generally been rising during the last four months since plunging to an all time low of 404 in May  with the addition of a flood of new units  As a proof of the recovery  Halliburton reported 9  sequential growth in North American sales  However  most of this bullish sentiment was offset by lower business in other parts of the world 
Outlook   
Halliburton warned that fourth quarter activity is likely to be weak due to holiday and seasonal weather associated disruptions  Moreover  pricing pressure is expected to continue over the near term with international business set to be flat sequentially 
Segmental Performance
Operating income from the Completion and Production segment was  24 million  falling sharply from the year ago profit of  163 million  However  the division turned around from previous quarter s loss of  32 million  helped by improvements in North American pressure pumping activity 
Halliburton s Drilling and Evaluation unit profit also dropped big time   from  401 million in the third quarter of 2015 to  151 million this year  However  the number was almost flat with the  154 million earned in the Jun quarter

6998,228513,WFTLF,North American Recovery Drives Halliburton  HAL  Q1 Earnings,opinion,"Major oilfield services provider Halliburton Company   NYSE HAL   reported better than expected first quarter profit thanks to improved utilization on the back of growing North American rig count 
Halliburton s adjusted income per share from continuing operation  excluding special items  came in at 4 cents  a penny above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 3 cents   the eleventh consecutive quarterly outperformance  However  revenues of  4 279 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  4 281 4 million amid a difficult international market 
Oil services companies  like Halliburton    providers of technical products and services to drillers of oil and gas wells   are generally the first of the U S  energy firms to kick off an earnings season  While the world s biggest oilfield services company Schlumberger Ltd    NYSE SLB     the remaining two of the so called Big Four oilfield service and equipment providers   Baker Hughes Inc    NYSE BHI   and Weatherford International plc   NYSE WFT     report first quarter earnings over the next few days 
North American Market Continues to Recover

Along the results  Halliburton also sounded optimistic in its view that the North American land market is improving rapidly  driven by increased activity  As it is  rig counts have generally been rising during the last ten months since plunging to an all time low of 404 in May 2016  with the addition of a flood of new units  As a proof of the recovery  Halliburton grew its domestic land revenue by nearly 30  sequentially
However  the international market recovery is set to start slower  with lower capex spend for the third successive year affecting economics across deepwater and mature field markets  To make things worse  the sluggish recovery and persistent pricing pressure are signs of another challenging year in the offing Halliburton Company Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
 

   Segmental Performance
Operating income from the Completion and Production segment was  147 million  increasing sharply from the year ago profit of  30 million and the previous quarter s income of  85 million  helped by strong pressure pumping activity and the pricing recovery in the U S  land market 
But Halliburton s Drilling and Evaluation unit profit dropped big time   from  241 million in the first quarter of 2016 to  122 million this year  The number was also way below the  248 million earned in the Dec quarter  driven by lower contribution from software sales  together with reduced pricing and decreased fluid sales in the Middle East 
Balance Sheet
Halliburton s capital expenditure in the first quarter was  265 million 
As of Mar 31  2017  the Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company had approximately  2 107 million in cash cash equivalents and  10 812 million in long term debt  representing a debt to capitalization ratio of 54 6   You can see  
Stock Performance
Halliburton has seen its shares fall 12 9  year to date after gaining more than 50  for 2016  Nevertheless  the company has managed to outperform the  industry across the past six months  and 1 year periods 
Let s wait and see if the latest earnings beat can help the stock break out of recent sluggishness

7002,228517,WFTLF,U S  Rig Count Ticks Down As Natural Gas Drilling Drops,opinion,"In its weekly release  Houston based oilfield services company Baker Hughes Inc    NYSE BHI   reported a fall in the U S  rig count  number of rigs searching for oil and gas in the country    only the second decrease in 12 weeks 
This can be primarily attributed to losses in the tally of natural gas directed rigs  partially offset by higher oil rig count 
Analysis of the Data
Weekly Summary  Rigs engaged in exploration and production in the U S  totaled 506 for the week ended Sep 16  2016  This was down by 2 from the previous week s rig count and represents just the second time the tally did not rise since Jun  Rig counts have generally been increasing during the last three months since plunging to an all time low of 404 in May  with the addition of a flood of new units 
Despite the steady climb   punctuated by a few pauses   the current nationwide rig count is considerably lower than the prior year level of 842  It rose to a 22 year high in 2008  peaking at 2 031 in the weeks ending Aug 29 and Sep 12 
For the week in discussion  rigs engaged in land operations   which fell by 3 to 482   were the primary reason for the decline in count  This was partly offset by higher offshore activity  where rig count was up by 2 to 20  Meanwhile  inland waters drilling was down by 1 to 4 units 
Oil Rig Count  The oil rig count   that bottomed at 316 in May 2016   improved further  by 2  to 416  In fact  the number of active domestic oil rigs have gone up in eleven of the last 12 weeks  As a result of this sustained gain  the current tally is now the highest in 7 months  Nevertheless  they are well below the previous year s rig count of 644 and only a fourth of the peak of 1 609 in Oct 2014 Oils Energy Sector Price Index

Natural Gas Rig Count  The natural gas rig count   which last month plunged to their lowest level on record   decreased for the first time in 3 weeks to 89  a dip of 3 rigs from the previous week   As per the most recent report  the number of natural gas directed rigs are languishing 95  below the all time high of 1 606 reached in late summer 2008  In the year ago period  there were 198 active natural gas rigs 
Miscellaneous Rig Count  The miscellaneous rig count  primarily drilling for geothermal energy  at 1 was down from the previous week s count of 2 
Rig Count by Type  The number of vertical drilling rigs remained unchanged at 64 while the horizontal directional rig count  encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations  also known as shale formations  was down by 2 to 442  In particular  horizontal rig units fell by 2 from last week s multi month high level to 394 
Gulf of Mexico  GoM   The GoM rig count was up by 2 to 20  The number of oil drilling rigs increased by 2 to 19  while there was a solitary gas rig exploring   same as last week 
Conclusion
Key Barometer of Drilling Activity  The Baker Hughes data  issued since 1944 at the end of every week  acts as an important yardstick for energy service providers in gauging the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry 
This generates considerable excitement among energy investors and has long been deployed to help predict future oil and gas production  When number of rigs decline  fewer wells are drilled  This means less new oil and gas are discovered  and ultimately production slows down

Gulf of Mexico  GoM   The GoM rig count was stood flat at 20 as the number of oil and natural gas drilling rigs stayed put at 19 and 1  respectively

7009,228524,WFTLF,Oil Nears  40  Will US Drillers Halt Production Growth ,opinion,Crude is spiraling down again  this time it is close to  40 per barrel psychological mark  In fact  Paul Ciana   a technical strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch  NYSE BAC    recently said that  Oil is in a downtrend and risks trending into the  30 s  In the wake of such a scenario where markets are expecting oil exploration and production businesses to run into losses  U S  shale players have been flocking to crude resources  Crude has lost over 20  on a year to date basis but that hasn t stopped U S  drillers from pumping out more oil  adding to the woes of an oversupplied market It seems that drillers in the U S  shale plays are cushioned against crude problems and can continue to profit by lowering exploration costs  However  we need to warn investors that the U S  companies are close to the risk zone and might be compelled to halt production growth if oil slides below  40 Oil Enters Bearish TerritoryCrude slipped below the  45 a barrel mark on global oversupply worries  On Jun 20  West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude touched the lowest level since last September  This has questioned the effectiveness of OPEC s compliance with its landmark production cut deal As per the weekly rig count report issued by oilfield services player Baker Hughes Incorporated   NYSE BHI    there has been a  count for 22nd consecutive weeks Higher supply from Libya and Nigeria has also been weighing on crude prices  The countries belong to OPEC but were exempted from the output cut accord  Crude production in Libya surged by 50 000 barrels per day to 885 000 barrels after the dispute between National Oil Corporation  NOC  and Wintershall   energy firm of Germany   was settled  per Reuters  In fact  for the first time since 2014  production level in Libya has crossed 800 000 barrels a day Also  per Reuters  the export of Bonny Light crude of Nigeria is expected to touch 226 000 barrel per day during the month of August  much above last July s mark of 164 000 barrels per day News Spells Doom for Shale DrillersIt has been more than three years since mid 2014 that the market has been witnessing weak crude prices  But  U S  shale companies have never cut down on production to address the supply glut  This has led to the decline in oil Let s analyze the broader factors supporting U S  firms in their continual drilling activities  OPEC and 11 non OPEC players  including Russia  decided in the Vienna meeting on May 25  to  the production cut deal by another nine months  Thus  it is an ideal time for shale players to increase production at the expense of OPEC  especially because oil is trading way above the historical low level reached last February  No wonder  U S  shale producers have been gathering to oil patches as they aim to sell the commodity at higher prices We should consider President Donald Trump s exit from  as a factor encouraging drillers to continue pumping more oil  The question here is how long will the U S  companies be able to maintain their growth in exploration and production activities amid the crude free fall  In other words  how low will oil have to go before the companies halt drilling ramp up Many analysts believe that if oil dropped to  40 a barrel  smaller drillers will be forced to discontinue operations in the comparatively less productive crude resources  Eventually  oilfield service firms like Schlumberger Limited   NYSE SLB    Halliburton Company   NYSE HAL   and Weatherford International plc   NYSE WFT   will have to lower their activities It is to be noted that analysts at UBS Group AG in Zurich predict that most of the shale drillers in the U S  will suffer at  45 per barrel oil  If crude touches  40  there will unlikely be any rise in production for all the exploration and production companies in all the U S  prolific oil plays  Even the Permian Basin  where cost of production is low and infrastructure is readily available  will see a halt in production growth when oil tanks to  40 Overall  the business scenario is not in favor of companies belonging to the  industry  A few such companies are Apache Corporation   NYSE APA    Cabot Oil   Gas Corporation   NYSE COG   and Cimarex Energy Co    NYSE XEC    All these firms carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  Looking for Ideas with Even Greater Upside Today s investment ideas are short term  directly based on our proven 1 to 3 month indicator  In addition  I invite you to consider our long term opportunities  These rare trades look to start fast with strong Zacks Ranks  but carry through with double and triple digit profit potential  Starting now  you can look inside our home run  value  and stocks under  10 portfolios  plus more ,2017-06-21,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/oil-nears-$40:-will-us-drillers-halt-production-growth-200196949,200196949

7012,228527,WFTLF,5 Energy Stocks Near 52 Week Low To Buy Right Away,opinion, It is one of the great paradoxes of the stock market that what seems too high usually goes higher and what seems too low usually goes lower    American entrepreneur and stockbroker William J  O Neil  In the investment world  chasing the fad will only make lose out on opportunities to make profit  The crowd simply follows the market trend with the belief that if a stock moves up  it will continue to trend higher  The same theory is applied on stocks in the bearish territory Meanwhile  a smart investor will opt for value investing which states that the ideal time to buy a stock is when everybody is selling  If an investment instrument is found to have strong fundamentals but the market hasn t got a whiff of it  it would be judicious to buy the stock when most are dumping it  In other words  value investors will buy and wait for the crowd to catch up   The same goes for the energy sector as crude prices have touched rock bottom on oversupply concerns  Investors willing to make money from the sector amid the oil turmoil should identify stocks selling near or at their 52 week low mark Oil Enters Bearish TerritoryCrude is trading below the  45 a barrel mark on global oversupply worries  On Jun 20  West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude touched the lowest level since last September  This has questioned the effectiveness of OPEC s compliance with its landmark production cut deal As per the weekly rig count report issued by oilfield services player Baker Hughes Incorporated  NYSE BHI   there has been  count for 23rd consecutive weeks Higher supply from Libya and Nigeria has also been weighing on crude prices  The countries belong to OPEC but were exempted from the output cut accord  Crude production in Libya surged by 50 000 barrels per day to 885 000 barrels after the dispute between National Oil Corporation  NOC  and Wintershall   energy firm of Germany   was settled  per Reuters  In fact  for the first time since 2014  production level in Libya crossed 800 000 barrels a day  Also  per Reuters  the export of Bonny Light crude of Nigeria is expected to touch 226 000 barrel per day during the month of August  much higher than last July s mark of 164 000 barrels per day Time to Start Building PositionAs the fate of most of the energy companies are positively correlated with oil prices  many oil companies have fell to their 52 week lows following the freefall in crude  But  a correction in the commodity market will drive oil again Many analysts believe that if oil dropped to  40 a barrel  smaller drillers will be forced to discontinue operations in the comparatively less productive crude resources  Eventually  oilfield service firms like Schlumberger Limited   NYSE SLB    Halliburton Company   NYSE HAL   and Weatherford International plc   NYSE WFT   will have to cut down on their activities It is to be noted that analysts at UBS Group AG in Zurich predict that most of the shale drillers in the U S  will suffer at  45 per barrel oil  If crude touches that low  there are slim possibilities of a rise in production for all the exploration and production companies in all the U S  prolific oil plays  Even the Permian Basin  where cost of production is low and infrastructure is readily available  will see a halt in production growth when oil tanks to  40 Hence  if shale drillers stop bumping up production in the U S   crude will start its northward journey  Here  we need to mention that investors buying valuable oil stocks will get rewarded if crude gains strength 5 Stocks to Scoop UpWith the help of our proprietary   we have shortlisted five stocks that are trading near a 52 week low  In particular  we have taken

7022,228537,WFTLF,US Rig Count Up By 17  More Drilling Activity Seen On Land,opinion,"In its weekly release  Houston based oilfield services company Baker Hughes Inc    NYSE BHI   reported a higher U S  rig count  number of rigs searching for oil and gas in the country  than the previous week  The West Texas Intermediate  WTI  oil futures are currently trading at around  44 per barrel 
Analysis of the Weekly Rig Data
Weekly Summary  Rigs engaged in exploration and production in the U S  totaled 481 in the week ended Aug 12  2016  This was up by 17 from the week before Oils Energy Sector Price Index
The current nationwide rig count is just more than half the prior year level of 884  Notably  the count had peaked at 4 530 in 1981  Inversely  an all time low was recorded in March  Since then the rig count has recovered marginally Rigs engaged in land operations were 461 compared with 443 in the previous week  Inland water activity involved three rigs  down by one from the prior week  Offshore drilling was flat at 17 units 
Natural Gas Rig Count  The count rose by two from last week to 83  However  the current natural gas rig count is almost 95  below the high of 1 606 reached in late summer 2008  In the year ago period  there were 211 active natural gas rigs 
Oil Rig Count  The count was up by 15 from the previous week at 396  The number had skyrocketed to 1 609 in Oct 2014   the highest figure to have been reported since Baker Hughes started breaking up oil and natural gas rig counts in 1987  The current tally is well below the previous year s rig count of 672 
Rig Count by Type  The number of vertical drilling rigs rose by four to 62  while the horizontal directional rig count  encompassing new drilling technology that can drill and extract gas from dense rock formations  also known as shale formations  was up by 13 to 419 
Gulf of Mexico  GoM   The GoM rig count was flat at 17 units 
Conclusion
Key Barometer of Drilling Activity  The Baker Hughes data  issued since 1944  acts as an important yardstick for energy service providers in gauging the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry 
An increase or decrease in the Baker Hughes  rotary rig count weighs heavily on demand for energy services like drilling  completion and production provided by companies that include large cap firms such as Halliburton Co    NYSE HAL    Schlumberger Ltd    NYSE SLB   and Weatherford International plc   NYSE WFT   Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research  Today  you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days ",2016-08-15,Zacks Investment Research,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/us-rig-count-up-by-17,-more-drilling-activity-seen-on-land-200148044",200148044
7023,228538,WFTLF,A Rare Fall In U S  Rig Count  Are Shale Drillers Slowing ,opinion,In its closely watched weekly release  Houston based oilfield services company Baker Hughes Inc    NYSE BHI   reported a rare fall in the U S  rig count  number of rigs searching for oil and gas in the country    the first decrease in 24 weeks Analysis of the DataWeekly Summary  Rigs engaged in exploration and production in the U S  totaled 940 for the week ended June 30  2017  This was down by 1 from the previous week s rig count and breaks the impressive trend of recent increases that has only been snapped five times since June 2016 Since plunging to an all time low of 404 in May last year  rig counts have generally been rising over the past 12 months  with the addition of a flood of new units due to the rapid growth in American shale production As a result of the steady climb   punctuated by a few pauses   the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior year level of 431  It rose to a 22 year high in 2008  peaking at 2 031 in the weeks ending Aug 29 and Sep 12 For the week in discussion  the 1 unit fall in rig count could be attributed to lower offshore activity  now at 21 compared to last week s 22   while units engaged in land operations and inland waters stayed flat at 915 and 4  respectively Oil Rig Count  The oil rig count   that last week reached its highest since April 2015   declined by 2 to 756  The current tally  though far off the peak of 1 609 in October 2014  is significantly above the previous year s rig count of 341 following 23 successive increases prior to last week   Natural Gas Rig Count  The natural gas rig count   which plunged to their lowest level on record in August last year   inched up for the eighth time in 11 weeks to 184  a gain of 1 rig from the previous week   Like oil  a string of weekly rig additions has meant that the present count sits comfortably above the year ago tally of 89  Still  as per the most recent report  the number of natural gas directed rigs are languishing 89  below the all time high of 1 606 reached in late summer 2008 Rig Count by Type  The number of vertical drilling rigs remained unchanged at 77  while the horizontal directional rig count  encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations  also known as shale formations  was down by 1 to 863  In particular  horizontal rig units stayed put at 792   the most since April 2015 Gulf of Mexico  GoM   The GoM rig count was flat at 21   18 of those oil directed About the Baker Hughes Weekly Rig Count DataThe Baker Hughes data  issued since 1944 at the end of every week  acts as an important yardstick for energy service providers in gauging the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry An increase or decrease in the Baker Hughes rotary rig count heavily weighs on the demand for energy services   drilling  completion  production  etc    provided by companies like Halliburton Co    NYSE HAL    Schlumberger Ltd    NYSE SLB    Weatherford International plc   NYSE WFT    Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc    NYSE DO    and Transocean Ltd    NYSE RIG   ConclusionSo  what does the first weekly rig count decline in six months indicate  Does it point to decelerating U S  production  or is it just a blip before growth resumes again Lately  there have been some signs of brake in shale oil production  Yes  output is still climbing but growth might have slowed down  According to the U S  Energy Information Administration  EIA   domestic crude volumes have declined thrice in the last 8 weeks  Per the most recent report  U S  output decreased 100 000 barrels per day   the largest fall since July 2016  As a proof  crude inventories have tumbled over 26 million barrels during the past 3 months  And with it  the pace of new rig addition has slowed down as well     However  there s no denying that the U S  still remains awash with excess oil that is derailing bulk of the OPEC led cuts aimed at rebalancing the market  At 509 21 million barrels  current crude supplies are up 2 7  from the year ago period and are in the upper limit of the average range during this time of the year  Worryingly  the major U S  basins like the Permian  Arkoma Woodford and Haynesville shale continue to add rigs   Therefore  it will be prudent to wait and watch whether this week s retreat in rig count could be sustained Till then  in case you are looking for energy names for your portfolio  one could opt for Canadian Natural Resources Ltd

7040,228555,WFTLF,Baker Hughes says in preliminary merger talks with rival Halliburton,news,"By Terry Wade and Nadia Damouni HOUSTON NEW YORK  Reuters    Oilfield services provider Baker Hughes Inc said on Thursday it is in preliminary merger talks with its larger rival Halliburton Co  though any potential deal would likely face antitrust concerns 
Two people familiar with the matter  who spoke on condition of anonymity  said Halliburton was looking to buy Baker Hughes  in what would be the second largest energy deal of this year 
Oil prices have slid by a third since June  eroding demand for drilling services and pummeling stock prices across the energy sector  That has prompted a flurry of chatter among executives and bankers about acquisition opportunities 
A tie up between the No  2 and No  3 players in the services industry might allow them to better weather the downturn and resist pressure from oil producers to slash prices 
Baker Hughes said in a statement it has  engaged in preliminary discussions with Halliburton Company regarding a potential business combination transaction  
Halliburton declined to comment on the talks  which were first reported by Dow Jones and in The Wall Street Journal 
A potential merger would create a drilling  logistics and well services giant worth  67 billion  initially with 140 000 employees 
But the merged entity would be only half the size of industry leader Schlumberger  which has a market capitalization of  125 billion 
If a deal were struck  the companies could well have to sell assets to convince regulators they would not hurt competition  said Seth Bloom  a veteran of the U S  Department of Justice s antitrust division now in private practice 
 The question with mergers like this is are there divestitures of submarkets that can solve the problem   Bloom said   It s clearly not a slam dunk to approval but it s not automatic that you can t get it through  You have to drill down to see what the markets are like  
The deal is also likely to draw the scrutiny of regulators in Europe  China  Brazil and Mexico  others experts said  Arguably  the antitrust concerns would be greatest outside the United States  where there are relatively few services companies 
There are at least seven major product lines where there is overlap between the two companies  The companies offer scores of services and technology  from drill bits  to cementing and casing work  to artificial lift systems that improve output from wells 
An analyst who follows the company and did not want to be quoted said Halliburton could get the deal down with a mix of debt and equity and still maintain its investment rating 
News of the talks sent shares of another services company  Weatherford International Plc  which has long been seen as vulnerable  up nearly 6 percent 
Baker Hughes shares were halted in New York Stock Exchange trading due to volatility  They later reopened and shot up 18 percent  Halliburton shares rose as much as 3 5 percent before trimming gains at the close

7042,228557,WFTLF,Exclusive  Radioactive material stolen in Iraq raises security concerns,news,"By Ahmed Rasheed  Aref Mohammed and Stephen Kalin BAGHDAD  Reuters    Iraq is searching for  highly dangerous  radioactive material whose theft last year has raised fears among Iraqi officials that it could be used as a weapon if acquired by Islamic State  Baghdad reported the stolen material to the International Atomic Energy Agency  IAEA  in November but has not requested assistance to recover it  the U N  nuclear watchdog said on Wednesday  The material  stored in a protective case the size of a laptop computer  went missing from a storage facility near the southern city of Basra belonging to U S  oilfield services company Weatherford  N WFT   an environment ministry document seen by Reuters showed and security  environmental and provincial officials confirmed  A spokesman for Iraq s environment ministry said he could not discuss the issue  citing national security concerns  Weatherford said in a statement that it was not responsible or liable for the theft   We do not own  operate or control sources or the bunker where the sources are stored   it said  The material  which uses gamma rays to test flaws in materials used for oil and gas pipelines in a process called industrial gamma radiography  is owned by Istanbul based SGS Turkey  according to the document and officials   An SGS official in Iraq declined to comment and referred Reuters to its Turkish headquarters  which did not respond to phone calls and emails  The U S  State Department said it was aware of the reports but has seen no sign that Islamic State or other militant groups have acquired it  The environment ministry document  dated Nov  30 and addressed to the ministry s Centre for Prevention of Radiation  describes  the theft of a highly dangerous radioactive source of Ir 192 with highly radioactive activity belonging to SGS from a depot belonging to Weatherford in the Rafidhia area of Basra province    A senior environment ministry official based in Basra  who declined to be named as he is not authorized to speak publicly  told Reuters the device contained up to 10 grams  0 35 ounces  of Ir 192  capsules   a radioactive isotope of iridium also used to treat cancer      The IAEA said the material is classed as a Category 2 radioactive source  meaning that if not managed properly it could cause permanent injury to a person in close proximity to it for minutes or hours  and could be fatal to someone exposed for a period of hours to days  How harmful exposure can be is determined by a number of factors such as the material s strength and age  which Reuters could not immediately determine  The ministry document said the material posed a risk of bodily and environmental harm as well as a national security threat  DIRTY BOMB FEAR Large quantities of Ir 192 have gone missing before in the United States  Britain and other countries  stoking fears among security officials that it could be used to make a dirty bomb  A dirty bomb combines nuclear material with conventional explosives to contaminate an area with radiation  in contrast to a nuclear weapon  which uses nuclear fission to trigger a vastly more powerful blast   We are afraid the radioactive element will fall into the hands of Daesh   said a senior security official with knowledge of the theft  using an Arabic acronym for Islamic State   They could simply attach it to explosives to make a dirty bomb   said the official  who works at the interior ministry and spoke on condition of anonymity as he is also not authorized to speak publicly  There was no indication the material had come into the possession of Islamic State  which seized territory in Iraq and Syria in 2014 but does not control areas near Basra  A State Department spokesman declined to comment on whether the missing material might be suitable for use in a dirty bomb  The security official  based in Baghdad  told Reuters there were no immediate suspects for the theft  But the official said the initial inquiry suggested the perpetrators had specific knowledge of the material and the facility   No broken locks  no smashed doors and no evidence of forced entry   he said  An operations manager for Iraqi security firm Taiz  which was contracted to protect the facility  declined to comment  citing instructions from Iraqi security authorities  A spokesman for Basra operations command  responsible for security in Basra province  said army  police and intelligence forces were working  day and night  to locate the material   The army and police have responsibility for security in the country s south  where Iranian backed Shi ite Muslim militias and criminal gangs also operate  POLLUTION RISK Iraqi forces are battling Islamic State in the country s north and west  backed by a U S  led coalition  The Sunni Muslim militant group has been accused of using chemical weapons on more than one occasion over the past few years  The closest area fully controlled by Islamic State is more than 500 km  300 miles  north of Basra in the western province of Anbar  Islamic State controls no territory in the predominantly Shi ite southern provinces but has claimed bomb attacks there  including one that killed 10 people in October in the district where the Weatherford facility is located  Besides the risk of a dirty bomb  the radioactive material could cause harm simply by being left exposed in a public place for several days  said David Albright  a physicist and president of the Washington based Institute for Science and International Security   If they left it in some crowded place  that would be more of the risk  if they kept it together but without shielding   he said   Certainly it s not insignificant  You could cause some panic with this  They would want to get this back    The senior environmental official said authorities were worried that whoever stole the material would mishandle it  leading to radioactive pollution of  catastrophic proportions   A second senior environment ministry official  also based in Basra  said counter radiation teams had begun inspecting oil sites  scrapyards and border crossings to locate the device after an emergency task force raised the alarm on Nov  13  
Two Basra provincial government officials said they were directed on Nov  25 to coordinate with local hospitals   We instructed hospitals in Basra to be alert to any burn cases caused by radioactivity and inform security forces immediately   said one ",2016-02-17,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/exclusive:-radioactive-material-stolen-in-iraq-raises-security-fears-385163,385163

settled debts with at least three global drug companies by giving them bonds that trade at a heavy discount  a further sign of the OPEC nation s worsening financial crisis   Novartis  AG  VX NOVN    Bayer AG   DE BAYGn  and Sanofi SA  PA SASY  acquired dollar denominated bonds from state owned oil company PDVSA that they resold for as little as a third of their face value  according to a Reuters analysis of regulatory filings and sources with knowledge of the situation  This contributed to some  500 million in foreign exchange losses that the three companies suffered in Venezuela in 2015  The extent of the bond transactions has not been previously reported  For a graphic showing how the bond deals can be a bitter pill for drugs companies  see  The payment method provided a shortcut around the country s troubled 13 year old currency control mechanism  The system is widely regarded as a primary cause of runaway inflation  a deep recession and chronic product shortages that have afflicted Venezuela s economy under socialist President Nicolas Maduro  Companies are required to sell products in bolivars but then struggle to convert them into hard currency through the government s currency board   Venezuela tries to use an official exchange rate of 10 bolivars to the dollar for priority goods such as food and medicine  The rate is the result of a devaluation last month from the previous rate of 6 3 bolivars  However  Venezuela  which gets nearly all of its foreign exchange from oil exports  has had fewer dollars to disburse as a result of the crash in oil prices in the past two years  That has left it without enough dollars to pay down debts to pharmaceuticals companies at the preferential exchange rate  Few of the alternatives are palatable  They include holding a rapidly deteriorating currency or using a much weaker official exchange rate of 206 bolivars to the dollar  The black market rate is close to an extraordinary 1 100 bolivars to the U S  dollar  valuing the Venezuelan currency at less than 1 percent of the official rate   Novartis said it agreed to acquire PDVSA bonds with a face value equivalent to the amount it was owed  and later sold them at a roughly two thirds discount  Novartis reported a loss of  127 million on its sale of PDVSA 2024 bonds   leaving it with proceeds of just  73 million from the operation  The bonds currently trade at about 31 cents on the dollar  with a yield of 27 percent  Neither Bayer nor Sanofi provided details on their bond transactions  but sources familiar with the situation said they accepted similar steep discounts  They declined to comment on whether they had any other option for repatriating their funds  A fixed income trader who follows the Venezuelan market said he noticed heavy selling of the PDVSA 2024 bonds starting in January  and estimated that more than  500 million of the bonds flooded the market  This coincided with a sharp drop in the price of the bond  which fell to 25 cents in the dollar from 37 cents  The trader added he did not think financial institutions would have sold the bonds at such low prices  It is unclear whether this was directly related to selling by the drug companies  Venezuela s Information Ministry  which handles media requests on behalf of the Finance Ministry  did not respond to a request for comment  The Central Bank did not respond to an email seeking comment  Investors who track Venezuela say the deals makes sense for the companies despite the losses  The bond purchases represented a chance to get dollar denominated assets  even ones that had to be sold at a heavily discounted price  At the black market rate  Novartis would have been left with only a tiny sliver of what it was owed   FOOD AND OIL Sanofi in 2015 recorded a currency loss of 240 million euros   264 million  associated with its Venezuela operations  A spokesman said this was the result of  a variety of payment means including dollar denominated bonds   In early 2015  several big drug companies were still holding out to convert their bolivars into dollars at the most favorable exchange rate permitted by law  U S  regulatory filings show  In a typical disclosure   Pfizer  Inc  N PFE   for example  said last May that it continued to believe that the nature of its business  shipping medicine to Venezuela  would qualify for the most preferential rates  Last month  Pfizer said it expects an  800 million  negative impact  related to Venezuela in 2016  but did not immediately respond to questions about whether it was involved in any Venezuela bond transactions  Buying bonds to obtain hard currency assets has so far mostly been a path used by foreign multinationals  A proposal by Venezuela s principal industry association for a similar mechanism for local companies to settle debts with foreign providers has so far gained no traction   Two sources in the Venezuelan food industry  which has struggled to maintain operations due to a lack of imported raw materials  told Reuters that they would not accept an arrangement in which their providers were required to assume such heavy discounts  They insisted that the government should fully pay off those debts  Venezuela in March 2013 used a similar scheme to settle debts with oil services companies  including Weatherford International Ltd   N WFT   which said it received bonds from PDVSA that year in exchange for unpaid bills  It said it sold them for around half their face value  Maduro has vowed to maintain social programs created by his mentor and predecessor  late socialist leader Hugo Chavez  including expanded access to low cost medicine   But with fewer dollars available for health sector imports  Venezuelans struggle to obtain products ranging from simple ointments to life saving cancer drugs  Long pharmacy lines and social media pleas for help obtaining pharmaceuticals are routine  Venezuela s bond payment offers mirror a similar scheme in 2010 by Greece in which Athens settled billions of dollars in debts to pharmaceuticals companies with zero coupon bonds issued specifically for that purpose  With Greece at the height of its debt crisis  the bonds quickly fell to around half of their face value and the drugmakers sold them at a substantial discount  Greece s situation was simpler  however  given that it did not have exchange controls and the debts were denominated in the widely used euro currency  BETTER THAN NOTHING At a least a dozen major U S  companies  including Procter   Gamble Co  N PG   Pepsico Inc  N PEP   Colgate Palmolive Co  N CL   Kimberly Clark Corp  N KMB  and  Mondelez International Inc   O MDLZ   have deconsolidated their operations in Venezuela  resulting in several billion dollars in write downs over the past year  The accounting maneuver largely insulates their consolidated financial results from Venezuela s economic turmoil   Drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline plc  L GSK  in 2015 reported a  130 million Venezuela foreign exchange loss after switching to a 200 bolivar per dollar exchange rate  97 percent weaker than the official rate it had previously used  Merck   Co  N MRK  in 2015 reported an  876 million foreign exchange loss related to Venezuela  The firm declined to comment when asked if this was related to bond operations  Venezuelan bonds are the riskiest of any issued by an emerging market nation  according to the JPMorgan  NYSE JPM  Global Diversified Emerging Markets Bond Index   They pay on average some 31 percentage points more than similar U S  Treasury bills  nearly triple that of war torn Iraq   Investors worry PDVSA will be unable to meet heavy debt service of around  7 5 billion between March and December unless there is a major rebound in crude oil prices

7053,228568,WFTLF,Forget fracking  Choking and lifting are latest efforts to stem U S  shale bust,news,"By Swetha Gopinath and Amrutha Gayathri  Reuters    Something is awry in the beleaguered U S  shale patch  older wells  which normally gush oil or natural gas in their first few months before rapidly depleting  are not petering out as quickly as they should  When oil prices began falling a year and a half ago in the deepest rout in a generation  many analysts expected U S  crude production  especially from fracking in the new shale plays that contributed to a global supply glut  to follow quickly   Producers  such as  Continental Resources Inc   N CLR  and  Whiting Petroleum Corp   N WLL   have slashed spending on almost everything  in some cases even leaving drilled wells unfinished to conserve cash and wait for a sustained turnaround in prices  With oilfield activity suddenly contracting  production from a dwindling number of freshly fracked wells would be unable to compensate for the rapid depletion of older wells  Yet that long anticipated turning point has only just begun to emerge   partly because producers had a couple more tricks in store  Some drillers are spending a little bit more on measures that are subtly flattening the so called  production curve  of shale wells  either by limiting the initial surge in output or by squeezing a few additional barrels out of older wells  according to industry executives and analysts  The measures offer differing benefits  Choking output at newly fracked wells curtails immediate supply and revenue in hopes that prices will be stronger later  whereas maximizing output at old wells with things like  artificial lift  is a relatively cheap way to increase volume and immediate revenues   Baker Hughes  Inc  N BHI   the third largest services company in the U S  shale patch  cited its artificial lift business as the  one notable exception  to a sector wide slump in its latest quarter  growing by 4 percent even as other shale related revenues fell 10 percent   Companies still want to grow production  they want to generate cash   said Wade Welborn  vice president of artificial lift at Baker Hughes  His business offers  a means to increase that cash flow   For oil markets  they amount to the same thing  the long anticipated fall off in U S  shale oil output is still proving slower and more tempered than anticipated  impeding the process of correcting the global glut that has walloped prices   Production optimization is going to be the next phase of the shale revolution   said Andrew Slaughter  director for the Deloitte Center for Energy Solutions   The low price environment will give companies and operators a chance to take stock of the techniques that work   LATE PHASE LIFT The volume of daily production from a new shale well typically declines by 70 percent in the first nine months  according to estimates provided by SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst Neal Dingmann  Yet  that sharp decline rate has been shockingly slow to translate into lower production across the United States  While the number of oil rigs collapsed by some 75 percent since the end of 2014  U S  production has only barely begun to ebb  a disconnect generally attributed to the increasing productivity of the hydraulic fracturing process  with each new well yielding more barrels than the one before  But other measures are also in play by companies keen to maximize immediate revenues to cover interest and other payments  and avoid the cost and hassle of shutting in wells  For instance  rather than forking out  3 million to  6 million to drill and frack a new well  a producer can spend just  250 000  500 000 to reinvigorate an older well with artificial lift   which may involve injecting chemicals or gas into perforations  or using an electrically driven pumping system  With lift  a well can begin to flow again at 50 75 percent of its initial production rate in most instances  said Evercore ISI analyst James West  That may help extend the life of a well that would otherwise be slated for abandonment    Demand is strong because it is not directly correlated to new wells and drilling   said Kyle Chapman  president of Weatherford International Plc  N WFT  production and completion line    Devon Energy  Corp  N DVN  says it is using workovers  refracking  artificial lift and other techniques to make its wells more productive  even as it cuts spending for the year by 75 percent  It expects 2016 output to fall about 10 percent  Older wells  in production  help companies cover costs and it would cost more to shut them down  said Julius Walker  a senior consultant at JBC Energy in Vienna  noting this was contributing to  production resilience  and causing output to outperform the firm s forecasts based on historical models  For example  in the Bakken   heart of the shale revolution   official data showed production in the fourth quarter was 60 000 bpd   or about 5 percent   higher than what JBC had estimated based on well data and historical decline rates   CHOKING ON OIL Other producers are taking a different  and cheaper  approach  by throttling back the initial production  IP  from newly fracked wells  pumping less now but more later and preserving pressure within the underground reservoir  Most  if not all  recently drilled wells include a choke  a piece of steel placed in the flow path of oil coming out of a producing well  and more companies are now using them to curb early production in ways that can boost overall output from a well by as much as 10 percent  experts say   It s like if you take a coke bottle and shake it up and all the drink fizzles up  But if you don t shake it up  you end up getting more to drink   choking has the same effect   said Mike Breard  an analyst at Hodges Capital Management in Dallas  Continental Resources   an industry pioneer that essentially stopped finishing new wells in North Dakota s Bakken shale field   is also applying chokes to manage production from three news wells in Oklahoma s STACK play  For example  its Compton oil well  which has been producing for 51 days  pumped 80 000 barrels of oil equivalent in its first 41 days online  but has since been restricted to flow at 1 670 barrels of oil equivalent per day

7062,228577,WFTLF,The One Sector You Must Own Now  It s Cheap  But Not For Long ,opinion,"Summary
 The market  has done well this year  The S P 500  the best of the bunch  is up over 10  
How about you  If you haven t kept pace  here s a rock solid sector that has hit a temporary speed bump 
If history is any guide   and it is   these great companies won t stay cheap for long 
The time to do your due diligence is today   and if you agree  the time to buy is now 
As recently as 24 hours ago  I would have included Baker Hughes  NYSE BHI  in my discussion below  But near the close on Thursday  Halliburton  NYSE HAL  divulged that it would like to acquire its very large rival Baker Hughes  BHI jumped 15  in 25 minutes   Not that anyone would invest in just one company  of course  but that s 50  better than the S P has done all year long  
That s what happens when oil and gas stocks become temporarily cheap  As I wrote to the  too few  in retrospect  clients of ours that owned BHI 

 I did not have inside information prior to BHI s 15  jump just prior to the close today  But I know the energy industry and know that  when quality companies get this cheap   1  competitors will buy them out rather than build new business from scratch  and  2  these companies will inevitably rebound  This one just started to rebound faster in light of Halliburton s possible buyout  


All oil and gas explorers  producers  servicers  drillers  machinery providers  and transport and storage firms are considerably cheaper today than they were just 6 weeks ago   so cheap  in fact  that one might make enough by buying them to do every bit as well as the market this year   even starting this late 
It couldn t come at a better time  in my opinion  I was cautious on the market by the end of summer  expecting an October time frame pullback  Our clients were mostly in preferred stocks and bond funds  with a healthy dollop of long short mutual funds and even a few put options  Ouch  It certainly felt like the right thing to do all the way through mid October as the market was falling and we were making money 
But then the market rebounded in a V shaped recovery that  in 12 days  undid the entire 10  decline  We didn t immediately go long because every bear correction  well  every other bear correction   is punctuated by a series of head fake rallies  but then resumes its decline  After 5 years straight up  those two weeks were our entire correction   Couldn t be  But it was  So now we are starting from the uncomfortable position of making less than the market this year  and that will not stand  We have sold all those bonds  bond funds  preferreds  preferred ETFs and other income only investments 
Fortunately  the sector I have known the best for the past 40 years in this business is oil and gas   fortunate because that is where the bargains are today  if only we have the fortitude to buy them  Oil and gas always suffer a so called glut after the summer vacation driving season ends and people no longer need their air conditioner when it stays light until 9 p m  or so  And that glut  during which time we can normally pick up some fine bargains as people tear their hair out over the demise of oil and gas  is ended when the days get shorter  the lights go on earlier  and we need heat here in the Northern Hemisphere  The glut goes away  and we who have bought oil and gas in the  glut  pocket our profits 
This year the problem has been exacerbated  however  by a serious slowing of manufacturing and production in Europe and Asia and by the marvelous enhanced oil   gas production we are enjoying in North America  not just US shale production  but Canadian and soon to be Mexican successes as well 
Goldman Sachs recently wrote that worldwide demand is likely to stay flat for some time because China and the developing nations will consume less  I don t think they will  People with a bicycle want a motorbike  those with a motorbike want a car  This trend is unstoppable  as is the need to mine resources or manufacture  things  for export 
Goldman further sees U S  shale as a target for the Saudis and their OPEC brethren to break by producing all out  While it is true that the Saudis can be profitable at a lower price point  I don t think US shale producers are their target  I think it is their fellow OPEC partners and other competitors  It wouldn t hurt the Saudis  feelings if arch enemy Iran were squeezed and brought to the bargaining table  And it wouldn t hurt US diplomacy  either  if Russia  Iran and Venezuela were eating crow instead of selling oil   gas at a profit 
Indeed  unlike Goldman  I see US shale production as a way to defeat any attempt to put the US over a barrel  so to speak   According to the International Energy Agency  IEA   producers in the Marcellus Shale can make a 20  pre tax return on investment in the Marcellus even if oil goes below  40 a barrel  The Eagle Ford  Utica and Bakken are still that profitable at less than  60 a barrel  In fact  according to the IEA  only 4  of shale production needs  80 oil to return that 20  pre tax profit 
I further break down the oil and gas industry in the energy sector into four rough sub sectors  machinery and equipment  transport and storage  field services  to include offshore   and the drillers  both land based and offshore  It would be pretty cumbersome to put all these in a single article  so I will cover the first two sub sectors here and will include the other two big sectors  plus  bonus round   two more speculative special situations I think have superb potential in my second post  here  Let s start with 
Machinery   Equipment
National Oilwell Varco s stock symbol is NOV  which customers and nervous competitors sometimes say stands for  No Other Vendor   With good reason  NOV controls about 50  of the deepwater equipment market  while competing against the likes of Halliburton  Baker Hughes  FMC Technologies  NYSE FTI   Weatherford International  NYSE WFT   and Cameron International  NYSE CAM   all fine companies in their own right   I have not included Dresser Rand Group Inc  NYSE DRC  because its merger with giant conglomerate Siemens  OTC SIEGY  looks like a done deal  or Bolt Technology Corporation  NASDAQ BOLT   because it is a smaller player  albeit with great strength in the niche market of subsea vehicles and equipment  
These firms  and scores of others  build  sell and service entire rig systems  both offshore and land based  as well as any of the hundreds of individual pipes  pumps  control systems  fluid handling and power systems  and all the rest that goes into the rigs  They also provide wellbore support with everything from drill bits and drilling fluid to coring services and waste management  For an in depth overview  I suggest you go to  and click on  Products   Every single item on that page has its own link for further info 
The bottom line is without these companies making finely honed  sturdy  and reliable equipment  there would be no exploration or production of oil and gas  As investors  we don t need in depth knowledge of all the components that make this all come together  we need to know  1  that this is an essential industry that offers above average growth  and  2  which companies are the most attractive to buy right now  While many other industries have run to new highs and are now on every momentum investor s buy list  none of these firms have set the world on fire  NOV is selling for 5  less than it did 12 months ago  BHI  well  until about 3 35 Thursday afternoon  anyway  was down 14   HAL is down 4   and WFT is down 4   CAM is up 5   while FTI is up 9   the only one that has even come close to keeping pace with the market 
I don t think you could go wrong buying any of these  But of the 5  leaving BHI out for now  HAL has the biggest enterprise value  NOV the lowest P E  HAL and FMC the best ROA and ROE  NOV the best operating and net margins and the lowest debt equity ratio  and HAL and NOV the best 5 year revenue and earnings growth  Of the two that seem to float to the top here  NOV beats HAL on valuation criteria like Price Book  Price Sales and the PEG Ratio  Price Earnings Growth   Of the bigs  NOV is still our favorite  And when the biggest  most competitive and most highly regarded firms in the industry have sold off every bit as much as the less well managed or less well capitalized firms  why not buy the best  We are buyers first of NOV  then of HAL 
Transport and Storage
The benefit of owning pipeline and storage companies is that they get paid on through put  not on the price of the commodity  Also  these are by and large domestic  or at least North American  firms  so their earnings are less dependent upon the currently weaker economies of Europe  Asia and the emerging markets  If Americans consume more oil and gas this winter  the transport and storage outfits make money  It doesn t much matter if that oil equivalent barrel is priced at  70 a barrel or  100 a barrel  they get paid to transport something regardless of its value  Think of these companies as a or FedEx  NYSE FDX    whether the contents of the package UPS delivers is worth  10 or  100  UPS charges by weight and distance  not by the value of the contents  That s what pipeline companies do  The storage end of the equation is slightly different  the prices received for storage are less subject to federal regulation and are therefore more subject to the laws of supply and demand 
So what are the best pipeline companies to own  That depends upon your end goal  If you re looking solely for current income you might buy Niska Gas Storage  NYSE Niska Gas Storage Partners LLC  NYSE NKA  which pays at a 30  yield   but has lost 69  of its value over the last 12 months  I can name another dozen that pay double digit yields  though I personally wouldn t buy a one of them for myself or our clients  I d rather have steady  conservative growth with a well managed company that increases its DCF  distributable cash flow  every year and its distributions as often 
Pipeline firms don t really  compete  with each other  FERC  the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission  regulates most aspects of interstate pipelines  and gives an effective monopoly to the pipeline from point A to point B and sets rates for flow that are  just and reasonable   So when reviewing competitive position in this sub sector  we want to select those companies with management that is most astute and a network of pipelines that are in basins with lots of proven reserve life left in them instead of old fields only pumping with tertiary recovery methodologies 
A few names percolate to the top as pipeline builders in the newest and most prolific areas  Among these are TransCanada  NYSE TRP   Enbridge  NYSE ENB   Oneok  NYSE OKE  and Statoil  NYSE STO  
Statoil  Statoil  What am I smoking  you ask  For those who only know STO as the Norwegian state oil company  a powerhouse in Europe and the supplier of the world s newest LNG terminal  the Klaipeda terminal in Lithuania  which completely eradicates the Russian stranglehold on Lithuania   you may wonder at its inclusion here  But STO also spent  4 billion to buy the US company Brigham Exploration  a major Bakken player  and is hard at work building storage facilities here in the U S  STO is now a serious producer in the Marcellus and the Eagle Ford  And in addition to its 5 000 miles of pipelines in Europe  it now owns pipelines from the Marcellus shale direct to New York City and Toronto  This is yet another concrete example that there is tremendous overlap in each of these sub sectors   here s a major integrated oil company that is now expanding its pipelines and storage divisions 

You ll notice there is something missing from my analysis of the transporters  We made superb money and attracted lots of followers in previous years talking about the steady Eddie income  growth and tax benefits of MLPs  Where are the MLPs  Master Limited Partnerships  that have done so well for us in the past  Well  old favorites Kinder Morgan Energy Partners LP  NYSE KMP  and El Paso Pipeline Partners LP  NYSE EPB  are being absorbed by our also favored parent company Kinder Morgan Inc  NYSE KMI   That leaves Plains All American  NYSE PAA  and  for both growth and yield  QR Energy  NYSE QRE   Linn Energy  NASDAQ LINE   and EV Energy  NASDAQ EVEP  atop our few remaining MLPs we might still consider buying  except   
   I am more and more interested in acquiring the parent companies that pay ordinary dividends rather than the MLPs that pay tax advantaged distributions via K 1s these days  My reason has nothing to do with K 1s  however  It has to do with the growing sentiment in Congress to do in the U S  what the Canadians did in 2011 and remove the tax advantaged status of LPs  It makes me uneasy at best  It doesn t have to even happen to cause a big downdraft in MLPs  just being floated as an idea by some Congressman will be enough to send them down 10  in a day  We ve seen enough of that kind of volatility  thank you  If I have to pick only one  it would be KMI 
Bottom line   we are buyers of NOV  HAL  STO and KMI  with a dozen more to come next  In Part II  I ll cover the dirt cheap drillers  where we are placing most of our funds right now  and the biggest and best servicing outfits  as well as our favorite big integrated oil and gas companies  Oh  and those special situations for the more risk tolerant  as well

7065,228580,WFTLF,4 Stocks To Watch This Week  BAS  EPAM  QURE  RNDY ,opinion,"The stock market had a strange session on Monday  gapping down  running up  and then rolling over at the end of the day  and closing as a good day  It could have been a lot better  and also it could have been a lot worse  Let s take a look at some of the stocks that acted well today 
Basic Energy Services Inc  NYSE BAS   one of the junior oil stocks that is acting great  was up 46 cents to 8 31  or 5 86   on 4 5 million shares  It has dropped from 30  all the way down to 5  based out for several months  formed a beautiful base  and on Monday  it pushed up and through the resistance line  and may very well test the gap around the 10 dollar level  Beyond that the targets are 11  and then 12 
EPAM Systems Inc  NYSE EPAM  has been beautiful all year  The trend goes from 14  all the way up to Monday s high at 67  This stock spiked and broke out after running up in Feb  consolidated for 4 5 weeks  and on Monday  popped 4 35 to 66 07  or 7   on 20 million shares  That s a breakout in new  all time high territory  It looks like it may reach the top of the channel at 70 short term

7066,228581,WFTLF,Does Rig Count Matter Anymore ,opinion,"The figure used to generate considerable excitement among energy investors and has long been deployed to help predict future oil and gas production  However  the correlation seems to come under the spotlight recently 
As per conventional thinking  when number of rigs decline  fewer wells are drilled  This means less new oil and gas sources are discovered  and ultimately production slows down 
But recent data suggest otherwise 
Rig Count Slump Continues
In its latest report  oil services player Baker Hughes Inc   NYSE BHI  said that rigs engaged in exploration and production in the U S  totaled 859 for the week ended Jun 12  2015  the lowest level in almost 6 years  What s more  following the latest decline  the current nationwide rig count is now less than half of the prior year level of 1 854 
In particular  the number of natural gas directed rigs  at 221  is down almost three fourths from its recent peak of 811 reached in 2012  In fact  the current natural gas rig count remains 86  below its all time high of 1 606 reached in late summer 2008  In the year ago period  there were 310 active natural gas rigs  Similarly  the current oil rig tally of 635 is now the lowest in more than four and a half years  and well below the previous year s rig count of 1 542 
Moreover  the horizontal directional rig count  encompassing new technology to drill and extract crude from onshore shale formations    at 758   is well below the previous count of 1 466 
Yet Production Hits Record
As per the U S  Energy Department s latest inventory release  at 470 60 million barrels  current crude supplies are up 21 6  from the year ago period and are near the highest level during this time of the year in 80 years at least 
On the natural gas front  as per the latest report from Bentek Energy   the forecasting unit of Platts   May production edged down less than 1  from the record highs of April to 72 6 billion cubic feet per day  Bcf d   In fact  the May output was 7 2  higher year over year  Thanks to the emergence of major shale plays yielding impressive results  Bentek analysis further suggests that average domestic natural gas supply will climb to 73 Bcf d in 2015  To put things in perspective  U S  production was averaging just 55 1 Bcf d in 2009  only six years back 
Reasons for the Mismatch
First  producers have become immensely better at churning out oil and gas from deep underground layers of rock with the help of sophisticated technology 
Second  a major portion of the rigs that have been taken out of work were employed in secondary regions where the probability to find oil gas was low anyway  Therefore  their exclusion did not materially affect overall volumes 
Last  2014 s crude price spike   which saw the commodity breach the  100 a barrel level   led to massive expansion in domestic drilling  which is still adding incremental oil to inventories 
So  Are Rig Counts Relevant at All 
It s quite clear that the number of rigs is no longer the sole criteria in determining production movement  as it doesn t give the whole picture  Consequently  the decline in the number of U S  drilling rigs has not translated into slowing shale production yet 
For the real picture  one should also take into account existing and impending cuts in fracking  or shale drilling  operations from the likes of oilfield services giants Halliburton Co   NYSE HAL  and Weatherford International plc  NYSE WFT   and spending cuts by top energy companies including Apache Corp   NYSE APA   Pioneer Natural Resources Co   NYSE PXD  and WPX Energy Inc   NYSE WPX  ",2015-06-18,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/rig-count-vs.-production:-has-the-correlation-ended-255424,255424

The stock market posted its first 4 day winning streak since January  The S P 500 last week fell as much as 4 percent from its all time high  and has since recovered to trade within 1 percent of its record set in May  The S P 500 and the Dow are up 3 percent over four sessions  while the Nasdaq Composite has added 4 percent 
The United States and other world powers reached an agreement with Iran that calls for limits on Tehran s nuclear program in return for lifting economic sanctions that have crippled Iran s economy  enabling the oil rich nation to ramp up its energy exports  access international finance and open the doors to global investors  Full implementation of the agreement will likely take months and is contingent on the pace at which Iran meets its obligations  The deal will keep Iran from producing enough material for an atomic weapon for at least 10 years and impose provisions for inspections of Iranian facilities  including military sites 
Oil prices initially dropped when the Iran deal was announced  but then prices climbed higher  The oil markets were not surprised by the news announcement  and a deal was clearly already priced in  and it will take some time before Iran has a big impact on supplies  Iran doesn t have great reserves of crude oil supplies to throw on the market  Tehran has stored around 25 million barrels of oil mainly consisting of condensate  Iran will have to invest heavily in infrastructure  they will need to attract investment  sign commercial contracts and figure out the other logistics needed with producing and exporting oil  If the deal holds  look for Iran to deliver more supplies by 2016  possibly pushing prices lower  Even so  this represents opportunities for the Big Oil firms like Exxon Mobil Corporation  NYSE XOM   Total  Royal Dutch Shell  LONDON RDSa   also  oil field service companies like Schlumberger NV  NYSE SLB   Halliburton  NYSE HAL  and Weatherford International Ltd  NYSE WFT   also tanker companies  also big banks should do well with financing deals  but only the biggest banks such as JPMorgan Chase   Co  XETRA JPM   Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  and Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS  
The director of international affairs at National Iranian Oil Company  said   We will try to maximize our crude export capacity to Europe and restore 42 to 43 percent share in the European market before the sanctions were imposed   This is an interesting sidebar  Since the Russian invasion into eastern Ukraine  Europe has been dealing with the threat of Russia cutting oil and nat gas  Iran now steps up as an alternate energy source  Iran holds the world s fourth largest proved crude reserves and the second largest natural gas reserves  So  Europe might be a winner in today s announcement  The bottom line is that today s announcement means the oil market will be over supplied for a long time 
Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras appears to be facing open rebellion in his coalition as he attempts to push creditor reforms through Greece s parliament ahead of Wednesday s deadline  With dozens of MPs in Syriza threatening to defect  Tsipras will need the support of the opposition to pass the  86 billion euro package  putting the future of his government in doubt  Meanwhile  Athens missed another payment due to the IMF late Monday  The Greek deal does not include debt relief  and this might be its fatal flaw  The other flaw is continued insistence on austerity  which has not worked  Austerity measures are primarily aimed at shrinking debt as a proportion of a country s economic output  a measure known as the debt to GDP ratio  Even if total debt is reduced  the debt to GDP ratio can rise because gross domestic product shrinks in tandem  So  Greece still faces the same problems they faced a month ago   their debt burden is unsustainable 
In the first meeting with investors since calling its  72 billion debt pile  not payable   Puerto Rico said it was still premature to discuss how creditors would be affected  but made the case for a restructuring  Puerto Rico bonds are held by many U S  investors  who bought the securities because they re tax exempt nationwide and offered higher yields than comparable debt 
After a month long rollercoaster ride  China s stock market is showing some signs of stabilizing  suggesting Beijing s bundle of support efforts are having the intended impact  Last week  Chinese officials allowed more than half of all listed companies to suspend their shares from trading and prohibited major stakeholders from selling at all  pushing the Shanghai Composite up 13  Thursday and Monday  Chinese stocks are down 24  from their mid June peak 
China accounted for 38 percent of the global growth last year  up from 23 percent in 2010  It s the world s largest importer of copper  aluminum and cotton  2 and the biggest trading partner for countries from Brazil to South Africa  If China slows down  the demand for industrial commodities goes down  That can have a huge impact on the global economy

Households cut spending on a variety of goods and services  including cars  clothes  home furnishings  and dining out  Americans also spent less online and shelled out less cash at do it yourself and building materials suppliers  The decline in auto sales was expected because dealers had already posted lower sales after a huge month in May  but the rest of the report was disappointing  Only department stores  consumer electronics outlets and gasoline stations posted sold sales gains  and the improvement at gas dealers owed mostly to higher fuel prices last month  If gas stations are stripped out  retail sales fell an even sharper 0 4

7068,228583,WFTLF,To Profit From Oil And Gas Sector Now  Find Unusual Bargains,opinion,"To profit in the current oil and gas space  investors have to move down the food chain to find  unusual bargains   says Randall Abramson  CEO and portfolio manager with Toronto based Trapeze Asset Management  Abramson expects global demand to return oil to  75 85 barrel inside 12 months  which means you won t have to wait long to see those bargains rise with the tide  In this interview with   Abramson discusses several bargains in the junior oil and gas space  as well as a handful of serviceable service names 
The Energy Report  In a previous interview  you said that Trapeze Asset Management uses its valuation model from a bottom up perspective to tell you where to find individual bargains  and from a top down perspective to tell you whether markets or sectors are overvalued  undervalued or fairly valued  What is that model telling you about today s oil and gas space 
Randall Abramson  Overall  the U S  stock market appears to be smack on its fair market value and  unusually  has held there for about a year  In fact  we have had the least amount of volatility in the first six months of 2015 than  apparently  in any first six month period in history 
That said  with oil and gas prices having dropped so far from this point last year  the industry appears to be trading at a 20  discount  Some of the quality names are only bargains assuming higher oil and gas prices  which is reasonable given that oil is trading below the average cost of production and way below where it ought to  since it normally trades at a premium to the cost of production  Some of the smaller names have traded way off  and they represent unusual bargains even at today s oil prices  Those names appear particularly attractive 
TER  Do you see Iran flooding an already flooded market with crude after the recent landmark nuclear deal 
RA  We don t  Based on the readings we ve done  we think there s only a few hundred thousand barrels per day that Iran could add to the system  Total Iranian production today is roughly 2 8 million barrels a day  2 8 MMbbl d   It could possibly get to about 3 2 MMbbl d  but it s not going to be all that meaningful to the overall picture  in our view  given ever growing demand and declining or flatlining supplies around the world 
TER  What did you make of the recent American Petroleum Institute  API  crude inventory numbers 
RA  The numbers in the U S  mask the reality  They show big inventory growth  but it s somewhat based on a model  Our readings show there are some potential inaccuracies  because U S  demand seems to be growing smartly  yet the U S  Department of Energy s production figures are model based and likely overstated  U S  production has likely flatlined  We expect to see the inventories wane in the months ahead  Already  only 19 MMbbl have been added this year  since May  versus 24 MMbbl normally 
Global oil inventories are more important to the oil market and are more in line  That s because  in the global market  we haven t seen the oversupply issues that we ve seen in the States  Global demand for oil has grown even faster than the most bullish prognosticators have predicted 
TER  What is the current drill rig count in the U S   How does that influence your view on near term and medium term oil and gas prices 
RA  We re down to about 870 rigs in the U S  That s less than half of the peak  That tells us that  even if we are more efficient today  there are fewer people finding oil and gas  The decline rate  particularly in the shales  where most of the growth has come from  is huge  especially in the early stages  While we have yet to see major declines in U S  production  it s inevitable that production is going to be flat or down for the foreseeable future  unless we have a massive recovery in the oil price  Even still  I doubt that most boards would approve drilling projects unless they are highly robust because of the glut less decline in the oil price in the absence of a recession 
TER  How long do you expect the price decline to last 
RA  We believe there will be a supply deficit in Q4 15  or sooner  Therefore  we should see  75 barrel   75 bbl  Brent or higher  Take your appropriate bottleneck discount to West Texas Intermediate to come up with North American prices 
The  75 bbl Brent price will come about because we re going to get a supply demand deficit that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries  OPEC  will not be able to meet  in our estimation  Saudi Arabia is already at full production capacity  The demand globally has been growing faster than expected  Not long ago global demand was in the 70 80 MMbbl d range  and in the next six to 12 months  you re going to see it at 100 MMbbl d  given the growth rates we ve witnessed  And the key point is  I don t think the world can meet that level of demand with a sub  60 bbl oil price  The price at the margin should adjust rapidly 
TER  Given how much the energy sector has fallen out of favor with investors  what are three or four fundamentals investors should specifically pay attention to in oil and gas equities 
RA  If you and I sat to develop a wish list of what we d want in a company  we d seek a company with low financial leverage so it could have staying power  along with high internal rates of return  IRRs  due to low finding costs  lower variable costs  or higher deliverability per well  You want solid IRRs at prices below where everybody would be making free cash flow  and a management team that knows not to get so levered as to imperil the business  That would be a recipe for success 
TER  Management experience is key  What other management attributes do you seek 
RA  Management must wear the three hats needed in this business  geology  engineering and business  If you foul up any one of those three  you re done  There have been countless examples of projects that look great geologically but for which the engineering does not work  and others that work at  75 bbl oil but not at lower prices 
TER  Are there steps you prefer to see companies taking in a low oil price environment 
RA  You need to make sure that a company is cutting costs to boost its IRRs  or focusing on projects with positive free cash flow  This is important because if a third party engineer lowers the reserves due to lower oil prices  then the company s line of credit is reduced since the reserves are no longer worth as much 
TER  Are there some back of the napkin metrics you commonly use to separate the better companies from the lesser 
RA  Not necessarily  because there are a lot of moving parts  It s like looking at any other business  With Apple  NASDAQ AAPL   it might be about profit margin and the number of units it s selling  In an oil and gas company  it s typically the IRR  how many cookies it can cut from its land package  and what s it going to cost per well versus the returns on those wells  As long as you have a balance sheet that can withstand the hits  you can throw off free cash flow to keep redeploying cash and increasing your reserves 
TER  What are some oil and gas equities that Trapeze continues to own at  50 60 bbl oil 
RA  We are enamored with Manitok Energy Inc   TO MEI   Manitok s share price suffered because it satiated the market with shares after doing a reasonably large size issue at  0 80 share  That enabled the company to make a big acquisition that will leave it with up to 300 drilling locations with IRRs in excess of 50  at today s oil prices in both its Basal Quartz and Lithic Glauc zones in southeast Alberta 
But Manitok is a smaller company  it s trading at CA 0 60 share on about 85 million  85M  shares  It is an under CA 50M company with just shy of CA 70M of debt  so its enterprise value  EV  is about CA 120M  Yet it s trading at less than 4x EV earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortization  EV EBITDA  at today s oil price  and at about 2x EV EBITDA assuming  65 bbl oil about the global average cost of production with years of growth ahead 
TER  You had a  2 50 share target price the last time we talked  What gives you confidence that Manitok can approach  2 50 share inside 12 months 
RA  Essentially  the company s NAV at about  60 share oil would be in that ballpark  Now  whether the market wants to take it there is going to depend on production from Manitok s wells staying on the type of curve that it has been at so far 
TER  Are companies this size in the oil and gas space typically trading at a similar discount 
RA  Few  Right now  in  Commodityland   the smaller you are  the harder you ve fallen  So you might have senior companies trading at 6 8x EV EBITDA  and midsize to junior companies trading at 4 5x  It s rare that you get a junior that s trading at 2x  like Manitok  The reason is that the company had production mishaps last summer and fall  Then guidance came in a little lower than expected  followed by the share issue related to the acquisition  In the meantime  it s trading at about  18 000 per flowing barrel the private market value is likely three times that amount 
TER  Does that list of issues give you pause to question management 
RA  Absolutely  You always question management  But you have to also look at whether this was the hand management was dealt  or whether the situation could have been managed more effectively  This was a poor hand  Sometimes things fall out of the sky and you have to deal with them 
TER  What other small cap companies do you follow 
RA  We continue to like Orca Exploration Group Inc   TO ORCa  ORCb   a natural gas company based in Tanzania  Orca has suffered the last few years because the Tanzanian government has not paid its bills on time  to Orca and others  We think that is all but over  The government is once again making payments  but still owes Orca for previous deliveries 
A pipeline the government had planned to build for some time is now built and should be commissioned in the next month or two  The World Bank and its various arms are about to provide financing so that Orca can drill some wells to help fill that pipeline  That should allow Orca to have significantly more cash flow than it does today 
TER  Does approval of the financing by the World Bank give you greater confidence in this story  given the risk profile of where the company operates 
RA  Absolutely  Tanzania is actually one of the better African countries in which to operate  but there was a corruption scandal in the government  along with the financial issues  The fact that the World Bank is involved definitely gives us greater confidence  Amazingly  Orca still trades at just over CA 3 share  even with a reserve based NAV in excess of CA 11 share 
TER  What are some other smaller oil and gas names you re focused on 
RA  We ve owned a company called Powder Mountain Energy Ltd   which was just acquired by Canamax Energy Ltd   TO CAC   We think there is some serious upside to Canamax  which trades at less than  0 50 on the dollar based on our valuation  The merged entity should be quite profitable  even at  say   60 bbl oil  If Canamax exits 2016 with more than 4 000 bbl production  which should be about 70  oil and 30  gas  at  65 bbl  that would be about CA 45M in EBITDA  It is trading at just over 1x EBITDA today  based on those metrics  It trades at about CA 0 45 share today at  let s say  a 5x multiple of cash flow  Assuming oil reverts to just above the global average cost of production around  65 bbl  then it would be more like CA 1 30 share by the end of next year 
TER  Why did Canamax and Powder Mountain get together 
RA  Canamax needed funds because it was making an acquisition to expand production  Powder Mountain had more than CA 20M cash and a significant land position  But Powder Mountain s land is more for tomorrow  because it works at  70 bbl oil or higher  Powder Mountain was looking to do something with its cash rather that put it into its own land at  50 bbl oil  It was almost a perfect match  Powder Mountain had looked at something like 40 different companies to fold itself into  and determined that Canamax was by far the best opportunity 
TER  Any others 
RA  We like a handful of names in the service sector  like Halliburton Co   NYSE HAL   which we think is trading at less than  0 80 on the dollar  We also like Weatherford International Ltd   NYSE WFT   which is even cheaper  But my favorite is still Technip  PARIS TECF    OTC TKPPY   which is probably trading at  0 65 on the dollar and has an EV EBITDA of just over 3 5x with a fine balance sheet 
TER  Technip recently won the contract for the Trans Adriatic Pipeline  Is that a material catalyst for that company 
RA  Not necessarily  The contracts the company has are relatively diversified and go to the overall strength of its business  This underpins our estimate of the company s discounted cash flow based value  which is about 75 euros  or 40  higher than its share price 
TER  When do you see the energy space fully recovering to previous highs  Or will it 
RA  The Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund  ARCA XLE  is 30  below its previous size  The XLE has a big coal component  which I m not sure is ever coming back  But if we get  75 85 bbl oil over the next six to 12 months  that should go a long way toward helping oil and gas companies recover  You could see the sector jump dramatically if we get to the  75 bbl mark  Some of the quality names are not going to move as much  but the smaller names could move substantially higher 
TER  Have you reduced your exposure to oil and gas names given current crude prices 
RA  We have not really changed our share allocation  We added more Manitok with the new issue but  otherwise  we ve held our full complement throughout the downturn 
TER  Any parting thoughts 
RA  We don t think oil is like copper or nickel  The price of copper or nickel tends to go up and down in a much more harried manner because the demand is more cyclical  The demand for oil  even in a recession  is normally positive  It was only in the last recession that oil demand actually declined and the price went from  145 bbl all the way to  30 something  where it bottomed 
We tend to like oil because it s a less cyclical commodity  We have to heat our homes  drive our cars and transport things about the planet  That means  especially with the Chinese and Indian economies continuing to grow  that demand will continue to move higher  And that bodes well for underlying oil prices

Initial jobless claims rose in the last week of January but remained at a very low level  New claims rose by 8 000 a seasonally adjusted 285 000 in the seven days stretching from Jan  24 to Jan 30  Any number below 300 000 is historically considered a sign of a robust labor market  but claims are no longer falling rapidly  In the last two weeks of January  for example  the number of new claims was slightly higher compared with the same two weeks in 2014  It s the first time in three years that has happened for two weeks in a row 
The productivity of U S  businesses fell at a 3  annual pace in the fourth quarter  marking the biggest decline in almost two years  Weak productivity growth has been a hallmark of the near seven year economic recovery  Productivity increased just 0 6  in 2015  less than one third the average since the end of World War II  In the fourth quarter  employees put in more time on the job but output of goods and services barely rose  Output edged up a scant 0 1  while hours worked jumped 3 3  
The European Commission trimmed its 2016 growth forecast for the euro area to 1 7 percent from 1 8 percent previously  At the same time  it slashed its 2016 inflation forecast  dropping it to 0 5 percent for the year  from 1 0 percent  In a speech at Germany s Bundesbank this morning ECB president Mario Draghi said that weak global inflation would not stop the central bank from adding more stimulus at its March meeting  The euro currency did not seem impressed by his dovishness  rising to a three month high versus the dollar

The US Dollar Index was down again  for the fourth straight session  part of the recent dollar decline is due to soft economic data  part might be due to comments by Robert Kaplan  the new head of the Dallas Fed  who said the central bank should be  patient  on rate increases 
The recent weakness in the greenback has provided investors the incentive to take profits in successful trades against commodities and emerging markets  which had suffered after a run higher by the dollar  New York Federal Reserve Bank President William Dudley said that financial conditions have tightened since late last year and policy makers will take this into account when they meet next month to decide whether to raise rates again 
Analysts and strategists in a Bloomberg survey cut their forecasts for the Fed s peak policy rate at the end of this tightening cycle  known as the terminal rate  to a median of 2 875 percent from 3 375 percent in a July poll  That compares with the Fed s latest forecast of 3 5 percent published in December  down from 3 75 percent in June  That means the Fed s rate outlook is out of sync with the markets  The question is who blinks first 
Small businesses stepped up hiring in January after taking a pause in December and many continued to point to difficulty finding qualified workers  The monthly survey of the National Federation of Independent Business showed that 52 percent of respondents said they were hiring or trying to hire  but a large share of those reported few or no qualified applicants for the jobs they were trying to fill  The average employment gain per firm was 0 11 workers compared with  0 7 workers in December 
The latest monthly report from the staffing firm Challenger  Gray and Christmas on planned layoffs showed that US employers in January reported 75 114 planned job cuts  up 42  year on year  Retailers moved the needle on this data point the most  particularly Walmart  N WMT   which announced plans to close 269 stores across America  The staffing firm also said energy sector layoffs continued to be a problem

ConocoPhillips  N COP  missed fourth quarter profit expectations and lowered its dividend  The company reported a net loss of  3 5 billion  wider than a net loss of  39 million  or a loss of 3 cents per share  in the year earlier period  The company lowered its 2016 capital expenditures and said   While we don t know how far commodity prices will fall  or the duration of the downturn  we believe it s prudent to plan for lower prices for a longer period of time  
Weatherford  N WFT  has announced in its fourth quarter earnings report that it ll lay off another 6 000 employees and close nine manufacturing service facilities before the end of the year  The latest round of cuts brings to 20 000 the number of workers who have been or will be released by the world s fourth largest oilfield services supplier  Weatherford also set a capital expenditure target of  300 million for this year  about 56  lower than its 2015 spending

There is a side story here  SwiftKey was started in 2008 by three young British guys  Jon Reynolds  Ben Medlock  and Chris Hill Scott  It is tough to build a startup  and Hill Scott grew weary of the long hours and low pay  He sold his stake to the other guys for a bicycle in 2008 and went to work for the British government  Reynolds and Medlock just pocketed about  35 million each for their shares 
Twenty four hours after facing fraud charges in a federal court in Brooklyn  Martin Shkreli turned up in Washington after being subpoenaed by the House of Representatives oversight committee  Shkreli created and ran a firm called Turing Pharmaceutical  which is known for acquiring the rights to a drug called Daraprim  and then hiking the price 5 000  overnight  from  13 50 to  750 a pill 
The reason behind the hearing was to find out about the drug pricing  Shkreli did not provide answers  he invoked his Fifth Amendment rights  while smirking and smiling  Afterwards he tweeted  Hard to accept that these imbeciles represent the people in our government  
Before invoking the Fifth today  Shkreli had said that he wasn t alone in taking big price hikes on drugs  And that is true  A survey of about 3 000 brand name prescription drugs found that prices more than doubled for 60 and at least quadrupled for 20 since December 2014 
Also at the hearing  Howard Shiller  interim CEO of Valeant Pharmaceuticals  N VRX   Valeant has increased the price of numerous old drugs  but the House committee has focused on two heart drugs  Isuprel and Nitropress  Valeant acquired both a year ago and immediately raised the price of Isuprel by more than 500 percent and of Nitropress by more than 200 percent  provoking protest from the hospitals that buy these drugs ",2016-02-07,Marvin Clark,https://www.investing.com/analysis/who-blinks-first-383530,383530
7070,228585,WFTLF,Is This The Time For Fed To Get More Hawkish ,opinion,"Is this the best time for the Fed to get more hawkish  Crude oil prices saw their biggest drop in 6 weeks after a large build in crude supply and hawkish talk from Fed officials which is almost unprecedented in the days after a terror attack  The flip flopping Fed is back at it  causing more confusion than it needs to  by getting hawkish after the terror attacks in Brussels  The Federal Reserve  just last week  gave the market some support by acknowledging that the global economy was struggling  Now St  Louis Fed voting member President James Bullard to join non voting Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart and San Francisco Fed President John Williams  talk about raising interest rates in April  Do Fed officials worry about adding to market instability by putting more pressure on the European economies right now  Even if they think they need to raise rates to slow burgeoning inflation  this is not the best time to bring it up 
This comes as U S  Crude Inventories rose by 9 36 million barrels last week on the back of oil imports which shot up 9 percent to 8 9 million barrels a day  That was the highest level of crude oil imports that we have seen since June 2013  Yet despite the big import inspired build  the overall build in crude oil supply fell by 1 258 million barrels in the Cushing  Oklahoma delivery hub  We also saw U S  oil production fall by 30 000 barrels a day to 9 04 million which was the lowest production number since November 2014 
Gasoline demand also is strong  averaging about 9 4 million barrels per day  up by 7 0  from the same period last year  This led to a big 4 62 million barrels drop in gasoline supply 
And while many are focused on short term over supply  looking down the road there are more fears that oil production will fall to dangerous levels in the future  The International Energy Agency warned about  historic  investment cuts  a term I have used  that are now taking place now  They warn that we will see the increased possibility of oil security surprises in the  not too distant future  
The head of the IEA s Oil Industry and Markets Division  Neil Atkinson  warned that about  300 billion is needed to sustain the current level of production and nations including the U S   Canada  Brazil  and Mexico are facing difficulty in keeping up investments  Bloomberg quotes him as saying 

 We need a lot of investments just to stand still  There s danger as we are reaching a point where we are barely investing upstream  If investment doesn t resume in 2017 and 2018  we can see a spike in oil prices as oil supply can t meet demand  

This came the day after the Energy Information Administration warns that shale wells can t keep up because of sharp decline rates  One loyal reader of the Energy Report said 

 When it comes to drilling and completing here are some things that you may already know  It takes on average for most companies in the Eagleford Shale Field  15 25 days to drill a well approximately 18 000 total feet  Of course before you can drill a well you have to build a pad  Most of the operators in any shale play do not build a one well pad  Large operators can build pads anywhere from 6 to 9 wells and smaller operators build 3 to 5 well pads  

He continued 

 Once you have drilled the wells  it takes some time to move the rig off the pad and then bring in a frac crew  If you took an average of two weeks to frac per 4 wells  to include mobilization time  your total time before you are able to bring on one well onto production is between 110 150 days  Currently the industry has wells that have been drilled but are uncompleted  DUCs  and as the price of oil ticks up  you will see that inventory brought down  

This  he warns  is hitting the oil service companies  Major players like Halliburton  NYSE HAL   Weatherford International Ltd  NYSE WFT   Baker Hughes Incorporated  NYSE BHI   Cudd  and Schlumberger NV  NYSE SLB  have seen over 45 of the operators that they service  could go bankrupt

7085,228600,WFTLF,How To Exploit The Coming Natural Gas Export Explosion,opinion,"There s more than one way to invest in energy  and you don t have to choose between majors and juniors  Frank Curzio  editor of the Small Stock Specialist newsletter  tells us exactly why every investor needs a diversified portfolio of juniors  large cap oil and gas producers and natural gas services  In this interview with The Energy Report  Curzio talks of a shifting political climate and why it could mean a massive boom for U S  natural gas exports  Don t let yourself be caught out in the cold when the natural gas market catches fire 
The Energy Report  Frank  will the ongoing crisis in Ukraine keep oil prices above  100 barrel   100 bbl  
Frank Curzio  Yes  I think so  Even without the short term effects of geopolitical risk  the fundamentals should keep oil at an average price of  95 bbl over the next few years in the U S  I don t see it trending too much higher  but I also don t see it dropping 
The reserve replacement ratio for some large U S  producers remains over 100   which is good  International oil companies  like Saudi Aramco  Gazprom  GAZP   PetroChina Company Ltd   PTR  and Petr leos Mexicanos  PEMEX  have replaced less than 80  of their oil reserves annually over the past three years  That is troublesome 
Outside the U S   it s very difficult to find oil that s economically priced  There s plenty of oil  but in a lot of places Russia and several spots in the Middle East  in particular explorers and producers are having trouble finding oil that can be developed for less than  90 bbl 
However  demand is still strong  Some reports show people are driving less  but according to a report by IHS Automotive  a record 82 million  82M  automobiles were sold last year around the world  Airbus set a sales record last year  as well  demonstrating strong aviation demand  The emerging markets have been down  but I expect to see more stimulus packages targeted at producing short term growth over the next few years from the BRIC nations  Brazil  Russia  India  China   particularly China 
In the U S   manufacturing is strong  gross domestic product is expected to hit 3   Housing starts are solid in this low interest rate environment  which will be around for years according to the Federal Reserve Bank  All of these are fundamental changes that will result in oil prices averaging  95 bbl over the long term 
TER  You ll be speaking at the Stansberry Society Conference with T  Boone Pickens  He takes the position that the U S  should look to clean energy and capitalize on low domestic natural gas prices by converting heavy truck fleets from diesel to natural gas  Can that be accomplished 
FC  Yes  I m siding with Boone Pickens  the process has already begun  Wal Mart  WMT   United Parcel Service Inc  UPS   Coca Cola  CCE   Pepsico  PEP  and Waste Management Inc  WM  are all switching their engines from diesel to natural gas compressed  CNG  or liquefied  LNG   so they re also building CNG and LNG fueling stations 
Fuel costs are the biggest expense for transportation companies  Using natural gas instead of diesel amounts to huge savings for companies with large fleets 
TER  What about cars  Can infrastructure be put in place so they can use natural gas 
FC  Some pickup trucks are already being converted to use both natural gas and gasoline  I rode in one when I visited Westport Innovations Inc   WPRT   and the only difference I noticed was that the engine made no sound at all 
Nearly every auto manufacturer produces cars that run on natural gas they just don t do it in the U S  because we don t have enough fueling stations yet  When that changes  natural gas cars will be huge  Clean Energy Fuels Corp   CLNE  is building CNG and LNG fueling stations  but infrastructure has to be in place before natural gas will become a mainstream fuel for cars  It could happen as soon as five years 
TER  When natural gas prices were low  many coal burning power plants switched to natural gas  When the price surpassed  6  some returned to burning coal  Will that dance continue or will more utilities switch to natural gas permanently 
FC  I think we ll see a move to natural gas  There are price spikes and volatility in every commodity  Overall  you need to look at the average price of things  like  3 50 bbl for natural gas over the course of our 100 years  worth of supply 
We have such a huge supply of natural gas that we have to burn it because we have no place to store it  Think about that for a minute  We have so much natural gas  we are burning it  This tells me the price of natural gas will remain cheap long term  thus making it a much better alternative to coal  both economically and environmentally 
TER  The last time we talked  you had just returned from a tour of U S  shale plays  and you were bullish on the amount of oil and natural gas coming out of the ground  Do the decline rates and transportation challenges worry you 
FC  Declining rates are a concern  as is depletion  but not in the short term 
I noticed this on my visits to the Permian and Eagle Ford  Depletion rates are high  But we still have so many locations to drill in these areas  For example  the Permian has so many layers  you can drill in the Wolfcamp  the Sprayberry and the Cline  Some experts say that oil production from the Cline could be three times bigger than the Eagle Ford  Four or five years from now  declining rates will be a big concern  but not in the short term 
Transportation challenges are more immediate  Three trains carrying oil crashed in North Dakota  which is significant  considering that 70  of the crude developed in the Bakken is shipped by rail  We also saw trouble shipping from Texas to the northeast 
Instead of worrying  I see it as an opportunity  especially for investors  We have to figure out why there have there been 6 incidents in the last 12 month and find a solution  This is an opportunity to improve our rail system 
We also have an opportunity to improve the infrastructure by building more pipelines  This is a great opportunity for companies like Kinder Morgan Energy Partners L P   KMP  and El Paso Pipeline Partners L P   EPB   These companies have high multiples because they have high yields and we re in a low interest rate environment  However  both will benefit from the long term pipeline infrastructure trend 
TER  How can these pipelines be approved and built 
FC  Pipeline systems need to be approved  but they won t because it s all about votes  not about what s good for the country  Of course  the process needs to be regulated  and we need to be concerned about the environment  but it seems people would rather save birds and plants than lower our poverty rate  We need to open up fracking in areas all over the country  We ve drilled tens of thousands of wells  and we haven t seen too many earthquakes  If it s done right and regulated correctly  we re sitting on a massive opportunity  We just need to open this system up a bit so more small towns  and the entire country  can benefit 
TER  In your Small Stock Specialist newsletter  you named getting governmental approval to build LNG export facilities as the biggest hurdle for energy companies selling U S  natural gas overseas  When do you see that changing  How much money is on the table due to the gap between U S  and European natural gas prices 
FC  Here in North America  we can produce natural gas at a much cheaper price because we have so much of it and we have the best techniques  namely fracking and horizontal drilling  Natural gas prices are 200 400  higher in the rest of the world  so there s been a mad rush to build LNG export facilities so we can sell to Europe  Asia and elsewhere 
Getting to that point is quite a process  First  you have to get through the U S  Department of Energy  DOE   which has been dragging its feet because of politics  Only six LNG export facilities have been approved since 2011  but there are more than 24 in the pipeline 
The Domestic Prosperity and Global Freedom Act was recently submitted to Congress as a means of bypassing the DOE s current regulations to make it easier to build and permit all the facilities that were in the pipeline at the time of the bill s submission  The situation in Russia and the Ukraine is changing legislators  minds even Democrats  Russia supplies most of Europe with energy  every time Russia gets mad  it threatens to shut off the natural gas  If the U S  could export our cheaper natural gas to Europe  it would cripple Russia  If enough Democrats get on board  you could see LNG export facilities built nearly as fast as a new McDonald s opening across the street 
Of course  we still need regulation  Companies will have to go through certain processes  but in the long run  it could represent a massive infrastructure build valued at more than  200B  That s great news for companies like KBR Inc   KBR NYSE   which earns 40  of its revenue building LNG facilities  Chicago Bridge   Iron Co  N V  s  CBI  revenue will soar as well  If this bill gets passed  it will be fantastic in the short and long term 
TER  KBR was beat up in the market recently  but it s still a really large stock  as is Chicago Bridge   Iron and McDermott International Inc   MDR   Do you buy these stocks on dips  or do you just buy and hold them 
FC  It all depends on where the stocks are trading  Right now  I d wait for a pullback on Chicago Bridge   Iron  but I would definitely buy KBR right away 
McDermott  which builds offshore oil platforms  may be one of the most hated stocks in the sector  The stock dropped from well over  20 to around  7 and is trading at book value  There is almost no downside risk here  which I rarely say  The company has a decent balance sheet  so if it can get a few orders any positive catalyst it will shoot up more than 25  in the short term  McDermott is a low risk  very high reward play 
TER  On the topic of shales  not all are the same  some are more advanced  some are oilier than others  In your opinion  where are the sweet spots 
FC  It s very important for an investor to focus on companies in the sweet spots  You don t want to buy a company just because it has Eagle Ford or Bakken in its profile  The specific place that the company is drilling is important  In the Bakken  production could cost as much as  80 90 bbl or little as  60  65 bbl  depending on where the company is drilling  The Eagle Ford comprises some 27 counties  but the sweet spots I note include Gonzales  McMullen and Lavaca counties 
TER  What companies of interest are working in these sweet spots 
FC  I like Swift Energy Co   SFY   It sold its non core assets and put the money into drilling in McMullen and La Salle counties  The company didn t raise quite the money it wanted  so management lowered production rates  The company s stock took a hit  but it will still produce a ton of oil in Eagle Ford  It s a fantastic buy 
In the Permian Basin in Texas  I like Laredo Petroleum  LPI   It has more than 900 drilling locations  The company has already hit a few big wells 
Penn Virginia Corp   PVA  is in the Eagle Ford and its stock is up a lot  The company will report earnings soon  but I might want to wait for a pullback before buying 
The three biggest shale plays are Pioneer Natural Resources Co   PXD   Continental Resources Group Inc   CRGC OTCBB  and EOG Resources Inc   EOG  
These three companies have market caps between  20 50B  which makes them takeout targets  They still have 15 20  production growth  so if you can buy a Pioneer  Continental Resources or EOG for  20 50B and get at least 20  production growth for the next 3 5 years  that seems like a pretty good deal to me  After all  the major oil companies are spending record amounts of cash and are struggling to grow production 
These three companies own hundreds of thousands if not millions of acres in these sweet spots and are set to grow production quickly  potentially four or five times faster than the average major oil company 
TER  What about oil services companies  Is there still money to be made there 
FC  Yes  but I would stick to the international plays that I ve been recommending for a couple years  Schlumberger Ltd   SLB   Halliburton Co   HAL   Baker Hughes Inc   BHI  and Weatherford International Ltd   WFT  
The Eagle Ford extends into Mexico  where PEMEX just signed a  1 9B deal with Schlumberger to start development  Additionally  rig counts in Saudi Arabia are near record highs  These four companies get 60  of their sales from overseas  The rest of the world is just starting to frack  and while there will be political hurdles to overcome  fracking will win out  When that happens  these four companies will benefit hugely 
These companies not only grow three to four times faster than the average S P 500 company  but their stocks are cheaper  too  They re still trading at 20 30  discount to the average S P 500 company  13 times earnings compared to 16 times for the average S P 500 company  Even at their 52 week highs  they are cheap considering their valuations  and they are in the middle of a massive long term growth trend 
And don t forget Barclay s estimate that oil companies plan to spend more than  700B on capex this year  A lot of that will filter down to oil service companies  but the four I mentioned are the best 
TER  In a risk averse environment  are larger oil companies still willing to invest in difficult megaprojects to spend  5B  for offshore work or in far reaches of the Arctic 
FC  They have no choice  The only way they can produce more is by spending more  In 2000  oil companies took on seven megaprojects  defined as projects that cost  5B or more   In 2012  the oil companies took on 37  That upward trend is another good sign for the infrastructure plays 
Take the Gorgon gas project in Western Australia  for example  It was expected to cost  30B  but it s up to  52B  and it isn t even done yet  However  that cost isn t shouldered just by Chevron Corp   CVX  or Exxon  XOM  several companies split the bill 
We re seeing this trend in the LNG export facilities  too five or six companies building a facility together as a big joint venture  In order for them to replace their reserves  they have to spend money  which is good for infrastructure companies 
TER  Why should investors consider the names in your Small Stock newsletter rather than sticking with blue chips 
FC  I think they need to go with both  I try to limit risk through small caps  while retaining massive gains  so it s important to own some large caps that pay a high dividend  like Chevron and even Exxon  You could own those companies forever 
However  it s important to own smaller companies because of the upside potential  If you bought Continental or Pioneer seven years ago  you would be up 500 1000  
An investor needs a basket of companies of all sizes  the large caps are steady and the small caps are speculative  It s my job to make sure people find the good speculations that offer limited downside and huge upside

7088,228603,WFTLF,What s Keeping Oil Prices Below  100 A Barrel ,opinion,"OUTLOOK
Crude Oil Record domestic production and the easing of geopolitical fears have combined to keep oil prices below the major psychological threshold of  100 per barrel  In particular  a spike in U S  output    now at their highest levels since 1986    has ballooned crude inventories to around 370 million barrels  thereby creating a supply glut  The commodity s recent lack of momentum also stems from perceptions of easing tensions over Iraqi oil exports  Till now  the militant uprising is limited to the northern part of the country  while Iraq s production region in the south remains largely unscathed  Concerns about the European economy and the resumption of output from Libya s largest oilfield have been further weighing on sentiments  Partly offsetting this unfavorable view has been a host of largely positive economic data  pointing towards improvement in the U S  labor market  This has prompted hopes for robust fuel and energy demand in the world s biggest oil consumer  The bullish momentum has been aided by the Federal Reserve s measured Taper reduction  The central bank    asserting that the U S  economy was strong enough    trimmed bond repurchases to  25 billion a month in July  substantially down from the peak of  85 billion  In the medium to long term  while the Western economies exhibit sluggish growth prospects  global oil demand is expected to get a boost from sustained strength in China  which continue to expand at a healthy rate despite some moderation  According to the Energy Information Administration  EIA   which provides official energy statistics from the U S  Government  world crude consumption grew by an estimated 1 3 million barrels per day in 2013 to a record high level of 90 4 million barrels per day  The agency  in its most recent Short Term Energy Outlook  said that it expects global oil demand growth by another 1 1 million barrels per day in 2014  But importantly  the EIA s latest report assumes that world supply is likely to outpace consumption growth and go up by 1 5 million barrels per day in 2014  In our view  crude prices in the next few months are likely to exhibit a sideways to bearish trend  mostly trading in the  90  100 per barrel range  As North American supply remains strong and the groundbreaking agreement with Iran makes it easier for the country to sell the commodity  we are likely to experience a pressure in the price of a barrel of oil Natural Gas Over the last few years  a quiet revolution has been reshaping the energy business in the U S  The success of  shale gas     natural gas trapped within dense sedimentary rock formations or shale formations    has transformed domestic energy supply  with a potentially inexpensive and abundant new source of fuel for the world s largest energy consumer  With the advent of hydraulic fracturing  or fracking     a method used to extract natural gas by blasting underground rock formations with a mixture of water  sand and chemicals    shale gas production is now booming in the U S  Coupled with sophisticated horizontal drilling equipment that can drill and extract gas from shale formations  the new technology is being hailed as a breakthrough in U S  energy supplies  playing a key role in boosting domestic natural gas reserves 
As a result  once faced with a looming deficit  natural gas is now available in abundance  In fact  natural gas inventories in underground storage hit an all time high of 3 929 trillion cubic feet  Tcf  in 2012  The oversupply of natural gas pushed down prices to a 10 year low of  1 82 per million Btu  MMBtu  during late April 2012  referring to spot prices at the Henry Hub  the benchmark supply point in Louisiana   However  things have started to look up somewhat following a frigid winter that saw the heating fuels  demand take off  This pushed commodity prices to its highest level in 5 years earlier this year  But with recent natural gas stock builds continuing to outpace the historical norms on the back of strength in summer production and mild weather  the commodity s near term fundamentals remain rather lukewarm  at least till the next heating season starting November ZACKS INDUSTRY RANK Oil Energy is one the 16 broad Zacks sectors within the Zacks Industry classification  We rank all of the more than 260 industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook for the constituent companies in each industry   The way to look at the complete list of 260  industries is that the outlook for the top one third of the list  Zacks Industry Rank of  88 and lower  is positive  the middle 1 3rd or industries with Zacks Industry Rank between  89 and  176 is neutral while the outlook for the bottom one third  Zacks Industry Rank  177 and higher  is negative  The oil energy industry is further sub divided into the following industries at the expanded level  Oil   U S  Integrated  Oil and Gas Drilling  Oil   U S  Exploration and Production  Oil Gas Production Pipeline MLP  Oilfield Services  Oil   International Integrated  Oil   Production Pipeline  Oilfield Machineries and Equipment  Oil C  Integrated  and Oil Refining and Marketing  The  Oil   U S  Integrated  is the best placed among them with its Zacks Industry Rank  18  comfortably placing it into the top 1 3rd of the 260  industry groups  where it is joined by the  Oilfield Machineries and Equipment  and  Oil   International Integrated  with respective Zacks Industry Ranks  45 and  79  The  Oil and Gas Drilling     with a Zacks Industry Rank  89    moves just out of the top 1 3rd and into the middle 1 3rd  The  Oil   U S  Exploration and Production    Oil Gas Production Pipeline MLP  and  Oil   Production Pipeline   with Zacks Industry Ranks of  91   97 and  104  respectively  However  all the other sub sectors   Oil Refining and Marketing  Oilfield Services  and Oil C  Integrated   are featuring in the bottom one third of all Zacks industries with respective Zacks Industry Ranks of  209   218 and  221  Looking at the exact location of these industries  one could say that the general outlook for the oil energy space as a whole is leaning toward  Neutral  to  Positive  EARNINGS TRENDS A look back at the just concluded Q2 earnings season reflects that as far as overall results of the Oil Energy sector is concerned  it displays a bullish trend  Crude prices rose to their highest level in nine months during this period  as tensions over Iraq continued to feed supply concerns in the Middle East  During the June quarter  earnings rose 12 2  year over year  a substantial improvement from the 1 6  decrease witnessed in the previous quarter  There was some progress on the revenue front too  which was up 2 1  in the second quarter as against a gain of just 0 8  in the first quarter  The sector has also been encouraging in terms of beat ratios  percentage of companies coming out with positive surprises   While the earnings  beat ratio  was good at 55 6   the revenue  beat ratio  was even more impressive  at 64 4   For more information about earnings for this sector and others  please read our Earnings Trends report OPPORTUNITIES Considering the turbulent market dynamics of the energy industry  we always advocate the relatively low risk conglomerate business structures of the large cap integrateds  with their fortress like balance sheets  ample free cash flows even in a low oil price environment and growing dividends  Our preferred name in this group remains Chevron Corp   CVX   Its current oil and gas development project pipeline is among the best in the industry  boasting large  multiyear projects  Additionally  Chevron possesses one of the healthiest balance sheets among its peers  which helps it to capitalize on investment opportunities with the option to make strategic acquisitions  While all crude focused stocks stand to benefit from  90  commodity prices  companies in the exploration and production  E P  sector are the best placed  as they will be able to extract more value for their products  In particular  we suggest exposure to small cap  undervalued E P players like Emerald Oil Inc   AMEX EOX  and Jones Energy Inc   NYSE JONE    which enjoy the benefits of crude oil price leverage  One may also capitalize on this opportunity with the related business sector of energy equipment service providers  Our top pick in this space is Cameron International Corp   NYSE CAM   The oil drilling equipment maker boasts of a diversified product portfolio  specialty service capabilities and proprietary technological expertise  Other positives for Cameron include a strong backlog position  growing international operations and a favorable outlook for subsea activity levels  Further  we remain optimistic on the near term prospects of Weatherford International plc  NYSE WFT    Going forward  there are plenty of positives for the oilfield services behemoth  including its leading position in the global market  its broad and technologically complex product service offerings  and its growing presence in the relatively stable Eastern Hemisphere  The company is well positioned to take advantage of the multi year expansion in the international upstream segment  The process is ongoing and is likely to gather momentum through 2014  Within the contract drilling group  we like Nabors Industries Ltd   NYSE NBR  and Patterson UTI Energy Inc   NASDAQ PTEN    Supported by their large and high quality drilling fleet of rigs  together with considerable exposure to the U S  shale bonanza  we expect the companies to sustain profitability over the foreseeable future  We believe Nabors and Patterson UTI s technologically advanced units will continue to benefit from an upswing in U S  land drilling activity and the shift to complex onshore plays that require highly intensive solutions  China s CNOOC Ltd   NYSE CEO is also a top pick  CNOOC remains well placed to benefit from the country s growing appetite for energy and the turnaround in commodity prices  In particular  the company enjoys a monopoly on exploration activities in China s very prospective offshore region in addition to having a growing presence in the country s natural gas and liquefied natural gas infrastructure  The acquisition of Canadian energy producer Nexen Inc  has further improved CNOOC s growth profile by augmenting proven reserves by 30   while helping it to vastly expand its holdings in Canada WEAKNESSES Weak propane prices have prompted us to be bearish on independent refiner and midstream services provider Phillips 66  NYSE PSX   We are also concerned by the company s aggressive growth plans that require high level of capital spending  which may eventually result in reduced returns going forward  We are also skeptical on Italian energy company Eni SpA  E   The integrated player  with a large presence in Libya  has seen its total production fluctuate in recent times  primarily due to operational disturbances at several fields in the North African nation  Additionally  Eni s upstream portfolio carries greater political risk than its peers  since it has the highest exposure to the OPEC countries  The Rome based company has also been mitigated by a weak macroeconomic scenario in Italy and Europe that is likely to affect its performances going forward  We see little reason for investors to own engineering and construction firm McDermott International Inc   MDR   The company s steep operating costs  an erratic earnings trend over the last few quarters and lack of clarity about some of the big projects have made us bearish about the firm s near term prospects  Contract drilling services provider Noble Corp   NYSE NE   is another company we would like to avoid for the time being  Apart from volatility in the macro backdrop  a sequential decline in the company s fleet utilization and a drop in backlog continue to concern us  Moreover just 74  and 50  of available rig operating days for the remainder of 2014 and 2015 have been committed  Lastly  we recommend against buying legacy offshore drillers like Transocean Ltd   NYSE RIG   The most pressing concern for the group  at least in the short term  will be oversupply in the rig market  With multinational energy biggies looking to reign in their skyrocketing capital expenses  the offshore drilling space is likely to see intense competition  as multiple firms run after a single contract  This excess capacity  in turn  could lead to lower utilization or dayrates  As the sector looks set to enter a cyclical downturn and struggle with idled rigs  we do not see an immediate rebound in the sentiment and expect more punishing times ahead for the likes of Transocean ",2014-08-22,Zacks Investment

7097,228612,WFTLF,Elliott Gue  Where To Look For Yield During A Time Of Low Gas Prices,opinion,"With gas prices stuck at historic lows for the foreseeable future  bored investors can look toward master limited partnerships to increase profit yields on energy portfolios  Elliott Gue  energy investment strategist of Capitalist Times  spends his day finding great energy deals in the margins and curves  In this interview with The Energy Report  Gue does the dirty work and gives us his strategy so that investors can golf  yacht  and have fun without worrying about losing the value of their savings to inflation 
The Energy Report  Elliott  you recently wrote in  that  unless last winter marked the onset of a new ice age  the underlying supply and demand trends that prevailed before the polar vortex are always going to win out   Based on the charts that accompany that article  what are those trends 
Elliott Gue  Last winter was really cold and  as a result  natural gas demand was very high  Natural gas stores in the U S  were drawn down much more rapidly than normal  At the same time  there were production disruptions  It was so cold in the Rocky Mountains that producers were not able to service their wells  Natural gas production plummeted and gas prices shot up 
The underlying trend remains very bearish for gas prices  however  The demand for gas did ease after the winter heating season  lowering prices  but there has been resurgence in production  and storage levels are back up  The electric power utilities thrive on cheap gas  and production is growing even faster than rising demand  There are simply oceans of gas out there that we have not yet tapped  like the Haynesville Shale in Louisiana  I expect that gas prices in the U S  will remain low  and  consequently  electricity prices will continue to hug the bottom relative to the rest of the world 
TER  Given the situation  who will be the winners 
EG  The biggest winners are going to be companies that consume gas  rather than companies that produce gas  A lot of energy companies are moving away from gas toward producing more oil and natural gas liquids  Electricity prices in China are twice what they are in the U S  Reversing a long trend  Chinese companies are building out manufacturing capacity in the U S  The aluminum smelting industry stands to benefit tremendously  because its manufacturing process is linked to the price of electricity 
TER  Who do you like in aluminum 
EG  We like Century Aluminum Co   NASDAQ CENX   which is an aluminum smelter  Century takes aluminum oxide and  using a process that requires a lot of power  turns the oxide into aluminum  which is then used in thousands of products  Century is buying power in the U S  on the spot  which means that it pays prevailing market prices  As a result  it is buying power at a steep discount to what its European competitors are paying 
Demand for aluminum by the automobile industry is expanding  because the federal government s Corporate Average Fuel Economy  CAFE  standards require automakers to boost the fuel efficiency of entire lines of cars and trucks  Ford is meeting the standard by increasing the amount of aluminum used in its vehicles  The 2015 Ford F 150 pickup truck is 750 1 000 pounds lighter than the 2014 model  It is expected to sport a fuel efficiency of 30 miles per gallon  30 mpg   No standard size pickup truck in the U S  has ever achieved 30 mpg in terms of fuel efficiency  The low natural gas prices in the U S  will continue to be a big boost for companies like Century Aluminum  which require an awful lot of power in their factories 
TER  Are energy investors today looking for short term profits in the hurly burly of the stock market  or are they looking for steady income vehicles 
EG  Steady income investments are in demand  Back in 1999 2000  you could put money into a certificate of deposit  a money market account  or even a savings account and still get interest rates of 5 6  year  Now  you can t even get 1   Income producing stock sectors  like utilities and real estate investment trusts  REITs   are yielding at near historic lows  under 3   Investors are starved for steady stream income vehicles  This highlights the attractiveness of master limited partnerships  MLPs   which are typically used by midstream energy companies  The MLPs own assets like pipelines and natural gas storage vehicles  They offer higher than average yields  which permits investors to earn better than average returns 
TER  Are the best opportunities for steady income flow emerging from the established MLPs  or from those MLPs making initial public offerings  IPOs  
EG  We focus on MLP IPOs because the yields on many of the large  traditional MLPs have fallen not because they have cut dividends or distributions  but because the MPL industry has rallied so much  I see a lot of value in new MLP listings companies that have just gone public as MLPs  Exchange traded funds  ETFs  and institutional money is strongly attracted to the largest and longest standing MLPs  such as Enterprise Products Partners L P   NYSE EPD   Buying MLPs en masse inevitably drives down the yield  Still  investors are so hungry for yield that they are piling into the traditional MLPs  which can increase the valuation of the larger  more established names 
Oftentimes  if you search for a symbol for a new MLP  it will show that there is no yield  The reason is that the MLP has not yet paid its first quarterly distribution  It is a good strategy to jump in early on new MLPs  before they become too popular  Investors can get a good price until the MLP starts paying out distributions  and displays its income potential for all to see and grab 
TER  What IPOs do you like in the MLP space 
EG  One new IPO that we are looking at is Cypress Energy Partners LP  CELP NYSE   It went public in January 2014  Cypress is in the wastewater business  Oil and gas fields produce large volumes of water that contains all kinds of contaminants  and that water must be disposed of in a regulated fashion  Cypress injects wastewater into disposal wells underneath the drinking water table 
There is also a need for recycling fracking wastewater  so it can be used in another round of fracking  The technology to do that already exists  but it is more expensive than disposing of wastewater in an injection well  The future holds more recycling opportunities because reusing expensive water can cut costs  For instance  in Southern California  water prices are very high because there is a drought  so using recycled water makes sense  Cypress may enter that space as well 
The second part of Cypress  business is pipeline integrity  monitoring pipelines for signs of weakness that might cause a spill  Obviously  with high profile pipeline spills and reputation damaging ruptures over the last five to 10 years  focus has shifted to this business  Companies are spending cash to make sure their pipelines are safe 
Cypress yields about 6 5   The average MLP yields about 5 5   so Cypress delivers an above average yield  It has a lot of growth potential because both of its businesses are necessary  I expect its distributions to grow at an annualized pace of 10 15   plus the 6 5  yield 
TER  Which other MLPs do you particularly like 
EG  One of our favorites is Memorial Production Partners LP  NASDAQ MEMP   It owns mature oil and gas fields in Texas and the Rockies  and an offshore field in California that went into production 70 years ago  Predictable rates of production from these fields back the company s strong  9 6  yield  Of course  if oil and gas prices fall  Memorial would have to cut its distribution  To prevent that scenario  it hedges most of its production five years into the future meaning that Memorial does not have any real exposure to the volatility of commodity prices 
TER  Are there any MLP spinoffs in the works 
EG  One of the biggest MLP spin offs is going to be called Shell Midstream Partners LP  As that name implies  it is being spun out from Royal Dutch Shell Plc  NYSE RDSa   which is  of course  one of the largest oil companies in the world  It is an integrated producer  It has upstream oil and gas production  It has downstream refining  and owns a large number of midstream assets in North America  like pipelines and storage facilities  Shell Midstream will own the Ho Ho pipeline  which stretches from Houston to Houma  Louisiana  The spin off s long term contracts will be with producers like Shell  which is also its general partner  Those solid contracts will guarantee a minimum cash flow  I suspect that this new MLP will go public in Q4 14  and it will be a hot name 
TER  Have you spotted any undervalued oil and gas production majors 
EG  The problem with Exxon Mobil Corp   NYSE XOM  and Chevron Corp   NYSE CVX  is their slow production growth in recent years  These companies are overvalued by any metric price book value  price cash flow  price earnings  We look for smaller integrated names  These are still massive companies  but not as gargantuan as Exxon and Chevron 
For instance  Eni S p A   NYSE E  is an integrated oil company that is partly owned by the Italian government  It trades at a discount to the big U S  and northern European energy firms because it is based in Rome  The financial crisis in southern Europe has hit the Italian economy hard  and investors tend to shun firms listed in Rome  The reality is that most of Eni s assets are in Africa  where Italy had a longstanding colonial relationship  Eni s main products are natural gas and crude oil priced in dollars  not euros  So Eni has had very little exposure to the risky Italian situation  yet it trades at about half the valuation of Exxon 
TER  If the majors are experiencing a slowdown in production growth  how can the smaller firms do better 
EG  Exxon has trouble growing because  for a field to move the company s stock needle  it has to be massive  Eni can exploit smaller projects in Africa and generate relatively greater production growth  It has a number of major finds in Mozambique that are due to come on stream over the next few years  An additional benefit is that Eni yields about 5   whereas Exxon yields around 2 3   Eni is offering a much higher yield alongside production growth in the outlier regions 
TER  Are there other large companies in that smaller space that you like 
EG  Total S A   NYSE TOT  is a French company  It trades at a discount because it is based in Europe  It offers a yield of about 5   It is not quite as strong a production growth story as Eni  but it does have a number of interesting projects coming online in the Arctic  near Norway 
TER  What junior explorers and producers do you have your eye on 
EG  Noble Energy Inc   NYSE NBL  centers its production on the Niobrara Shale region in Colorado and Wyoming  The Niobrara is not as fully developed as the Bakken Shale  but the Niobrara s wells are among the most spectacular plays in the U S   ranking only behind the Bakken in terms of profitability  Noble is one of the largest acreage holders in the Niobrara  It has set up a very aggressive drilling program for the next three to five years  As people become more aware of what is going on in the Niobrara  and as production expands  entrenched names like Noble will attract lots of attention and capital 
TER  Is Noble international 
EG  Three years ago  Noble discovered a massive gas field off the coast of Israel called the Leviathan  While natural gas prices in the U S  are very low  that is certainly not the case in Europe and Israel  The massive Leviathan gas field is strategically important to Israel  Noble will be able to produce natural gas from this field  sell it domestically  and bring down the cost of natural gas in Israel  It will also be able to export liquefied natural gas  LNG  to Europe  Currently  Europe imports the majority of its natural gas from Russia  With the ongoing political turmoil in the Ukraine  the Europeans are keen to diversify their supply sources 
TER  When will the Leviathan start producing 
EG  Noble is drilling a number of delineation wells  These wells will evaluate the size and productivity of the play  The flow of news is good  I suspect the Leviathan will go into production in the next two to three years  It will ramp up in 2019  as the company s LNG plant goes live 
TER  With the differential in natural gas prices  what s happening in the refining space  Where are the best buys 
EG  The refining space is the biggest beneficiary of the surge in U S  oil production  At the end of 2013  the U S  overtook Saudi Arabia to become the world s largest oil producer  That is an amazing statistic when you consider that just 10 years ago  we were talking about how much more oil the U S  was going to have to import from Saudi Arabia to meet domestic demands  And oil production in the U S  continues to grow 
But one of the side effects of that growth is that U S  oil prices are far lower than in other parts of the world  The key international global oil benchmark is Brent crude  It is trading around  100 105 barrel   100 105 bbl   The key U S  oil benchmark is West Texas Intermediate  WTI   and that is trading in the low to mid  90s 
In other parts of the U S   oil prices are even lower  In Midland  Texas  in the heart of the Permian Basin play  oil prices are trading around  74 bbl  which is a massive discount to international oil prices  Due to the lack of pipeline capacity  there is a glut of crude oil in certain parts of the U S   and that fact is depressing prices  Obviously  that is not good news for producers  but it is great news for refiners 
TER  Why 
EG  Refiners are manufacturers  A refiner s largest cost is the price of crude oil  If a refiner can buy oil at a deeply discounted price  that will enhance its profit margins  Refiners located near Midland purchase crude at a steep discount and sell gasoline and diesel fuel at high prices  Plus  the U S  government does not allow the export of crude oil  but it does allow the export of refined products  And international prices for refined products are sky high 
TER  What refiners do you like 
EG  Valero Energy Corp   VLO NYSE  is the largest independent refiner in the U S   with refinery assets primarily located around the Gulf Coast area  A lot of production flows toward that region because pipelines in the U S  are set up to transport oil to the Houston area  where the refining industry is strong 
Looking at smaller refiners  we keep tabs on Alon USA Partners LP  ALDW NYSE   This MLP has a refinery in Big Spring  Texas  near Midland  It benefits from the low Midland crude oil prices and selling its refined products at very high markups  It currently yields about 16   and that is super 
TER  Of the Big Four firms in the service sector  which ones are the best positioned in today s economic climate 
EG  Four of the largest oil services firms in the world are Baker Hughes Inc   NYSE BHI   Halliburton Co   NYSE HAL   Schlumberger Ltd   NYSE SLB  and Weatherford International Ltd   NYSE WFT  
Schlumberger is the largest  It is also the most respected and  technologically  the most advanced  People sometimes make the mistake of thinking that the energy business is not high tech  The energy business is one of the most high tech industries  It is producing oil from deepwater plays  drilling in water that s 10 000 feet  10 000 ft  deep  with wells that can be 35 000 ft long  Bidding on big deepwater developments  and big onshore projects in the Middle East  is a very competitive business  These projects are so heavily bid that the pricing is not great  because companies are competing on price to win business 
Schlumberger has developed certain unique technologies that the rest of the Big Four services firms don t have  These are typically techniques that allow companies to drill a well using less water  drill a well quicker than its competitors  and locate oil in underground rock formations with seismic waves that map the rock formations  As a result  Schlumberger is able to charge high prices for its unique services  and its margins are much higher than those of its competitors 
Weatherford has been the worst of breed over the last five years  It had an accounting scandal an irregularity in its international accounting for taxes  That matter has been settled  which means Weatherford s management team can return to focusing on operations  The company is spinning off noncore businesses that were not returning high margins  The  1 billion   1B  from these spinoffs can be used to pay down Weatherford s debt load  which is a big positive 
Operationally  Weatherford has artificial lift  a technology that can produce more oil from mature fields  That lifting ability is very much in demand  because there are a lot of mature fields around the world  and oil prices are high enough to make it profitable  Once Weatherford gets rid of the small businesses that have been acting as a headwind on profits over the last five years  its managers will be able to focus on the firm s competitive strengths  such as artificial lift 
TER  What advice are you giving readers about adjusting portfolios for the fall 
EG  Stocks have been steadily on the rise  and we have not seen very many corrections  The correction we saw this summer was on the order of 5  on the S P  Be prepared for a 5 10  pullback in the broader market  We regard a pullback as a buying opportunity for a lot of the names that I have mentioned 
Longer term  the economy is in good shape  Growth is accelerating after too many years of weak growth  Growth generates a big tailwind for stocks  We have been selling out of the names that have done very well for us  taking our profits off the table or reducing our exposure  It is all about having cash in reserve to take advantage of the lower prices when they come around  as they always do

7115,228630,WFTLF,FX Futures Edge  September 24  2012 ,opinion, FORECAST STOCKS  The European debt contagion has been  kicked down the road  a bit further as Spanish and Italian short and long term bond yields have moderated recently given the ECB  plan  to buy bonds of up to 3 years in maturity   but only if asked  and only if conditionality is imposed upon those asking  The Fed has also changed its game from  inflation fighting  to  unemployment fighting   and with any war   they will go further and farther than anyone believes in printing money to achieve their ends  This will support all asset prices ultimately STRATEGY  The S P 500 remains above long term support at the 160  wma at 1228  which delineates bull bear markets  The much followed 200 dma support level stands at 1353  and remains the bulls  Maginot Line   We ve noted this is perhaps one of the  weirdest rallies  we ve ever seen  and it causes us a great deal of consternation  But the new Fed policy is directly at stocks  expect an S P all time high test at 1576 WORLD MARKETS ARE CORRECTING THEIR RECENT GAINS THIS MORNING as there are some concerns that the Spanish are once again  for the umpteenth time   dragging their feet on requesting a bailout  If there is anything we can count on is that once southern European bond yields move lower on the prospects of ECB intervention  then the governments  propensity to fix their problems falls with yields  Such is the case today  and there are reports out of Germany that they are growing weary of the Spanish intransigence to make the long awaited request  German Finance Minister Schaeuble has even gone as far to say that Spain doesn t need a bailout to take pressure of the situation or to backhandedly push Spanish yields higher to pressure Spain  But this is Politics 101  and this is how they play out  What we find interesting that is that Spanish yields aren t moving higher this morning In terms of the current state of the stock markets  they are still consolidating the gains seen prior to the Fed s  game changer  10 days ago  and we still see them going higher in the very short term  We view the current consolidation in the S P 500 as very similar to that seen prior to the Fed s announcement  and look for higher prices towards the all time highs at 1550 to 1600  Now  we won t say this rally will be dressed up and really pretty  for we believe it shall be rather ugly and scraggly   and once it arrives at the  dance zone   then we ll see a rather material correction as that is nearly always the case on the first attempt to poke tonew highs At present  our worst worry is the Dow Transports  for they made their highs in July 2012 and have since traded lowerto  sideways as the Dow Industrials have enjoyed a rather healthy rally  Many will point to this as a  non confirmation  of Dow Theory  and we ll leave the particulars of this theory to others more versed in this controversial area  Let us further note that this used to be the simplest of indicators  elegant in its simplicity as one only had to view highs and lows and one could get a sense of confidence in a rally and consequently the economy  This is no longer the case a myriad of technicians have found many holes in the theory  and there is a raging debate going on as to its current validity  We like to keep things simple here  we are concerned that the Transports have not forged a high with the Industrials  yet  But to this end we ve provided a ratio chart of the Dow Industrials Dow Transports  It is quite clear to us that the Industrials are breaking out against the Transports above the 300 week moving average for the first time since 1998   just as the Fed was once again easing monetary policy aggressively in lieu of the Russian Credit Crisis  So  it would appear that a new trend towards higher Industrial prices versus Transports has taken place  We should further note the Industrials hit their absolute peak in 1999  while the ratio continued higher into March 2000 highs TRADING STRATEGY  At present  we are positioned bullishly  with an emphasis upon  reflation  given the Fed s balance sheet is larger than our margin account to bet against it  If we are looking to be long again  we ll look towards two energy plays  Weatherford  WFT  and Transocean  RIG   On Friday  both these stocks were  higher  on rather impressive displays of strength in a stagnant market   perhaps the late cycle energy plays are the place to be  WFT forged a key reversal higher  while RIG was sharply higher on 4x its normal volume  and on the cusp of a major breakout above its 280 day moving average  We like these patterns a great deal To Read the Entire Report Please Click on the pdf File Below ,2012-09-24,Richard Rhodes,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/fx-futures-edge:-september-24,-2012-137522",137522
