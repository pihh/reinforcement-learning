6258,227773,BMRC,The Only Dividend Champions And Contenders That Are Attractively Valued,opinion,"Introduction
As the stock market continues its relentless advance  attractive valuations are getting harder and harder to find  This is especially true for the highest quality blue chip dividend growth stocks  Perhaps more importantly  in addition to the market s relentless advance  there has also been a clear flight to quality   especially with dividend growth stocks  Therefore  the vast majority of the best of breed blue chip dividend paying stocks are currently trading at elevated levels  In other words  finding high quality and value is very rare today in the dividend growth segment 
This presents a conundrum for the prudent dividend growth investor with money available for investment  Prudence suggests that the quality of the companies chosen for their portfolios is extremely important  It only makes sense to try to invest in the highest quality companies you can find  However  the prudent dividend growth investor also needs to ask and answer another important question  At what point does excessive valuation turn quality into high risk investments  After all  the idea behind investing in quality is to lower risk 
Furthermore  being prudent implies being sensible regarding the valuations you should be willing to pay for even the highest quality company  The intelligent value investor recognizes that you can overpay for even the best company  Moreover  they understand that investing when valuation is too high reduces the opportunity for attractive returns and simultaneously increases risk  Taking on more risk for lower potential returns is the antithesis of prudent value investing 
However  this poses a second important question that the prudent value investor must also ask and answer  How much quality should you be willing to forgo  Asked differently  what is the proper balance between quality and value  In other words  at what point does attractive valuation compensate you for the risk of investing in lesser quality securities  These are difficult questions for the prudent investor to answer  However  I will attempt to provide some insights into correctly answering these questions with this article 
Dividend Growth Stocks on David Fish s lists of Champions and Contenders 
In my previous article titled  These Are The Only Dividend Aristocrats I Would Consider Today  I identified only 7 out of 50 Dividend Aristocrats I would consider investing in currently  This prestigious list of dividend growth stocks covers what is generally considered the cr me de la cr me of dividend growth stocks  However  produces and tracks 3 additional lists of dividend growth stocks with histories of increasing their dividends each year known as the CCC lists 
His Dividend Champions have increased their dividend payout for at least 25 years similar to the Dividend Aristocrats list  However  his list includes 108 Champions versus only 50 Aristocrats  Nevertheless  the majority of companies found in his Dividend Champions are generally high quality dividend growth stocks 
His second list he calls Dividend Contenders  which is comprised of companies that have increased their dividends for 10 to 24 straight years  This list of reliable dividend growth stocks is currently made up of 242 companies  Generally speaking  this is also a list of high quality dividend growth stocks  but arguably  the quality of the companies on this list would in the general sense not be equal to the Champions or Aristocrats constituents 
Finally  David Fish offers his third list of up and coming potential dividend stars known as the Challengers  There are 428 companies currently on this list representing dividend growth stocks that have increased their dividends for 5 to 9 straight years  With this article  I only surveyed the Champions and Contenders looking for attractive valuation  Consistent with what I found when I surveyed the Dividend Aristocrats in my previous article  I only found 6 additional Dividend Champions  excluding any of the duplicate Aristocrats I presented in my previous article  that I considered attractive in today s elevated market 
On the other hand  my cursory review did identify 32 Dividend Challengers that appear attractively valued today  Consequently  this leads me to conclude that the best values for the dividend growth investor might currently be found in the Dividend Challengers  However  that does not automatically imply that the research candidates on this list are of lower quality  On the other hand  some are of lower quality and some are not  Finding impeccable quality available at attractive valuations is currently challenging  to say the least  Nevertheless  the one common denominator with all these research candidates is that they have all increased their dividends each year for the past decade or more 
Why a 15 P E Ratio is a Rational Valuation Reference
The P E ratio of 15 is an extremely important and rational valuation reference if you understand the significance of what this metric really means  First and foremost  the P E ratio is not just a mere number or statistic  It is actually a mathematical calculation that represents the value that a given company s earnings are offering you as an investor  In my most recent article  a comment was made suggesting that applying a P E ratio of 15 to all companies was overly simplistic  With this article I intend to demonstrate why that is not true for most companies 
As rational investors  we are always attempting to earn the highest possible returns we can at the lowest levels of risk we can assume  Therefore  a rational way to look at investing in a stock is to determine what rate of return the company s earnings power is offering you at a given level of valuation  As I ve written many times before  the easiest way to determine this is to simply calculate the earnings yield represented by the company s P E ratio  This is accomplished by inverting the formula from price to earnings  P E  to earnings to price  E P  which gives you the earnings yield  Therefore  a 15 P E ratio represents an earnings yield of approximately 6 66   A P E ratio of 20 represents an earnings yield of 5  and a P E ratio of 30 represents an earnings yield of 3 33  
Consequently  when you are evaluating the P E ratio of a given company  in the back of your mind you should be asking what yield is the company s current earnings offering me  An earnings yield of 6  to 7   P E ratio 15  would be the minimum that a rational investor should expect given the risk associated with investing in common stocks  This is especially pronounced when you consider that as a passive shareholder  you will not be receiving all of the company s earnings 
For example  if the company s dividend payout ratio was 50  of earnings  this would imply a current dividend yield of 3 33   Any return you would expect above that would have to come from capital appreciation potential  Of course  a lower dividend payout ratio would indicate a lower dividend yield  and vice versa  However  the point is that the earnings yield and the dividend yield represents the current returns that the company s earnings power is affording you at any given valuation 
What I am suggesting here is that when you are seeing a company trading at a certain P E ratio  you should immediately ask yourself what is the earnings yield  and is it high enough to entice me to invest  Obviously  this also suggests that the lower the P E ratio you pay to invest in a stock  the higher the earnings yield that valuation represents  With all investing  higher yield is always better than lower yield 
Additionally  and as I also have written many times in the past  the long term returns from stocks has averaged somewhere between a range 6  to 8   Therefore  an earnings yield that falls within that range  i e  a P E ratio of 15  represents an average return expectation with anything less being unacceptable  Therefore  I am recommending that a P E ratio of 15 represents a very valid and rational valuation reference and perhaps even limit 
Furthermore  suggesting that a P E ratio of 15 represents a rational value reference for most companies does not simultaneously suggest that the market will not assign a different P E ratio valuation  However  there is a big difference between market valuation and intrinsic valuation  Stock prices are volatile and changing every day  and with those price changes P E ratios change in tandem  In other words  P E ratios will be routinely moving above and below this fair valuation reference 
The key for the rational investor is to understand the difference between sound valuation and market valuation   and then act accordingly  Nevertheless  if the investor finds a reason to not act accordingly  they should at least be aware of the ramifications of their actions  In other words  when you are investing in a stock at a high P E ratio  you should recognize that you are taking on more risk than the company s earnings power is offering  Consequently  you must depend on future market action for your rewards  because fundamental values are not there  Said differently  the only way you can expect attractive returns when paying a higher valuation is to expect the market to continue to value your company at these high valuations long into the future 
Up to this point what I presented might be considered an interesting theory on valuation and the relevance of the P E ratio of 15 as an important valuation reference  However  the proof is  as they say  in the pudding  Therefore  if there is any credence to the theory  then we should be able to see it at work under real world occurrences  In other words  how well does the P E ratio 15 stand up as a valuation reference when examining the long term record of actual companies in the stock market over time 
If what I have presented has any relevance  then we should see a strong correlation between a company s stock price and its earnings at a P E ratio of 15  Furthermore  we should see periods of underperformance when a company s valuation is higher than a P E ratio of 15  and periods of better performance when the company s valuation is lower than the P E ratio of 15  And more importantly  during periods of time when the market is valuing the company above this valuation reference we should see the price move back into alignment  and when the market is undervaluing the company it should also eventually move back into alignment with the P E ratio of 15 
Therefore  in order to test this theory  I am going to provide long term historical earnings and price correlated  on all of the Dividend Champions and Challengers that I have identified as fairly valued research candidates by surveying those lists of dividend achievers  Frankly  I m not sure how many of these companies many readers might find attractive or of interest 
To be honest about it  they are only a few that I would personally be willing to consider  However  the purpose of this exercise was to examine the valuations of what many consider the best sources for dividend growth investing  The bottom line result is that attractive valuations on good dividend growth stocks are hard to find today  Hopefully  there are a few on this list that might be of interest to some of you 
Is the 15 P E Ratio Overly Simplistic or Profoundly Rational 
In all the many articles on value investing I have authored  the validity of my contention that a P E ratio of 15 is a sound and valid valuation reference has been often challenged  In most of my articles  I presented a few examples that I considered relevant to the thesis of what I was writing about  However  with this article I m going to take a more aggressive approach  With this article I m going to include approximately 40 earnings and price correlated F A S T  Graphs   I apologize in advance for the number of graphs  however  these 40 companies come in virtually every color and flavor imaginable  Therefore  they represent strong evidence supporting my thesis 
On the majority of these graphs the orange earnings justified valuation reference line will be drawn at a P E ratio of 15  However  there are a few companies with earnings growth rates above 15  where the orange earnings valuation reference line will be drawn at a higher P E ratio  and one REIT example where I will be presenting the more appropriate price to funds from operations  FFO  
Moreover  in addition to just presenting fairly valued Dividend Champions and Challengers  my more personal motivation is to illustrate to the reader how the P E ratio of 15 applies to real companies over long term timeframes  The P E ratio of 15 as a fair valuation reference is profoundly relevant when you examine the long term earnings and price correlations of most companies  I contend that the examples presented in this article provide prima facie evidence of that reality  Theory is fine and even interesting to pontificate about  but true insights come from examining how the theory applies and or works in the real world 
However  in order to truly benefit from this exercise  I would like to focus the reader s attention on to what is actually being displayed  On each company graph presented  please recognize that the orange lines on each graph are drawn at a P E ratio of 15  The black lines on the graph are plotting monthly closing stock prices over the timeframes presented 
Therefore  when the black price line is touching the orange line  note that this is a time when the P E ratio of the company is precisely 15  Further note that when the price is above the orange line  the P E ratio at that time is higher than 15  and when the price is below the orange line the P E ratio is lower than 15  Most importantly  note how the stock price tracks the 15 P E ratio closely over time and how it always and eventually moves back into alignment when it becomes disconnected from the orange line  Once you get the hang of what you re looking at  it should only take a few seconds to examine each of the numerous graphs presented 
Additionally  be conscious of what happens to performance when the price is above the orange line and what happens to performance when the price is below the orange line  Also  pay attention to how price correlates to the P E ratio of 15 during times when the company s earnings are rising as well as when they are falling  I believe that if you spend a little time examining these graphs cognizant of how price reacts in accordance with the P E ratio of 15  you will gain incredible insight into how important a valuation reference it truly is  At the end of the day  my hope is that it will enhance your investing acumen 
The reader should also note that the honeydew green  white looking  line on the graph plots dividends  The area below this line represents the dividend payout ratio  The light green shaded area above the orange line indicates dividends after they ve been paid out of earnings 
4 Out of 108 Fairly Valued Dividend Champions
General Dynamics Corporation  NYSE GD 
The 15 P E ratio clearly represents sound valuation over time  The best time to have invested in General Dynamics was just after the Great Recession  However  it took patience to reap the ultimate rewards as price eventually moved back to a P E ratio of 15 

HCP Inc   NYSE HCP 
The price of this REIT has clearly followed a price to FFO of 15 over time  Periods of overvaluation and undervaluation are clearly revealed 

1st Source Corporation  NASDAQ SRCE 
With this example we see price following the P E ratio of 15 during periods of rising earnings and falling earnings  Once again  periods of overvaluation and undervaluation are clearly revealed 

First Financial Corp  NASDAQ THFF 
There are many times with this example where price deviates from the P E ratio of 15  However  it inevitably moves back into alignment and clearly tracks the P E ratio of 15 over the long 

32 Out of 242 Fairly Valued Dividend Contenders
Aaron s  Inc   NYSE AAN 
Aaron s doesn t provide much in the way of dividend yield even though it has a history of increasing its dividend each year  However  the correlation between its price and the P E ratio of 15 is clear and undeniable 

AmerisourseBergen Corporation  NYSE ABC 
Fast growing AmerisourseBergen is an exception to the 15 P E ratio fair valuation reference  Earnings growth averaging 16 6  per annum commands a P E ratio of 16 6  However  the earnings and price correlation at this slightly higher valuation is highly correlated 

Acme United Corp   NYSE ACU 
This company has only been paying a dividend since 2004  Although the relationship of price to the P E ratio of 15 is not as correlated  it is still relevant as a valuation reference  However  in this case it might be wise to lower the threshold to a lower P E ratio valuation reference 

American Financial Group Inc   NYSE AFG 
Although the P E ratio of 15 and price is not as correlated as many others  this example still establishes the 15 P E ratio as an upper limit valuation reference 

Ameriprise Financial  Inc   NYSE AMP 
After being spun off from American Express  NYSE AXP  in 2005  the P E ratio of 15 represents a profound valuation reference  Once again  periods of undervaluation are clearly revealed 

BancFirst Corporation  NASDAQ BANF 
This is a classic example of the relevance of the P E ratio of 15 as a valuation reference  Price clearly tracks earnings at that multiple  and periods of overvaluation and undervaluation are clearly revealed 

Best Buy Co   Inc   NYSE BBY 
This example clearly illustrates the danger of disregarding the P E ratio of 15 as a valuation reference  Many times in the past the market has placed extreme valuations on this stock  and each time the price promptly fell back into alignment with the P E ratio of 15 

Bunge Limited  NYSE BG 
The P E ratio of 15 as a valuation reference is highly correlated with this example  Investing when the P E ratio was above 15 has clearly been a mistake  However  earnings have been very cyclical over this timeframe 

Bar Harbor Bankshares  NYSE BHB 
Over time this company stock price has tracked earnings and correlated to a P E ratio of 15  However  investing in this stock when the P E ratio is below 15 was opportunistic 

Bank of Marin Bancorp  NASDAQ BMRC 
The relevance of the P E ratio of 15 could not be clearer then with this example 

BOK Financial Corporation  NASDAQ BOKF 
Being only willing to invest in this company with a P E ratio was 15 or lower would have served you well 

Cardinal Health  Inc   NYSE CAH 
Here we see an excellent example of how violating the P E ratio of 15 as a valuation reference can be damaging to performance  Long periods of underperformance would have resulted from investing in the stock at P E ratios above 15 

Cummins Inc  NYSE CMI 
The 15 P E ratio has been an important valuation reference for this cyclical  Reviewing the earnings and price history suggests that it seems prudent to invest in this cyclical at a P E below this 15 threshold 

Crane Co  NYSE CR 
This is an excellent example of the P E 15 as a rational valuation reference  There are numerous short periods when the price rises above and below this valuation reference  but promptly returns 

CSX Corp  NASDAQ CSX 
Once again  another classic example of the P E ratio of 15 as a sound valuation guide  Investing at a higher valuation always led to a short term  and for the most part  a long term mistake 

Brinker International Inc  NYSE EAT 
In this example it is stunning how often the P E ratio has risen above 15 many times in the past  and even more stunning how quickly price returns to P E 15  Over the long run price follows the orange P E 15 line 

FedEx Corporation  NYSE FDX 
With this example the market has had a penchant for applying a valuation above the P E 15 line  Nevertheless  adhering to the 15 P E valuation reference would have enhanced long term returns 

The First of Long Island Corporation  NASDAQ FLIC 
Investing in this regional bank at a P E of 15 or below has clearly been a sound decision  The price and 15 P E correlation has been high 

Harris Corporation  NYSE HRS 
The 15 P E valuation reference would have kept you out of this example for many years  However  in the long run it would have proved prudent 

International Business Machine  IBM  NYSE IBM  
Adhering to the 15 P E valuation reference during the tech bubble would have avoided years of poor performance as price moved into alignment  Additionally  we see a clear relationship of the price to earnings correlation in recent years  The rising dividend has been the story in recent years 

Norfolk Southern Corp  NYSE NSC 
The importance of the relevance of the 15 P E ratio as a valuation reference could not be more clear than with this example  The earnings and price correlation at that valuation is high 

Bank of the Ozarks Inc  NASDAQ OZRK 
With earnings growth averaging above 15   a P E ratio equal to the growth rate was a sound valuation reference with this example  The P E ratio 15 valuation reference is a strong guide for average companies  However  it is rational to pay a higher valuation for higher growing businesses 

Prosperity Bancshares Inc  NYSE PB 
Here is another example where the fair value reference P E Ratio of 15 would serve investors well  Clearly  investing in this regional bank when the valuation was higher than that typically led to poor performance  However  in the long run  price tracked the P E ratio 15 

Polaris Industries Inc  NYSE PII 
In this example  we see the price tracking the P E ratio of 15 until earnings dramatically accelerated starting in 2010  For the next several years  the company commanded a higher P E ratio than 15  However  once earnings flattened  the price quickly moved back to the P E ratio 15 valuation reference 

Perrigo Company  NYSE PRGO 
This is a very interesting example where price tracked the P E ratio of 15 until earnings began accelerating in 2008  For several years this company has traded at a much higher P E ratio  For clarity  I will be providing an additional graph for this timeframe 

With this shorter timeframe  we see an example of stock price trading at a P E ratio equal to its growth rate of 25 6  When earnings growth is above 15   a P E ratio higher than 15 is justified due to the compounding high growth represents  However  note what happened to stock price when the earnings growth began to slow down 

QUALCOMM Inc  NASDAQ QCOM 
This example illustrates the danger of investing in a stock when its P E ratio is above 15  Even though the company s earnings and dividend growth were strong  the stock price had nowhere to go but sideways for many years 

Ryder System Inc  NYSE R  
This example clearly illustrates the relevance of the P E ratio of 15 as a valuation reference  However  it also illustrates what can happen when earnings are falling  The fair valuation reference P E ratio of 15 is very relevant as long as the company continues to grow earnings in the future 

Regal Beloit Corporation  NYSE RBC 
Once again we see a company s stock price tracking a P E ratio of 15 over the long run  This principle applied even though earnings were very cyclical 

Shire  NASDAQ SHPG 
This is another example where a P E ratio above 15 is rational because earnings growth averaged more than 15  per annum  However  the long term relationship between price and earnings as a valuation reference remains profound 

United Technologies Corporation  NYSE UTX 
Although the market shows a history of placing a premium valuation on this blue chip dividend growth stock  the P E ratio of 15 still has relevance  Patiently waiting to invest in this stock when its P E ratio was 15 or lower would produce better returns at lower levels of risk 

Verizon Communications Inc  NYSE VZ 
With this example we see the correlation of price to a P E ratio of 15 even during a long stretch of weak earnings growth  The point here is that the P E ratio of 15 is a valuation reference  but it does not automatically ensure good returns  Earnings growth has to follow 

Williams Sonoma Inc  NYSE WSM 
Here we see another example where a high rate of earnings growth justifies a higher P E ratio than 15  In this case  fair value was equal to the company s growth rate of 24 8   However  I have also added a second shorter graph for this example to illustrate how a P E ratio of 15 becomes relevant when earnings growth slows 

Since earnings growth only averaged 10 6  since 2011  the 15 P E ratio fair valuation reference became extremely relevant  Higher P E ratios eventually gave way to sound valuation 

Summary and Conclusions
If you spent time reviewing the graphs in this article it should now be clear to you how relevant the P E ratio of 15 truly is as a valuation reference  However  you should also recognize the importance of the word  reference  in that statement  Additionally  you should now immediately understand that if you invest in a company when its P E ratio is higher than 15  you are paying a high price for the company s earnings power 
Based on the mathematics behind this valuation reference  I believe it is only rational to pay a higher P E ratio when you are absolutely confident that the company s future earnings growth will be strong  I refer to this as earnings growth yield  If future earnings growth turns out to be high  then you will be purchasing future earnings at a reasonable valuation  On the other hand  if earnings growth is expected to be single digits  I contend that paying any P E ratio above 15 is too high a price to pay  You can still make money doing this  but you will make less and take on more risk to earn those lower returns  This includes receiving less dividend income as well 
Finally  there are other factors to consider before actually making an investment in a stock even when the P E ratio is 15 or lower  For example  if earnings growth is expected to fall  then a current P E ratio of 15 may actually be too high of a high valuation  There are also many other fundamental metrics that should be considered  Nevertheless  I believe that investors should recognize and keep the mathematics behind a P E ratio of 15 in the forefront of the minds  But there is one thing that I feel certain about  and that is that a P E ratio of 15 is far from an overly simplistic valuation reference

6270,227785,BMRC,How To Remain Solvent Longer Than The Market Is Irrational ,opinion,I believe it is extremely important that investors focus on the value of what they own more than they do on the day to day machinations of price volatility  However  I also believe  and even recognize  that very few investors are capable of ignoring volatile stock price movements  When the price of a stock that they own is rising or falling  especially when the swings are large and or violent  it is very difficult for people to maintain a steady head and hand  Instead  emotions take over reason which often cause otherwise rational investors to make irrational decisions  My last article dealt with how to think about stock prices in today s volatile markets  and can be  The above article was well received by readers  and generated many lively comments and questions  One comment question in particular that attracted my attention was also the inspiration to offer this follow up regarding how to think about stock prices  I have cleaned up the comment and paraphrased it as follows   In your Dividend Growth articles  it s always been highlighted that certain premium dividend stocks often seem to be fully or slightly overvalued  except in the case of a severe financial crisis  e g  Kimberly Clark  KMB   Coca Cola  KO   Walmart  WMT   and then there are certain stocks which often seem to be chronically undervalued by the market  for years and years at a time  take Teva  TEVA   for instance  Is there a strategy to deal with buying these outliers that takes this mispricing into account  I m wondering how to navigate chronic under and overvaluation     The above comment led me to realize that it s one thing to accept the idea that stock markets can be irrational at times and misprice companies  over or under  however  it s another thing altogether to develop and follow a strategy that allows an investor to exploit other people s folly  First of all  in order to do this successfully  investors have to be able to discern and differentiate between times when the market is behaving rationally and when it is not  My point being  that there are times when wild price swings are rational  and of course times when they are not  Therefore  it is implicit that the correct strategy be predicated on distinguishing between the times when price behavior is rational and when it is not  To my way of thinking  that was the essence of the question that the reader was asking in the above comment question  Therefore  I offer this article to illuminate upon the types of behavior and research required to ensure as best you can  that the proper strategy and actions are being implemented  At this point  I would like to interject that the correct strategy regarding navigating  chronic  overvaluation and or undervaluation must be based on the proper determination and realization that overvaluation or undervaluation actually exists  This can only be accomplished when the investor is focused on the business first and foremost  and then  and only then  on stock price  The point I m driving at here is that stock prices are often  as I pointed out in my previous article  pathological liars  They can be misleading and often are deceiving  thereby generating extreme emotional responses  It s hard to have confidence in your company when its market price is falling precipitously  Moreover  and equally as dangerous  it is very easy to become complacent and overconfident about a business when stock price is on an upward tear  On the other hand  I believe it is much easier to determine the intrinsic value of a business  than it is to attempt to forecast where its price may go in the short run  As I did in my previous article  I will turn to the wisdom of legendary investors to illustrate my points  The following quote by Martin J  Whitman supports my last statement   I remain impressed with how much easier it is for us  and everybody else who has a modicum of training  to determine what a business is worth  and what the dynamics of the business might be  compared with estimating the prices at which a non arbitrage security will sell in near term markets   Martin J  Whitman  Chairman of the Board  Third Avenue Value Fund Navigating Overvaluation Procter   Gamble  PG    A Quality Premium Form of Overvaluation When dealing with overvaluation  there many types and degrees that can occur  For example  certain blue chip companies can typically be awarded what I call a quality premium by the market  In many ways  I consider this type of overvaluation to be one of the most difficult to navigate  First of all  because the overvaluation is chronic  it is less obvious  and therefore  more difficult to ascertain or judge  But more importantly  it is up to each individual investor as to whether or not they would ever be willing to pay the premium the market typically is asking in order to own the security  A classic case in point is the blue chip dividend growth stock Procter   Gamble  Procter   Gamble has paid a dividend for 122 consecutive years since its incorporation in 1890  and has increased its dividend for 56 consecutive years  On this basis  it is easy to see why the market historically affords the company a premium valuation  Quality and consistency  the likes of which that Procter   Gamble has achieved and delivered for shareholders  is very rare  The following FAST Graphs  review of Procter   Gamble for the years 1997   2007 illustrates the quality premium that the market has typically applied as referenced in the above paragraph  I chose this time frame for two reasons  First of all  it clearly shows typical premium pricing by the market  and includes the infamous irrational exuberant period that ended in 2000  Therefore  it illustrates two types of overvaluation  the normal quality premium and a period where overvaluation becomes extreme  The second reason I chose this time frame was because it shows Procter   Gamble up to  but just before the great recession of 2008  The orange line on the graph plots earnings per share and represents a PE ratio of 15 which would typically be applied to a company growing at approximately 10  per annum like Procter   Gamble has  The blue line on the graph represents the normal PE ratio of 22 2  the quality premium valuation  that the market was typically capitalizing Procter   Gamble shares at  Therefore  it is clear from this graph that if you were ever to own Procter   Gamble during this time  you had to be willing to pay the premium valuation as the company s price never touched its theoretical fair value  the orange line  When you review the performance associated with the above historical time frame where Procter   Gamble was always priced at a premium  you discover that the shareholder rewards were very attractive  Procter   Gamble delivered cumulative total dividends that would have exceeded the general market as measured by the S P 500  and capital appreciation   2729 02 for Procter   Gamble versus  1982 29 for the S P 500  was also significantly above average Consequently  even though you were forced to pay this premium valuation in order to own this blue chip  the rewards were clearly worth it  However  at the same time you should also have been aware that you were taking a greater risk than the company s valuation  based on its cash flows  warranted  In theory  the quality of the company compensated you for the extra risk you took  On the other hand  it is up to the individual investor s own judgment as to whether or not they were willing to take this overvaluation risk  Personally  I chose not to When evaluating overvaluation  the individual investor needs to always be aware that even though the market may not always be efficient  it always has a penchant for seeking efficiency  Therefore  the reality that a reversion to the mean could occur at any time should be at the forefront of their mind  It s one thing to be willing to pay a premium valuation for a quality blue chip like Procter   Gamble  however  it s an entirely different matter to complacently believe that mispricing would never be corrected  It s much smarter and prudent to recognize that it could occur at any time  and therefore be prepared when  and if  it does This next earnings and price correlated graph that brings us up to current time on Procter   Gamble shows that a reversion to the mean did  in fact  occur during the great recession of 2008  Here we see that the price of Procter   Gamble shares did drop down to  and then slightly below  the orange earnings justified valuation line  orange circle on the graph   Interestingly  over the next three years or so  with investor sentiment negatively charged by the great recession  the quality premium for Procter   Gamble shares was gone  Instead  price tracked earnings very closely up to the spring of 2012  wherein the price has once again begun moving towards its typical premium valuation  the blue normal PE line  The title of this article was written in reference to a popular quote about the market that states  the market can remain irrational  longer than you can remain solvent   However  I received a comment in my previous article from which I modified this quote to state as follows   Mr  Market can be irrational longer than your patience threshold can endure  As another reader pointed out  the original quote referred to those who were investing using leverage  When money is borrowed  it is quite possible that the market can be irrational longer than you can be solvent  In contrast  if you invest more prudently without leverage  I believe that market irrational behavior can be waited out  However  there must be an intelligent framework supporting your patience  I believe that intelligent framework would be an understanding of the intrinsic value of the business behind the stock  Therefore  a strategy for dealing with overvaluation is to focus more on the business  the orange line on these graphs  and less on the stock  and make your investment decisions accordingly  In other words  if you must own Procter   Gamble  then you must be willing to accept the fact that the market likes to put a premium valuation on the stock  On the other hand  don t fall asleep believing that this can never change  as evidenced by the following graph The following performance graph associated with the above earnings and price correlated graph where Procter   Gamble s share price did revert to the mean provides an interesting perspective  As long as shareholders didn t panic and sell when the recession hit  their long term performance would have still been intact  Moreover  for the wise and levelheaded dividend growth investor  they continued to receive a raise in pay each year to reward them for their patience Cisco Systems Inc   CSCO    Dealing with Extreme and Dangerous OvervaluationThe most insidious form of overvaluation is when Mr  Market is truly being totally irrational  In the case with Procter   Gamble above  Mr  Market was quasi rationally applying a premium valuation to a blue chip  However  during the infamous irrational exuberant period  Mr  Market brought us a quintessential example of a bubble in technology stocks  Great tech stocks  such as Cisco Systems Inc   became so irrationally overvalued as to be dangerous Dealing with this situation is a far cry different than dealing with a premium valuation on a blue chip  For starters  the correction can be much swifter and severe due to the extreme nature of the mispricing  Moreover  the effect of the correction can last for a significantly longer time  Cisco Systems has never  and may never recover from its peak price in calendar year 2000 Since a picture is worth 1000 words  let s look at how ridiculously overpriced Cisco really became during this time  Cisco s PE ratio became so astronomically high that common sense dictated that there could be no possible way that future earnings and cash flows could support it  Consequently  as quickly as the shares rose  their imminent fall was just as dramatic and swift Consequently  I believe that dealing with dangerous overvaluation must imply a different approach and behavior  First and foremost  an investor s first step should be to protect and preserve  Therefore  dangerous overvaluation implies a selling strategy  Depending on the investor s tolerance for risk and their emotional capacity  will determine whether an outright sale should occur  or perhaps a methodical unwinding of the position The following earnings and price correlated FAST Graphs  on Cisco Systems Inc  is marked with a green dot representing a theoretical purchase when the company s shares were in value  The red dots represent various theoretical sells  This is presented to illustrate potential strategies that an investor could utilize when dealing with extreme overvaluation For example  a prudent  but perhaps more aggressive  investor could have sold one fourth of their original position as the stock went on its meteoric advance  Therefore  in the following example  they would have locked in a significant profit after the first sell  Consequently  each subsequent sell was made while playing with so called house money  unrealized gains  A second strategy would have been to simply sell out at the first level where the investor felt that the stock could become dangerously overvalued  Note in the example below that even if this occurred on the first red dot  a significant profit would have been harvested  Moreover  even though a lot of money would have been left on the table over the short run  this still represented a good long term decision  However  the primary point is that strategies for dealing with even extreme overvaluation must ultimately be based on each individual investor s own judgment and risk tolerances Navigating UndervaluationStock prices can be all over the place  and often for no good reason  On the other hand  the fundamentals underpinning a solid business are much easier and therefore reliable to gauge  Moreover  business results tend to be more consistent than the often whimsical up and down and jagged movements seen in the typical stock price chart  But as Marty Whitman points out in this next quote  the trick is to determine the difference between the destruction of the business model versus a temporary drop in its price  Unrealized Market Depreciation occurs when the market price of a publicly traded security declines  Permanent impairment of Capital occurs when the Fundamental values of a business are dissipated with the consequent long term adverse consequences   Martin J  Whitman  Chairman of the Board  Third Avenue Value Fund I fervently believe that knowledge is power  and I further believe that knowledge is the greatest antidote against making foolish mistakes  For added color on this important principle  let s turn to Warren Buffett and see what he has to say about navigating the market s mispricing  Great investment opportunities come around when excellent companies are surrounded by unusual circumstances that cause the stock to be misappraised  It s only when the tide goes out that you learn who s been swimming naked   Warren Buffett In order to correctly ascertain undervaluation  the first step is recognizing that just because the price of a given stock drops  does not mean that the stock is undervalued  Some price drops are justified  and others are not  More simply stated  not all price drops are the same  and it s implicit that the prudent investor makes this distinction for them to expect their investments to be successful Once again  I will turn to earnings and price correlated graphs to illustrate the veracity of this point  My goal is to establish that if prices are dropping while business results are holding up  a bargain is created  On the other hand  if prices are dropping along with business results  then the price drop is not only justified but perhaps even permanent During the great recession of 2008  financial stocks were the most devastated sector in the market place  The following earnings and price correlated graph on Aflac  AFL  up through year end 2009 shows that stock price fell significantly beyond the earnings drop  Therefore  Aflac s stock price recovered back to its earnings justified level rather quickly  red circle on the graph  However  when we bring the Aflac graph back to current time  below   we see that price again became undervalued due to an earnings drop in 2011  This drop was primarily a function of the company de risking their balance sheet in order to better prepare themselves for weak economic times  Nevertheless  the market reacted strongly once again  and Aflac shares have remained under their earnings justified valuation ever since The question that stimulated this article was essentially how long can  or should  an investor wait for an undervalued  and therefore  underperforming stock to regain its luster  My simple answer would be that as long as the company s earnings are justifying a higher price  then I would be willing to wait as long as it takes  Personally  I am confident that the stock will inevitably reach its fair value  it s only a matter of time  As I did in my last article  I will once again repeat one of my favorite Peter Lynch quotes  You can see the importance of earnings on any chart that has an earnings line running alongside the stock price  On chart after chart the two lines will move in tandem  or if the stock price strays away from the earnings line  sooner or later it will come back to the earnings   Peter Lynch    One Up On Wall Street In order to be as clear as I can on my position on undervaluation  the most critical step is determining that undervaluation does  in fact  exist  The only way I feel that can be done is when you measure stock price against its earnings justified valuation  In other words  if earnings justify a higher value  then one of the bargains that Warren Buffett talks about above is being manifest  On the other hand  if both stock price and earnings are falling  then I feel the appropriate action is to sell regardless of price  The following graphic on Citigroup  C  another famous financial stock  represents a clear example of what I m referring to Contrast Citigroup with a regional bank such as the Bank of Marin  BMRC  below and we see a precipitous drop in stock price during the great recession while earnings held up nicely  Therefore  in this example the stock price recovered quickly and has continued achieving new highs Summary and ConclusionThe following graphic on Teva Pharmaceuticals  TEVA  represents an example of a company that I believe Mr  Market is currently mispricing  Since I believe that this company s earnings  future is well defined and bright  I would be adding to my position as much as I could  as long as the market kept giving me the opportunity  I trust the orange line on the graph much more than I trust the black line  Warren Buffett taught me this when he said Only those who will be sellers of equities in the near future should be happy at seeing stocks rise  Prospective purchasers should much prefer sinking prices   Warren Buffett Therefore  I submit that the simple answer to the question how you navigate overvaluation or undervaluation is fundamentally based on whether you trust fundamentals or not  I believe that as long as earnings are solid it makes sense to hold on  and perhaps even more sense to add to your position  I never let the market dictate my behavior  instead I take my cue from what I believe the intrinsic value of the business is  based on deep research  Once again I ll turn to Peter Lynch and share his sage words on this subject  What makes stocks valuable in the long run isn t the market  It s the profitability of the shares in the companies you own  As corporate profits increase  corporations become more valuable and sooner or later  their shares will sell for a higher price   Peter Lynch  Worth Magazine  September 1995 I am interested in owning stable and growing businesses that can be purchased at sound and attractive valuations  I m never one to be willing to pay more than I believe the stock is worth  but on the other hand  it s hard to argue with a quality premium valuation awared to Procter   Gamble  as was illustrated previously in this article  Personally  I did not invest in Procter   Gamble until the price came down to the orange line  This took well more than a decade to occur  However  it was worth the wait So at the end of the day  my advice is that investors can  and should  trust a solid business and always hold the day to day price volatility with a great deal of mistrust  With that said  the best strategy is to conduct comprehensive due diligence with the goal of recognizing anomalous pricing when it occurs  This is how you exploit others  folly and find bargains to buy and overpriced businesses to sell Disclosure   Long PG  CSCO

6273,227788,BMRC,Should Value Investors Pick Bank Of Marin Bancorp  BMRC  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Bank of Marin Bancorp   NASDAQ BMRC   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Bank of Marin Bancorp has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 20 3  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares somewhat favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 21 2  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Bank of Marin Bancorp s current PE ratio above its midpoint over the past five years However  the stock s PE also compares unfavorably with the industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 19 8  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively overvalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Bank of Marin Bancorp has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 21  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Bank of Marin Bancorp s stock in the near term too  PEG RatioWhile earnings are certainly important  it is essential to know how much you are paying for the growth of earnings as well  One can easily do that with the PEG ratio  ratio of the P E to the expected future earnings growth rate  The PEG ratio gives a more complete picture of the valuation of a stock than the P E ratio The company s PEG ratio stands at just 1 9  compared with the industry average of 2  This suggests a slight undervalued trading relative to its earnings growth potential right now Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Bank of Marin Bancorp currently has a Value Style Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes BMRC a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 14 7  which is slightly better than the industry average of 15 8  Clearly  BMRC is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Bank of Marin Bancorp might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of F and a Momentum score of A  This gives BMRC a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of C   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the current year consensus estimate has risen 0 3  in the past month  while the next year estimate has also increased 0 3   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Bank of Marin Bancorp Price and Consensus   The stock holds a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   which indicates expectations of in line performance from the company in the near term  However  Bank of Marin Bancorp is enjoying bullish analyst sentiment  as indicated by the positive estimate revisions  and this works in the company s favor Bottom LineBank of Marin Bancorp is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  a decent industry rank  Top 43  out of more than 250 industries  further supports the growth potential of the stock   In fact  over the past three months  the industry has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below  So  it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company s prospects  as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pick More Stock News  This Is Bigger than the iPhone                    It could become the mother of all technological

Good morning and welcome to the call  Bank of Marin full year 2019 results reflect the successful execution of our proven relationship banking model  We continue to deliver consistent loan growth  a low cost deposit base and exceptional credit quality Let s start with our 2019 highlights  Net income for the full year was a record  34 2 million  which represented a return on assets of 1 34  and return on equity of 10 49   Diluted earnings per share were  2 48  up 6 4   We grew our loans by  79 4 million or 4 5  based on a record year of originations  with contributions across our footprint  Deposits grew  161 7 million for the year to  2 3 billion  Non interest bearing deposits increased  62 8 million in 2019  and comprised 48  of total deposits at year end  For the year  our cost of deposits remained very low at 20 basis points  Non accrual loans represented just 0 01  of total loans at year end  reflecting our unwavering focus on credit quality In 2019  we successfully executed on the organic growth initiatives that we discussed at the start of the year  We opened a new loan production office in Walnut Creek and strengthen our presence in San Francisco by bringing in well established commercial banking lenders  We made significant progress in staffing across our markets that should position us well for continued loan growth and market share gains in 2020  With favorable outlook on top of our strong 2019 performance  our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of  0 23 per share on January 24  2020  an increase of  0 02 per share  This represents the 59th consecutive quarterly dividend paid by Bank of Marin Bancorp Our  25 million stock repurchase program expires February 28  2020  We repurchased 42 349 shares totaling  1 9 million in the fourth quarter and 356 000 shares  totaling  15 million over the year 2019  With the current share repurchase program nearing exploration  Bancorp s Board of Directors approved a new repurchase program on January 24 of up to  25 million in Bancorp s common stock  The new program will expire February 28  2022 Now let me turn it over to Tani for additional insight on our financial results Tani Girton    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThank you  Russ  Good morning  everyone  As Russ stated  we built solid momentum through 2019  producing net income of  34 2 million for the year  This marked a 5  increase over 2018 and continued Bank of Marin s long term upward earnings trend  Over the past five years  we ve produced an average earnings growth rate of more than 10   due to the successful execution of our two pronged growth strategy  First and foremost is consistent organic growth  We amplified that growth by effectively integrating and building on strategic acquisitions  as we have done with the Charter Oak Bank  Bank of Alameda  and Bank of Napa acquisition Year over year net interest income grew  4 2 million or 4 5  driven by higher loan balances and yields  The impact of higher interest bearing deposit balances and rates was mitigated by the early redemption of subordinated debt in 2018  Non interest income declined  1 million from 2018  which included a  956 000 gain on the sale of Visa Class B shares and higher fees on deposits sold to third party networks in 2018  In 2019  a  562 000 payment on bank owned life insurance policies was partially offset by expenses on new policies purchased Notably  non interest expense of  58 million was down from 2018  while salaries increased 7 5  year over year primarily driven by hiring for our commercial banking offices  our data processing  professional services and health insurance costs declined due to the renegotiation of contracts  There were no acquisition related expenses in 2019  an FDIC insurance premium payments were not required in the last two quarters of the year as the deposit insurance fund exceeded its billing threshold  The full year 2019 efficiency ratio of 55 3  declined from 57 3  in 2018  demonstrating our commitment to careful expense management that is balanced with strategic investments in talent  and technology Now turning to our fourth quarter results  Net income was  9 1 million in the quarter compared to  9 4 million in the third quarter  There were three events in the third quarter that led to higher net income  a  388 000 interest recovery on a land development loan  a  562 000 benefit on bank owned life insurance and a  327 000 tax adjustment related to the true up of our deferred tax liability  Diluted earnings per share were  0 66 in the fourth quarter compared to  0 69 in both the prior quarter and the same quarter a year ago  after adjusting for the November 27  2018 stock split  Our return on assets was 1 37  and return on equity was 10 75  Net interest income was fairly stable quarter over quarter as growing loan balances mostly offset declines in yields related to federal reserve interest rate reductions and the third quarter interest recovery  In line with strong loan growth  we recorded a  500 000 loan loss provision in the fourth quarter compared to  400 000 in the third quarter of 2019 and no provision in the fourth quarter of 2018 Non interest expense of  13 3 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 was down from  14 2 million in the prior quarter and  13 7 million in the same quarter a year ago  The decline from the third quarter was mostly due to an incentive bonus adjustment and higher deferred loan origination costs related to a higher volume of new loans  Most of the decline from the fourth quarter of 2018 was due to lower data processing costs and the absence of FDIC insurance premium payment  Disciplined expense control enabled the bank to reduce its efficiency ratio to 50 8  in the fourth quarter of 2019 from 52 8  in the prior quarter and 51 3  in the fourth quarter last year I d now like to discuss the new accounting standard related to credit losses  commonly known as CECL  This went into effect on January 1  2020 and had no impact on our 2019 results  Our primary credit loss methodology will utilize a discounted  Phonetic  cash flow approach that considers the probability of default and loss given default  Parallel testing occurred throughout 2019 and we estimate that our implementation of CECL will result in an increase of 5  to 15  of our December 31  2019 allowance for loan losses  which will reduce retained earnings net of tax In closing  we are very pleased with our 2019 results and all of the work accomplished during the year that positions our teams to build off this great success as we move forward in 2020 Now Russ would like to share some closing comments Russell A  Colombo    President and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Tani  The Bank celebrated its 30th anniversary on January 23  We re very proud of the progress we ve made and the success we ve had over the last three decades  We have built one of the strongest and lowest cost deposit franchises in the country  with close to 50  of funds in demand deposit accounts  That s a result of a true commitment to our relationship banking model  Our focus on sound underwriting and comprehensive understanding of our clients and markets produces a high quality loan portfolio with industry leading credit metrics  rarely having to deal with problem loans  allows us to focus on attracting and serving customers Our steady and safe loan growth paired with our low cost deposit base drives continued growth in the earnings per share  With an efficiency ratio at 55 3  for the year  it s clear that we manage expenses exceptionally well  We spend wisely  when it can help us provide more services to our customers and grow our market share  This is evidenced by the recent hires I noted in Walnut Creek and San Francisco  We are always mindful of expenses  For example  we review all contracts and leases upon renewal and often find opportunities to drive efficiencies and reduce costs Looking ahead  we believe we are well positioned for growth in 2020  We serve one of the most economically vibrant regions in the country  We have a strong technology sector as a foundation and the Bay Area is growing and economically diverse  Unemployment across our markets is very low  Here  in Marin County  it s just about 2   which is basically full employment  This drives ongoing economic activity and opportunities for loan growth  There is substantial momentum for local businesses and for the bank  And we are confident  we can further build on this in 2020 We also feel we are well positioned to grow our presence in our existing markets  And to consider expansion into new markets with de novo offices or acquisitions  Our consistently strong performance  coupled with our proven history  give us a strong position to acquire other community banks  While acquisitions are a very important part of our long term strategy  we take a disciplined and selective approach to evaluating opportunities  All in all  I m very excited about the future of this bank in 2020 and across the next 30 years Thank you for your time this morning  And now we will open it up to answer your questions

and Chief Financial OfficerGood morning Jeff Rulis    D A  Davidson    AnalystThe first one is on expenses and I guess you had a year over year decline and I think Tani kind of outlined a bunch of the    some of the levers to pull  You had some contract negotiations  obviously  the FDIC expense line item in a true up on the salaries in the fourth quarter  So declined year over year moderately I guess  expectations as you invest in the business for  20  First question is  expectations for broader expenses in  20  And then  Tani  if you could provide detail on the FDIC expense early part of the year  if we expect to normalize those going forward  Thanks Tani Girton    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSure  Just to clarify  I think you mentioned a true up on salaries  It wasn t really a true up on salaries  We ve just brought in some new hires in our commercial banking area  which is what drove our salary lines up a little bit  And in terms of going forward  I think we continue to look at any contracts that come up for renegotiation  To the extent that we had vacancies in 2019  a lot of those vacancies have been filled  And so  if we have a lower vacancy rate in 2019  I mean  in 2020 than we did in 2019 plus with our new hires  you could see a lift in salary expense  again that s consistent with the fourth quarter levels And then finally  on the FDIC premium  as long as that    the insurance fund remains above its threshold  we won t have to pay those insurance premiums and it has been trending up  So our expectation is that it is likely that at least for the first quarter or two  we may not have to pay that  but there is no telling because there are a lot of bank results that go into producing that number and if something happens then obviously all that s    are off  So  but we have had two quarters and we do notice that the insurance fund is increasing in value  so that    if that trend continues  then we will probably continue to get relief Jeff Rulis    D A  Davidson    AnalystOkay  And Tani  if I could just circle back then on the comp line that really does seem to be kind of the    it was pretty front end loaded in 2019  I assume on hires and as that sort of transition lower throughout the year  So if I read you right  I mean  you ll continue to invest in finding new folks  but is there a    I mean you were kind of  1 5 million range on that salaries and benefits  is there a quarterly number that you think you    maybe 4Q  does that seem artificially low at 7   8   Any further color there Tani Girton    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerNo  I don t think so  Because we actually    our staffing levels were pretty good in the fourth quarter  And what happened in 2003 is that we had a severance payment and that bumped salaries up in the third quarter Jeff Rulis    D A  Davidson    AnalystOkay  And last one is just a question broader on growth  4 5  loan growth  7 5  roughly on deposits  Looking at payoff activity and the overall environment  Russ sounds like you re pretty positive on origination activity  Just thoughts on  20  in general  is that  that anything that could be changing  what you re hearing out in the market from a demand side Russell A  Colombo    President and Chief Executive OfficerNo  It s pretty consistent and the good news for us is that we have staffed up these offices and we re really pretty much full employment  I think we may be have one opening in all of commercial banking right now which is fantastic  And that when you hire  there is a little bit of a lag period  But you should see better    greater production going forward  We had great production in 2019  and I m very confident about 2020 And one of the things  I just wanted to mention to the salaries in the fourth    you said that    you thought the salaries are front loaded  They were more back loaded frankly  because we hired a lot of those people kind of near the end of the year  And the fourth quarter typically  we have an accrual of bonuses that goes on through the year and if we think we re going to be over accrued then we do reverse them  And so there was some accrual reversal in the fourth quarter which happens every year  So that fourth quarter is kind of a weird number  probably got most of the salaries  but it does have an accrual reversal in the future and that s what it was  But tell you  as I look forward to the next year  I m pretty    feel pretty good about the opportunities for growth in commercial banking Jeff Rulis    D A  Davidson    AnalystOkay  Thank you OperatorThank you  We do have another question from the line of Matthew Clark with Piper Sandler  Please go ahead  Your line is open Matthew Clark    Piper Sandler    AnalystHi  Good morning Tani Girton    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerGood morning Matthew Clark    Piper Sandler    AnalystOn the comp line  can you maybe quantify how much the lower accrual was and how much FAS 91 impacted that  7 8 million Tani Girton    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerFAS 91  I ll have to dig a little bit  for the bonus accrual was about  500 000 reduction Matthew Clark    Piper Sandler    AnalystOkay  And then on the pipeline can you speak to    I guess how that pipeline looks going into 1Q here maybe year over year  Just to give us a sense for how that may have changed Russell A  Colombo    President and Chief Executive OfficerThere is two components to that  There is the existing staff and there is people that we just brought in  So we feel pretty good about it  We obviously    when you have a really good fourth quarter  a lot of work that you ve been doing during the year translates into business  and so then you do have a reduction in your pipeline first quarter and so and it takes time to build that back up  So while I don t think it s a big impact  it s probably off a little bit just because we booked everything that we are working on  So that being said  I m very confident about the people that we have and now with our    we ve staffed up San Francisco and Santa Rosa and Walnut Creek  And so I feel pretty good about the opportunities for growth of our commercial loan portfolio Matthew Clark    Piper Sandler    AnalystOkay  And then just on loan yields  they were down a little bit here  I know part of that was from the recoveries  So difficult comparison relative to the third quarter  But still  even adjusting for that  there was still some pressure  Can you give us a sense for where kind of new money yields are coming on the books and what might be running off in terms of yield Russell A  Colombo    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Okay  Yeah  So the new    kind of  the new loans that are coming on around the average    around those new loans is about 4 3     4 3   whereas the existing portfolio is probably at 4 8   4 9   So you re seeing definitely a lots of pressure coming down on the loan yields  That being said  I think you ll see that across the industry Matthew Clark    Piper Sandler    AnalystOkay  And then just any update on M A in terms of conversations or opportunities out there for you Russell A  Colombo    President and Chief Executive OfficerWe keep talking to people  The key problem is  as we always say  a bank is sold  they re not bought  There s not a lot of banks left in the Bay area  So as I mentioned  I think in my comments  we re looking at not only necessarily M A in the Bay Area  but we might look at contiguous markets  but there s nothing new to this part at this point  My job is to talk to other banks and I continue talking  but nothing new at this point Matthew Clark    Piper Sandler    AnalystOkay  Thank you Tani Girton    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerMatthew  this is Tani  I dug out the deferred loan origination cost for the fourth quarter that was roughly  900 000 and that was up about  100 000 from the third quarter Matthew Clark    Piper Sandler    AnalystGreat  Thanks OperatorThank you   Operator Instructions  Our next question is from the line of Jackie Bohlen with KBW  Please go ahead  Your line is open Jackie Bohlen    KBW    AnalystHi  Good morning Tani Girton    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerGood morning Russell A  Colombo    President and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  Jackie Jackie Bohlen    KBW    AnalystI would be remiss  if I didn t start us off with a compensation question  And just one quick one  Tani  I have in my notes that payroll taxes  usual    and other seasonal items  usually increase compensation by about  1 million between 4Q and 1Q  Is that still the run rate you re expecting Tani Girton    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerIt might be a little bit higher  just given the higher level of salaries in general  But I think that we do get a pretty big bump in payroll taxes as well as in 401 k  match in the first quarter  So those expenses will go up Jackie Bohlen    KBW    AnalystOkay  Thank you  And then lastly  you talked about new contiguous markets from both de novo and M A perspective  And I have kind of a two pronged question here  First off  what would you can consider to be attractive contiguous market  And secondly  if M A doesn t happen in that way  would you look to do de novo in those markets Russell A  Colombo    President and Chief Executive OfficerSo the contiguous markets  certainly we re not in the South Bay  we re not    we were not really other    we re not any farther south than Oakland  Alameda and the East Bay  So there is markets    they were really not    I mean on the Peninsula  we have an office  San Francisco  we have nothing from San Francisco South  So there is a number of contiguous markets for you that we would consider if something came up for either M A or for de novo offices And if we don t    if there s not M A  then we will continue on the growth of just organic growth and we ve been able to see good    we ve been able to attract good people in all of our markets and that will translate into business and if we can    if we don t buy anything and we are doing just fine  And we re showing nice loan growth  almost 5  on the loan side  7  on the deposit side  Those are good numbers and given the market  I think that    and our margins while they re down a little bit  still continue to be good  I m pretty  pretty confident about the future regardless of whether we have M A or not Jackie Bohlen    KBW    AnalystOkay  And given the high quality of your brand  do you get bankers or teams of bankers from some of the markets you re looking at that inquire about coming to work for you Russell A  Colombo    President and Chief Executive OfficerI m not sure that people are just calling us to come work for us  It s more an outreach  We have a program where we have identified in all of our markets  it s really part of the branch managers  jobs as well as the regional manager and the commercial banking side s job to identify the top markets and the top bankers in their markets  And so just like having a loan portfolio  we have a banker ports    banker pipeline and so we know    our job is to get to know those people and if there are opportunities then we know who to reach out to  And that s when you have a need  it s better to be able to go to those people directly and that you ve identified as good as opposed to calling up a search firm to help us  So that s a strategic initiative we have just to make sure we know all the top bankers in every market we do business Jackie Bohlen    KBW    AnalystOkay  That s helpful  Thank you  And then just one last one for me  You had really strong origination volume in the quarter and it accelerated throughout the year  most notably in the second half  And is that timing driven  market driven  is that part of the new hires you invested in Walnut Creek and San Francisco  How would you characterize that Russell A  Colombo    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Our Board will say it s bonus driven  but I won t say that  It s just all over the map  I mean  I think that there is a push certainly by lenders as you get closer to the end of the year to meet their goals  to meet their targets  And as you get later in the year  the push gets harder and they really push hard  So that being said  I think there is a lot of activity    since there is a lot of activity in the first    in the fourth quarter  it tends to fall off a bit early in the year  And then it picks up again as you get later into the spring and to the summer and then certainly near the end of the year  So that s    it s a pattern that has existed for a number of years here  This is not unusual  and we keep thinking it will be great if we can front load more of that  it just doesn t happen that way  And I think that pattern will probably continue this year  I mean  we had slow originations earlier in the year  But as you say  it picked up in the summer and it really picked up at the end of the year Jackie Bohlen    KBW    AnalystOkay  All right  Thank you  That s all I had Russell A  Colombo    President and Chief Executive OfficerOkay  Thanks OperatorThank you  And I m showing no further questions on the phone lines Russell A  Colombo    President and Chief Executive OfficerOkay  If there s
