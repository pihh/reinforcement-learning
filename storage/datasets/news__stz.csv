Because unlicensed growers do not have to play by the same rules  no taxes  for example   they can sell their product for less  In California  the illicit cannabis market supports three times as many sellers as does the legal  regulated market  A study by a California group of legal marijuana businesses  the United Cannabis Business Association  found that about 2 835 businesses  including storefronts and delivery services  are operating illegally in the state  The state has licensed just 873 businesses  less than a third as many State regulators weren t counting on this effect  at least not to the degree to which it has come  Enforcing licensing regulations adds to the state s cost  which cuts into tax receipts  Tax revenues are the primary reason that California and other state governments have legalized recreational use of marijuana What Does a Licensed Grower Do Now When Tilray  Aurora Cannabis and Canopy Growth filed for their initial public offerings  all three talked about expanding their cultivation  But the Canadian market couldn t absorb that much production of smokable pot  and that put Tilray on a different expansion path The company began exporting cannabis flower to Germany and Israel and acquired smaller companies that were producing edibles or cannabidiol based  CBD  products that do not contain the psychoactive ingredient tetrahydrocannabinol  THC   While edibles are regulated  CBD products are not  as long as a company does not make claims about the products that run afoul of agencies like the U S  Food and Drug Administration Then  in December 2018  the U S  government removed hemp from its list of Schedule I drugs  Tilray spent about  55 million to acquire cultivator Natura and  316 million to acquire Manitoba Harvest  a maker of hemp based edibles  The company then merged with Seattle based private equity firm Privateer Holdings in July in a deal valued at  2 9 billion Cash and equivalents shrank from around  487 million in the third quarter of 2018 to  100 million 12 months later  Long term debt only increased by about  8 million to  428 million in the same period  The net debt to EBITDA ratio dropped from a positive 1 1  to a negative 2 3  Cash flow from operations dropped from a negative  19 8 million to negative  57 0 million in the 12 months through September 2019  Capital spending doubled to  24 2 million  and levered free cash flow tumbled from negative  27 5 million to negative  133 2 million Tilray s enterprise value has dropped from about  6 25 billion in September 2018 to around  2 12 billion 12 months later  Investors are not convinced that spending on expanding cultivation capacity and on entering the hyper competitive CBD market at the same time is going to get Tilray back on a growth trajectory

first quarter or so of 2019  Then  what the stock market had given  it decided to take back The Boom Goes BustBeginning in late 2018  billions of investment dollars poured in from some beverage and tobacco giants  Constellation Brands Inc   NYSE  STZ  took a  4 billion stake in Canopy Growth Corp   NYSE  CGC  and Altria Inc   NYSE  MO  invested  1 8 billion in Cronos Group Inc   NASDAQ  CRON   Canopy Growth and Cronos were among the 10 largest marijuana companies as 2019 began  Molson Coors Co   NYSE  TAP  also signed a joint venture deal with Hexo Corp   NYSE  HEXO  to develop pot infused beverages These big investments by established consumer products companies dried up in 2019  Only the  2 9 billion merger between Tilray Inc   NYSE  TLRY  and its majority shareholder  Privateer Holdings  came anywhere near the big transactions of 2018  According to Viridian Capital Advisors  for the full year  companies trading marijuana stocks on public exchanges raised  7 64 billion in fresh capital  of which some  5 28 billion came in the form of new equity  In 2018  publicly traded pot companies raised  9 9 billion in new capital  including  7 9 billion in new equity Cannabis sales improved last year  but not by as much as analysts and investors were looking for  Organigram  for instance  saw net revenues rise from  16 9 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019  ended in November 2018  to  70 1 million in the same fiscal quarter of 2020  Adjusted EBITDA  however  fell from  66 7 million to a negative  22 1 million over the same period On the balance sheet  the company reported cash and short term investments of  72 2 million at the end of November 2018 and  25 7 million at the end of this past November Still  Organigram s share price dropped by just over 31

Aurora Cannabis  down 56 5   or Tilray  down 75 7   2019 Was High on Promise  Low on DeliveryRegulating the new cannabis industry took longer than expected  Legal sales of recreational pot in Canada did not begin until the fall of 2018  even though legislation approving sales was passed almost 18 months earlier In Ontario  Canada s highest population province  only about two dozen retail stores were open a full year after sales began  In December  the provincial government replaced its lottery system for awarding licenses Health Canada also failed to move quickly to license derivative products like edibles  vapes  infused beverages  topicals  tinctures and concentrates  These high margin products were not available until mid October of 2019  The sale of derivatives was expected to boost revenues and profits and to keep investors buying stock in Canada s cannabis companies Organigram was unable to ship its first vaporizing pen until mid December  too late to have any impact on first quarter results  And what the company calls its Rec 2 0 portfolio of vape and edible products face delays or other restrictions in several provinces  including Quebec  Newfoundland and Labrador  and Alberta How 2020 Will Be DifferentTo overcome the hurdles Organigram and other Canadian cannabis firms face going into 2020  at least two things are going to be needed  cash and a solid plan  Organigram spent heavily during its 2019 fiscal year but still managed to close with more than  25 million in cash on the books  along with some  55 million in available credit  That should go a long way toward promoting the new products The company also plans to delay the completion of the last phase of its  12 million facility expansion to raise its production capacity to nearly 250 000 pounds  In its latest earnings report  Organigram noted that  remaining construction can be completed in a relatively short timeframe to be ready to respond to an increase in consumer demand which may result from additional store openings  Those new stores are planned in the country s largest markets  Ontario and Quebec   collectively representing over 60  of the Canadian population  The focus on high margin derivative products gets a boost from Organigram s development of a proprietary technology expected to provide an initial absorption of cannabinoids within 10 to 15 minutes  In dissolvable powder form  consumers can add the powder to their own beverage of choice  Organigram plans to have the powder on the market by the summer One last note about Organigram s balance sheet  Unlike some competitors  the company did not go into acquisition mode last year  Among those that did  some have taken write offs  Virtually all have seen their goodwill increase as the actual value of the new assets has been adjusted to reflect last year s reality  Tilray posted goodwill of  163 million in its most recent quarterly report  Aphria Inc   NYSE  APHA  claims  504 million of goodwill  and Aurora lists nearly  2 4 billion in goodwill  Organigram  however  claims no goodwillOrganigram appears to want to differentiate itself from other Canadian producers by focusing on its derivative products like vapes  pens  edibles and  now  dissolvable powder  Going after high margin markets is often a good  if costly  strategy  Organigram stock has massive upside potential  now the company needs to execute

112037,333552,STZ,Is Constellation Brands Making a Big Mistake ,news,"Things weren t supposed to turn out this way for Constellation Brands  NYSE STZ   The company s investment in Canopy Growth  NYSE CGC  was intended to generate strong growth while diversifying the company s business 
Unfortunately  Constellation Brands has seen loss after loss from the cannabis producer pull down its results  While some growing pains were inevitable  there s not much light at the end of the tunnel  Investing in the cannabis industry has been an expensive  4 billion bet for Constellation Brands  one that the company may want to consider walking away from sooner rather than later 
Another quarter weighed down by cannabis losses
Constellation Brands reported its third quarter earnings earlier this month  which offered no surprises for investors  Canopy Growth dragged down the company s results  yet again  Although Constellation reported a profit of  366 5 million in Q3  the beer maker still incurred a loss of  71 1 million relating to its investment in the Canadian cannabis company 
Unfortunately  this is not a new problem  as a lack of profitability has been a recurring issue for Canopy Growth  In July 2019  Canopy Growth fired co CEO Bruce Linton after another disappointing quarter dampened Constellation s numbers  The move rocked the industry and  even though Linton has since moved on  Canopy Growth continues to incur losses 

Over the past four quarters  the cannabis operator has accumulated net losses totaling 1 9 billion Canadian dollars on revenue of just CA 344 million  There s little hope of improvement around the corner as the company is bogged down in overhead and administrative costs  Selling  general and administrative costs totaled CA 241 million last quarter  which was more than triple the company s top line of CA 77 million 
There s a lot to fix at Canopy Growth  and what was initially an exciting investment in a new industry is looking like more and more like a burden on Constellation Brands 
Constellation is bullish on the Canadian marijuana market  but it shouldn t be
Despite the painful results  Constellation Brands isn t showing any signs that it s throwing in the towel on Canopy Growth anytime soon  The company s CEO Bill Newlands said   We remain bullish on the Canadian cannabis market as the conversion of the illicit market to the legal market continues to strengthen  
It s been more than a year since recreational pot use became legal in Canada on Oct  17  2018  but there s not a whole lot to be bullish about today  Data from Stats Canada suggests that less than one third of cannabis users buy pot from legal sources  Although that figure will likely rise as more cannabis stores pop up  legal pot prices are still far more expensive than what users can buy from the black market  Numbers from October indicate that illegal pot was nearly half the price of what consumers would pay from a licensed cannabis retailer  
The reality is that while there may be some improvements in the Canadian cannabis market with edibles and ingestibles now becoming available  that s not enough to make it an appealing market in which to invest  Cannabis research company BDS Analytics adjusted down its forecast for the cannabis industry in Canada last year from a projected market size of  5 9 billion by 2022 to only  5 2 billion by 2024 
That s not a terribly high number when you consider that Green Thumb Industries CEO Ben Kovler expects that the recently legalized Illinois market alone can be worth as much as  3 billion  The California market is already worth more than  3 billion  and that s with a very strong black market still jockeying for position there  
What does this mean for investors 
Constellation Brands isn t going to say it s dumping Canopy Growth because it s been a horrible investment  even if it really believes that  Doing so would only send the marijuana stock down even further in price  
Instead  the takeaway for investors is that Constellation Brands will keep seeing its numbers weighed down by Canopy Growth for the foreseeable future  as there s little hope of a drastic improvement happening anytime soon 
Another takeaway is for the broader cannabis industry  Companies from other industries may be more hesitant to get involved in the cannabis industry in Canada in light of the challenges that have plagued Constellation Brands since its big pot investment  That means investors shouldn t expect any big deals to happen anytime soon involving beverages or any other industries 
Canopy Growth may well turn things around  but it could take a very long time for that to happen  In the meantime  Constellation Brands  stock is likely to remain on a very turbulent path  and investors ought to steer clear of it for now ",2020-01-22,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/plj7d,2065401
112038,333553,STZ,Canopy Growth Appoints Constellation Brands Director to Board,news,"Canopy Growth  NYSE CGC  announced today that it was making two major changes to its board of directors  Judy Schmeling  who currently sits on the Constellation Brands  NYSE STZ  board of directors  will be stepping up as Canopy s new board chair while a senior marketing executive from Constellation  Jim Sabia  will be joining Canopy s board as well 
Schmeling has already been serving on Canopy s board since late 2018  as well as being the chair of the audit committee  In addition to serving on the board of Casey s General Stores  she also used to work as the Chief Operating Officer for the digital retailer HSN 

Jim Sabia  on the other hand  is a new addition to Canopy s board  Currently  he is an Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer with Constellation Brands  Prior to working with Constellation  Sabia held senior marketing positions with Molson Coors 
Looking at the bigger picture
These new board appointments are further outward signs of the growing influence that Constellation Brands  one of Canopy s biggest investors  has on the company  Canopy s new CEO  David Klein  was previously the Chief Financial Officer for Constellation as well 
Constellation had invested over CA 4 billion into Canopy growth back in August 2018  However  as the cannabis giant continued to post financial losses  Constellation ended up removing founder Bruce Linton from the chief executive position  Since then  Constellation has been doing its best to turn things around and prevent further losses 
Canopy also recently announced that it was postponing the launch of its CBD beverage product lineup  although management has said that this delay won t meaningfully affect the company s 2020 revenue figures ",2020-01-22,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pljk6,2065427

Will CannTrust Shares Make a Comeback CannTrust  which could sell none of its cannabis products  was also barred from growing more  In a bull market that could have spelled the end of the company As it turned out  however  the bear market for pot may have inadvertently helped the company  It laid off 140 employees and saved more money on operating expenses  While CannTrust was on life support  Wall Street looked elsewhere for profits and there were plenty of opportunities  especially in the last half of 2019 If CannTrust s new management team can deliver its tardy financial statements by the end of the first calendar quarter of 2020  the company could recover  provided that it hasn t lost its customers for good  Every legal pot grower in Canada is going to have a substantial inventory of product that it will want to sell  probably at closeout pricing That s not going to help CannTrust  Neither are other growers  booming inventories  At the end of the second quarter of last year  according to Statistics Canada  a gram of legal cannabis cost consumers C 10 65  Black market pot sold for C 5 63 a gram Health Canada placed a hold on some 11 400 pounds of CannTrust s dried cannabis inventory  and the company voluntarily withheld sales of another 16 500 pounds  The company said at the time that it was continuing to grow  cultivate  harvest and sell cannabis  Sales in Ontario and Alberta were later stopped by provincial regulators In October 2019  Health Canada suspended CannTrust s licenses to produce and sell cannabis but allowed the company to continue cultivating and harvesting the plant  The company also agreed to destroy approximately  12 million worth of biological assets and about  56 million worth of inventory that was not authorized under the company s license CannTrust reported inventory assets of  35 4 million at the end of December 2018  growth of more than three times year over year  At the end of the first quarter of 2019  the company s inventory value had ballooned to more than  55 8 million  That s the last quarterly report the company filed  It s worth noting that before getting its license suspended  the company said it expected production capacity to rise to a range of 400 000 to 660 000 pounds by late this year As harshly as CannTrust was treated  and deservedly so   last year s flagging cannabis market was a good time to get sideways with the regulators  The company was looking at producing about 220 000 to 440 000 pounds of marijuana last year  Not having to soak off all that inventory this year  if it gets its licenses back  could be a plus for the company What to expect from CannTrust in 2020 is a glass either half empty or half full  The effects of its licensing violations will continue to be felt this year  and there s been no indication the Health Canada is working overtime to get the company back on track  There s no reason it should  After all  the former CEO knew about the illegal grows and  at best  did nothing to stop them When CannTrust came public in August 2017  the shares priced at  1 70  before rising to an all time high of nearly  11 00 in October 2018  Following a bounce in March  the stock price has plunged steadily to less than  1 20  One positive signal for the industry is that short sellers are generally bailing out The improving share price and diminishing short interest in pot stocks may be enough for it to hold on to its New York Stock Exchange listing  but it s not enough for investors  Once the company begins filing financial statements again  that is the critical time for CannTrust

112041,333556,STZ,Why Canopy Growth s Infused Beverage Business Will Struggle,opinion,Canopy Growth  CGC  has recently enjoyed the rebound in the cannabis market  as sentiment  at least temporarily  has grown more optimistic for the overall sector In this article we ll look at why the company has a good chance of under performing in the infused beverage market  and what that could mean over the long term for Canopy Growth  We ll also look at the positive impact an increase in same store sales could have on the company going forward Product returnsOne of the major concerns I have for Canopy Growth is its inability to accurately identify demand trends  which in the last quarter came back to bite them  as it had product returns of just under  27 million  much of that coming from a lack of demand for its oil products I don t think that s only from misreading demand  but from misreading the trend itself  It remains to be seen if oils will be the positive catalyst some following the industry  and some in the industry itself  have believed it would be  Canopy Growth was definitely wrong in its assumptions concerning demand for oils As a result of primarily excessive inventory  the company noted in its latest earnings report that it had identified  15 9 million in product inventory that exceeded demand  or had become obsolete The key issue here to me is that the company was not only overly optimistic concerning oils in particular  but may have went after the wrong market segment altogether I draw that conclusion from the fact that its major competitor Aurora Cannabis had stated in the past it wasn t convinced oils were going to be as popular as some companies believed Infused beveragesAs this relates to infused beverages  I m concerned the same thing could happen  So far  much of the outlook for infused beverages is related to theory rather than reality Obviously  with large brewers like Constellation Brands  STZ  and other industries looking at the cannabis sector for growth opportunities  the assumption is they will be able to generate significant sales in the infused beverages segment  The level of demand for infused beverages has yet to be proven If it doesn t meet expectations in any significant way  Canopy Growth could face some strong headwinds beyond what they already do  Why this would have a major negative impact on the company is because the market is looking for its partnership with Constellation Brands and infused beverages to drive a lot of future growth Some good newsOne positive thing Canopy Growth has going for it is its same store sales performance  Last quarter same store sales from retail outlets it owned were up 17 percent in gross revenue  When including new store openings  that number jumped to 24 percent This is important because Ontario is going to start opening up approximately 20 stores a quarter  starting in April 2020  If it is able to perform well in those stores  it could go a long way toward consistent growth  The significance of that is it s doing it without the sales of derivatives If the company is able to figure out derivatives  it could add nicely to the top and bottom lines  So far the company hasn t shown it can project demand in specific segments with accuracy  so it remains to be seen if it can improve in that area in the months and years ahead Consensus VerdictWall Street is unsure Canopy Growth is worth the gamble  with 7 out of 16 analysts in the last 3 months rating a Buy on the stock  and the majority maintaining a Hold  With a downside potential of nearly 6   the stock s consensus target price stands at  22 61   See Canopy Growth stock analysis on TipRanks ConclusionSince Canopy Growth received the  4 billion cash infusion from Constellation Brands  it has been touted by many as the cream of the crop in the cannabis sector  For some time I ve been one of the few that have went against the grain with that conclusion  for the reasons of its poor track record of identifying legitimate trends in the industry  along with providing the right products to meet what demand is there From what I ve seen so far  the infused beverage market could be a negative catalyst for Canopy Growth  That has in part been confirmed by the recent decision of the company to push back the release of infused beverages  I think that s not necessarily a bad decision  because it needs to get this right If it were to bottle up a lot of products that once again have to be returned  it would underscore the fact it has difficulty in accurately identifying demand in certain segments  which if isn t able to break out of that weakness  it would crush the share price of the company  even with over  2 billion in cash remaining from Constellation s investment in Canopy If Canopy can t overcome these things  its bottom line will take further hits  and questions on the sustainability of any meaningful growth trajectory would increase I  for one  am not convinced it will be able to do so  If it fails with infused beverages  there s not a lot of tailwinds left to drive it  On the other hand  if it does succeed at some level with infused beverages  the combination of the increase in stores in Ontario  and secondarily  in Quebec  could be enough in the way of catalysts to help the company turn around To find good ideas for cannabis stocks trading at

112042,333557,STZ,Did Constellation Brands Waste  4 Billion on Canopy Growth ,news,"Constellation Brands   NYSE STZ   190 million investment in Canopy Growth  NYSE CGC  in 2017 for a 10  stake in the marijuana producer altered the landscape for the legal weed industry  Because it was the first major company to put money into pot  it bestowed much needed legitimacy on the industry 
Yet as Canopy Growth stumbles over yet another seemingly unforced error  investors may begin questioning whether Constellation wasted the  4 billion it eventually poured into the pot producer  and so far  the record isn t very encouraging 

Lurching forward
Canopy Growth s latest snafu is its delay in introducing its so called Cannabis 2 0 lineup of marijuana infused beverages  Instead of the January 2020 launch date it originally promised  Canopy pushed it back to some indefinite time in the future to give it the chance to scale up its production facility 
 In order to deliver products that meet our customer s high standards we are electing to revise the launch date while we work through the final details   CEO David Klein said in a statement 
Considering Constellation is one of the premier beer and wine distributors in the U S  and its investment in Canopy was predicated not on how much dried cannabis flower or leaf the pot grower could sell but on the drinks it could produce  being ready to hit the ground running when it got the green light should have been a priority 
Canopy submitted its application for a beverage facility last June  and Canada s regulations for Cannabis 2 0 went into effect in October  Canada Health issued Canopy a license in November and the marijuana producer announced the following month it was launching its beverages in January  And then it said it wasn t 
While Canopy says the delay shouldn t have a material impact on its revenue this year  suggesting it may not be too big of a deal over the long term  it is ceding the early ground to other companies that are prepared to move forward with cannabis infused beverages of their own   For example  Truss Beverages  the joint venture of HEXO and Molson Coors  and Fluent Beverage  the partnership between Tilray and Anheuser Busch  also have a full lineup of drinks ready to go 
Overpromise  underdeliver
If this were Canopy s only blunder  it would be easy to excuse  but the marijuana producer seems to regularly trip itself up 
Last quarter Canopy reported that sales tumbled 15  year over year to CA 76 6 million because it misjudged demand in the cannabis oils market and had to recognize CA 32 7 million in adjustments due to a large number of returns 
It has also overpaid for acquisitions  and it operated with seemingly little oversight from the board of directors  who allowed former co CEO Bruce Linton to freely distribute the company s cash hoard so that its balance has been nearly halved to CA 2 7 billion  While Linton was eventually ousted and a Constellation executive installed in his place  Canopy remains a loss generating operation with no end in sight 
The recent placement of another Constellation executive on Canopy s board implies the beverage company might want a few more adults in the room to stop the hemorrhaging  but it also suggests a good part of Canopy s future will be in beverages 
A glass half empty
That s good if cannabis infused drinks are as big as some hope  but like oils and dried flower and leaf demand  this may be a more underwhelming figure than expected  Although some analysts see them growing to  1 4 billion by 2023  where they are legal to buy in the U S  they haven t moved the needle  accounting for about 6  of the entire edibles market  There may be a market for them  but demand may not be so great after all 
It s too early to say that Constellation has wasted its money on Canopy Growth  After all  it may simply have been a defensive move to be part of an industry that s seen as potentially undermining alcohol sales 
Yet it s also apparent that whatever benefit Constellation hoped it would derive from its investment in marijuana won t be generating any positive returns for some time to come ",2020-02-03,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pqiiw,2074656

112077,333592,STZ,Constellation Brands Updates Its 2020 Targets After a Mixed Quarter,news,"Investors had modest expectations heading into Constellation Brands   NYSE STZ  third quarter earnings report on Wednesday  The alcoholic beverage giant has been enjoying strong growth in its beer portfolio  but the wine and spirits segment has been slumping  Those uneven trends  combined with financial challenges stemming from its investment in marijuana specialist Canopy Growth  NYSE CGC  added uncertainty to this formerly high flying stock 
This week s earnings announcement answered key questions in a few of these areas  but it also showed that investors will need to be patient as they wait for clarity during this turbulent time for Constellation s business 
Let s take a closer look 

Portfolio updates
The beer segment was again the standout performer for the consumer stock  with depletion  an industry metric that tracks consumption  rising 7   That result marked an acceleration over the prior quarter s 6  boost and was a testament to Constellation s many popular imported beer franchises  Modelo enjoyed a 15  depletion spike in the period  securing its place as the country s fourth best selling beer  Corona continued its winning streak  too  with depletions rising 7  thanks to healthy demand for core products like Corona Extra and new launches like Premier and Refresca 
The beer business became significantly more profitable  with operating margin rising 2 percentage points to 39  of sales 
As for wine and spirits  depletions continued to fall under the weight of Constellation s major brand sale to E J  Gallo  Still  the rebound that management had predicted in its so called  power brands  finally occurred  That niche  which includes Kim Crawford and Meiomi wines along with Svedka vodkas  expanded 4  to reverse last quarter s 3  drop 
Constellation s Canopy Growth investment continued to add volatility to reported earnings  with non cash losses amounting to  71 million compared to  55 million last quarter 
Looking ahead
Investors are bracing for a sharp slowdown in beer sales in the fourth quarter  but that deceleration is mostly due to the timing of shipments that resulted in a huge volume increase in the year ago period  CEO Bill Newlands and his team say that situation will pressure growth in Q4 by a bit more than expected  so the company is now projecting beer sales gains of between 7  and 8  rather than its prior target range of 7  to 9   On the bright side  lower input costs and rising prices have combined to improve the beer segment s earnings profile  and operating income is now set to rise a bit faster than executives predicted back in October 
Constellation is still expecting the wine and spirits divestment to pave the way for depletion growth and rising margins in that segment  yet the latest results didn t show much concrete evidence on that score  Yes  power brands are growing again  Yet operating margin fell slightly and overall depletion volumes are still falling 
In a nod to those mixed financial and operating results  Newlands noted that fiscal 2020 is  shaping up to be a dynamic year  that includes the divestment of many alcoholic beverage brands that commanded lower prices  Constellation is optimistic that the remaining portfolio will support faster  more profitable growth  Yet its fiscal 2021 success will also depend on favorable consumer reception of new brands like Corona Seltzer and Crafters Union Bubbles  which will be launching over the next few months ",2020-01-08,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pfl7q,2055391

112080,333595,STZ,Not Even Canopy Growth Can Be a Buzzkill for Constellation Brands s Q3,news,"Marijuana producer Canopy Growth  NYSE CGC  swiped a quarter s worth of per share profits from Constellation Brands  NYSE STZ   but the beer  wine  and spirits distributor still managed to beat analyst expectations and maintain strong growth across all of its beverages 
Earnings actually fell year over year  and sales crept only 1  higher in the third quarter  But the results remained better than what Wall Street was expecting and led Constellation to raise its outlook for the year 

Mexican beer can t be beat
Everyone was expecting Constellation s investment in Canopy Growth to be a real drag on performance  Having reported an  839 million decline in the fair value of its investment in the pot producer in the second quarter  the  534 million decrease this quarter was significantly better  even though Canopy s stock lost over 30  of its value in 2019 
Arguably even more surprising was the continued strength of its beer business  which continues to post exceptionally strong growth considering the weakness of craft beer and the declines seen in the overall industry 
Depletions  or sales to distributors and retailers    an industry proxy for consumer demand    were up 7 3  in the quarter  The Modelo Especial brand continued to see them rise by nearly 15  as it tightened its grip on being the fourth biggest beer brand in the entire U S  beer category 
Return to growth
Constellation also saw a 7  increase in depletions from its Corona family of beer  driven by both Corona Premier and the flavored malt beverage Corona Refresca  which was introduced to tap into the demand for hard seltzers  Constellation will be introducing its own seltzer in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 under the Corona brand  Unlike Anheuser Busch InBev or Boston Beer  which created new seltzer brands  possibly to hide their brewer roots   Constellation says Corona is such a popular brand that it makes sense to capitalize on it when the seltzer is introduced 
Especially encouraging for Constellation was the return to growth of Corona Extra  which has suffered from falling sales after Premier and Corona Especial were introduced in 2018 
What it could get growing was its Ballast Point Brewing craft beer  which it purchased for  1 billion four years ago  Having written down the value of the brewer  it agreed to sell it to Kings   Convicts Brewing last month for an undisclosed sum  but one that was likely vastly lower than what it paid 
That s the spirit
Constellation Brands also agreed to sell its underperforming  low end wine and spirits brands to E J  Gallo Winery  as it seeks to focus on just premium and super premium brands  However  it had to adjust the terms of the sale to address competitive concerns  and the value of the deal was revised downward as certain brands were eliminated from the transaction  Constellation still intends to sell them to a different buyer when it finds one  It also sold its Black Velvet Canadian Whisky business in November 
Organic net sales for the division were down almost 9  for the quarter  with organic shipment volumes tumbling almost 12   though there were some bright spots  Svedka vodka  for example  continues to gain market share in that spirits space  with the analysts at IRI saying it grew 8  for the period in the channels it monitors 
Toasting future growth
Management now says that excluding the anchor Canopy Growth represents  it forecasts full year earnings in a range of  9 45 to  9 55 per share  up from its previous guidance of  9 00 to  9 20 per share  but also well ahead of Wall Street  which was forecasting just  8 49 per share at the midpoint 
Constellation Brands stock is up 15  over the past year  but that s less than half the gains of the stock indexes  With its beer brands all seemingly on track and its plan to step up the quality of its wine and spirits portfolio in place  the adult beverage distributor looks primed for better growth this year  And if its marijuana stock investment can also regain its footing  Constellation may have something to really be buzzed about ",2020-01-09,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pfvnk,2055821
112081,333596,STZ,Will Constellation Brands Acquire Pot Stock Canopy Growth ,news,"For years  the cannabis industry has grown by leaps and bounds  Worldwide marijuana sales more than tripled from 2014 to 2018  reaching nearly  11 billion  and some Wall Street analysts have forecast a roughly 18 fold increase in global annual sales by 2030 to approximately  200 billion  With sales forecasts like these  it s easy to see why investors have flocked to marijuana stocks 
These sales projections are also a big reason behind heightened merger and acquisition activity  and equity investments  into the pot industry in 2018 and the first half of 2019  Out of the numerous acquisitions and investments in the cannabis space that came to fruition  the largest to date is the November 2018 equity investment of  4 billion from Modelo and Corona brewer Constellation Brands  NYSE STZ  into Canopy Growth  NYSE CGC   the largest publicly traded pot stock in the world 

According to a recent note released to clients by Pablo Zuanic  cannabis industry covering analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald  Constellation is  more likely than not  at this point to buy the remainder of Canopy Growth that it doesn t already own  But does Zuanic s thesis hold water  Let s take a closer look  
Constellation has been building a position in Canopy for some time
Before completely diving into the positives of a potential acquisition of Canopy Growth  it s important for investors to understand just how deep Constellation Brands already is into Canopy from a monetary perspective  Although Constellation did make the  4 billion equity investment into Canopy  it actually was the third time that Constellation directly or indirectly took a stake in the company 
Back in October 2017  Constellation Brands became the first brand name company to dip its toes into the pond by paying approximately  190 million for a 9 9  equity stake in Canopy Growth  Then  in June 2018  Constellation acquired a third of Canopy s CA 600 million   460 million  offering of convertible debentures  Though Constellation could choose to accept repayment of this debt in cash  it may also be able to convert its debt into Canopy s common stock in the future  Likewise  Constellation received warrants with its massive equity investment in November 2018 that could be exercised in the future 
In short  Constellation didn t just make a single investment into Canopy Growth in November 2018  Even though investors tend to focus on this singular event as game changing  Constellation has been digging into Canopy Growth for more than two years 

Here s why a Constellation Canopy combination might make sense
Now that we ve got that out of the way  let s examine why acquiring Canopy Growth could work out in Constellation s favor 
First  Constellation would be able to acquire what it doesn t already own of Canopy for a reasonably inexpensive price  Zuanic suggests that acquiring what it doesn t already own of Canopy at a 15  premium would only amount to a little over  5 billion  Considering that Constellation has already  directly and indirectly  invested more than  4 3 billion into its aggregate equity stake in Canopy  this is a pretty reasonable price to pay to make the full leap into a high growth industry 
Second  we re talking about internalizing all partnered development projects  and thereby reaping the full rewards of doing so  For instance  Constellation and Canopy are working together to create a line of nonalcoholic cannabis infused beverages  Buying Canopy would allow Constellation to reap the full reward of this line of derivative products  as well as Canopy s other high margin ventures  including its push into Canadian edibles 
Third  it would combine two companies that already have diverse international distribution networks  Constellation is a major alcohol player throughout North America  with Canopy Growth having an export  production  research  or partnership presence in 17 countries  including a hemp processing license in the U S   in New York State   There would  presumably  be sizable synergies realized by combining these distribution networks 
Fourth  former Constellation Brands CFO David Klein is set to take the reins as CEO of Canopy Growth  Klein  one of Constellation s own  will undertake the necessary steps to turn the largest pot stock in the world into a mature and sustainable business 
Finally  it would be a logical step by Constellation s management to expand into another high growth vice industry  It s not so much that premium alcohol sales aren t thriving for Constellation throughout North America  as it is that cannabis represents another avenue of steady long term growth  especially with a younger generation of consumers 

Zuanic s thesis has a pretty big flaw
I admit  there s a lot here that makes sense  Constellation already being waist deep in its aggregate investment  and recently installing its former CFO as Canopy s new CEO  both make for solid reasons to combine these two companies  But Zuanic s thesis overlooks a pretty sizable problem  Namely  Constellation s balance sheet is already stretched more than its management team would care for 
Over the past four years  Constellation s total debt has roughly doubled to more than  12 billion  and it has in excess of  1 billion in short term borrowing and long term debt coming due over the next 12 months  Though the company is expected to generate  2 3 billion in operating cash flow for fiscal 2019  it has only  94 million in cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet 
In layman s terms  the only way Constellation Brands is going to be able to acquire Canopy Growth is if it further balloons its outstanding debt  Constellation s management made it clear following that  4 billion equity investment in November 2018 that maintaining fiscal discipline is important  Thus  I don t see how Constellation makes a play for Canopy Growth given the current state of its balance sheet 
What s more  Canopy s own balance sheet is not in the best shape  The company looks to have grossly overpaid for a number of acquisitions and is now lugging around CA 1 91 billion   1 47 billion  in goodwill  This would come atop the  7 77 billion in goodwill that Constellation already has on its balance sheet from previous acquisitions  Thus  the combined company  inclusive of a premium paid to acquire Canopy  could have more than  10 billion in goodwill  perhaps representing as much as 30  of total assets  
Suffice it to say that while I appreciate Constellation Brands  equity investment into Canopy Growth and believe the two can grow together in the cannabis industry  I don t believe an acquisition is likely ",2020-01-11,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pgr1k,2057399
112082,333597,STZ,Constellation Brands Tells Investors It Can Win in the Hard Seltzer Category,news,"Investors had a positive early reaction to Constellation Brands   NYSE STZ  third quarter earnings report earlier this week  Yes  the alcoholic beverage giant reduced its outlook for growth in the core beer segment  But that slight downgrade was offset by improving profitability across its portfolio of beer  wine  and spirits brands 
In a conference call with Wall Street analysts  CEO Bill Newlands and his team discussed the trends affecting results over the last few months and looked out to a fiscal 2020 that will be influenced by major new beverage launches such as Corona Hard Seltzer 
Let s look at some highlights from that presentation 

No signs of weakness in beer

Calendar 2019 marked the 10th consecutive year of volume growth for Constellation beer business and solidified our position as the leader in the high end of the U S  beer business  These trends were driven by Corona Extra  Modelo Especial s explosive growth  and our successful innovation initiatives 
   Newlands

Shifting consumer tastes have pressured demand for many leading beer brands  Constellation s portfolio of imported brands has been immune to that slump  though  The Corona franchise expanded sales by 7  this quarter  which pushed annual volume up to 110 million cases  compared with 90 million in 2010  That success made Corona one of just a few major beer brands to grow volume during this past decade 
Executives highlighted other major wins in this consumer staples niche  including booming growth for Modelo and Pacifico  that allowed beer volume growth to accelerate between the fiscal second and third quarters 
This boost occurred even as pricing increased and marketing spending ticked lower   Our beer business continues to be a powerhouse for growth as the No  1 brewer and seller of imported beer in the U S  market   Newlands said 
The wine and spirits rebound is still coming

We are already actively pursuing other opportunities to divest most  if not all brands in these  low margin wine and spirits  categories  as we believe this is the best path to optimize our portfolio going forward 
   Newlands

Constellation has had to scale back its original deal with Gallo to sell lower priced wine and spirit brands  The timing has been pushed back  too  But it is encouraged by the improving growth trends in its remaining wine and spirits franchises  including Meiomi  Kim Crawford  and Svedka  Management reiterated its wider goals that target a quick return to volume growth in this segment and a steady climb toward 30  operating margins 
A big year ahead

Corona Hard Seltzer will be introduced in four flavors  including tropical lime  mango  cherry  and blackberry lime  Corona carries unbelievably strong brand equity as the No  1 most loved brand among both Hispanic and total population drinkers aged 21 to 54  and that s why we ve decided to put the Corona brand name on our new seltzer  And of course the refreshment characteristics of seltzers perfectly matches with Corona s refreshment DNA 
   Newlands

Management is optimistic that a change in leadership at Canopy Growth will help long term returns for the company s investment in the marijuana space  But the bigger impact on Constellation s fiscal 2021 will come from product introductions like the hard seltzer it is aiming to launch in the spring 
Alcoholic seltzer drinks have been growing quickly in recent quarters  and Constellation s research suggests that they re mostly taking market share away from domestic premium and craft beers  As a result  a successful Corona branded seltzer would fit perfectly into the company s decadelong growth strategy that has used imported brands to grow beer sales at the expense of traditional brands like Bud Light and Miller ",2020-01-11,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pgr1h,2057398
112083,333598,STZ,Constellation Brands  STZ  Upgraded To Buy  What Does It Mean For The Stock ,opinion,"Investors might want to bet on Constellation Brands  STZ   as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates  which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices 
A company s changing earnings picture is at the core of the Zacks rating  The system tracks the Zacks Consensus Estimate    the consensus measure of EPS estimates from the sell side analysts covering the stock    for the current and following years 
Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time  In these situations  the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements 
Therefore  the Zacks rating upgrade for Constellation Brands basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  and the near term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated  The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship  as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock 
For Constellation Brands  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company s underlying business  And investors  appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
As empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Constellation Brands
This wine  liquor and beer company is expected to earn  8 67 per share for the fiscal year ending February  2020  which represents a year over year change of  6 6  
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Constellation Brands  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 3 3  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

The upgrade of Constellation Brands to a Zacks Rank  2 positions it in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions  implying that the stock might move higher in the near term ",2020-01-13,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/constellation-brands-stz-upgraded-to-buy-what-does-it-mean-for-the-stock-200498417,200498417

The company is the world s largest agricultural input retailer and fertilizer producer Technological advancements are an increasingly important growth catalyst in many different industries  and the agricultural sector is no different  Nutrien has been maneuvering itself into a leading position in what is known as digital agriculture  The company s digital platform was launched almost 2 years ago and provides farmers with data on climate and weather conditions to assist in the process of planting  fertilizing and harvesting  The platform met with immediate success and it took only 6 months from its launch for more than 50  of the company s North American retail sales customers to start making use of it Nutrien has also been busy on the acquisition front  the latest of which was only announced last week  The company agreed to purchase Brazilian Ag retailer Agrosema Comercial Agricola  an important player in the Brazilian agricultural industry  The purchase comes hot on the heels of several other acquisitions since the launch of its digital platform and RBC s Andrew Wong thinks there is more to come The analyst said   We believe the company will continue the roll up strategy in North America  spending   300 500M annually on accretive acquisitions  In Brazil  we expect Nutrien to gradually build up a base through acquisitions that may be priced above typical valuations  due to less natural synergies   but eventually build a business model similar to the highly successful North American business  The Wholesale segment is working on several cost savings and expansion projects that should result in lower potash production costs and higher nitrogen volumes  To this end  Wong kept his bullish call on Nutrien with an Outperform rating and price target of  60  The figure represents potential gains in the shape of 27    To watch Wong s track record  click here What side of the field does the Street stand on regarding the fertilizer producer s potential  then  On

and phosphate markets  and we believe it would be an ideal investment in a commodity upside scenario  The acquisition of production and distribution assets in Brazil further enhances the company s exposure to the fastest growing agriculture market and provides significant synergy potential  With this in mind  Wong reiterates an Outperform rating on the potash producer  along with a  26 price

The alcoholic beverages maker    also considered a marijuana stock by some due to its considerable investment in Canopy Growth  NYSE CGC     reported its Q3 of fiscal 2019 Wednesday morning  For the period  net sales grew by 1  year over year to just under  2 billion 
Attributable net income rose 19  to just over  360 million   1 85 per share   despite a writedown on the Canopy Growth stake that amounted to  0 25 per share    higher than in previous quarters  On a per share adjusted basis  Constellation s net profit shook out at  2 14  

Beer was the liquid that gave the company its fizz during the quarter  Net sales of its considerable lineup of brews rose by 8  to  1 3 billion  The smaller wine portfolio went in the opposite direction  falling nearly 10  to  689 million 
The company s top line figure came in just above analyst estimates  Meanwhile  prognosticators were expecting only  1 83 in non GAAP  adjusted  earnings 
More encouragingly  Constellation raised its earnings guidance for the entirety of fiscal 2019  The company now anticipates it will book a net profit per share between  9 45 and  9 55  well up from the previous estimate of  9 00 to  9 20  That forecast  however  excludes potential Canopy Growth writedowns 
Investors seem to be less concerned about the company s Canopy Growth investment than before  judging by the market s reaction to the Q3 results  The marijuana stock fell steeply in price last year  and the resulting writedowns negatively affected Constellation s fundamentals ",2020-01-08,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pfkc1,2055321

Bill Newlands    President and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Patty  Good morning and Happy New Year to everyone  I certainly hope you enjoyed the holidays and had the opportunity to include some of our awesome Constellation products in your celebrations with your family and friends  The end of every year is a time of reflection for me  and this year is no exception As I reflect on 2019  I m reminded that we re not only ending a certain fiscal year  but a dynamic decade at Constellation Brands  Since 2010 Constellation has been on an incredible journey marked by strong financial performance and notable business milestones  Over the last 10 years  we ve significantly increased the value of our stock and produced double digit growth in sales  operating income and operating cash flow As a matter of fact  the closing price of Constellation s stock on December 31  2009 was just more than  15  Fast forward to December 31  2019  we closed at almost  190  This incredible increase of more than 1000  over the last 10 years  made Constellation  the best performing stock in the S P 500 Consumer Staples Index during this timeframe  One of the biggest drivers of our success was the game changing beer acquisition that was executed almost at cap rate through the last decade  It enabled Constellation to buy Grupo Modelo brands in the United States  where we successfully built these brands for many years  while positioning ourselves for this transformational opportunity At that time  this deal allowed us to double the sales of our company  diversify our profit stream  significantly enhance our margin  earnings and free cash flow  while providing new avenues for growth  Since then  our beer business has made significant contribution to the overall sales  profit and cash flow results for our business and continues to be a powerhouse for growth as the number one brewer and seller of imported beer in the US market Calendar 2019 marked the 10th consecutive year of volume growth for Constellation Beer business and solidified our position as the leader in the high end of the US beer business  These trends were driven by Corona Extra  Modelo Especial s explosive growth and our successful innovation initiatives In 2010  the Modelo Especial brand depleted approximately 35 million cases and then went on to achieve double digit growth in every single year of the past decade  finishing 2019 at more than a 140 million cases  and there s more to come  In our most recent third quarter  this powerhouse brand posted depletion growth of almost 15  with double digit growth in 46 of the 50 states  while solidifying its position as the Number 4 beer brand in the US market Corona Extra  which is the Number 7 beer brand in the US beer category grew from approximately 90 million cases in 2010 to more than a 110 million cases in 2019  and as one of the few top selling brands in the US to grow this past decade From a quarterly perspective  the Corona brand family grew nearly 7  in IRI channels  driven by the continued strength of our Corona Premier and Corona Refresca innovations as well as the renewed growth of Corona Extra  Corona Premier continues to gain distribution  especially in the on premise and delivered double digit depletion growth in 35 of the 50 states during the quarter Corona Refresca was a Top 10 growth contributor to the year    to the US high end beer category during the third quarter And finally  let s not forget Pacifico  which achieved double digit depletion growth of nearly 16  and remained a top tier gainer within the US imports segment We re excited also about our plans for the launch of Corona Hard Seltzer this spring  which will help to further strengthen our position as the leader in the high end of the US beer segment  Our launch strategy includes the largest ever single brand investment for our portfolio of more than a 100    excuse me  more than 40 million in marketing to support this intro  We ve already started to take orders from distributors and have received incredibly positive feedback from retailers who are excited about the prospects of Corona Seltzer and have already incorporated our newest portfolio addition into their shelf set programing plans for the spring selling season As we ve discussed  Corona Hard Seltzer will be introduced in four flavors  including tropical lime  mango  cherry and blackberry lime  Corona carries unbelievably strong brand equity as the Number 1 most loved brand among both Hispanic and total population drinkers aged 21 to 54  and that s why we ve decided to put the Corona brand name on our new Seltzer  And of course the refreshment characteristics of Seltzers perfectly matches with Corona s refreshment DNA There s been a lot of debate about the Seltzer trend and where Seltzers are sourcing their growth within the total beverage alcohol category  Our research shows that Seltzer is taking share across the board from beer  Wine and Spirits  While a significant amount of this growth is sourced from the beer category  it is primarily coming from domestic premiums  crafts and FMBs with minimal interaction of Seltzer consumption with imported brands In addition  we are seeing increased overall consumption from those Seltzer drinkers and new consumers who are entering the TVA space through their interaction with Seltzers  As an aside  the trends that you ve seen for Constellation s Beer business in this week s four week IRI data covering the month of December are related to our recent annual price increase specifically in the California market  which briefly decreases features and promotions  The impact of these price increases are normal and frankly short term in nature Overall  we closed out the month of December with depletion growth for our  Technical Issues  business in the high single digit range of our year to date trends Moving now to Wine and Spirits  I m pleased that we ve been able to execute a revised agreement with Gallo  which paves the way for accelerated growth and margin performance for our Wine and Spirits business going forward  In addition  we believe it addresses the FTC concerns by excluding the sparkling wine  brandy  dessert wines and concentrate categories from the original transaction We are already actively pursuing other opportunities to divest most  if not all brands in these categories as we believe this is the best path to optimize our portfolio going forward  To be clear  the FTC needs to provide final approval of our revised agreement with Gallo  once we have finalized all transactions  including the proposed divestitures  which we expect to occur by our fiscal year end We have also entered into a separate  but related agreement with Gallo to divest our Nobilo Wine brand  This fits with Gallo s portfolio strategy and allows them to expand in the New Zealand wine category without affecting our long term goals and strategy or our opportunity in the New Zealand wine category in the US as a greater than  11 price point  This transaction is expected to close in the first half of fiscal  21 Despite the delay and timing and revisions to the transaction  I d like to remind everyone that we have benefited from almost an entire year of additional cash flow from the divested brands by the time the transaction closes  which has contributed to our debt reduction and share buyback activities During the last decade  our team has created significant value by transforming and simplifying our Wine and Spirits portfolio through the rationalization and divestiture of assets in an effort to premiumize the business  which is the right strategy to enhance our Wine and Spirits growth and financial profile going forward This premiumization strategy is taking hold in the marketplace as our Power Brands continue to outpace our competitors and take market share at the price points that matter in the higher end  In fact  our Power Brands as the greater than  11 retail price point  grew nearly 9  in IRI channels during the third quarter  including brands like Meiomi  which has more than doubled its volume with a CAGR of nearly 30  since its acquisition in 2015 Kim Crawford  which is another gem within our Power Brand portfolio was the Number 1 selling wine on wine com this past year and has consistently outperformed its competitors  posting a 20  volume CAGR in IRI channels over the last decade As we progress through fiscal  20  we continue to show steady upward progression in revenue trends for our Power Brands and expect mid single digit sales growth for this collection of brands in the fourth quarter Innovation and new product development are also critical to our success for the remainder of the year and we feel we are well positioned to drive these initiatives to the finish line  We ve already had great success with the launch of Robert Mondavi Private Selection Buttery Chardonnay and Woodbridge ready to drink packs  which while gaining traction across all channels is doing especially well in the convenience channel  A channel growing at two times the rate of the total US wine market Both Woodbridge and Robert Mondavi Private Selection  which represent the most significant volume within the Robert Mondavi brand franchise are outperforming in their respective price segments driven by marketing investments that we ve recently made  We recently extended our highly successful Barrel Aged program with the introduction of RMPS  Rye Barrel Aged Red Blend  As a reminder  we ve sold more than 1 million cases of Barrel Aged products since the inception of this program nearly two years ago  which helped to revive that Robert Mondavi Private Selection brand  while also becoming the foundation for some of our other successful Barrel Aged innovations like Cooper   Thief We re also building on the success of wine in a can  where consumers are seeking products that are convenient  ready to drink and sold in an environmentally friendly packaging  These trends have helped to fuel the growth of Crafters Union  which is the number one growth driver in canned wine over the last 12 weeks  We plan to build on the momentum of this brand with the launch of Crafters Union Bubbles during the fourth quarter Later this month  we will be releasing the Prisoner Unshackled  the newest addition to The Prisoner collection of brands in Chardonnay  Red Blend and Rose  We expect these brands to strengthen our ability to compete at the fast growing  25 retail price point On the spirits front  SVEDKA Vodka continues to significantly outpace the vodka category in IRI channels  driven by increased distribution within a core portfolio as well as the more recent introduction of the Rose flavor During the quarter  one of our most successful venture investments  Nelson s Green Brier  launched its first Tennessee Whiskey product  This Tennessee Whiskey is based on Charles Nelson s original recipe dating back to 1860 and it s the first time it s been bottled since provisions shut down at distillery in 1909  This is another milestone for Nelson s Green Brier as they continue to innovate and leverage the success they ve already achieved Overall  our US Wine and Spirits business has executed changes that have resulted in a sharpened focus on consumer preferred trends related to premiumization  innovation and brand building  As a result  we have benefited from ongoing consumer trade up trends  positive mix and great consumer response to our new product introductions in the marketplace Before moving on to Canopy Growth  I d like to remind everyone that the core business activities  I just highlighted are driving an increase in our EPS guidance for fiscal  20 Now a few comments about our investment in Canopy Growth  which continues to have the leading market share in Canada and today the leader in global cannabis sales  We remained bullish on the Canadian cannabis market as the conversion of the illicit market to the legal market continues to strengthen  Per statistics Canada in 2018  23  of cannabis consumers obtained cannabis from the legal market  while in 2019 that number significantly improved to almost 50  In addition  retail store sales have increased significantly in every province during the last 12 months  We expect further retail sales increases as products like vape  edibles and beverages flow through the retail stores in Canada  now that Rec 2 0 products have been released  We couldn t be more excited to see these products in the marketplace as Canopy now have the ability to showcase their best in class brands and intellectual property We are also excited to see the progress the Ontario government has made to satisfy the demand of consumers by agreeing to allow more retail store openings beginning in early March  During Canopy s second quarter  they established leading recreational market share across Canada  including a noteworthy share of over 35  in Alberta  Canada s most developed provincial recreational market In the US in early December  the Canopy team introduced First   Free allowing a branded hemp derived CBD products  These products are offered in a variety of formats including softgels  oil drops and creams and are currently available for sale via e commerce on the First   Free website Overall  we re pleased with the progress of the Canopy team and what they ve accomplished in the last few months  As most of you know  in less than a week  my colleague  David Klein will assume the role of CEO at Canopy Growth  where I believe he will bring more focus and discipline to that business in executing their strategic priorities  We have also appointed Garth Hankinson as Constellation s new CFO  who will help lead our company through its next phase of growth David has been a significant contributor to our organization during his time here  His accomplishments at Constellation are numerous  and I wish him great success at Canopy  where I will continue to collaborate with him through our Canopy Board interactions  During his time at Constellation  David built an incredibly talented finance organization  which is why we re expecting a seamless transition to Garth as he assumes his new role Garth brings a wealth of experience to this critical leadership position  Most recently  serving as Senior Vice President for our Corporate Development Activities  where he s led the company s efforts in financial planning  reporting and analysis as well as mergers  acquisitions and our venture initiatives  Many of you will have the opportunity to meet Garth in the coming weeks and I would like to publicly congratulate him and welcome him to our executive management team In closing  we have accomplished a great deal on this exciting journey through the last decade  But I m equally excited and optimistic about the next 10 years as well  We have a great product portfolio in a terrific industry  We have the right strategy and an energized management team in place to execute our vision for the future I d like to reiterate two key takeaways from today s discussion  Number one  with every step we take  we are positioning Constellation for sustained long term success as we continue to premiumize the portfolio  a strategy which has paid huge dividends over the years  I m confident in the continuation of strong results for our beer business and the excellent prospects for our Wine and Spirits business going forward Number two  our powerful cash generation capability and our desire to quickly de lever and return  4 5 billion in cash to shareholders makes Constellation a compelling investment for the future  We remain steadfast in this commitment and I believe our significant debt reduction to date  coupled with our second quarter share repurchases are a testament to this commitment We have a relentless consumer obsessed focus on brands and categories that are high growth  high margin and we re working continuously to build a solid and sustainable foundation of operational excellence  financial strength and innovation  We plan to execute in these areas throughout the remainder of the year and well into the coming decade With that  I d like to turn the call over to my colleague  David  who will review the financial results of our third quarter  David David Klein    Chief Financial OfficerGood morning everyone  and thank you  Bill  It s truly    pleasure working with you and all of the wonderful people at Constellation  My time as CFO has been exciting  as well as personally and professionally fulfilling I am leaving the company in good hands with Garth as the new CFO  Throughout his 18 years at Constellation  Garth has been a significant contributor to our premiumization and growth efforts  while developing an in depth understanding of the company s business operations and finance activities  Going forward  we will continue to collaborate on key initiatives as they relate to Constellation s investment in Canopy Growth I ll certainly miss my interactions with our investors and the sell side analysts who cover Constellation  Over the years  I ve valued your ideas  suggestions and feedback and I thank you for your ongoing support  I look forward to continuing to interact with many of you in my new role at Canopy Growth Now moving to the financials  In Q3  we continued to produce strong beer operating performance and cash flow results  Our Wine and Spirits Power Brand strategy is gaining momentum as marketplace performance for these brands continues to outpace the overall category  We also recently closed the Black Velvet transaction  revised the original Wine and Spirits deal with Gallo  including a separate  but related agreement to divest the Nobilo Wine brand and signed an agreement with Kings   Convicts Brewing to divest Ballast Point Before we jump into the financial results  I d like to provide an update on guidance  We ve increased and narrowed our full year comparable basis diluted EPS range to  9 45 to  9 55  Our increased guidance range primarily reflects the updated Gallo transactions and related timing as well as strong beer operating performance  This range excludes Canopy equity earnings  which better reflects the underlying performance of our core business  We strongly urge investors to focus on this metric as the Canopy equity earnings impact is non cash Our increased FY  20 guidance now assumes the revised Wine and Spirits transactions and the Ballast Point transaction closed by the end of the fiscal  20  We expect the Nobilo transactions to close in the first half of fiscal  21 As Bill mentioned  we believe efforts to divest remaining brands from the original transaction along with incremental cash flow generated from the delay in timing of the transaction  will get us relatively close to the value outlined in our original divestiture agreement with Gallo  This assumes we realized the full value of the earn out After completing these transformation activities  we believe the Wine and Spirits business will be positioned to produce mid single digit top line growth  while migrating to an operating margin of 30  over time Now let s review Q3 performance and our full year outlook in more detail  where I ll generally focus on comparable basis financial results  Starting with beer  Net sales increased 8  on shipment volume growth of nearly 7   The reversal of the year end fiscal 2019 over shipment was minimal in Q3 and came in lower than previously anticipated  We expect the remainder of the shipment s timing benefit from fiscal  19 to reverse in Q4 Depletion volume growth for our import portfolio showed continued strength growing nearly 8   As Bill mentioned  this was mostly driven by continued strong performance of Modelo Especial  When including an unfavorable impact from Ballast Point  total beer depletions were up 7 3   In Q4  we pick up the additional selling day that we lost in Q2  which will help us achieve high single digit depletion growth in Q4 Beer operating margins increased 200 basis points to 39 3   benefits from pricing and COGS were partially offset by higher marketing and SG A  COGS benefits were largely driven by FX  a one time contractor cost reimbursement and an inventory build ahead of our SAP S 4HANA implementation  The contractor cost recovery and the inventory build helped us outperform our margin expectations for the quarter I am pleased to report that the first phase of our SAP S 4HANA implementation for our beer operations in Mexico was completed ahead of schedule and with excellent execution by the team  This is an important milestone after more than a year of planning  designing and training for this important initiative  We ll continue to update you on upcoming milestones of our S 4HANA implementation Marketing as a percent of net sales increased 30 basis points to 11   Marketing spend for the quarter was slightly below expectations  We expect fiscal  20 marketing as a percent of net sales to be in the 9 5  to 10  range  For fiscal  20  we now expect net sales growth of 7  to 8   This includes 1  to 2  of pricing within our Mexican portfolio  As a result of the planned reversal of fiscal  19 shipment timing benefit  we expect full year fiscal  20 depletion volume growth to land about 1 percentage point ahead of shipment volume growth  We also expect fiscal  20 operating income growth of 8  to 9  and our full year operating margin to be in the range of 39 5  to 40   which is an improvement compared to the previous year and prior FY  20 guidance of 39 3  As we move toward next year  we re excited about our plans to launch Corona Hard Seltzer at the beginning of fiscal  21  There will be some investment in production costs  as we ramp up production for this major innovation in addition to the significant marketing investment Bill mentioned earlier Moving to Wine and Spirits  Net sales declined 10  on shipments that were down 14   Depletions declined 6   Q3 results outperformed our previously communicated expectations primarily due to a shipment timing benefit  Our third quarter Wine and Spirits results were somewhat impacted by a shift in Thanksgiving holiday timing with retailer and distributor replenishment shifting to the fourth quarter  Last year there was one full week post Thanksgiving to fully replenish In addition to the shift of the Thanksgiving holiday  we continue to be impacted by transition activities with distributors and lapped some lower quality sales incentives and pricing activities that we ve decided not to repeat in order to better align with our strategy for the business going forward Wine and Spirits operating margin decreased 80 basis points to 26 2   as mix benefits were more than offset by higher COGS and higher SG A as a percent of net sales  Higher COGS mostly reflect freight cost headwinds  The higher SG A as a percent of net sales  included marketing investments driven by the continued support of the Power Brands  including new product development initiatives and Meiomi advertising in the quarter We now expect fiscal  20 Wine and Spirits net sales and operating income to decline 8  to 10   Our updated guidance reflects the revised transaction close assumptions discussed earlier  As part of the Wine and Spirits Transactions  we remain committed to our  130 million stranded cost reduction plan  which we now expect to be realized over the fiscal  21 to fiscal  22 timeframe  I remain confident that the Wine and Spirits Transformation strategy is working Power Brands performance continues to benefit from our increased focus and marketing investments  In fiscal  20  we re running a bit short of our mid single digit Power Brand depletion growth target  largely due to the activities I mentioned earlier  However  Power Brands are driving mix benefits and gaining share in IRI channels and you should expect to see a sequential improvement in depletion trends in Q4 When you include these mix benefits  we believe our portfolio post divestitures is on track to achieve our longer term targets  including mid single digit net sales growth  while migrating to an operating margin of 30  Fiscal year to date corporate expenses came in at  149 million  up slightly versus Q3 year to date last year  We now expect full year corporate expenses to approximate  230 million  reflecting an increase for insurance related costs  higher incentive compensation and the ramp in IT spend  which includes our S 4HANA implementation and other digital enablement activities We expect our SG A to decrease by the end of fiscal  22  once our digital enablement activities are fully implemented  when we can eliminate redundant IT costs and realize the benefits of the new platforms In Q3  comparable basis interest expense increased 11   This primarily reflects additional interest expense related to the funding of our incremental Canopy Growth investment in fiscal    in November of 2018  Fiscal  20 interest expense is now expected to approximate  430 million Our Q3 comparable basis effective tax rate  excluding Canopy equity earnings came in at 17 5  versus 14 1  last year  This increase primarily reflects lower stock based compensation benefits  We now expect our full year fiscal  20 comparable effective tax rate  excluding Canopy equity earnings to approximate 18   The 1 percentage point rate increase versus our guidance is primarily due to the impact of lower stock based compensation benefits and higher expense for miscellaneous tax items than we previously forecasted  I d like to note that we expect our full year cash tax rate to be in the mid to high single digit range Let s move to free cash flow  which we define as net cash provided by operating activities plus capex  We generated free cash flow of  1 5 billion for the first nine months of fiscal  20  This represents an impressive 14  increase  Free cash flow improvement primarily reflects strong operating cash flow and lower capex We now expect full year capex spend of  700 million to  800 million versus our original guidance of  800 million to  900 million  This includes approximately  560 million of capex for our Mexico beer operations expansion  including investments in the Obregon and Mexicali breweries as well as the fifth glass furnace at the Nava glass plant  We expect fiscal  20 operating cash flow to be in the range of  2 2 billion to  2 4 billion and free cash flow to be in the range of  1 5 billion to  1 6 billion Now let s discuss several impacts that were excluded from Q3 comparable basis results  Last quarter  we noted that we expected to recognize a loss in Q3 on the writedown of assets held for sale related to our transaction with Gallo  The actual writedown of  340 million was largely driven by the  250 million of contingent consideration associated with the revised transaction price Accounting rules governed our election to record the contingent consideration when it s determined to be realizable  We also recognized  547 million of net income tax benefit resulting from the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets in connection with tax reform in Switzerland Moving to Canopy  The total pre tax net gain recognized since our initial Canopy investment in November 2017 is  223 million  In Q3  we recognized  534 million decrease in the fair value of the Canopy investment  As a reminder  Constellation s original warrants with Canopy have an exercise price of CAD12 98 per share and will expire on May 1  2020 and represent less than  200 million in consideration In addition  the Tranche A warrants expire on November  1 of 2023  The company will evaluate exercise of each of these warrants immediately prior to expiration and does not plan to make additional cash contributions to Canopy beyond the potential exercise of these warrants I would like to close with some comments on capital allocation  First and foremost  as Bill mentioned  Constellation remains committed to it s goal of returning  4 5 billion to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases over the fiscal  20 to fiscal  22 timeframe I am pleased to report that in Q3  we returned to our targeted leverage ratio range  This was at the early end of the 12 to 18 month timeframe we committed to when we closed on the Canopy investments  excludes non cash Canopy related equity earnings  Continued deleveraging  driven by the company s strong cash flow generation capabilities should provide the flexibility to be opportunistic and increase share repurchases as we move into fiscal  21 and  22 As I reflect on my time as CFO at Constellation  I m proud to have been in this role during a time of significant value creation  I remain bullish about Constellation s prospects and believe the company has the right strategy in place to produce top tier performance for many years to come  I look forward to creating value for Canopy s shareholders including Constellation in my new role at Canopy Growth With that  Bill and I are happy to take your questions Questions and Answers Operator Operator Instructions  Our first question comes from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala with Credit Suisse  Your line is now open Kaumil Gajrawala    Credit Suisse    AnalystHey  good afternoon everybody  David  congratulations  A question on Seltzer  it s obviously going to be an incredibly competitive category for calendar 2020  What s going to make your proposition different and how are you thinking about  of our marketing spend and investment given that it seems like it s really building up to be a pretty significantly competitive category this summer And then second separately  on your deleverage comments  are you happy to keep the levels that where they are now and everything incremental from here is a buyback to manage to those levels  Or should we be thinking about it differently  Thank you Bill Newlands    President and Chief Executive OfficerSure  I ll take the first half of that  we re very excited about Corona Hard Seltzer in part  just because of the refreshment DNA that s attached to the Corona brand  We obviously have done a lot of product testing  a lot of product research to make sure that we have a product that meets or exceeds the other key players in the marketplace  So we are quite comfortable with the the sheer quality of the product that we re going to bring to the table  And as usual our marketing department will bring outstanding consumer communications as they always do around our critical brands The last thing I would say is  we still believe that there is a lot of upside in the total size of the Seltzer business  It was roughly 60 million cases in 2019  and we believe there could be a two to three times    2 to 3x opportunity going forward  And we expect to take a significant share of that opportunity David Klein    Chief Financial OfficerYeah  Kaumil on the buybacks  our targeted range is three to four times  Our preference would be at the midpoint of the range  but now that we re    now that we re back in the range we will definitely look to be opportunistic as we move forward OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets  Your line is now open Nik Modi    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystYeah  thanks  good morning everyone  David  let me  second the congratulations on your new opportunity  So the question is really around  if I can go back to capital allocation  still  obviously a lot of investors for years have been concerned about Constellation s capital allocation decisions  and the last few months have been tough  right  with Ballast Point with Canopy value declines  So maybe just kind of give us a state of the union from your perspective  kind of what you ve learned as an organization from from Ballast Point in particular  And how you think about this capital deployment outside of obviously the buyback stuff that you guys have already committed to  just to give people a sense of kind of how you re thinking about it philosophically  as you kind of go into year two of being CEO of this company Bill Newlands    President and Chief Executive OfficerSure  I think one of the things and David just pointed that out  we remain as committed as we always have to getting ourselves into the range and as he said  we re pleased that we have gotten into the top end of our range earlier than we had anticipated  We have a tremendous amount of opportunity with our core existing franchisees  You have seen and you will continue to see a relentless focus on the critical categories and brands that we see as high margin  high growth opportunities and we will invest to take significant share within those  where we see issues and problems  much like you point out the Ballast Point or the low end of our wine business  we are prepared to take action to make sure we are focused on where the consumer is going  rather than where they have been  And those are two examples of that I think what that will do  well that will allow us to continue to focus all of our attention on the premiumization play both in the beer business and the Wine and Spirit business  so that we continue to be the leader and when someone sits in this chair 10 years from now  they ll be able to tell the same story that I just told  which is a great decade of tremendous growth for our company and for our shareholders OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer with Cowen  Your line is now open Vivien Azer    Cowen    AnalystHi  good morning  I would also my congrats to you  David and I really look forward to working with you as part of my coverage of Canopy  So Bill  I just wanted to follow up on your commentary around the dislocation that you think Hard Seltzer is driving based on the consumer insights you offered  Do you think it s kind of broad based and it s under indexing to imported beer  How are you thinking    not asking for guidance for fiscal  21  but are you expecting that dynamic to shift given the introduction of Corona Hard Seltzer and perhaps put it more specifically  how much cannibalization might you guys be expecting in terms of interaction between your core Corona offerings and that Hard Seltzer proposition  Thank you Bill Newlands    President and Chief Executive OfficerWell  the thing that excites us about the Corona Seltzer introduction is that  first of all the category appears to continue to have real strength  And this has a lot of growth potential in it  As I said a moment ago  I think there s probably 2x to 3x  where it sits today  which creates tremendous opportunity for those of us  who are going to play in the category I think  our expectation would be that we would have a similar type of cannibalization profile that we saw around Premier  which is as you might recall  was in the 70  to 75  range Incremental  So this  we think this is a great opportunity for us  But  I would also urge all of you on the call to keep in mind  as they get as exciting as this launch will be  Modelo Especial is likely to be our single biggest grower next year  This continues to be a brand that is absolutely on fire  It grew 15  in the most recent period and it had 30 plus consecutive years of double digit growth  This is a brand that s going to be and remain a significant foundational play for this company for many  many years to come OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies  Your line is now open Kevin Grundy    Jefferies    AnalystHey  good morning everyone  And David  I want to extend my congratulations as well  I wanted to pick up on the beer guidance  So Bill  you sounded pretty positive  despite some of the slowing that we saw on the Nelson data  I think you would attribute it to pricing  But as I look at the midpoint  if my math is right  it implies about 7 5  organic sales growth  The year over year comp is easier if you do get an additional selling day  Can you talk about maybe what you re seeing in the business  Corona looks a little bit light  Premier looks like it s decelerated a bit  is there anything that gives you a cause    a bit of pause here with the base portfolio in terms of some deceleration  And then given that  as we look at the 7  to 9  longer term growth that you ve expressed confidence in over the intermediate term  and the fact that we had to tweak it modestly lower this year  should that be at all concerning for investors looking out to next year  Thank you Bill Newlands    President and Chief Executive OfficerSure  No  I think you should be very positive about our expectations around our core business  We were particularly excited that the Corona Extra business returned and renewed in growth in the third quarter  As I stated  certainly the price increases that we talk  particularly in the State of California  gave us a very brief factor that you saw in the most recent IRI data  But we do not expect that to have any impact on our longer term trends  And in fact as I alluded to earlier  our December depletion growth profile overall was in the high single digit range  which is ahead of our year to date trends So we remain very very bullish  And when you think about things like Modelo and Pacifico and the addition of our Seltzer business  I think you re going to see a continued strong delivery against our business in the range that we had said we would do  and that we will deliver for this year OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley  Your line is now open Dara Mohsenian    Morgan Stanley    AnalystHey  good morning guys  Also want to extend my congrats to David  Just two quick clarifications on the beer business  Bill  you mentioned that as high single digit depletion growth in December  I think that included an extra day though  So ex the extra day  what type of rate are you trending at  And then David  you mentioned the contractor and inventory timing benefit of margins in the quarter  can you give us a sense of how much that was And those are more clarifications  if you give me the benefit of additional question  you guys did comment on the fabulous track record of beer volume growth over the last decade and kudos for that  obviously an amazing track record  but if you do look at the year to date depletion growth of 7   it s below that 9  to 10  pace from the prior few years  I know it s close to what you guys originally expected  But just at a high level  taking a step back  just curious for your perspective  and if the slowdown this fiscal year  that s just more of a natural maturation as you move the larger case volumes  if we should expect sort of a gradual slowdown in depletion over time on larger numbers or if there were more discrete issues driving the sequential slowdown this year and this is not sort of the start of a moderation trend as you look out longer term  Thanks Bill Newlands    President and Chief Executive OfficerSo relative to the our depletion trends for the fourth quarter  we expect fully expect that our depletion trends for the fourth quarter are going to be in the high single digit range  much like the December presented itself  Look we remain extremely bullish about the long range prospects for our beer business  we are significantly  significantly outperforming the overall category as well as the high end of the category as well and that s before we introduced Hard Seltzer product  which will compete in an area that admittedly has gotten very big  very fast So this will provide us with I think renewed opportunity for growth and we are very excited about the prospects for that going into the new fiscal year  Obviously as a reminder  we will give fiscal guidance during our next call  So we will refrain from doing that at this point in time  but certainly  we re very excited not only about the fourth quarter and finishing our year very strongly  but for next year as well David Klein    Chief Financial OfficerYeah  Dara on the contractor settlement  even in the year S 4HANA kind of production build that we did in in Q3 that gave us a benefit  these are all a few to several million dollars each  And if you think about last year  just rewind to last year  I think in Q3  we had an issue with glass production in the quarter  So we get these impacts every single quarter that I would call it  3 million to  7 million each And sometimes they kind of aggregate in our favor  sometimes they go against us  but if you look at our total operating margins in say FY  18  we re at 39 5   FY  19 we re at 39 3  and this year we re saying we re going to be between 39 5  to 40   I think by the time you get to the end of the year all these little timing  they just go away and we end up in a pretty consistent margin range in this business  which I ll point out maybe for the last time is by far our best in class in North American brewing  You can come back and say that   Indecipherable   if you want OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Amit Sharma with BMO Capital Markets  Your line is now open Amit Sharma    BMO    AnalystHi  good morning everyone Bill Newlands    President and Chief Executive OfficerHi good morning Amit Sharma    BMO    AnalystJust a couple of questions  one on beer  Bill  talked about the long term outlook  and it looks like you re still confident on high single digit  Can you talk about Modelo in particular  it s still growing double digit  but some people are little bit concerned about the decel that we saw recently  Can you talk about what is in the pipeline from a Modelo perspective  as you look to continue this momentum  And then wine  David  good to hear 30  operating margin outlook still intact for that business  Can you talk about the timeline of the stranded cost as they come out post the divestiture of the lower price brands  Thanks Bill Newlands    President and Chief Executive OfficerSure  I d say  and I ve said this many times  I think Modelo remains the single largest opportunity for this company  It is just beginning to craft into the general market  if this had a very  very strong run with its core Hispanic base and continues to grow with that audience and as many of you know  we do have a great tailwind with the growth of the Hispanic consumer in the United States  which will continue to give us a tailwind for a fair amount of time  But as you know our advertising in our marketing activities around the Modelo have been expanded to a broader audience and the growth profile within the non Hispanic consumer is tremendous  So we see a remaining tremendous upside in Modelo Going to your question that about what else  we will be introducing the more Modelito products  so in different size we have size opportunities  And as you all know  we have done nothing truly to innovate around Modelo outside of the Corona business which has done extremely well for us  So we think Modelo is going to continue to be a juggernaut well into the next decade  and will likely be the single largest growth product and brand for us going forward David Klein    Chief Financial OfficerYeah  on the topic of stranded costs  it s a bit of the story we told at the beginning of this year  almost on a one year delay  we were saying it s a  130 million stranded costs without getting into specifics  that will be included  when we provide guidance next quarter  You can assume that a quarter to a third of those costs come out in FY  21  the rest in FY  22  because we have the flow through COGS to hit before it hits our P L  So like FY  23 will be the first real clean year where we can take a look at that  seeing a lot of stranded costs coming up or being out OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays  Your line is now open Lauren Lieberman    Barclays    AnalystGreat  thanks  Good morning  So I was hoping you can talk a little bit about the increased marketing spend on Corona  because last quarter  right  you took the opportunity to say look beer profitability is coming in a bit ahead of plan  we ll put some extra money behind Corona  And clearly  there s been some reaction  but at the same time  the marketing spend on beer came in a little bit light of plan  So if you can just give us some color on why the spend was a little bit lighter  kind of the plans looking forward  And what in that marketing mix has particularly    had a particularly attractive return would be interesting  Thanks Bill Newlands    President and Chief Executive OfficerSure  And I ll comment on the kind of timing of spend and it really is  it s a timing issue  We expect that we will finish the year  let s say in the 9 5  to 10  range of net sales  At the same time  we expect that we will see an uptick in our marketing spend in Q4 this year versus Q4 last year  Some of that having to do with incremental investment behind our core brands  but also some of that having to do with basically production costs around the Seltzer marketing campaign that Bill outlined earlier  So I think for marketing for us  it really is just a function of timing as we still are focused on a 9 5  to 10  range OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Robert Ottenstein with Evercore ISI  Your line is now open Robert Ottenstein    Evercore ISI    AnalystGreat  thank you very much  A couple of just kind of follow up clarifications  First  it looks to us that the price mix was about 1 6   Can you give us a sense of what that would have been without Ballast Point  And then second  following up on some of the comments on Corona Seltzer  you made some comments that it s being well received by retailers  can you give us a sense of how you see the shelf sets coming out next year  where Corona Seltzer is going to be positioned on the shelf versus beer versus other White Claw And then if you look at the White Claw trends  they ve been unbelievable  right  I mean  they ve    and they re actually increasing share  I think the latest share is something like 67  up from 60   What gives you the confidence that this is actually a Hard Seltzer segment as opposed to a White Claw segment and that there is room for a lot of new competitors  Thank you Bill Newlands    President and Chief Executive OfficerSure  So let s talk about the the sets and where we expect to see Seltzer  Seltzer is in all likelihood not going to take space from our core beer franchise the consumer views it as something different  The retailers viewing it as something different  whether it s on the shelf or in the cold box  So we think there will be a distinct differentiation of product location versus just cannibalizing existing shelf space  That s the way it s been so far  we believe that will continue This    the answer to your question regarding whether this is a category or a brand  I think we ve solved that answer for ourselves with research  Our consumer and the Seltzer consumer is very interested in the idea of Corona Hard Seltzer  in part because of what I said earlier  which is a whole refreshment DNA around the core Corona brand  The strength of Corona in that whole refreshment relaxation beach experience is perfect for this  As we said earlier  that the Seltzer consumer is    has generally been increasing their overall consumption of the total alcoholic beverage category  which I think speaks well for the overall category of Seltzers going forward  and the strength of the Corona brand name together with the investment that we re going to make against it  We re quite bullish on it David Klein    Chief Financial OfficerAnd Robert on the price mix question  it might be  if we were just looking at imports  it might be 10 basis points to 15 basis points  but not    additional to that  not much more OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank  Your line is now open Steve Powers    Deutsche Bank    AnalystThanks and congratulations from me too David  Maybe coming at the beer outlook from another direction  Just coming back and coming into calendar  19 at the Beer Event in Chicago  you guys were pretty adamant the beer margins would trend flattish  more or less in line with where you finished last year  call it 39 5  as you said  But now we re three quarters into fiscal  20  beer margins have exceeded expectations three quarters in a row  raising the full year outlook and arguably 4Q would seem to have potential upside embedded in that as well acknowledging some of the 3Q benefits that could reverse I guess as you step back  does any of that change or go forward thinking as to where beer margins could ultimately aspire to especially without the recent drag from Ballast  I mean is there  I guess is there a structural upside to your prior outlook  Or do you attribute the recent strength just to some of those timing that you had mentioned earlier  David Bill Newlands    President and Chief Executive OfficerSo I ll start with that  and David can add as he would like  During that discussion  one of the things we were quite clear about relative to our guidance is there will be some years where things go our way  costs are better  FX is better  certain things just simply are favorable to what we would view as sustainable long term proposition around our margin structure  This year has been one of those and we re certainly happy to take it  But it s also realistic to recognize that those things can go either way  As I said  this year it has gone in our favor  and we continue to work  As you would expect on our operational footprint to make sure we are extracting every ounce of opportunity as it relates to cost  but this year on our way and we re quite pleased that it had  David  you want to David Klein    Chief Financial OfficerYeah  Steve  I would say that we are  pleased  I m convinced we have some of the best operations people on the planet in order to produce the results that we do on a consistent basis  A note of caution is though is that  I think we ve been clear about this is that when we are in the launch year from a Seltzer standpoint  we know that we re going to be driving toward the high end of our marketing spend as a percent of SG A range  We also know as I said in my script that there are going to be some drag on gross margins as we come out of the gate on Seltzers However  we ve also said that we believe over time Seltzers don t have to be a drag and we don t expect them to be a drag over time  right  So I think you re going to see puts and takes in our business as Bill outlined  but I m actually pretty pleased with the consistency of margins in that  as I said 39 5 ish percent range for three years in a row Bill Newlands    President and Chief Executive OfficerI would just add on to David s comments that  much like our beer margin structure is best of class  I think you would expect that our Seltzer margin structure as we get to critical mass will also be best of class versus the competition OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira with JP Morgan  Your line is now open Andrea Teixeira    JPMorgan    AnalystHi  good morning  David  congratulations also on your promotion and thank you for your work as a CFO of Constellation  So my question is a follow up on the comment about increased investment on the Seltzer marketing  Should we budget part of it already in the fourth quarter and also increase in early first quarter in fiscal 2021  because I understand the launch is early fiscal year in March     early March  so relative to the typical launches or the typical innovation that happens around Syncrude  Phonetic  And a clarification  if I will  and shifting gears a little bit for Wine and Spirits  So the implied fourth quarter Wine and Spirits profit guidance  it s down  so far it s down 13  year to date  So the full year is down 8  to 10   which implies that you have an improved performance in the fourth quarter  So if you can elaborate on that as well  Thank you Bill Newlands    President and Chief Executive OfficerYes  so on marketing spend  we expect that our spend will be up on a year over year basis in Q4  And that s the    you can kind of calculate back to get into that 9 5  to 10  range  As I said  that s most likely the Seltzer production    marketing production costs  And then we think that the spend will be a little bit weighted to the first quarter and certainly the first half of the year  while we re just getting the product on the shelf  and want to make sure that we re driving a lot of consumer activity at that point in time OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Bill Kirk with MKM Partners  Your line is now open Bill Kirk    MKM Partners    AnalystThank you  So I have a quick question on cannabis  obviously you ve worked with Canopy on the beverage launch up in Canada  and as I understand it  Acreage can bring Canopy s IP technology including that beverage technology to the US  So I guess my question is  would you want Acreage in the US to start making the products that you developed with Canopy Bill Newlands    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I think the best thing that  so it s not our decision  Let me just be clear about that  It s Acreage s decision  but to the extent that we develop outstanding products for use in the Canadian market  if Acreage can bring those to the US and they are comfortable to do so  we think that as a home run all around  it s like throughout our cannabis ecosystem  if you will  That s a benefit to Canopy  that s a benefit to Acreage and some of our Constellation team has been helpful in making sure that the products are meeting the expectations of the consumer and the marketplace OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Sean King with UBS  Your line is now open Sean King    UBS    AnalystHi  thanks  You called out Refresca the growth driver  but it s still looks pretty small in the track channels  Where do you stand in terms of  I guess  a national roll out strategy  And how do you expect Seltzer to interact with Refresca  I guess on the shelf Bill Newlands    President and Chief Executive OfficerYes  we re very pleased with the Refresca  It has outperformed what our expectations were  And we re going to continue to invest behind it to make sure it continues to grow  As I said a little earlier  we don t expect the shelf interaction to get in the way between our Seltzer and our and our Refresca businesses  We think they serve different needs  although admittedly  there is some interaction between an FMB consumer and a Seltzer consumer  But we think there is room for both of those products in the market and we re looking forward to seeing continued acceleration of both the Refresca franchise as well as the    as well as Hard Seltzer when it comes out OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell with SunTrust  Your line is now open Bill Chappell    SunTrust    AnalystThank you so much  And David  congratulations  Two quick ones  Any kind of guidance on what the peso versus the dollar impacted beer margins this quarter or is that more to come in future quarters  And then also in terms of kind of what you talked about marketing spin  and following Andrea s question  is this similar  when we look at the first quarter of 2021 to what we saw 18 months ago with the roll out of Premier in terms of kind of pulling forward marketing more spending very front end loaded or is it more balanced throughout the year Bill Newlands    President and Chief Executive OfficerYes  so on FX and again  we get some volatility in FX  and our team  I think does a nice job of trying to lock in bumps in the peso  which gives us a little tailwind  especially given the volatility between the USD and the peso over the last couple of years  right  So we think that in the quarter that was about 60 basis points of impact on margins  And then  yeah  I think you can think about it a lot like Premier  So kind of the spread throughout the quarters of the year should look just like the Premier launch OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Laurent Grandet with Guggenheim  Your line is now open Laurent Grandet    Guggenheim    AnalystYes  good morning  Bill and David  I d like to have a question on Corona Premier and Familiar  specifically  we re getting Familiar when looking at the Nielsen data over the last few periods  we are seeing an accelerated  I mean decline  So is it deliberate choice as it seems  and you keep mentioning it  you are incurring Corona in the refreshment space  that s something I may not fit  and to provide more space for Modelo to grow And then on Corona Premier  growth is plateauing  it seems like it s getting to the size of Corona Light  so is there any sense you can revamp that brand and reaccelerate the growth  Or are you satisfied with the current performance of Corona Premier  So those two  Thank you Bill Newlands    President and Chief Executive OfficerSo relative to Familiar  Familiar continues to do very well  particularly in the core Hispanic community  which is where it was originally targeted  So we continue to think that Familiar is going to be an important part  particularly with the Hispanic consumer in very specific demographics and very specific geographic regional opportunities Relative to Premier  Premier continues to do very nicely and we re excited about it  Obviously there has been some impact to cannibalization that has occurred  has been impacting  as you would expect to some degree  But Premier also opens up a bunch of new consumers to our franchise as well  who are looking more for that low carb positioning that Premier presents  So we remain very bullish on the future for Premier  and we re going to continue to invest against that franchise going forward  And again  it goes right back to  we are always pleased when more and more consumers spend more and more dollars against the overall Corona franchise  People believe in this franchise  It is the Number 1  as I said before  Number 1 most trusted brand with both Hispanic and non Hispanic consumers 21 to 54  And that gives us the chance to continue to leverage new introductions like Refresca  Premier  and Hard Seltzer which is obviously coming in this coming fiscal year So we remain very bullish on the overall Corona franchise and I think the fact that franchise was one of the few growth brand franchises over the course of the last decade  shows the real longevity for that brand OperatorI m showing no further questions in queue at this time  I would like to turn the call back to Bill Newlands for closing remarks Bill Newlands    President and Chief Executive OfficerWell  thanks very much  And I guess I d be remiss David  if I didn t say that all the congratulations you just received are well deserved

what a powerful decade this has been for Constellation  Our results over the past 10 years are a testament to the dynamic strategic efforts made by our strong management team  Through our current initiatives and priorities  we are positioning this company for a sustained long term success and therefore we are just as excited and optimistic that the next 10 years will continue the momentum into the fourth quarter as well as a strong finish to this fiscal year As a reminder  during our next quarterly call as I said earlier  we will be providing guidance for the upcoming fiscal year  So thanks

112124,333639,STZ,Earnings Preview  Constellation Brands  STZ  Q3 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Constellation Brands  STZ  reports results for the quarter ended November 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 8  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This wine  liquor and beer company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 90 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  19 8  
Revenues are expected to be  1 95 billion  down 0 9  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Constellation Brands 
For Constellation Brands  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  3 07  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Constellation Brands will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Constellation Brands would post earnings of  2 61 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 72  delivering a surprise of  4 21  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Constellation Brands doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2020-01-01,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-constellation-brands-stz-q3-earnings-expected-to-decline-200495830,200495830
112125,333640,STZ,3 Stocks To Watch This Week  Walgreens  Bed  Bath   Beyond  Constellation,opinion,"There s a new source of volatility confronting investors when the markets resume normal trading on Monday  following the U S  s targeted killing of Iranian military leader Major General Qassem Soleimani in an airstrike in Baghdad on Thursday 
The complex nature of this conflict between the U S  and Iran  which is a Middle Eastern regional power  makes it hard to predict how it might affect the U S  economy  which is in a strong growth mode  helping the domestic markets to reach new highs 
Despite economic optimism  stocks are likely to come under pressure at least in the short run after this sharp escalation  The Middle East will be the focal point for next week s trading 
Some companies  however  will be reporting quarterly earnings in the week to come  We believe these three stocks could see some price swings after they report 
1  Walgreens
Walgreens Boots Alliance  NASDAQ WBA   the second largest pharmacy operator in the U S   will report Q1 earnings on Wednesday  Jan  8  before the market opens  Analysts expect an EPS of  1 41 a share in the quarter ending November on revenues of  34 6 billion 

The Deerfield  Illinois based company has been implementing a cost cutting drive as its market share comes under pressure with growing competition from Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  and other players  In October  the drug seller said it plans to cut another  300 million from its annual costs as it expects growth to flatten in the current fiscal year 
The drug store operator s aim is to streamline its retail operations and prioritize the digital transformation of some functions  The company said in August that it intends to close 200 U S  locations on top of a previously announced cut of as many as 750 stores 
Adjusted earnings per share will be  roughly flat  in fiscal 2020  Walgreens told investors at that time  Due to these pressures  its shares have massively underperformed the broader market during the past year  falling more than 12   Shares closed unchanged on Friday at  59 08 
2  Bed  Bath   Beyond
If U S  consumers continued to spend in the final three months of 2019  as reports of the holiday retail season suggest  then we re going to see some evidence of this strength when the embattled home furnishing and housewares giant  Bed Bath   Beyond  NASDAQ BBBY  reports its fiscal Q3 earnings on Wednesday  Jan  8 after the market close 

Analyst consensus estimates the retailer will report  2 85 billion in sales  while making  0 02 per share profit  The retailer is in the middle of a massive turnaround after failing to revamp its business model in order to survive the onslaught of e commerce giants  
Last month  the company announced that a half dozen top executives are leaving the chain  including the heads of merchandising  marketing  digital and legal  Earlier this year  Bed Bath   Beyond replaced several directors  including the chain s co founders  amid pressure from activist investors  As well  it has been conducting a strategic review of its portfolio of roughly 1 500 stores 
Encouraged by these efforts  investors have sent BBBY shares higher by more than 50  in the past three months  They closed on Friday at  16 08 after falling 1 5  
3  Constellation Brands
Also on Wednesday  the U S  based producer of Corona beer  Constellation Brands  NYSE STZ  will  come under investor scrutiny when it reports Q3 earnings for the 2020 fiscal year before the opening bell  The Victor  N Y  based beer  wine and spirits maker is anticipated to show  1 9 billion in revenue and  1 84 of profit per share 

In the past few quarters  earnings have been pressured by the  4 billion stake the company has in marijuana producer  Canopy Growth   NYSE CGC   The Canadian cannabis company is struggling to show profitability  a challenge faced by other pot producers in the sector 
In the previous quarter  Constellation reported a  525 2 million loss in the second quarter  weighed down by paper losses in its Canopy Growth investment  Its stake in Canopy shrank by about  1 3 billion of value in Q2  including a  839 million decline in Canopy s share price 
 Canopy s business is rapidly evolving  and the financial results will likely be volatile   Constellation s finance chief  David Klein  told analysts in October  The company s share price has fallen more than 5  in the past six months  It was up 0 6  on Friday to close at  189 53 ",2020-01-05,Haris Anwar/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-stocks-to-watch-this-week-walgreens-bed-bath--beyond-constellation-200496430,200496430
112126,333641,STZ,Constellation Brands  STZ  Q3 Earnings And Revenues Beat Estimates,opinion,"Constellation Brands  STZ  came out with quarterly earnings of  2 14 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 84 per share  This compares to earnings of  2 37 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 16 30   A quarter ago  it was expected that this wine  liquor and beer company would post earnings of  2 61 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 72  delivering a surprise of 4 21  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
Constellation Brands  which belongs to the Zacks Beverages   Alcohol industry  posted revenues of  2 billion for the quarter ended November 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 29   This compares to year ago revenues of  1 97 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Constellation Brands shares have lost about 3 2  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 0 2  
What s Next for Constellation Brands 
While Constellation Brands has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Constellation Brands was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  1 65 on  1 77 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  8 49 on  8 18 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year 
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  Beverages   Alcohol is currently in the bottom 10  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2020-01-07,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/constellation-brands-stz-q3-earnings-and-revenues-beat-estimates-200497331,200497331
112151,333666,STZ,Will Canopy Growth Weigh Heavily on Constellation Brands in Q3 ,news,"Constellation Brands  NYSE STZ  is trying to get its house in order after going on a spending spree over the past few years in an attempt to drive growth  Thus far  most of those efforts have failed to deliver  so now  it s refocusing on a group of premium brands and future growth opportunities 
With its third quarter earnings release scheduled for Jan  8  investors will want to know whether the adult beverage company s plans are on track  even though its forays beyond its core competency are likely to weigh on performance again 

Brewing up trouble
Constellation Brands is now shedding some of the businesses it picked up during that spending spree  In December  it announced it was selling Ballast Point Brewing  The price was not disclosed  but it was likely dramatically less than the  1 billion it paid for the craft brewer back in 2015 
As growth in the craft beer segment began to slow  Constellation was forced to write down the value of the brewer  It paid an absurd amount for the regional brewer to begin with    some  3 400 per barrel  But in the context of a pair of deals from 2019    Boston Beer paying  1 000 per barrel for Dogfish Head Brewing  and Anheuser Busch InBev  NYSE  BUD  spending less than  500 per barrel for Craft Brew Alliance  NASDAQ  BREW     it s even more clear how steeply Constellation overpaid 
But the beer business isn t all bad for Constellation  Its Corona and Modelo brands continue to post strong sales as Mexican beer remains popular  but even within that portfolio  results are hit and miss  Modelo Especial has been a surprise hit  generating the fastest growth in the company s entire U S  beer category  Depletions  i e   sales to distributors and retailers  grew 15  in the third quarter  But sales of Corona Extra were flat  Still  Corona has tremendous brand value    it s the sixth largest beer brand in the country    so Constellation expects that it will gain significant additional traction in the years ahead 
Not greening the portfolio
Where the company is not expecting upbeat results is with its investment in marijuana producer Canopy Growth  NYSE CGC   which along with much of the rest of the Canadian marijuana industry suffered a collapse in value in 2019 
Although Canopy remains the global leader in cannabis sales  the business suffered huge losses this year that were fueled by an out of control stock based compensation system  The board subsequently fired its CEO  and in December  Constellation announced it was installing its CFO in the executive position to rein in its investment  The situation isn t likely to turn around quickly  Constellation admits that results from the pot producer will be volatile and that it may need to write down the value of its stake in the business 
Yet there is potential here  because it s also clear that the regulatory and ramp up issues in the Canadian market will eventually get sorted out  In the interim  Canopy has the launch of new marijuana infused beverages to look forward now that the Cannabis 2 0 market is rolling out in Canada  New edibles  including chocolates and baked goods  will be part of it  and these new products could be a salve to the business 
Premium opportunities
What Constellation Brands wants most is to fashion itself into a premium adult beverage business  Across beer  wine  and spirits  the trend toward premium priced  high end beverages has been the one constant in recent years 
Constellation tried to sell its low end line of wines and spirits to E J  Gallo for  1 7 billion  but the plan ran into some antitrust concerns  and it had to revise the deal to remove some brands and cut the purchase price to around  1 1 billion  Constellation still intends to sell off the remaining low end lines  As President and CEO Bill Newlands told analysts last quarter during the earnings call   We will continue to maintain our focus on premiumization  innovation  and brand building as the transformation strategy evolves for our wine and spirit business  
More struggles to come
Analysts forecast that Constellation s sales will decline 1  to  1 95 billion for the quarter as the portfolio realignment takes hold  but they re also forecasting a 20  drop in earnings to  1 90 per share  Constellation doesn t offer quarterly guidance  but it did raise its full year earnings per share outlook to a range of  9 00 to  9 20    excluding the expected hit from Canopy Growth  which it adjusts for so that investors can focus on its core business 
Constellation Brands stock rose 18  in 2019  and if it can continue pushing its way to the leadership position in premium beer  wine  and spirits  it s distinctly possible investors will push its share price even higher in 2020 ",2020-01-04,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pdjmi,2052408

112153,333668,STZ,Constellation Brands Earnings  What to Watch,news,"Shares of Constellation Brands  NYSE STZ  trounced the broader market for years as its premium imported beer brands won market share from traditional giants like Molson Coors  Yet that stock surge was disrupted in 2019 due to challenges in its wine and spirits segment  along with rocky returns from its huge investment in pot stock Canopy Growth  NYSE CGC  
Those issues will be front and center in investors  minds when Constellation Brands announces its earnings results in just a few days  while updating its outlook for the fiscal year ahead  Let s look at what shareholders might expect when the company reports Q3 results on Wednesday  Jan  8 

Portfolio updates
Constellation s growth since 2012 has been tilted toward the runaway success of imported brands like Corona and Modelo  but the beer business is even more crucial now that the company is shedding underperforming brands across its portfolio 
That shift was clear in its last earnings report  with a 6  beer volume spike being offset by the 13  slump in the wine and spirits segment  Look for Constellation to highlight market share gains in brands like Modelo  Corona  and Pacifico this week  which together accounted for most of the wider industry s growth last quarter 
The wine and spirits division should keep shrinking thanks to the smaller portfolio  But look for CEO Bill Newlands and his team to give an update on the core premium products  which they call their  power brands   These include franchises like Meiomi wines and Svedka vodkas  which Constellation is betting on to lift the broader portfolio over the next year or so  The power brands segment dipped 4  last quarter  but investors will be demanding better results from that division in time 
Refreshing the outlook
Constellation will issue two important outlook updates this week  The first will include any changes to the consumer stock s operating prediction that currently calls for beer sales to rise by about 8  in fiscal 2020 as operating income expands at the same rate  The company also sees the wine and spirits division dropping by as much as 20   mainly because of the divestment of many of its lower margin brands  Both forecasts are subject to revision on Wednesday to reflect the latest demand trends 
The bigger question mark hovers over Constellation s investment in Canopy Growth  which has so far mainly injected volatility into its earnings results without providing much return for investors  The company booked an almost  500 million noncash loss last quarter and has been vocal about its disappointment with the pot stock s poor financial performance 
David Klein  Constellation s former CFO  took over the CEO position at the marijuana giant and plans to combine cost cuts with new growth initiatives  We ll likely get more details on how Constellation s management sees the shift working out for its investment  which covers more than 40  of Canopy s equity with an option to boost that ownership level beyond 50  if the financials start to make more sense ",2020-01-05,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pdwl7,2052600

112155,333670,STZ,Canopy Growth s Drake Deal Eases Pullback As Q2 Earnings Near,opinion,"Canopy Growth   NYSE CGC   is set to report its second quarter results before the market opens on Thursday  November 14  The largest marijuana company in terms of market cap has seen its stock spiral down 55 3  over the past 6 months  Marijuana stocks in general have pull backed as regulatory complications in Canada have stalled operations 
However  Canopy Growth recently saw its stock tick higher last week after it announced a new partnership that excited investors  After all the volatility that has hit the company  Wall Street now has its sights set on the cannabis producer s Q2 earnings report 
Setbacks Send Stock Spiraling  
The last six months have not been good for pot stocks as billions of dollars have been lost in market value  Canopy Growth is no exception  losing around  10 billion over that same time period  A major contributing factor to the stocks  underperformance is the supply issues currently plaguing the Canadian market 
Regulatory agency Health Canada came into 2019 with a backlog of more than 800 applications to review  The regulatory agency will likely need several quarters to work through the backlog  bringing lengthy delays to marijuana products trying to enter the market 
Canopy Growth has also experienced setbacks within the newly federally approved derivative market   The official opening of the market for derivative cannabis products in Canada officially happened in mid October  which opened the door for Canopy Growth to cash in on higher margin cannabis products  However  the delayed launch of the derivative market won t be materializing any profits for cannabis companies until these products hit shelves in mid December 
On top of the stalled derivative products  certain derivative products like alcohol based beverages will remain illegal  This forces Canopy Growth and its partner Constellation Brands   NYSE STZ   to work around yet another regulatory obstacle  The cannabis derivative market is also poised to face the same supply issues that the dried flower space has been experiencing 
Investors should also note that while the derivative market may appear lucrative because of its higher margins  the fierce competition Canopy Growth will have to contend with shouldn t be overlooked  The stiff competition paired with the probable supply issues that the market will face will more than likely push back any material impact from the derivative market 
Will the Drake Deal Bear Fruit 
Canopy Growth announced late last week that the company had entered a partnership with pop culture icon  Drake  to open a cannabis wellness firm in Toronto  Drake has a 60  stake in the company  known as More Life Growth Company  while Canopy will have a minority 40  share 
More Life Growth owns a license from Health Canada to grow  process  and sell cannabis  Canopy Growth will  provide all of the day to day operations and maintenance of the More Life Facility and will retain all of the rights to distribute the product that is cultivated at the More Life Facility  
The announcement was enough to send Canopy Growth shares up over 11  as investors were excited to receive good news about the struggling pot stock  The Drake deal isn t the first partnership Canopy Growth has had with a celebrity 
Past partnerships include Martha Stewart  Snoop Dogg  and Seth Rogen  which have all failed to turn into anything substantial thus far  Snoop Dogg and Seth Rogen s brands have failed to produce sizeable financial results  and Martha Stewart s efforts to kickstart an animal healthcare product line haven t materialized yet 
Bottom Line
The cannabis industry still faces an onslaught of regulatory issues that don t seem to be going away anytime soon  which will more than likely bring further volatility to the marijuana space  While effective branding and marketing may be vital components to driving sales in other fields of business  it seems that in the marijuana industry that may not be the case   actually suggest that branding is a less important quality considered when consumers purchase a product 
Investors will now be looking to Canopy Growth s Q2 report to see whether the company has improved its margins and eased its capital expenditures  Our Q2 consensus estimates forecast Canopy Growth s earnings to grow over 64  to a loss of  0 27 per share and for net sales to grow over 330  to  77 1 million

112156,333671,STZ,Canadian Cannabis Firms Battle Volatility  While U S  Growers See Profitability,opinion,"It could be the fact that the calendar year is winding down  Or  it might be the recent volatile seesawing of share prices in the cannabis sector that has market watchers wondering out loud about the future of pot stocks  In the wild world of weed  however  there are more questions than answers 
In the last two weeks  share prices tanked virtually across the sector after earnings results from some of the biggest companies hit one disappointing note after the other  creating a crescendo of discouragement among investors still hopeful about the industry s long term viability  Then  beginning in the middle of last week  the market came back  with many companies seeing stocks make double digit rebounds 

 Canopy Growth  Corp  NYSE CGC    TSX WEED    Aurora Cannabis  Inc  NYSE ACB    TSX ACB  and  Aphria Inc   NYSE APHA    TSX APHA  sent out the first blimps on the charts  claiming the title of the top three performers on the Toronto Stock Exchange at the close last Wednesday  Canopy was up more than 16  on the day  Aurora gained 12 5  and Aphria added just over 5 5  
By Thursday  Hexo Corp  NYSE HEXO    TSX HEXO  had joined the ranks of the rebounders  marking an impressive gain of  more than 35  on the day  followed by Aurora and Canopy adding another 19  and 16   respectively  to their previous day s upward swings 
But by the time Friday rolled around  the swings were going in the opposite direction  Hexo dropped more than 15 5  on the day  Aurora lost 13  and Canopy shaved just over 9  from the previous close 
Volatility Based On Headlines
This recent volatility can be attributed to reaction to headlines  which explains their short impact span  In the U S   news of the House of Representatives  Judiciary committee approving a bill that would legalize marijuana at the federal level was largely responsible for the uptick in stock prices 
This coincided with the provincial government in Ontario announcing it would revamp how retail pot licences are handed out  But neither piece of news comes with immediate change  There is still no clear timeline for federal legalization in the U S  and regulatory changes for retail outlets in Canada s most populous province will not be effectively realized until the latter half of 2020 
The gains were paired back once reality carved a dent in the optimism  Canopy closed up 0 22  in New York yesterday to finish at US 18 45  while having gained 0 12  on the Toronto Stock Exchange to end the day at C 24 50  Aurora lost more than 6  yesterday to finish at US 2 52  C 3 35   Aphria lost 2 36  Monday to end the day at US 4 56 in New York and was down 1 45  on the TSX closing at C 6 10  while Hexo ended up just under 2  at US 2 19 in New York and up 2 8  in Toronto at C 2 93 
Two U S  Marijuana Companies Post Profitable Quarters

posted a cumulative decline of 28 4   This downside partly resulted from the lackluster guidance for the current year due to weaker demand  capacity curtailments  impact of foreign exchange headwinds  higher tax rate and impact of increased operational complexities  Factors Impacting Owens IllinoisOwens Illinois  shares have dropped 11 1  since it reported third quarter 2019 results on     The company reported adjusted earnings of 54 cents per share in the quarter  down 28  from the prior year  Net sales declined 3 8  year over year to  1 670 million  as unfavorable currency translation and lower sales volume muted favorable pricing and contribution from the Nueva Fanal acquisition  Global shipments were down 1  year over year in the reported quarter  reflecting sluggish market growth  particularly in Mexico and China  and persistent weak demand for beer and non alcoholic beverages in the United States Sales volume was primarily affected by lower shipments to food and alcoholic beverage customers  mainly due to the ongoing trends in beer shipments  The company also witnessed lower demand in China and the country is undergoing capacity curtailment  Overall  Owens Illinois anticipates volume to be down 1  this year  Further  the persistent decline of beer consumption in the domestic market is another major headwind For fourth quarter 2019  Owens Illinois anticipates adjusted earnings per share of 45 50 cents compared with the adjusted earnings of 61 cents per share reported in fourth quarter 2018  The benefit of higher selling prices and accretion from the Nueva Fanal acquisition will likely be offset by lower volumes  unfavorable foreign currency headwinds and higher effective tax rate  In response to lower sales  the company plans to curtail capacity in the United States and Mexico in the ongoing quarter  Furthermore  Owens Illinois has lowered its adjusted earnings per guidance for 2019 to  2 20  2 25 from  2 40  2 55  thanks to softer demand  capacity curtailments  and unfavorable foreign currency translation impact  The mid point of the guidance reflects a year over year decline of 18   The lowered guidance also includes the impact of higher effective tax rate and continued increased complexity The company is trying to counter the unfavorable impact of mega beer decline with new business in growing categories  However  this change in new business mix is giving rise to more operational complexities and higher costs  which might impact Owens Illinois  results  Additionally  commissioning new capacity for future growth has resulted in more cost than originally anticipated Will the Stock Rebound Owens Illinois is poised to benefit from focus on improving factory performance  cost reduction and innovations  In addition  the company is focused on investments in business  It intends to achieve this by investing in joint ventures and incremental capacity  and through bolt on acquisitions in emerging geographies  Owens Illinois  joint venture  JV  with Constellation Brands  Inc    NYSE STZ   and long term sales contracts in Mexico will likely mitigate the impact of the prevalent decline in mega beer in the United States  Glass packaging in Western Europe has been rising for the last two years  The company s efforts to add capacity in Europe  boost supply chain performance  focus on growing strategic relationships and footprint optimization poise it well for improving volumes and expanding margins in the region In the United States  demand for glass is growing  propelled by favorable consumer trends and increased preference of customers for glass packaging  Demand for non beer customer continues to grow in low single digits in the nation  Thus  the company is converting almost 20  of its beer capacity into flexible capacity to meet demand for non beer categories  In the Asia Pacific  benefits from the asset advancement program and growing demand in emerging markets will drive volumes  while efforts to lower structural costs will expand margins Owens Illinois has acquired 49 7  interest in Empresas Comegua S A  The buyout will help the company expand its presence into new and growing glass markets in Central America  as well as fortify market presence in the Caribbean  The Nueva Fanal buyout  along with the previous acquisition of Vitro s food and beverage business  solidifies Owens Illinois  position in the attractive and growing glass segment of the packaging market in Mexico We believe these factors will benefit Owens Illinois  results and help drive a recovery in its share price Zacks

In third quarter 2019  the company delivered positive earnings surprise for the fifth straight quarter  and fourth sales beat in the last five quarters  Robust momentum in top and bottom lines can be attributed to solid shipment and depletions growth in the past few quarters Depletions continue to gain from major innovations  quality of products and strong brands alongside solid sales execution and support from distributors  Moreover  increases in Truly Hard Seltzer and Twisted Tea brands as well as the inclusion of the Dogfish Head brand is boosting depletions growth  On the other hand  robust shipment growth is the result of the company s efforts to ensure that distributors  inventory levels were appropriate to cater to increased customer demand  Driven by the positive trends  management also raised the lower end of earnings  shipments and depletions view for 2019 Looking more closely at stocks in the broader industry  we note that the Boston Beer has outpaced its peers  Notably  stocks like Molson Coors   NYSE TAP   and Constellation Brands   NYSE STZ   have witnessed declines of 20 6  and 3 3   respectively  in the past year  Its close peer Anheuser Busch InBev   NYSE BUD   has gained 11 1  the same period Factors Driving Boston Beer s Growth StoryBoston Beer remains focused on its three point growth plan  which targets the revival of the Samuel Adams and Angry Orchard brands  cost saving initiatives and long term innovation  For the Samuel Adams brand  the company is undertaking packaging  innovation  promotion and brand communication initiatives to boost demand  Further  it is working to maintain momentum in the Angry Orchard and Twisted Tea s while ensuring Truly Spiked   Sparkling s leadership position in the hard sparkling water category The company has also accelerated cost savings and efficiency projects directed toward further brand development  Its third priority is long term innovation and maximizing shareholder value  Boston Beer remains optimistic about the future of craft beer and cider categories Notably  the company is lately witnessing robust trends in the Truly Hard Seltzer and Twisted Tea brands  which is driving depletions  The Truly brand delivered triple digit volume growth in the third quarter  while Twisted Tea generated double digit volume growth  The company is focused on promoting the Truly brand to take advantage of a shift in consumer preference to the fast growing hard seltzer category  In the third quarter  it launched Truly Draft nationally and continued to expand package distribution across all channels It is also initiating a new high profile advertisement campaign for Truly  featuring the famous comedian Keegan Michael Key  Furthermore  the company s recent multiyear U S  partnership with the National Hockey League   NHL   makes Truly Hard Seltzer the official drink of the League  This partnership not only benefits the Truly brand but also extends benefits to other brands  including Samuel Adams and Dogfish Head Additionally  the company is launching new formulations for all Truly flavors to make this brand the best tasting hard seltzer around  In early 2020  it plans to launch the Truly Hard Seltzer Lemonade in both a variety 12 pack and single serve sizes  It also expects to roll out another new flavor  Watermelon Kiwi  which will be available in Truly Tropical Variety Pack and 6 packs  With these new flavors  NHL partnership and new ad campaign  we believe the company well positioned to become a leader in the hard seltzer category while making Truly a core brand Moreover  this Boston based alcohol stock has an impressive long term earnings growth rate of 10  and a  of A Just Released  Zacks  7 Best Stocks for TodayExperts extracted 7 stocks from the list of 220 Zacks Rank  1 Strong Buys that has beaten the market more than 2X over with a stunning average gain of  24 6  per year These 7 were selected because of their superior potential for immediate breakout ",2019-12-06,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/heres-why-boston-beer-sam-stands-out-amid-industry-peers-200490741,200490741
112159,333674,STZ,Watch As Trulieve Moves From Being The Pot Sector Exception To Becoming The Rule,opinion,"In life  as in the cannabis investment sector  there are accepted rules and then there are the exceptions that prove those rules  In the cannabis space one such exception is  Trulieve Cannabis  Corp  OTC TCNNF    CSE TRUL   an expanding  Florida based cannabis grower  But here s the twist  This exception could emerge as an indication of a broader trend that will soon shed its exceptional status and actually become the new rule 
So first  let s get to the widely accepted rule  Most cannabis stocks have lost much of their value in the second half of 2019  Indeed  the stock performances of the big names in the sector have been disastrous  Just look at the year over year statistics   Canopy Growth  Corp  NYSE CGC    TSX WEED   40    Cronos  Group Inc  NASDAQ CRON    TSX CRON   47    Aurora Cannabis  Inc  NYSE ACB    TSX ACB   57    Aphria Inc   NYSE APHA    TSX APHA   10    Tilray Inc   NASDAQ TLRY   81  

Trulieve is a standout exception to this rule  With a market capitalization of US 1 93 billion  this vertically integrated  medical cannabis grower has seen its stock price increase by 60 73  through 2019 
The upward trajectory has actually picked up its pace in the last three months as the company s share price has jumped from US 7 88  C 10 44  on Aug  30 to close down slightly yesterday at US 13 09  C 17 27   an approximate 66  increase 

Trulieve claims to have 55  of the medical marijuana market in Florida  the third most populous state in the U S  Its patient base is growing at about 10  per month  and it has about 40 dispensaries in the state  with a plan to expand that network  It offers a wide range of cannabis based merchandise that comprises almost 300 products 

The company is also moving into other markets  It has obtained licences to open dispensaries in Connecticut  California and Massachusetts  It has grown slowly and steadily since 2015  and has avoided the huge  rapid expansion pitfalls other larger cannabis companies are suffering now  And although it is traded on both the OTC markets in the U S  and the Canadian Stock Exchange  it has limited its footprint to a comparatively smaller playing field focused only on the States  This could be the trend that emerges as the most successful route that will allow Trulieve to be seen as one of the few short term  big winners as the calendar flips to 2020 
Not All 2 0 Products Will Be Out For Christmas
Some cannabis 2 0 products will be available for sale before Christmas in Canada  but not all 
Last week  the Auxly Cannabis Group Inc  OTC CBWTF    TSXV XLY  said its infused products will be available for retail sale beginning Dec  16  In a  issued by the Vancouver based company  Auxly announced it has reached agreements with nine of the 10 Canadian provinces and will launch 83 derivative products that include vapes  chocolates  chewables and topicals 

 This is a major milestone for us   said Hugo Alves  CEO of Auxly  He expanded  saying 
 Our team has been working toward the launch of our derivative product portfolio for over 20 months and seeing the hugely positive reactions to our thoughtfully developed brands and products from provincial purchasers  our distribution partner  Kindred  and consumer focus groups has been immensely satisfying and motivating for the entire Auxly family  It is a huge accomplishment to be ready for commercialization on day one  right across the country   it speaks to the talent and dedication of our people and our organization wide focus on winning in the cannabis 2 0 market  
Shares of Auxly were unaffected by the announcement last Thursday  dipping slightly since then to close up slightly yesterday at US 0 4680  C 0 63   It will be interesting to see if early entry into the 2 0 market will move the needle on the stock price 
While a smaller producer like Auxly is pushing ahead on 2 0 products  the cannabis giant  Canopy Growth  has announced it will not be offering its array of 2 0 products until January 2020  Canopy will start with marketing its cannabis chocolate bars and infused drinks 
New CEO Named At Canopy
Meanwhile  Canopy shares made a substantial jump yesterday  gaining about 14  on the day on the news that David Klein was appointed CEO effective January  The move is being viewed as the company s major share holder  U S  based beer maker Constellation Brands  NYSE STZ   taking a firmer grasp of the reins of the Canadian pot producer  Last October  Klein  who had been in charge of finance at Constellation  was named chairman of the board at Canopy  Next month  he will replace Mark Zekulin who had been the sole chief executive after co CEO Bruce Linton was ousted last summer

112193,333708,STZ,Jobs Report Brings 1 4  Gains To End A Crazy Week ,opinion,"Sometimes you get exactly what you need at exactly the right time 
	Case in point  today s jobs report threaded the needle between  too hot  and  too cold   allowing the major indices to rally out a rough week 
	Each of the major indices jumped by 1 4  on Friday for their second consecutive day in the green after sharp plunges to begin the quarter 
	The NASDAQ added approximately 110 points to 7982 47 and was the only major index to post a gain for the week  It was up 0 5  over the past 5 days 
	The Dow soared 372 points to 26 573 72 and the S P advanced more than 41 points to 2952 01 
	This valiant effort reduced the indices  weekly losses to 0 9  and 0 5   respectively  though they ve now been in the red for three consecutive weeks 
	The economy added 136 000 jobs last month  which was a bit below expectations  However  the unemployment rate is down to 3 5   which hasn t been seen since the year of Woodstock  the original one     Investors considered it one of those  goldilocks  numbers  It was strong enough to assuage growing fears of a recession  but weak enough to keep the Fed on the side of another rate cut before the year is out 
	We also got an advantageous lead in from the ISM reports earlier this week  which included a second month of contraction for manufacturing and a bit of a slowdown for services  Skittish investors were probably waiting for a much more alarming jobs report 
	And let s not forget about Apple s part in today s rally  A report stated that the company was increasing iPhone 11 production by 10   The stock jumped 2 8  today and was a big reason for the NASDAQ getting onto the plus side for the week 
	We can go into the weekend feeling a lot better about things compared to Tuesday and Wednesday when the Dow plunged more than 800 points  However  we could use a break from all this uncertainty 
	It would be a big help if we got something real out of the trade talks with China next week  Or at least some good news that shows the two sides are making progress on a deal 
	As stated earlier  sometimes you get exactly what you need at exactly the right time  Let s keep our fingers crossed that this is one of those times    Today s Portfolio Highlights Counterstrike  Has this been a dead cat bounce the past couple of days  Jeremy thinks so  Therefore  the portfolio got short on Friday by adding a 10  allocation in Direxion Daily S P 500 Bear 3X Shares  SPXS   Basically  this position will make three times the loss of the S P while its in the portfolio  Read more about this new buy and take a look at its chart in the complete commentary Blockchain Innovators  There are lots of BIG companies in this portfolio as more and more giants embrace blockchain to improve their businesses  But Dave s pick today is a much smaller name  Fastly  FSLY  is an infrastructure software company with an edge cloud platform that helps companies scale up their blockchain offerings  In other words  demand is high for its services with no end in site  Current estimates forecast double digit earnings and sales growth for next year  while earnings estimates have been on the rise for the same period  The editor added FSLY on Friday and also sold the underperforming Lending Club  LC   Read the full write up for a lot more on today s moves TAZR Trader  The semis are near all time highs and have a far way to fall if the  phoenix rising  scenario for the third and fourth quarters doesn t happen  Kevin was already skeptical that anything will happen in next week s trade talks  which is why he added Direxion Semiconductor 3X Bear ETF  SOXS  on Tuesday  And on top of all that  the continuing protests in Hong Kong is further complicating the editor s bearish and cautious view  Therefore  he added more of SOXS on Friday  Read the full write up for more Marijuana Innovators  It looks like Constellation Brands  NYSE STZ  might be looking at its investment in Canopy Growth  CGC  as more of a nuisance than an opportunity  Despite the beverage giant beating expectations and raising its guidance in the most recent quarter  Dave decided this was a good time to sell STZ and secure the nice 15  return

112194,333709,STZ,Know The Molson Coors  TAP  Stock In And Out Before You Invest,opinion,Molson Coors Brewing Company   NYSE TAP   boasts a strong portfolio of well established brands  which is its key strength  This along with its focus on premiumization and cost savings has been aiding its bottom line performance  Further  innovation coupled with premiumization efforts is likely to boost the company s market share Additionally  its approach to the First Choice plan  which aims at solidifying and premiumizing portfolio  enhancing customer relations  and generating significant profits from international businesses  bodes well Factors Supporting GrowthMolson Coors is witnessing significant benefits from the execution of its premiumization and cost saving initiatives  With a view to accelerate portfolio premiumization  the company has made significant additions to its above premium brands  portfolio In second quarter 2019  Molson Coors  above premium brands continued to improve  with Peroni  Sol  Henry s Hard Sparkling  and Arnold Palmer Spiked Half   Half growing rapidly in the United States  Further  Blue Moon witnessed strong growth outside the United States and its growth across Europe continued  Moreover  the company gained share in the premium Light category with Coors Light returning to segment share growth and Miller Light recording segment share growth for the 19th straight quarter Additionally  for 2019 and beyond  it is encouraged by its innovation pipeline  including the accelerated development of Clearly Kombucha and launch of various innovative brands across regions  Molson Coors remains on track to witness continued segment share gains in premium brands  increased volumes in above premium brands  and bring stability to its below premium brands  volumes and market share The company has also undertaken restructuring initiatives to reduce overhead costs and boost profitability  These initiatives include the closure of underperforming breweries  improving efficiencies in finance  administration and human resources  and reducing labor and general overhead costs  In addition  the company has been focusing on initiatives to improve its supply chain network and build on efficiencies across the business to generate additional resources to invest in brand building and innovation Progressing on these lines  Molson Coors anticipates generating cost savings of roughly  205 million in 2019  remaining on track with the target of generating total cost savings of  700 between 2017 and 2019  The company s cost saving target is  150 million ahead of its initial goal of  550 million  Further  the company plans to achieve cost savings of another  450 million between 2020 and 2022  driven by procurement and supply chain  including brewery optimization  These cost saving efforts are likely to cushion the underlying EBITDA and underlying EPS growth in quarters ahead With regard to the aforementioned First Choice plan  the company witnessed strong pricing across brands and regions in second quarter 2019  driven by progress on this plan  Notably  Molson Coors  First Choice approach supports its key priorities   including cash generation  margin improvement and enhancing shareholder returns  Apart from this  the company remains focused on disciplined capital allocation  driven by the Profit after Capital Charge or PACC approach Near Term HurdlesThough the aforementioned strategies speak well of the company s long term growth prospects  we remain concerned about the recent glitch  thanks to the dismal earnings and sales trend in recent quarters  The company s top line in the second quarter was impacted by soft volume that stemmed from unfavorable weather and weak industry demand across the majority of its geographies in May and June This along with cost inflation in all segments  higher marketing expenses   owing to ongoing investments to support premiumization and innovation efforts  and lower G A benefits from last year hurt the company s bottom line  Additionally  its underlying EBITDA declined 9 2  in the second quarter  with a 12 8  fall in constant currency Moreover  Molson Coors has been witnessing softness in beer volume in the United States for quite some time  Consumers  changing preferences and the aging population mainly contributed to the decline  Additionally  the company s volume is hindered by tough competition from other alcohol beverage companies like Anheuser Busch InBev SA NV   NYSE BUD    Boston Beer Co    NYSE SAM   and Constellation Brands Inc    NYSE STZ   Like others in the industry  Molson Coors is also battling input cost inflation  which has been a hindrance for a while now particularly due to higher aluminum and freight costs  Notably  input cost inflation in all segments led to a decline in its earnings in second quarter 2019  The company estimates consolidated underlying COGS per hectoliter  on a constant currency basis  to increase in a mid single digit in 2019 mostly due to higher aluminum and other input costs  Clearly  these hurdles along with the increased tariffs on aluminum imports and beverage exports  due to the U S  China trade

112195,333710,STZ,Canopy Growth  CGC  Signals A Major Shift In Strategy,opinion,"In the wake of recent performance downgrades from Wall Street analysts   Canopy Growth  Corp  NYSE CGC  today announced its divestment of AusCann  signaling a potential shift in the company s growth strategy   
Thus far  Canopy Growth has exhibited an aggressive acquisition strategy   much to the malaise of investors concerned about cash burn  Even today  the company announced the completion of its previously announced acquisition of the global cannabinoid based research company  Beckley Canopy Therapeutics   
 The acquisition comes at a time when commercial opportunities across Europe are ramping up   said Canopy Growth CEO Mark Zekulin 
 Spectrum Biomedical has completed all necessary approvals to import cannabis into the UK market and is proud to facilitate patient access to safe cannabinoid based medicines there  Consolidating our UK based operations will allow Canopy to simultaneously improve its research and commercial capabilities across the continent  
Beckley Research   Innovations   BRI   and Canopy Growth formed Beckley Canopy as a joint venture in January 2018 for the purpose of researching and developing clinically validated cannabis based medicines  BRI emphasizes a strong focus on intellectual property protection 
Analysts applaud the divestiture  but remain bearish
Just a few days ago  Jeffries analysts downgraded CGC stock from  hold  to  underperform   But now Jeffries analysts seem to be more optimistic about the company s divestiture announcement 
  The decision to divest our position in AusCann  which we obtained three years ago in exchange for support provided  will allow us to sharpen our focus on our wholly owned operations in the market  while continuing to collaborate with our partners at AusCann   said Zekulin 
Jeffries analysts Owen Bennett and Ryan Tomkins have voiced support for the move  meanwhile adding the caveat   We do wonder how much more cleaning up may have to come  
 With Bruce Linton  the old CEO  often saying in interviews past a key part of his and Canopy s strategy was  go into a market  spend and dominate  and then do the same again   we wonder how many assets that have been acquired are indeed noncore  especially as the cash Constellation gave Canopy often meant money was no object  Further  we wonder how much Canopy would get for these assets when it sells them   the analysts wrote 
Part of Canopy s spending spree was made possible by the injection of  4 billion from Constellation Brands  NYSE STZ   the brewer of Corona   the same company that ousted former CEO Bruce Linton earlier this year  It seems Constellation too  may not have been content with how CGC was spending its money 
Canopy Growth was down to C 2 3 billion in cash by the end of last quarter  To put things into perspective  the Australian market is expected to be just 1  of the Canadian market next year  CGC unloaded its 13 2  stake in Australian producer AusCann for C 6 million   4 8 million  
Seaport Global analysts echoed this discontent yesterday by downgrading CGC stock from  buy  to  neutral  
 We see a headwind for the Canadian cannabis market ahead  based on sizable industry supply that will aim to funnel into a limited retail store set  We expect pricing and margins to drop considerably   said analysts Brett Hundley and Luke Perda in a note to investors

In fact  the U S  listed shares have shed 75  of their value since May  They hit their all time high on Apr  30  trading at US 8 28  compared to their close yesterday of US 2 07  a new all time low 
The price bottom comes on the heels of last week s disastrous performance review where the company reported its adjusted net loss had grown C 56 7 million  US 43 22 million  in the last quarter  substantially greater than the C 7 8 million  5 95 million  shortfall in the previous quarter  This brought the total adjusted loss for the fiscal year to C 81 56 million  US 62 17 million  
These less than stunning results also came less than two weeks after the Quebec based grower announced plans to slash its workforce by about 25   a move that was required  the company said in a statement  to keep the company on track to profitability 
On the upside  Hexo reported a small gain in net revenue  up to C 15 4 million   11 7 million   compared with C 13 million  US 9 9 million  the previous quarter 
It would be difficult to blame investors for wondering  has Hexo lost its mojo 
Answering that question will depend on how you view the future in the cannabis space  Several other marijuana growers will be reporting in the coming weeks  Will Hexo be the predictor of what is ahead  Or will it be the exception 
But investors who have been on the sidelines watching  waiting and wondering how this new untested frontier is going to play out might opt to view this as the perfect time to jump in before the 2 0 products hit the streets

112222,333737,STZ,Weed leader Canopy Growth ousts co CEO Bruce Linton,news,"By Debroop Roy and Nivedita Balu
 Reuters    Canada s  Canopy Growth  Corp  TO WEED   N CGC  fired founder and co Chief Executive Officer Bruce Linton  a surprise move that comes just a week after the weed producer s largest shareholder expressed disappointment over its loss making streak 
The world s largest pot company announced earlier in the day that Linton was stepping down  leaving Mark Zekulin in charge of the company 
 I think stepping down might not be the right phrase   Linton said in an interview with CNBC    I was terminated  
Linton also said he did not know why he was fired  adding   At the end of the day I really think sometimes entrepreneurs are entrepreneurs because they re not super employable  
Last month  Canopy reported a net loss of about C 323 million for the fourth quarter  attributing it to increased investments in expanding the business 
A week later  Constellation Brands  N STZ   which owns a stake of nearly 56  in Canopy and has four of its six board seats  said it was not happy with the Canadian company s year end results 
 We are working with Canopy almost on a daily basis to ensure that we are all focused on the right things   Constellation CEO Bill Newlands had said on a post earnings call with analysts 
On Wednesday  the brewer said it fully supported the decision made by Canopy s board to appoint Zekulin as the company s sole CEO 
 It is pretty clear that it was at the urging of Constellation Brands  At this point they have enough power on  its  board to make these kinds of decisions   William O Neil analyst Andrew Kessner said 
Linton s strategy of chasing growth at the expense of near term profits seemed to have fallen out of favor with top Constellation executives  who are under pressure to provide a clearer timeline on a return on investment in Canopy  Kessner said 
Linton founded Canopy in 2013 in an abandoned Hershey s chocolate factory in Smiths Falls  Canada and has since been the face of the company  He took the company public in 2014 and has bolstered its operations with acquisitions worth more than C 5 billion 
Under Linton  Canopy also raised over C 6 billion since its founding in 2013  with the Corona beer maker agreeing to invest more than  4 billion in the company   the biggest such investment in the cannabis industry 
 Graphic  Canopy shares outperform peers    
Linton did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment  Reuters  calls and emails to Canopy seeking details on Linton s departure were not answered 
While it was not clear what Linton s severance package would be  company filings showed that his total compensation for 2018 was  2 46 million  a near six fold rise from a year earlier due to  2 million of option based awards 
Analysts at brokerage Stifel said they would not be surprised to see Linton take on another role within the cannabis industry  likely as an entrepreneur as his strength was in recognizing early stage value 
Rade Kovacevic  who currently leads the company s Canadian operations and recreational strategy  will take over the role of president from Zekulin 
The company also named John Bell  Canopy s lead director of five years  as chairman  a decision that it said would be reviewed at the board s annual meeting in September 
Earlier this year  Canopy also replaced long term Chief Financial Officer Tim Saunders with a former Constellation executive

112223,333738,STZ,StockBeat   Trouble Brewing as AB Inbev Pulls Asian IPO,news,"By Geoffrey Smith
Investing com    If you believe that the IPO market is a decent indicator of overall market health  then you are probably a little worried this morning 
Anheuser Busch Inbev  BR ABI   the world s biggest brewer  scrapped what would have been the year s biggest initial public offering to date over the weekend  the  8 billion partial spin off of its Asian business  citing  adverse market conditions  
It s the second big deal in a matter of days to be pulled  after insurance giant   Swiss Re    SIX SRENH  pulled the listing of its U K  business ReAssure  which was supposed to raise over  3 5 billion  Like the multinational brewer  Swiss Re also blamed  heightened caution and weak underlying demand  
The two businesses have little in common  whether sectorally  cyclically or geographically  One is a mature U K  focused business   arguably a declining one   that revolves around interest rates and longevity  and the other is a punt on the Chinese middle class s developing taste for beer  So to see them using near identical language for their decisions should raise an eyebrow or two 
AB Inbev looks likely to face more scrutiny in the near term  as the failure is another negative judgment by the market on the merger  agreed in 2015  of AB InBev and SAB Miller  That deal  which saddled the merged company with one of the world s biggest debt loads  has failed to generate the rewards it promised   the stock is down nearly 30  from when it was agreed  a period in which rivals such as Carlsberg  CSE CARLa   Constellation Brands  NYSE STZ  and   Heineken    AS HEIN  have risen by between a third and a half 
AB Inbev fell 1 6  in early trading on Monday in Europe  a morning when almost all European and Asian markets were higher  profiting from some better than expected Chinese data on industrial production and retail sales  The Stoxx 600 was flat at 386 12  while Germany s Dax was up 0 2  and the FTSE 100 was largely unchanged 
It isn t unusual for buyers and sellers to vary in their opinion of what a business is worth  of course  but it s always more difficult when the seller s idea of the right price is colored by the price of a previous deal which looks  in retrospect  unrealistic 
That said  AB Inbev s management may yet have the last laugh  The company s profitability depends a lot on the exchange rate  given that most of its  110 billion debt load is denominated in dollars  and the bulk of its sales come from emerging markets  With the Federal Reserve now in easing mode and emerging market currencies strengthening  South Africa  one of the group s most important emerging markets  saw its currency test a five month high on the back of the Chinese data   that debt burden will be easier to shoulder  
But while that would vindicate AB Inbev s management on the narrower question of timing  it still leaves them with a mountain to climb in delivering their long term promises ",2019-07-15,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/stockbeat--trouble-brewing-as-ab-inbev-pulls-asian-ipo-1923352,1923352

112226,333741,STZ,Is Constellation Brands  STZ  Stock A Buy Heading Into Q2 Earnings ,opinion,"Constellation Brands   NYSE STZ   stock has crushed the alcoholic beverage market over the last three years  up 24   against its industry s 6  average decline  Shares of STZ have also matched the broader industry s impressive 2019 run  up 28  to blow away the S P 500 s 18  climb 
Now the question is should investors consider buying shares of Constellation Brands as we head into the release of its second quarter fiscal 2020 earnings results  due out on Thursday  October 3 
STZ Overview 
Constellation Brands is an alcoholic beverage powerhouse that produces and markets many imported and craft beers from Corona and Ballast Point  along with Kim Crawford wine and SVEDKA Vodka  The firm has been able to outperform its peers  which includes Anheuser Busch Inbev NV   NYSE BUD    over the last several in part because imports and craft beer have grown  while domestic beers like Budweiser face a slowdown  For instance  Modelo Especial was Constellation s most significant growth contributor in the portfolio last quarter 
The market has also been seemingly flipped on its head recently by the overnight success of hard seltzer  Luckily  many of the big brands have been able to take part in the massive rise  The Boston Beer Company   NYSE SAM   owns Truly Hard Seltzer  while Anheuser  Busch InBev owns Bon   Viv Spiked Seltzer and Molson Coors   NYSE TAP   owns Henry s Hard Sparkling Water  And Constellation rolled out a Corona branded flavored malt beverage that it has positioned as part of the larger non beer category   
On top of that  Constellation management last summer made a big bet on the growing legal marijuana business  The firm in August 2018 invested  4 billion to take a 38  stake in Canopy Growth   NYSE CGC    which  continues to be the global leader in total cannabis sales   Investors should note that the deal provides Constellation warrants to lift its ownership to over 50  
The investment hasn t paid off much yet  but as more and more states legalize recreational marijuana use  currently 11 states  D C  and all of Canada  it could prove to be a big boost  We won t dive into much more here expect that Canopy is one of the so called big four  pure play pot stocks  along with Aurora Cannabis   TSX ACB    Tilray   NASDAQ TLRY    and Cronos Group   NASDAQ CRON     And while we remain happy with our investment in the cannabis space and its long term potential  we were not pleased with Canopy s recent reported year end results   CEO Bill Newlands said one the company s conference call last quarter 
 However  we continue to aggressively support Canopy on a more focused  long term strategy to win markets and form factors that matter  while paving a clear path to profitability  
 
 
 
 
Outlook   Earnings Trends
Looking ahead  our Zacks Consensus Estimates call for the Constellation s second quarter fiscal 2020 revenue to pop 1 4  to reach  2 33 billion  This would mark a slowdown from Q1 s 2  top line expansion  which did top our quarterly estimates 
Meanwhile  the company s full year sales are projected to slip 1 9  to from  8 12 billion in fiscal 2019 to  7 96 billion  It is worth noting  however  that the company s 2019 sales growth set up a tough comparison period after they soared 7 1   Constellation s 2021 sales are then expected to pop 1 1  above our current year estimate 
At the bottom end  Constellation s adjusted quarterly earnings are projected to slip 8 7  to  2 62 per share  The company s fiscal 2020 EPS figure is then expected to fall 9 9   Peeking further ahead  2021 s earnings are projected to surge 10 6  higher than our current year estimate to nearly match 2019 s figure 
STZ has easily topped our quarterly earnings estimates in the trailing four periods by an average of 10 45   However  the company s earnings revision trends have moved in the wrong direction recently  In fact  the company s Q2 consensus estimate has slipped from  2 70 per share 90 days ago to its current  2 62 
 
 
 
 
Bottom Line
Constellation is a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  at the moment that hasn t seen its valuation picture become that stretched despite its strong run over the last five years  STZ is trading at 23 2X forward 12 month Zacks earnings estimates  which comes in below its industry s 24X and its own three year high of 25 3X
STZ shares are down 5  over the last 12 months  against its industry s 7  climb  And the beer and wine firm s stock closed trading Friday at  206  down 10  off its 52 week highs of  228 91 per share  This could give the Constellation shares room to run heading into earnings 
Investors should pay close attention to any and all Canopy updates on the earnings call  Plus  make sure to listen for updates on its projected Gallo Winery deal  which executives expect to close in the second half of calendar 2019  The firm first announced in early April that it would  divest approximately 30 brands from its wine and spirits portfolio principally priced at  11 retail and below  and related facilities located in California  New York and Washington for  1 7 billion  
Overall  Constellation appears to be a worth considering at the moment given its diverse portfolio  and is likely a safer way to play the growing but extremely volatile marijuana market  Plus  the company pays an annualized dividend of  3 00 per share  for a yield of 1 46  the 10 year U S  Treasury currently rests at 1 68  
With all that said  it is always risky to buy a stock before earnings  Therefore  interested investors might want to wait until after it reports its Q2 2020 financial results on October 3 to decide

manufacturer stock is down 46 7  over the past year compared with the stocks in the  that posted a cumulative decline of 35 4   This downside is partly due to the muted guidance for the current year due to the impact of foreign exchange headwinds  higher tax rate and negative impact of increased operational complexity on account of change in mix  Further  decline of beer consumption in the domestic market remains another major headwind Factors Plaguing Owens IllinoisOwens Illinois  shares plunged 41  since it reported second quarter 2019 results on Jul 31  The company reported adjusted earnings of 69 cents per share in the quarter  down 10  from the prior year  Net sales declined 1  year over year to  1 756 million  as favorable pricing was offset by unfavorable currency translation Moreover  net sales in the first six months of 2019 were down 3  from the same period in 2018  primarily due to the unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and lower volumes  partially offset by higher prices  Volume growth is projected at 0 5  for 2019  lower than the previous outlook of 1 5   The continued decline of beer consumption in the domestic market remains a major headwind For third quarter 2019  Owens Illinois anticipates adjusted earnings per share of 60 65 cents compared with adjusted earnings of 62 cents per share reported in third quarter 2018  The benefit of higher selling prices  sales volume and accretion from Nueva Fanal acquisition will likely be offset by elevated operating costs and higher effective tax rate related to shifts in regional earnings mix Furthermore  the company lowered its adjusted earnings per guidance to  2 40  2 55 from the prior estimate of  3 00  due to foreign exchange headwinds  higher effective tax rate and impact of continued increased complexity  Owens Illinois had reported earnings per share of  2 72 in 2018 The company is trying to counter the unfavorable impact of mega beer decline with new business in growing categories  However  this change in new business mix is creating more operational complexity and higher costs  which is likely to impact Owens Illinois  results  Furthermore  commissioning new capacity for future growth has added more cost than originally projected Will the Stock Rebound Owens Illinois is poised to benefit from focus on improving factory performance  cost reduction and innovations  In addition  the company is focused on investments in business  It intends to achieve this by investing in joint ventures and incremental capacity  and through bolt on acquisitions in emerging geographies Owens Illinois  joint venture  JV  with Constellation Brands  Inc    NYSE STZ   and long term sales contracts in Mexico will likely mitigate the impact of the ongoing decline in mega beer in the United States The JV has exceeded expectations so far   productivity has been higher than anticipated  capital costs were considerably lesser than initially expected and earnings have been growing every year  Owens Illinois has built four furnaces at this JV in just four years and is currently building the fifth one which is expected to come on line by the end of 2019  The fifth furnace will help cater to the rising demand from Constellation s adjacent brewery  With the installation of the latest furnace  the Nava plant will be the largest  most modern glass container factory globally  Glass packaging in Western Europe has been growing for the last two years  The company s efforts to add capacity in Europe  boost supply chain performance  focus on growing strategic relationships and footprint optimization poise it well for improving volumes and expanding margins in the region  In the United States  demand for glass is growing  propelled by favorable consumer trends and increased preference of customers for glass packaging  Demand for non beer customer continues to grow in the nation  Thus  the company is converting almost 20  of its beer capacity into flexible capacity to meet demand for non beer categories  In the Asia Pacific  benefits from the asset advancement program and growing demand in emerging markets will drive volumes  while efforts to lower structural costs will expand margins  Owens Illinois has acquired 49 7  interest in Empresas Comegua S A  The buyout will help the company expand its presence into new and growing glass markets in Central America  as well as fortify market presence in the Caribbean  In July  the company acquired Nueva Fanal in Mexico  which has the capacity to produce and supply approximately 300 000 tons of glass containers annually for Grupo Modelo brands  such as Corona serving the local and global export markets  It is anticipated to contribute roughly  140 million of revenues and  40 million of EBITDA on an annual basis  The Nueva Fanal buyout  along with the previous acquisition of Vitro s food and beverage business  solidifies Owens Illinois  position in the attractive and growing glass

With that said  let s unwind on the potential of the company s key segments and their likely contributions to earnings this time around Positive Trends in the Beer BusinessConstellation Brands has been significantly gaining from strength in the beer business over the years  Solid portfolio depletions and market share gains mainly due to strength in the Modelo and Corona brand families are driving growth in this segment  Notably  the company is witnessing increasing market share in the U S  beer category  driven by its brand building efforts and product introductions Strength in the beer business gives the company an edge over its competitors  including the likes of Anheuser Busch InBev SA NV   NYSE BUD   and The Boston Beer Company Inc    NYSE SAM    which are witnessing soft volumes for their key beer brands in North America Recently  the company launched Corona Refresca in the Corona brand family  The brand has gained the entire commodity volume or ACV distribution of above 30 since its launch  In the summer selling season  the brand is poised for growth in the flavored malt beverage category Further  expansions across its business have been contributing to growth  In the beer segment  the company s expansion plans are anchored by the Funky Buddha Brewery buyout  addition of Fathom IPA by Ballast Point Brewery  and expansions at the Nava  Obregon and Mexicali breweries  In fiscal 2019  the combined capacity for Nava and Obregon breweries reached 34 million hectoliters  with the completion of final 30 million hectoliter capacity expansion at Nava Brewery  The fifth furnace at Nava is underway and is likely to produce glass by the end of calendar year 2019 Additionally  the company expects the five million hectoliter expansion at Obregon brewery to be completed by the end of fiscal 2021  ahead of the schedule  a year before the original timeline   The expanded capacities at Nava and Obregon breweries are expected to provide more than 400 million cases of beer  which are abundant supply for many years  Moreover  the Mexicali capacity expansion is estimated to be completed between fiscal 2020 and 2023  On completion  the project will represent nearly 10  of the company s beer capacity in Mexico Beer Segment s Q1 PerformanceIn first quarter fiscal 2020  sales at the beer business improved 7 4   marking the 37th straight quarter of growth  This was mainly driven by a 5 4  increase in shipment volume and 6 6  depletions growth  In fact  the company s beer business was the most significant contributor to the U S  beer market in first quarter fiscal 2020  courtesy of gains at Modelo Especial  Corona Premier and Corona Refresca Overall ExpectationsManagement remains optimistic about fiscal 2020 results  owing to significant market

ago quarter s reported number The guidance includes the impact of the divestitures of nearly 30 low end brands from the wine   spirits portfolio but excludes impacts of Canopy Growth equity earnings and gain or loss on the wine and spirits transaction  On a reported basis  EPS for the fiscal year is anticipated to be  4 95  5 25  whereas it reported  17 57 in fiscal 2019 Constellation Brands continues to anticipate net sales and operating income for the beer segment to rise 7 9  in fiscal 2020  Further  the company expects to complete the wine and spirits asset divestitures by the end of second quarter fiscal 2020  Consequently  net sales for the wine and spirits business are estimated to decline 20 25   with operating income likely to fall 25 30  For the beer segment  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues in the fiscal second quarter is pegged at  1 624 million  which suggests growth of nearly 6 4  from the year ago reported figure  Meanwhile  the consensus mark for the

112231,333746,STZ,Can Constellation  STZ  Keep The Party Going  Earning BMO Thursday,opinion,"Constellation Brands   NYSE STZ   has been performing far above the public alcoholic beverage market for the past 5 years  This year alone  STZ has demonstrated over 28  share price appreciation  outpacing the already strong alcohol segment  which has returned investors an aggregate 18 6   We will see if STZ can keep the drive alive in its earnings release expected before market open Thursday  October 3rd 

STZ is typically a big mover on earnings reports with the last 6 quarterly releases having an average price impact of 5 9   4 up  2 down   Zacks Consensus Estimates for Q2 consist of an EPS of  2 62 on sales of  2 34 billion  This would represent an 8 7  EPS decline  a 1 7  sales increase and Constellation s strongest sales since its inception 
STZ rarely misses on EPS estimates but when they do it typically has an adverse effect on the company s immediate share price 
The Business
Constellations is a leading beer  wine  and spirits producer in North America  Its most recognizable products are its Mexican beer collection  which includes Corona  Modelo  and Pacifico  The company s most identifiable spirits include Svedka and Casa Noble 
Constellation has been focusing on high end alcohol products that produce higher margins and more substantial growth  The firm sold off more than 30 lower end wines and spirits for  1 7 billion back in April to concentrate on its premium products 
Constellation Brands is betting on the future of the marijuana business with is substantial investment in Canopy Growth   NYSE CGC    the largest publicly traded cannabis company in the world  STZ has invested more than  7 billion into CGC for 38  ownership  This venture diversified the firm s future bets and positioned them as an early mover in a segment that has prolific expectations 
Constellation has a diverse portfolio of recreational products that will continue to be a party starter and mood lifter as alcohol consumption trends remain on STZ s side 
Constellation is a consumer staple that will remain robust in times of economic downturns  Alcohol consumption may even increase in periods of economic uncertainty as consumers look for a way to relieve their anxiety 
Industry
Alcohol consumption has increased among millennials as more and more of them have kids  Millennials on average consume 29 drinks per month  which is an over 20  increase from 2013  where the figure was around 24 drinks  I expect that this trend will continue as a growing number of millennials feel the stressors of adult reality 
The cannabis industry is only beginning to scratch the surface of its potential  An increasing number of states are legalizing marijuana  with 12 states having already fully legalized the drug  The haze over the US is taking hold  and I expect that it will be federally legalized in the next 5 10 years  if not sooner 
The cannabis market value for 2018 in the US was  11 3 billion and is anticipated to have an impressive CAGR of 14 5   according to Grand View Research  Constellations ownership of the leading cannabis producer positions it well to take on this enormous US demand 
Take Away
Constellation Brands is outpacing the rest of the industry with its strategic positioning and operational excellence  This will only continue as management continues to grow this firm out organically and through tactical acquisitions 
Earnings before the bell this Thursday will illustrate whether Constellation can keep the party alive  Estimates are typically conservative and could produce a sizable upside  Look for management s guidance and sentiment for more clues into STZ outlook  I see this stock as an excellent long term play with its market immune characteristics and cushy 1 5  dividend yield

war and the Chinese stock market  There s a divergence between the earnings picture and the stock price here  That divergence is where the opportunity lies Over the last sixty days  eight analysts

year from  6 71 to  7 18  while next year s number has gone up from  8 61 to  8 90  That represents EPS growth of 25 52  for the current year and 23 9  growth for next year  That is also forecast to come on sales growth of 32 09  for the current year and 31 06  for next year  Those are monster numbers regardless of what s happening with the trade war  Remember that huge spike in oil prices a couple of weeks ago after the Saudi oil field was attacked  Yes  vaguely I m sure  The narrative then was that oil would keep on rocketing higher after a ton of supply was taken offline  That narrative proved to be false and oil prices came tumbling back to Earth  After spiking up over  63 25  crude has come down in the low  50s  It s put pressure on stocks across the energy industry  including today s Bear of the Day Today s Bear of the Day is Bonanza Creek Energy  Bonanza Creek Energy  Inc   an exploration and production company  focuses on the extraction of onshore oil and related liquids rich natural gas in the United States  The company s primary oil and liquids weighted assets are located in the Wattenberg Field in Colorado  As of December 31  2018  it had proved reserves of 116 8 million barrel of oil equivalent Bonanza Creek is currently a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   The reason for the negative Zacks Rank comes from the recent earnings estimate revisions to the downside  Over the last ninety days  three analysts have cut their estimates for next quarter and next year  The bearish moves have pushed down the Zacks Consensus Estimates for both of these periods  Next quarter s number has come down from  1 63 to  1 44 while next year s number has collapsed from  7 45 to  6 34 Bonanza Creek Energy  Inc  Price and ConsensusThat negativity has the stock on the defensive  After trading over  40 in August 2018  the stock has been in a downtrend  Shares hit a 52 week low of  17 79 in June  Since then  a strong rally took shares up over  26 right around the same time oil prices spiked on the Saudi attack  Over the last week and a half  shares have come under serious pressure  selling off under  22  What s worse for the bulls here is the stock is trading under both its 50 and 200 day moving averages Additional content Can Constellation Brands  STZ  Keep Its Earnings Party Going  Constellation Brands has been performing far above the public

112252,333767,STZ,Trade tensions may dent defensive armor of consumer staples stocks,news,"By April Joyner NEW YORK  Reuters    Shares of consumer staples companies are commonly seen as a safe harbor among U S  equities but may be more susceptible to the fallout from tensions between the United States and its trading partners than other defensive sectors such as utilities and real estate  Persistent trade disputes could raise the cost of goods for consumer staples companies and squeeze their margins  which would hamper their performance in the months to come  market watchers say  U S  tariffs have also weighed on China s economy and could have a similar impact on other targeted countries  which would hurt the performance of companies that sell to those countries  Stocks dived in May after U S  President Donald Trump stated he intended to hike tariffs on goods from China  Those increases  to 25  from 10  on  200 billion worth of Chinese goods  went into effect on Saturday  The S P 500 has risen some 2 8  so far in June as expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates have for the moment superseded trade worries  But Trump has also vowed to levy import taxes on goods from Mexico in an attempt to pressure Mexican authorities to stem illegal immigration into the United States  though Mexico has held talks with the United States in an effort to avoid such tariffs  Over the past month  investors have turned to less risky assets such as U S  government bonds  Among stocks  utilities  real estate and consumer staples shares  which are considered bond proxies because of their high dividend yields  outperformed the S P 500  which fell 6 6  in May  According to a Reuters analysis based on data from Yardeni Research  consumer staples outperformed the S P 500 in four of the five times since 2009 that the benchmark index has dropped more than 10  and led performance among bond proxies once   But they have lagged utilities and real estate recently  Among the bond proxy group in May  the S P 500 real estate index eked out a 0 05  gain  and the S P 500 utilities index fell 0 6   both holding up better than the S P 500 consumer staples index  which dropped 3 5     Because trade and tariffs are starting to heat up again  there s not as much of a safe haven in consumer staples as much as something like utilities   said Shawn Cruz  manager of trader strategy at TD Ameritrade in Jersey City  New Jersey   You can get some benefit in being more selective among defensive sectors   Oliver Pursche  chief market strategist at Bruderman Asset Management in New York  recently revised his allocation of consumer staples shares to underweight from overweight  He has maintained overweight exposure to utilities   Their margins are so thin already  so when they get hit with tariffs  it becomes exponentially more problematic   he said of consumer staples companies  Campbell Soup Co has said tariffs on Mexican goods would raise its costs  and such levies are also expected to have a significant impact on Constellation Brands Inc  NYSE STZ  and Brown Forman Corp  which import beer and tequila  respectively  from Mexico  It s not just a matter of costs  Eleven U S  listed consumer staples companies   including  Mondelez International Inc   NASDAQ MDLZ  and Philip Morris International Inc  NYSE PM    are estimated to generate at least a tenth of their sales in China  and six companies in the sector are estimated to get at least 5 percent of their sales in Mexico  The utilities and real estate sectors  which are domestically focused  lack such exposure   Indeed  though Lori Calvasina  head of U S  equity strategy at RBC Capital Markets in New York  has an  overweight  rating for consumer staples  in her view the sector has high risk exposure to a potential trade conflict with Mexico and moderate exposure to the trade war with China   The trade war disadvantages them a little bit  compared to utilities and real estate   she said  The sector has long faced profit margin pressures  said Rob Almeida  global investment strategist at MFS Investment Management in Boston  and an escalated global trade conflict would only exacerbate that issue  If trade conflicts were to weigh on the U S  economy  the sector s rising leverage ratios could also pose trouble  in his view   It s a sector more leveraged than normal  and it has more risk of margin decay  and those are issues it s had in the past   he said  To be sure  some strategists find advantages in consumer staples  Emily Roland  head of capital markets research at John Hancock Investments in Boston  favors the sector as a defensive play based upon its return on equity and 12 month forward price to earnings ratio   From a valuation standpoint  it s reasonable   she said   Utilities and REITs have become more expensive   Even those who favor consumer staples shares  however  acknowledge that as long as trade tensions remain prominent among investors  concerns  the sector s defensive properties are likely to be tested  
 We re starting to run out of places to hide   RBC s Calvasina said   Almost every sector has some political issues out there  ",2019-06-06,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/trade-tensions-may-dent-defensive-armor-of-consumer-staples-stocks-1890557,1890557
112253,333768,STZ,Economic Calendar   Top 5 Things to Watch This Week,news,"Investing com   Market watchers will be looking ahead to a meeting between U S  President Donald Trump and China s President Xi Jinping this week amid hopes for a thaw in trade relations  even if it alters expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts 
A line up of Fed speakers  as well as fresh economic data and earnings will also command investors  attention  Here s what you need to know to start your week 
1  G20 Meeting
Trump announced last week that he would hold an  extended meeting  with Xi on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Japan  The two day summit gets underway on Friday 
Negotiations between Washington and Beijing broke down in early May after Trump accused China of retreating from previous commitments  causing a market sell off 
Trump then slapped 25  tariffs on  200 billion of Chinese imports and threatened to impose tariffs on another  325 billion of Chinese goods  a scenario that Goldman Sachs says could sink equity markets as much as 4  
 The best the market can expect out of the G20 is a handshake and a commitment to resume talking   said Paul Christopher  head of global market strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute in St  Louis  Missouri 
This could be enough to pep up the trade weary market while anything less could cause the market to nosedive 
2  Fed Speakers
Appearances this week by several Fed policymakers will be closely watched after the U S  central bank indicated last week that it could cut interest rates to offset global economic uncertainties and subdued inflation 
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will discuss the economic outlook and monetary policy at the Council on Foreign Relations  in New York on Tuesday 
New York Fed head John Williams and St Louis Fed President James Bullard are both due to speak the same day  Bullard voted against the Fed s decision to keep rates on hold last week  instead favoring a quarter percentage point rate cut 
One uncertainty investors face is whether positive Trump Xi talks could delay a Fed rate cut 
U S  economic growth  while slowing  is strong enough that  the Fed can afford to wait a while  to monitor trade talk progress  Wells Fargo s Christopher said 
But if investors have to weigh a trade de escalation with the possibility of fewer than hoped for rate cuts  they will likely recognize  that a trade deal is a more powerful boost to U S  growth than Fed cuts   said Manulife s Donald 
3  U S  Economic Data
Some key U S  economic reports this week include the release of durable goods data on Wednesday along with figures on international trade 
Investors will also get an update on the health of the U S  housing market from reports on pending home sales  new home sales and the house price index 
The week will also bring the final reading on first quarter gross domestic product  with the consensus forecast for an unrevised reading of 3 1  
4  Euro Zone Inflation
Friday s euro zone inflation data will tell whether European Central Bank President Mario Draghi was right to warn that more monetary easing would come unless prices started rising faster 
Inflation has undershot the ECB s near 2  target since 2013  The rate was 1 2  in May  The bank is worried  but it is a dilemma shared by policymakers in many countries  not least the U S  and Japan 
But Draghi s words have made a mark  A closely tracked key market inflation gauge    the five year  five year break even forward    has shot up to 1 3   having languished at record lows at around 1 12  ahead of Tuesday s speech 
Economists say  real economy  indicators  wages  for instance  paint a less pessimistic inflation outlook  raising questions about whether Draghi s reaction to market based inflation measures is warranted 
5  Earnings to Watch
Homebuilder  Lennar   NYSE LEN  is due to report before the open on Tuesday  while KB Home  NYSE KBH  is set to release its earnings report a day later 
The world s largest package shipment company  FedEx  NYSE FDX  will report Q4 earnings after the close on Tuesday  amid concerns about its business being hit by the lingering China U S  trade dispute and slowing global growth 
On Thursday  Walgreens Boots Alliance  NASDAQ WBA  is set to report ahead of the open  while sportswear powerhouse  Nike   NYSE NKE  will report after the close 
Constellation Brands  NYSE STZ   the brewer of popular beer brand Corona  is set to report on Friday before the market open

112254,333769,STZ,Day Ahead  Top 3 Things to Watch,news,"Investing com   Death and taxes may still be the only certainties in life  but market moving tweets are making a case for a third entry 
Tomorrow  investors will be looking for and news  comments or  not entirely unlikely  insults coming from the beginning of the G20 meeting tomorrow in Japan 
Here s the top three things that could rock markets
1  Consumer Spending  Inflation to Ramp up Rate Cut Expectations 
Consumer spending and inflation data due Friday will likely bring the Federal Reserve into focus amid growing expectations the central bank is set to deliver its first rate cut since December 2008 at its July meeting 
Personal income for May is forecast to have slowed to 0 3  from 0 5  in the prior month while personal spending is expected to have increase by 0 4  
The Fed s preferred inflation gauge  the core personal consumption expenditures  PCE  price index  which excludes food and energy  is expected to have risen 0 2  in May  with the annual rate remaining at 1 6  
Trade will also be in focus as the G20 powwow is underway  with the bulk of the spotlight likely to be on the meeting this weekend between U S  President Donald Trump and China President Xi Jinping  set for Saturday  President Trump and Russia President Vladimir Putin are expected to meet Friday 
2  Rig Counts on Tap
The weekly installment of drilling activity from Baker Hughes on Friday will provide investors with clues on U S  oil production  which remains near record highs 
Data last week showed the number of oil rigs operating in the U S  rose by 1 to 789 
The weekly rig count is an important barometer for the drilling industry and serves as a proxy for oil production and oil services demand 
But even with U S  crude production flirting with record highs  supplies fell for a second straight week last week  the EIA reported Wednesday  underpinning oil prices  which are up roughly 3  this week 
As well as falling domestic crude stockpiles  rising U S  Iran tensions have also kept crude prices climbing 
Crude futures on Thursday settled 0 1  higher at  59 43 a barrel 
3  Constellation Brands Earnings on Deck 
Constellation Brands  NYSE STZ  will report its fiscal first quarter earnings before the market opens 
The earnings update comes as the alcoholic beverage giant s efforts to revive its struggling wine and sprit brands have seemingly come up short  with management recently taking a decision to sell some of its brands 
Constellation Brands is expected to report earnings of  2 09 a share on revenue of  2 06 billion  according to estimates compiled by Investing com 
The company s guidance will also be closely watched as investors are keen to get a sense of the company s outlook amid slowing beer demand ",2019-06-27,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/day-ahead-top-3-things-to-watch-1909851,1909851
112255,333770,STZ,Losses In Canada s Pot Sector Could Shift Interest To U S  Companies,opinion,"Investors in the cannabis sector on both sides of the Canada U S  border should take added interest in several upcoming earnings reports this week as the findings could signal a significant shift in the direction the sector takes in the short  to mid term 
Much of the attention to date has gone to the larger marijuana companies  And with the exception of Tilray  NASDAQ TLRY   these companies are mostly Canadian based  They all got early endorsement from investors as they were operating in the first nationally legal marketplace  But many of them have watched their share prices drop   especially since April   as they continue to post significant losses 





Chart powered by TradingView
This week  however  with several smaller U S  cannabis growers scheduled to unveil their latest quarterly earnings  focus on smaller operators could show a new trend  None are expected to post a profit  but it will be notable to see if any provide guidance that includes a timeline for expected profitability  That sign  especially if sent by more than a few companies  could serve as a significant marker that will encourage investors to divert larger sums of capital to cannabis companies in the U S   and infuse smaller marijuana growers with needed capital 
Timeline To Profitability
Sharp contrasts on the timeline to profitability between cannabis companies on opposite sides of the Canada U S  border could also shake up the industry  A delay in reaching profitability by the big boys in Canada could prove to be an opportunity for the smaller players in the U S  Timing coupled with impatience might prove to be a combination that triggers the shift 
The stage might already be set  Just look at what happened yesterday  Constellation Brands  NYSE STZ  disclosed it will post a record US 54 8 million loss in the current quarter stemming from its multi billion dollar investment in the biggest cannabis company on the planet  Canadian based  Canopy Growth   NYSE CGC    TSX WEED  
The company behind Corona beer made the disclosure as part of a regulatory statement  which comes in the wake of a statement made by Canopy CEO Mark Zekulin  stating the cannabis grower will not be profitable for another three to five years 
In November 2018  Constellation made a US 4 billion  C 5 3 billion  investment in Canopy  gaining a 56  stake in the company  It was looking to capitalize on the legalized sector  But profits did not follow 
In June  Constellation executives did not shy away from letting analysts know they were not pleased with the mounting losses at Canopy  These statements were quickly followed by the firing of Bruce Linton  Canopy s founder and CEO 
Impatience Hitting Sector
This impatience has had an impact on the entire sector  It is also raising questions  Could smaller companies be more nimble and meet investor expectations on profitability 
Time  of course  will tell  But for now keep an eye on guidance statements 
What To Watch

Illinois is the latest state to legalize marijuana for recreational use  though sales won t start until January 1  Marijuana is now recreationally legal in eleven states and D C  Meanwhile  while medical marijuana is legal in over 30 states and completely legal in Canada for both recreational and medicinal use  And this has all happened relatively quickly  since Colorado and Washington were the first states to approve recreational use in 2012 
Last year  investors reportedly poured over  10 billion into the North American marijuana industry  Overall  the legal weed business is projected to skyrocket from  9 billion in 2017 to an estimated  32 billion by 2020 though estimates vary  Plus  massive firms such as Scotts Miracle Gro   NYSE SMG    Molson Coors   NYSE TAP    GW Pharmaceuticals PLC   NASDAQ GWPH    Altria   NYSE MO    and Corona brewer Constellation Brands   NYSE STZ   have all made bets on the future of legalized marijuana in some form or another 
Inventors should also note that there are a few marijuana industry ETFs  such as ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF   CSE MJ    Others might want to take a look at marijuana REITs such as Innovative Industrial Properties   NYSE IIPR    which controls more than 1 3 million square feet of growing facilities  On top of that  Aurora Cannabis  Tilray   NASDAQ TLRY    Cronos Group   NASDAQ CRON    and Canopy Growth   NYSE CGC   make up the so called big four  pure play pot stocks 
We are also coming off a  Strong Week for Marijuana Stocks   according to our Zacks  portfolio manager David Borun  With all this said  there are still many legal grey areas in the U S  and this is likely to remain the case until marijuana is legalized on the federal level 
 
 
 
 
Aurora Cannabis   TSX ACB  
Edmonton  Canada headquartered ACB is a highly diversified marijuana firm that operates within the broader wholesale and retail distribution sector of the legalized weed industry  Aurora Cannabis has a market cap of  5 5 billion and holds an average daily trading volume of 11 5 million  The firm is one of the largest cannabis companies  with operations and sales across 24 countries for both consumer to medial use  Aurora has also grown over the last serval years through acquisitions 
Last quarter  Q3 fiscal 2019   the firm s consumer revenue popped 37  quarter over quarter  with Medical up 8   Investors should note that these two categories both accounted for roughly 50  of sales each  Overall  ACB s International Medical unit jumped 40  from Q2 with its medical patient base up by 5  and 69  from the year ago period to 77 136 active registered patients 
On top of that  overall Q3 revenue surged 20  from Q2 2019 and 305  from Q3 2018 to reach  65 1 million  The company also produced 99  more kilograms in Q3 than it did in Q2  but only sold 31  kilograms  The difference in increased production against sales growth could indicate a larger problem going forward 
Yet Aurora is likely increasing production in anticipation of wider legalization  This includes the so called legalization 2 0 in Canada  which is projected to include popular derivatives like edibles  concentrates and other offerings that weren t legalized last year   Aurora remains focused on having vapes and certain edibles ready for launch under new regulations in the Canadian consumer market which are expected toward the end of the calendar year   the firm wrote in a statement last quarter   
 With production ramping up  the Company continues to scale up manufacturing capacity  with innovation and technologies aimed at reducing time from harvest to market  The Company anticipates that increased processing  packaging and delivery efficiencies in Q4 and beyond will accelerate availability of product  
Q4 Outlook   Beyond
Looking ahead  our current Zacks Consensus Estimates call for Aurora s Q4 2019 revenue to skyrocket 432  from the year ago period to touch  79 0 million based on four total estimates  This would also represent a similar 21  sequential expansion from Q3 2019  Peeking further ahead  Q1 2020 revenue is projected to pop 18  from our fourth quarter estimate to hit  93 2 million 
The company s full year fiscal 2019 revenue is expected to climb from  55 2 million in 2018 to reach  192 6 million  This would represent roughly 250  expansion that would see it outpace 2018 s 205  full year growth  Then  Aurora s 2020 revenue is projected to climb 150  above our current year estimate to reach  487 4 million 
At the bottom end of the income statement  ACB is projected to post an adjusted quarterly loss of  0 02 per share  This would mark a significant fall from the prior year period  This year over year downturn is expected to be even larger for the full year  with Aurora predicted to post an adjusted full year loss of   0 23 a share  The marijuana company is also projected to post another adjusted loss in 2020 
Bottom Line
Aurora is currently a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   based on its negative earnings estimate revision activity  With that said  investors and Wall Street are likely focused much more on top line growth as the Canadian company ramps up production  distribution  and nearly everything else in the nascent marijuana industry 
Pot stocks have been hugely volatile and there is still much uncertainty regarding U S  federal legalization  Nonetheless  investors who can handle the inherent risks could be rewarded in the long run if things break the right way 
ACB stock is currently trading at roughly  6 00 per share  Clearly  investors shouldn t consider buying a stock just because it s  cheap   But Aurora does appear to be in a strong position to expand within a larger growth market  which is still largely untapped 
Aurora is scheduled to report its fourth quarter and fiscal 2019 results after the closing bell on Wednesday  September 11  The firm s conference call is set for Thursday morning  Make sure to come back to Zacks for a complete breakdown of Aurora s Q4 results

112261,333776,STZ,Things You Must Know Before Constellation s  STZ  Q2 Earnings,opinion,Constellation Brands  Inc    NYSE STZ   is scheduled to release second quarter fiscal 2020 results on Oct 3 Notably  this leading wine company delivered a positive earnings surprise in the preceding four quarters   the average beat being 10 5  Constellation Brands Inc Price and EPS Surprise   How Are Estimates FaringThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for second quarter earnings stands at  2 61  indicating a 9 1  decline from the year ago quarter s reported figure  Further  the consensus mark has moved south by a penny in the past seven days  For second quarter revenues  the consensus mark is pegged at  2 33 billion  suggesting a 1 4  rise from the prior year quarter s reported figure Factors at PlayConstellation Brands has been delivering a strong performance  evident from its consistent earnings record and strength in the beer business  The company is also poised to gain from exposure in the cannabis space with its investment in Canopy Growth  Furthermore  its constant brand building efforts  acquisitions and innovation are commendable Strength in Constellation Brands  beer business has been a key growth driver  In first quarter fiscal 2020  sales at the beer business improved for the 37th straight quarter  owing to an increase in shipments and depletions  In fact  the beer business is the most significant contributor to the U S  beer market  courtesy of gains at Modelo Especial  Corona Premier and Corona Refresca  These brands were aided by superb distribution gains and strong innovation Additionally  Constellation Brands  consistent focus on brand building and initiatives to include new products are aiding the top line  Owing to its endeavors  the company is experiencing an increase in market share  especially in the U S  beer category Its innovation and marketing efforts are well recognized in the beverage market  Recently  the company launched Corona Refresca in the Corona brand family  The brand has gained the entire commodity volume or ACV distribution of above 30 since its launch  In the summer selling season  this brand is poised for growth in the flavored malt beverage category  The company is also witnessing solid response for some of its previously launched innovations  including SVEDKA Rose  Robert Mondavi Private Selection  Rum Barrel Aged Merlot  and Crafters Union  Wine in a Can Additionally  management will continue enhancing its Bourbon Barrel Aged innovation program  which sold more than 1 million cases in the first two years  For fiscal 2020  the company has a strong innovation pipeline  with planned launches for the Woodbridge Rose and Robert Mondavi Private Selection Moreover  it expects to expand consumer marketing efforts for fiscal 2020  with new sponsorship opportunities  including the PGA  the U S  Tennis Association and several NFL teams for Meiomi  Kim Crawford and Woodbridge brands Backed by these initiatives  Constellation Brands is likely to post solid top  and bottom line improvements in the upcoming quarterly results However  softness in the company s wine   spirits business has been significantly weighing on these positive factors  Lower shipment volumes and depletions are hurting the segment s sales  Although Constellation Brands has announced the divestiture of nearly 30 low end brands from the wine   spirits portfolio  the segment s growth might take time Despite the encouraging divestiture plan  net sales  on a reported basis  for this business are estimated to decline 20 25  in fiscal 2020  with the operating income decreasing 25 30   The guidance for the wine   spirits business includes impacts from the sale of its brands to Gallo Further  the company issued a bearish outlook for fiscal 2020  due to impacts from the adjustments related to losses from the Canopy Growth deal  mostly higher interest expense  and other activities along with the wine and spirits divestitures For fiscal 2020  interest expenses are now expected to be  425  435 million  up from the prior projection of  420  430 million  The view includes an additional interest of  105 million related to the 2018 Canopy investment  This might weigh on the company s bottom line and hurt its performance in second quarter fiscal 2020 What the Zacks Model PredictsOur proven model does not conclusively predict that Constellation Brands is likely to beat earnings estimates in second quarter fiscal 2020  A stock needs to have both   a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold    for this to happen  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Constellation Brands has a Zacks Rank  3 but an Earnings ESP of  1 83   which makes surprise prediction difficult Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings EstimatesHere are some companies you may want to consider  as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to deliver

112262,333777,STZ,Earnings Preview  Constellation Brands  STZ  Q2 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"The market expects Constellation Brands  STZ  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended August 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on October 3  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This wine  liquor and beer company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 61 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  9 1  
Revenues are expected to be  2 33 billion  up 1 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2 26  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Constellation Brands 
For Constellation Brands  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 20  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Constellation Brands will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Constellation Brands would post earnings of  2 07 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 21  delivering a surprise of  6 76  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Constellation Brands doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-09-25,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-constellation-brands-stz-q2-earnings-expected-to-decline-200468293,200468293
112263,333778,STZ,Why The Earnings Surprise Streak Could Continue For Constellation Brands  STZ ,opinion,"If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report  you should consider Constellation Brands  STZ   This company  which is in the Zacks Beverages   Alcohol industry  shows potential for another earnings beat 
This wine  liquor and beer company has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 7 18  
For the most recent quarter  Constellation Brands was expected to post earnings of  2 07 per share  but it reported  2 21 per share instead  representing a surprise of 6 76   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  1 71 per share  while it actually produced  1 84 per share  a surprise of 7 60  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Constellation Brands lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Constellation Brands currently has an Earnings ESP of  2 44   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on October 3  2019 
With the Earnings ESP metric  it s important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power  however  a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-09-26,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-the-earnings-surprise-streak-could-continue-for-constellation-brands-stz-200468756,200468756

112291,333806,STZ,StockBeat   Goldman Warns Headwinds on Tap for Boston Beer  Shares Plunge,news,"Investing com    Boston Beer appears to be a victim of its own success as its shares are tumbling Friday after Goldman Sachs served up sobering note on the beer maker questioning if it can replicate its recent success 
Boston Beer  NYSE SAM  has been riding high on flavored malt beverage and cider innovations launched last year  both of which ensured frothy sales were on tap  But with competition set to crank up a notch  Goldman Sachs suggests it s time to ditch the beer goggles on Boston Beer and downgraded its shares to a sell rating  The shares fell 7 7  by 1 35 p m  ET  Friday and are off nearly 18  since March 11  
 While SAM has seen its overall sales growth accelerate on the back of its FMB and cider innovations in 2018  we downgrade SAM to Sell and see headwinds in 2019 as competition intensi es and the company is unlikely to repeat its innovation success again this year   Goldman Sachs said 
While Boston Beer is seemingly heading down a wobbly path  Constellation Brands  NYSE STZ  appears to be on a solid footing and could see its sales pick up pace if its flavored malt beverage innovations prove a hit  the bank said  Fourth quarter earnings  released Thursday  easily beat estimates 
 We favor STZ within our Alcoholic Beverage coverage as its core beer portfolio remains on a solid footing  and there is potential upside to sales if its FMB innovations  i e  Corona Refresca  proves to be more successful   Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  added  
But not everyone agrees  Deutsche Bank downgraded Constellation Brands to hold from buy on worries that the stock has little room for upside  The shares were off 0 3  on Friday but are up more than 18  this year

112293,333808,STZ,Bull Of The Day  The Boston Beer Company  Inc   SAM ,opinion,"The Boston Beer Company  SAM  posted stronger than projected second quarter financial results last week  even as the larger beer industry grapples with changing consumer habits  Despite slowing beer sales in the broader market  SAM shares have soared nearly 60  in 2019 to blow away the S P 500 and its industry 
The Pitch 
Boston Beer last Thursday posted revenue of  318 4 million  which marked a  45 3 million or 16 6  climb from the year ago period  The firm pointed to continued strength from its Truly Hard Seltzer brand  along with Twisted Tea as big reasons for its sales growth as its flagship Samuel Adams sales slow   Our depletions growth in the second quarter was a result of increases in our Truly Hard Seltzer and Twisted Tea brands that were only partially offset by decreases in our Samuel Adams and Angry Orchard brands   the company wrote in prepared remarks 
 Truly continues to grow beyond our expectations  We are launching Truly draft nationally this quarter while we continue to expand distribution across all channels  
The firm launched Truly in April 2016  This helped Boston Beer grab market share and build brand awareness relatively early on in the quickly the growing hard seltzer market  And the category hardly seems like a fad 
In fact  UBS analyst Sean King  the category can jump from  550 million at the moment to  2 5 billion by 2021  which implies an annual growth rate of 66   Plus  hard seltzer sales already surged 193  in the 52 week period that ended on April 20   
The Boston based firm is not alone in its purist of this new growth market  Anheuser  Busch InBev  BUD  owns Bon   Viv Spiked Seltzer  while Molson Coors  TAP  owns Henry s Hard Sparkling Water and Constellation  STZ  has rolled out a Corona branded flavored malt beverage that is part of the larger non beer category   
Along with Truly s success  Boston Beer officially closed its  300 million merger with Dogfish Head Craft Brewery on July 3  We can also see that SAM stock has roared back recently after an extended downturn 
Boston Beer shares have skyrocketed 145  in the past two years to crush its industry s roughly 9  average decline  SAM stock is also up 40  in the past 12 months  while the alcoholic beverages market dipped 4 5  
 
 
 
Outlook   Earnings Trends
Boston Beer expects full year 2019 shipments and depletions to jump between 17  and 22   including Dogfish Head  This marks a significant jump from its previous 10  to 15  guidance  Excluding the Dogfish Head impact  fiscal year shipments and depletions are projected to climb between 13  and 18  
Shipments and depletions don t exactly equal revenue generating sales  With this in mind  our current Zacks Consensus Estimate calls for Boston Beer s fiscal 2019 revenue to jump 11 7  to reach  1 13 billion  Looking further down the road  SAM s fiscal 2020 revenue is projected to climb nearly 9  higher than our current year estimate to reach  1 23 billion 
At the bottom end of the income statement  Boston Beer s adjusted full year 2019 EPS figure is projected to surge 17 5  to  8 78 per share  In a sign of sustained expansion  the firm s 2020 earnings are expected to climb roughly 13  above our 2019 projection 
Investors will also see that SAM s earnings estimate revision activity has boosted its fiscal 2019 and 2020 outlook recently  Boston Beer has also topped our quarterly earnings estimates by an average of 35  over the trailing four periods 
 
 
Bottom Line
Boston Beer has clearly positioned itself for future growth as consumers change their drinking habits  SAM is currently a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  stock that sports an  A  grade for Growth and a  B  for Momentum in our Style Scores system

112294,333809,STZ,2 Marijuana Stocks To Buy Heading Into Q2 Earnings And Beyond,opinion,"The marijuana industry is projected to grow at an  until it reaches  55 8 billion a year in 2025  The cannabis market has roughly tracked the S P 500 s expansion in 2019  A popular ETF representing the cannabis market  called Alternative Harvest   CSE MJ    is up 13 2  YTD  while the S P has climbed 13 6  
Industry Outlook
Marijuana is not yet federally legal in the U S   although it is many some states and Canada  Cowen estimated in an April 2018 report that the global cannabis industry rested at about  50 billion annually  including black market channels 
With many 2020 presidential candidates supporting federal legalization  or at least easing of marijuana restrictions  it seems likely that legalization will come within the next few years  If this happens  a large portion of the black market will theoretically move to the legal market 
Cannabis is already recreationally legal in 11 states  D C   and Canada  and a bill in Congress was recently passed by the House to prevent federal authorities from interfering with state legalizations  It is also medically legal in 33 states and D C 
Data suggests that consumers will treat federally legalized marijuana like alcohol  as a  published by three universities showed that alcohol sales decreased by 15  where medical marijuana is legal  This is good news for the cannabis industry  because if it could imitate the  it will end up in a great spot 
Let s take a look at some promising cannabis stocks reporting earnings in the next week and see how they look on the growth front 
Canopy Growth Corporation   NYSE CGC  
Canopy is a cannabis company headquartered in Smith Falls  Ontario that produces a large selection of products  The company is vertically integrated and operates in every stage from growing marijuana to retail  It is currently the largest cannabis company in the world with a market cap of  11 2 billion  The stock has shot up 350  in the last 2 years but has dropped of from its highs recently 
Constellation   NYSE STZ   brands in August 2018 purchased 38  of Canopy for  4 billion  This gave Canopy some much needed capital to expand and become an international company  and exposed the Corona and Modelo maker to the emerging cannabis market 
Canopy also signed a deal in April that gave the company the right to buy Acreage Holdings for  3 4 billion  contingent on the U S  federally legalizing marijuana  This will be a huge deal for Canopy if completed  as Acreage has operations and dispensaries in many U S  states  which would give Canopy instant access to the U S  market  The thought being that Canopy wouldn t have to spend time building out operations in the U S  and risk losing market share in the process 
Canopy currently holds a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and very impressive growth estimates  CGC reports earnings after close on Wednesday  August 14 
Our Zacks Consensus Estimates call for year over year top line growth of 327 9  that would see it hit  86 million  Estimates for Q3 call for 530  gains over Q3 2018 to reach  112 46 million  Full year revenue growth is projected to surge 198  to  511 48 million  with fiscal 2020 revenue expected to hit  1 02 billion 

Tilray Inc    NASDAQ TLRY  
Tilray is a pharmaceutical and cannabis company headquartered in Toronto  It went public last July and produces and sells medical and recreational marijuana  Tilray stock is up 87 2  since its IPO  but is down YTD from its astronomical highs 
In December 2018  Tilray signed a deal with Novartis   NYSE NVS   subsidiary Sandoz to co brand and distribute non combustible cannabis products in legal markets worldwide  This was big pharma s first partnership with the cannabis industry  Tilray also partnered at the end of 2018 with Anheuser Busch InBev   NYSE BUD   in a  100 million deal to produce non alcoholic THC and CBD infused beverages to sell in legal markets  These have the potential for huge popularity if the cannabis market starts to pull heavily from the alcohol industry 
Tilray is currently a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and is set to report its earnings after the closing bell on Tuesday  August 13  Our Zacks Consensus Estimates call for top line growth of 313 06  that would see it reach  40 23 million 
Like Canopy  estimates for Q3 show even stronger growth  with 408 5  gains expected over last year to  51 1 million  Full year revenue growth projections show 320  growth to reach  181 2 million  Plus  2020 revenue is predicted at  394 3 million 
Bottom Line
Tilray and Canopy are both projected to post losses through at least fiscal 2020  But investors should not be too worried as both companies pour money into growth opportunities and prepare for U S  marijuana legalization  Tilray and Canopy also appear to be trending in the right direction as their projected losses are set to shrink moving forward 
Both of these companies are poised to jump on U S  cannabis legalization though partnerships with other companies  The cash infusions from these deals have allowed Canopy and Tilray to expand at a tremendous pace and the partnerships will provide them already established distribution channels if and when the U S  legalizes

112298,333813,STZ,Canopy  Tilray Earnings On Tap As Investors Worry About Losses,opinion,"It s been a mixed bag for marijuana producers this year  Though they enjoyed a strong start to 2019 due to global marijuana legalization efforts and the burgeoning use of CBD as a wellness product  the initial euphoria which sent shares of some producers soaring is now waning 
Investors have begun to judge these companies by their quarterly performance rather than longer term future prospects  And it s unlikely that marijuana companies will show profitability anytime soon  As well  they spend heavily on marketing as a way of grabbing market share in this still nascent industry 
With this backdrop  it s the revenue number that most analysts will be focusing on to see how successful cannabis companies have been at translating their inventories into hard cash  Two large pot producers   Canopy Growth   NYSE CGC  and Tilray  NASDAQ TLRY   are scheduled to respectively report their Q1 and Q2 earnings this coming week  Here s what to look for  
Canopy Growth
It s not an easy time for Canopy Growth  the world s largest marijuana producer  which is reporting its fiscal 2020 first quarter earnings on Wednesday  August 14  after the close 





The Smiths Falls  Ontario based producer  whose stock closed at  32 93 on Friday  has lost more than 30  of its value in the last three months as the company faces growing pressure to cut losses and curb spending  After its previous earnings report in June  the company s largest shareholder  Constellation Brands  NYSE STZ  forced the ouster of Canopy s chairman and co chief executive officer  Bruce Linton  on differences over strategy and spending decisions 
Constellation  which owns 38  of Canopy and controls its board  wants management to focus more on operational efficiency after a major acquisition spree  Since Constellation s  4 billion investment was announced in August 2018  Canopy has done  781 million in deals  according to Dealogic  Canopy also signed a deal in April that gave the company the right to buy  Acreage  Holdings  OTC ACRGF   a New York City based investment firm specializing in the cannabis industry  for  3 4 billion  contingent on the U S  federally legalizing marijuana 
Investors may see a clear shift towards controlling costs and improving other earning metrics when the company reports earnings  but it s still a long road to achieving profitability for this producer  which controls the largest market share in Canada s recently legalized recreational pot market  Analysts on average are expecting losses of   0 22 per share on sales of almost  86 million 
Tilray Inc 
Tilray is scheduled to announce its fiscal 2019  second quarter earnings after the market close today  Tuesday  August 13  Analysts  consensus forecast expects sales to double  to more than  40 million  when compared to the Q1 period with   0 26 a share loss 
In June  Tilary told investors that the Nanaimo  British Columbia based cannabis company won t generate positive earnings for at least another year as it spends on the U S  CBD market and other opportunities  The U S  legalized hemp and hemp derived CBD in December  opening opportunities for Canadian producers south of the border  That development prompted Tilray to acquire hemp food manufacturer Manitoba Harvest and to partner with Authentic Brands Group LLC earlier this year 





Tilray stock  which hit a high of  300 in September last year  is one of the biggest boom and bust stories in the cannabis sector where valuations of many stocks can t be justified simply by looking at their sales numbers  When Tilray announces its earnings later today  that will be the key concern 
After a major plunge since September  Tilray is still one of the most expensive stocks in the sector  It closed at  42 57 on Friday  giving it a market cap of close to  5 billion USD  That valuation may come under scrutiny if the company fails to show a major improvement in sales ",2019-08-12,Haris Anwar/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/canopy-tilray-earnings-on-tap-as-investors-worry-about-losses-200454039,200454039
112299,333814,STZ,Will Investor Impatience With The Cannabis Sector Spur A Profitability Push ,opinion,"Are investors in the cannabis sector developing a growing sense of impatience  Could this speed up the push to profitability 
There is evidence to support the theory  Just yesterday some of the major stocks in the arena   Canopy Growth   NYSE CGC    TSX WEED    Cronos  Group  NASDAQ CRON    TSX CRON  and Tilray  NASDAQ TLRY   gave up ground  adding to their losses from last week 
Are investors in the cannabis sector developing a growing sense of impatience  Could this speed up the push to profitability

Increased sales  expanding networks  strategic partnerships  the highlights that once spurred stock prices higher   are largely being ignored as thepathway to profit takes on greater importance even though the industry is still in its infancy 
Adding to the impatience are the devastating headlines sparked by  CannTrust  Holdings  NYSE CTST    TSX TRST   which continue to come at a head spinning pace  The latest blow to hit the troubled Canadian based cannabis grower landed yesterday as the company was officially informed that its growing operation in Vaughan  Ont   was not compliant with Canada s federal government regulations  sending shares down more than 27 5  at the close 

Since early last month  when it first publicly acknowledged it had been growing marijuana in unlicensed spaces at its greenhouse facility in Pelham  Ont   CannTrust has lost about 55  of its market cap  The medical cannabis provider has been in crisis mode ever since  It has ceased selling product and exporting goods  fired a CEO and lost its chairman of the board  CannTrust launched an internal investigation and pledged to cooperate with regulators as it struggles to regain its footing 
Other specific signs of investor impatience in the cannabis sector were seen last week  as two major players reported their latest earnings  Both Aphria  NYSE APHA    TSX APHA  and Cronos Group earlier this month reported better than expected numbers  but neither company saw a sustained bump in share price 
In fact  Cronos on Aug  8 reported it had almost tripled revenue figures compared with the same period last year  But mounting operating costs ate into its solid revenue numbers  leaving an overall loss of  13 44 million USD  C 17 8M  for the quarter  The result  the stock went up on the early news but has been slipping ever since  It opened Aug  8 on the NASDAQ at  14 60 and closed yesterday at  13 25  a decline of 9 25  

Over at Aphria  fourth quarter results set a precedent in the sector as the company posted a profit for the three month period that ended May 31  It was the first profit report since marijuana was legalized in Canada in the fall of 2018  Distribution revenue jumped and cannabis sales made impressive gains  Its stock price soared on the news  gaining more than 42  on Aug  2   but is down almost 11 5  since then 
A glimpse at just how impatient investors will remain could come later this week when two of the biggest cannabis companies Canopy Growth and Tilray unveil their earnings 
Canopy Growth will report Aug  14  It is under pressure to perform  After the last earnings report  the board canned its high profile CEO and founder  Bruce Linton 
Although this week s earnings report will cover the three month period ending June 30  which is the last quarter of Linton s tenure at the company  Canopy s major investor  U S  beer maker Constellation Brands  NYSE STZ  has made it clear it is looking for a shift 
There are two key metrics analysts will be watching in the Canopy report  The first will be overall sales 
The second area will be an indication of progress in the edible and beverage sector  as the Canadian retail rollout is set for later this year  It might be difficult to see that in the numbers because it is still in the planning stages  but there is physical proof  Last week  construction crews were putting the finishing touches on a bottling facility for cannabis infused drinks near the headquarters in Smith Falls  Ont   as well as on a global distribution plant  Two concrete indications that expansion will soon give way to more profitable sales and distribution activities in area of greater profit margins

Something To Consider
A statistic to consider  one in seven Americans uses CBD oil  This figure  released last week by the Gallup poll  represents 14  of the U S  population who say they use some form of the oil  primarily for therapeutic reasons  Based on 2 500 telephone interviews between June 19 to July 12  these findings point to the explosive popularity of the hemp based product 
According to the poll  one in ten people over the age of 65 uses the cannabidiol  the non psychoactive extract from hemp and marijuana  The survey also asked respondents what they used CBD for  40  said they used the oil for pain  20  used it for anxiety  11  for sleep  8  for arthritis  5  for headaches and 5  for stress 
The use of CBD in the U S  has spread since the passage of the U S  Farm Bill late last year that legalized the growing of hemp  The Food and Drug Administration is currently developing regulations to allow CBD to be marketed in food and as a dietary supplement ",2019-08-13,Brenda O'Farrell/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-investor-impatience-with-the-cannabis-sector-spur-a-profitability-push-200454425,200454425
112300,333815,STZ,Canopy Growth  CGC  Earnings After The Bell  How High Can They Go ,opinion,"Q2 earnings are winding down with only a few exciting names yet to come  The largest publicly traded cannabis company is releasing earnings this evening  and investors need to see some positive results 
Canopy Growth   NYSE CGC   is reporting its June quarter results after the bell today  CGC has recently been a big mover on earnings with an average move of 9 4  over the last 4 earnings  2 up  2 down  
Analysts are estimating an EPS of    0 28  on sales of  86 million  This would represent an EPS decline of 133  year over year  but revenue growth of 309   Canopy has missed on the last 4 EPS estimates and 3 out of the previous 4 revenue projections  CGC share price is driven more by management guidance and marijuana news than it is by surprises on earnings or sales on earnings releases 
Constellation s Stake
Constellation Brand  STZ  increased its stake in Canopy Growth to roughly 40   from the original 9 9  in 2017  for  4 billion back in August of 2018  Constellation targeted Canopy because of its diverse portfolio of cannabis based products and scalability that would allow STZ to get its foot in the door in an industry that is going to take off 
Constellation Brands  NYSE STZ  is the second largest U S  alcohol company with long standing distribution and supply chain operations  This partnership is one of the best things that could have happened to Canopy Growth  giving them access to Constellation s well established supply chain to quickly scale operations in Canada and in the ability to do so in the U S  when legislation legalizes marijuana federally 
Constellation and Canopy are working closely to come up with a fast acting marijuana infused beverage that provides the consumer with a mild buzz without the calories of beer 
CGC has been on an acquisition frenzy  buying up as many diverse cannabis players as they can to put their stake deep in the cannabis soil  This surge in cash from Constellations increased their acquisition ability with management putting C 1 billion  roughly  750 million USD  aside for further purchases in this ripe industry 
U S  Cannabis Industry 
A significant portion of the future growth priced into these cannabis stocks is contingent on the U S  federally legalizing weed  The market for marijuana in Canada is expected to grow at over 77  annually  according to Cannabis Business Plan  The market in the U S   if legalized  is anticipated to grow even faster  Some analysts are predicting that it could even surpass the  100 billion U S  beer industry 
The modern consumer has changed as a generational consumption shift materializes  Millennials are now the largest consuming generation  and purchases are becoming increasingly health motivated  A low calorie marijuana based beverage or snack could be just what these next generation consumers are looking for as an alternative to alcohol 
The Pot Stocks
Top Canadian cannabis stocks include Canopy Growth  Cronos Group   NASDAQ CRON    Aurora Cannabis   TSX ACB    and Tilray   NASDAQ TLRY    All the pot stocks saw strong rallies in the in first few months of the year but have retreated quite a bit since  Below you can see how these stocks have traded since the beginning of the year 

These Canadian marijuana stocks are trading at exceptionally high multiples and beta s north of 3  Since these firms are yet to turn a consistent profit an useful metric for valuation is forward price to sales  P S   CGC is trading at 17x P S  on the lower end of its 5 year trend  but multitudes higher than the S P 500 s 3x  This multiple is being propelled by the triple digit top line growth figures that are expected over the next 2 years  These upcoming earnings reports will be crucial in deciding whether the extreme valuations are warranted 
Take Away
Canopy Growth and its publicly traded peers are all very high risk stocks but could yield significant returns in the future once the U S  federally legalize marijuana  Canopy is the clear leader in this space with a vastly diversified portfolio of cannabis products along with its STZ partnership and impending Acreage Holdings acquisition  CGC is making all the right moves to continue gaining market share as the market itself proliferates 
Before the U S  legalization push  another phase of Canadian regulation is expected to open up more streams of revenue for Canopy s diverse portfolio of cannabis products  Look for this regulation release in October of this year 
Tonight s earnings release is likely to be another crapshoot for CGC but look for management s guidance on expansion expectations

112305,333820,STZ,Canopy Shares Hit Lowest Point In 2019 On Monday  What s Next ,opinion,"Shares of the world s largest cannabis company hit their lowest point in 2019 yesterday  The price of  Canopy Growth  Corp  NYSE CGC    TSX WEED  stock closed at US 26 72  C 35 66   marking a 4 94  drop on the day and a 48 6  slide since the end of April  when it hit US 52 03  C 69 90  
The stock registered its all time highest in October 2018  when marijuana was legalized in Canada  trading at US 56 89  C 73 75   In the last 12 months  it has lost 16 74  
In the first few months of 2019  from January to late April  the stock price   like others in the cannabis sector   was driven by continued optimism  But that buoyancy was difficult to maintain in the face of indisputable numbers 

Worse than expected earnings results not only took a toll on Canopy Growth stock  they caught up with other players in the sector  Investors  who were once fuelled by the prospect of great things to come  got impatient   and that included corporate investors who entered the space as strategic investors with deep pockets 




So Where Does Canopy Go From Here 
The answer is still not clear  but indicators are out there 

Last week s earnings report was a major one  The Ontario based cannabis grower reported a net loss of C 1 28 billion  US 0 96 billion  in its first quarter of fiscal 2020  This was up from a loss of C 91 million  US 68 3 million  in the same period in fiscal 2019  It had an increase in revenue  but it did not stack up against the 215  spike in operating costs 

Net revenues were pegged at C 90 5 million  US 67 9 million   compared with C 25 9 million  US 19 4 million  in the same period the previous year  The healthy increase in revenues was attributed to the company s largest harvest to date   40 000 kilograms 

Despite some positive indicators  the bottom line was that both the reported loss and revenue figures were worse than analysts had anticipated  This sent share prices from US 31 93  C 42 46  at the close on Aug  14 just before the earnings report was released to US 27 34  C 36 38  at the close the following day  a drop of 14 38   The stock rallied somewhat in the latter half of last week  but resumed its downward trajectory yesterday 
Former CEO Buying Up Stock

Countering the negative impact of the earnings numbers were reports of what the company s high profile former CEO was up to  Bruce Linton  who was fired in June after Canopy s strategic partner  Constellation Brands  NYSE STZ   issued a public thumbs down on the company s performance following the previous earnings report  is buying stock 
Linton  who founded Canopy in 2013 and built it into the biggest cannabis producer on the globe  is still very keen on the company  After the stock fell in the wake of the latest earnings  he revealed in an interview that he has been  watching the dips  and has bought shares  He did not disclose how much he bought  but said he took advantage of what he referred to as the  August sale  
Here s Something To Chew On

As investors look toward the next developments in the overall cannabis market   the introduction of a slew of consumer products such as beverages and edibles  Canopy Growth says it s preparing rapidly for the wave of legalizations  The company announced during its earnings presentation that it s filed 56 patents in the last three months alone for new products  CEO Mark Zekulin said these high margin  unique cannabis consumer products  including vapes  food products and drinks  have the greatest potential of expanding the Canadian market for recreational cannabis products for the company And indeed  according to a new survey  an estimated 3 million customers are expected to enter the Canadian cannabis market when edibles  extracts and topicals are legalized later this year 
That is the major finding of a  last week by EY Canada and Lift   Co 
And given that Canada is leading the legalization push  what happens there provides a benchmark that other potential markets that are considering legalization are watching 
 New product offerings will open the doors for experimentation among current and non consumers giving cannabis companies the opportunity to capture a larger market share   said Monica Chadha of EY Canada Cannabis   But companies should keep in mind that these consumer segments will have very different attitudes towards cannabis and product formats  ultimately driving the need for differentiated customer experiences  
Only 17  of Canadian adults are cannabis consumers at the moment  according to Statistic Canada 
Current non consumers place more emphasis on clinical research and information to make purchasing decisions  according to the survey  The report claims a third of non consumers surveyed said they did not know enough about cannabis to consume it  but were interested in experimenting with low dosage baked goods  confectionery and food additive products 
These products will be in retail outlets in Canada by mid December ",2019-08-20,Brenda O'Farrell/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/canopy-shares-hit-lowest-point-in-2019-on-monday-whats-next-200456564,200456564

Anheuser Busch InBev hopes as it strives to reach more than 100 million U S  TV viewers during Sunday s Super Bowl  promoting vintage brands such as Budweiser and Bud Light  The world s largest brewer will not say how much it is spending for nearly six minutes of commercials  but industry sources estimate it is more than  50 million  That is up from the  42 million that Kantar Media said the brewer spent for four minutes of ad time last year  It is only part of the company s strategy to recapture market share from craft beers and Mexican imports   Brendan Whitworth  the head of sales for U S  arm Anheuser Busch  told Reuters the company would retain its big  national campaigns but also push ahead with its new strategy of tailoring brand marketing to individual American cities   The things we ve started to work on this year  we re starting to see real results  We re looking forward to scaling up those localized programs even more   he said   The Super Bowl s huge and diverse audience has makers of cars  beer and other consumer goods scrambling to create eye catching commercials that are sometimes more memorable than the game  Budweiser this year will bring back its iconic Clydesdale horses  while telling drinkers that the beer is produced with renewable energy from wind power  Bud Light has continued its mock medieval ad series  Driven by the need to pay off some  100 billion from its 2016 purchase of rival SABMiller  LON SAB   the company  which is known for acquisitions and cost savings  has made top line growth its priority  U S  management  overhauled in late 2017  believes it is on course to rebound in the company s biggest market  Part of that is the local ad focus and fresh versions of 143 year old staple Budweiser  as well as Bud Light   available now in an orange flavor  The two main brands make up 56 percent of its U S  beer sales  according to market research company Euromonitor International  That is down from more than 60 percent in 2013  Whitworth  a former Marine  CIA officer and PepsiCo  NASDAQ PEP  Inc director  said the goal is to boost the brand s shares and eventually halt their sales decline  AB InBev has a 36 4 percent share of the U S  beer market  according to Euromonitor  followed by Molson Coors and Constellation Brands  NYSE STZ    In general  mainstream lagers including Bud and Bud Light have fallen  while the shares of craft and imports have risen  according to market research group Nielsen  Drinkers have also shifted to wine and spirits  Executives at Heineken  the world s second largest beer maker  have said brewers need to work together to win back drinkers  Industry leaders say there still is a space for mainstream beer  which is cheaper and less caloric than many crafts   When  fans are watching an NFL game  that s a four to five hour experience    I m not sure it s a craft moment   said Jonnie Cahill  Heineken USA s chief marketing officer  Given recent trends  Anheuser Busch needs the equivalent of a  Hail Mary  pass  Its share of beer sales in the United States  its biggest market  is set to have declined 0 50 percentage points in 2018 after a 0 75 drop in 2017  That may seem slight  but the trend is in the wrong direction  A return to growth is not imminent   It s a supertanker and it s not going to turn on a six pence  I think it s going to be a slow journey   said Trevor Stirling  a London based beverage analyst at Bernstein Research  AB InBev s share of the U S  beer market has declined every year but one since its formation in 2008  when Belgium based InBev bought America s Anheuser Busch  Budweiser has steadily fallen  Bud Light s share last rose in 2012  when it rolled out an offshoot  Bud Light Lime A Rita  a margarita flavored brew with double the alcohol and calories of Bud Light  Despite the revival  Anheuser Busch said it has learned that the company should not stray too far from a brand s roots   Those extensions  they didn t necessarily reinforce the mother brand s position   Whitworth said   The brewer removed  Bud Light  from Lime a Rita cans this year  Last summer  it launched Bud Light Orange  brewed with orange peels  The product  with slightly more calories  is sweet and fruity  akin to an orange soda with alcohol  some drinkers say  Whitworth said it was one of the industry s most successful new products of 2018  boosting sales and margins and bringing in more female drinkers  The company hopes some Bud Light Orange drinkers will become regular Bud Light fans  Bud Light has partnerships with 28 of the 32 NFL teams  including this season s finalists  the Los Angeles Rams and the Boston based New England Patriots  But its marketing efforts with them have been modest to date  including special cans showing each team s logo  Earlier this season  Bud Light focused on Cleveland  whose team  the Browns  was experiencing one of the longest losing streaks in the sport  When the Browns finally won  the brewer set up  victory fridges  in bars across the city  Bud Light s share of core beer sales there grew as a result  Whitworth said  Citing another localized effort  Whitworth pointed to Philadelphia  the nation s sixth largest city  Bud Light offered free beer to fans of the Eagles when they won their first Super Bowl in 2018  This season the company unveiled a statue to commemorate the  Philly Special   a trick play in which the quarterback turned receiver for a touchdown in the championship game  Whitworth said the approach led to Bud Light sales growth of 9 percent in Philadelphia in the first half of 2018   They had an army of people handing out beer at the parade   said Pete Ciarrocchi  chief of Chickie and Pete s  a popular chain of sports bars in the Philadelphia area  The brewer s U S  arm is hoping the sales boost will help build long term loyalty  In one potentially positive sign  Philadelphian Peter Rosa  who normally chooses regional craft brands such as Dogfish Head and

112327,333842,STZ,Canopy Growth s Disappointing Q4 May Be Masking Its True Profit Potential,opinion,"If investors were hoping for Canopy Growth  NYSE CGC    TSX WEED  to reverse the downward trend in the cannabis sector of late  they were disappointed late last week  But perhaps they should consider tempering their frustration 
Shares of the largest marijuana company in the world dropped more than 8  last Friday after it unveiled its latest earnings report after the closing bell on Thursday  June 20  The financials for the three month period that ended March 31 showed ballooning losses that were more than four times what analysts expected 

Although the market reaction was clear  and a signal that investors are keen to find a path toward profitability  the company sent a strong message of its own  it s focused on its strategic positioning in multiple segments of the cannabis sector and the long term prospects of these opportunities  Investors who are in it for the long haul should take comfort in this view  as the outlook for profit  when seen through this lens  is discernibly more optimistic  albeit still some way in the distance 
Canopy stock dropped to US 40 20 on the New York Stock Exchange and C 53 28 on the Toronto Stock Exchange last Friday  Put in context  this dip is just that  for as of this morning Canopy is still up 23 65  in the U S  and up 22 68  on the Toronto Stock Exchange compared with a year ago  And the stock also gained slightly yesterday 
If nothing else  Canopy s latest results made it clear  cannabis truly is a new and different sector  The Canadian based company last week reported net revenue of C 94 1 million   71 41 million USD   a 312 percent increase from the C 22 8 million   17 3 million USD  in the corresponding three month period in the previous year  The revenue tally was even higher than that predicted by analysts 
First  The Bad News
But the disappointing news came in the net loss attributed to shareholders  which shot up to C 335 6 million   254 7 million USD   and translated into a 98 cent per share loss for the quarter  compared with a 31 cent per share loss in the previous quarter 
Operating expenses for the quarter were pegged at C 242 9 million   184 3 million USD   up 332  from the corresponding period in 2018  For the year  operating expenses totaled C 666 million   505 4 million USD   a 347  jump from the previous year 
Then  The Good News
With such large percentage spikes in expenses  it is perhaps understandable that the market seemingly overlooked the good news that was tucked away in two key metrics  First  net revenues were up 313  for the quarter and 191  for the year  Breaking that down  recreational cannabis revenues were C 68 9 million   52 3 million USD  for the quarter and C 140 5 million   106 6 million USD  for the year  But this good news was not completely one sided  Sales of medical cannabis were down 39   sales for the quarter came in at C 11 6 million   8 8 million USD   down from C 19 5 million   14 8 million USD  in the same period in 2018 
The second piece of good news was nestling in the company s cash reserves  Canopy listed its cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities at  4 515 billion   3 43 billion USD   up 1 298   This hefty war chest is fueling optimism for growth as the expected lucrative edible products are scheduled to hit the market at the end of this year 
Mounting Momentum
Putting these numbers alongside the other positive developments currently underway   Canopy s partnership with Constellation Brands  NYSE STZ   the maker of Corona beer  meaning the cannabis cultivator is poised to enter the beverage market  the recent purchase of UK based skin care company This Works  a key partner in the international wellness space  and the confirmation last week that shareholders have approved the proposed US 3 4 billion takeover of U S  marijuana company Acreage Holdings Inc   providing a large accelerated entry into the U S  marijuana market the moment the U S  legalizes weed at the federal level   and the momentum that is building is difficult to ignore 
Indeed  Canopy deals just keep coming  Yesterday  the company announced it received a new license for a major outdoor growing operation in northern Saskatchewan  Secured fields that span 160 acres will add to the firm s cultivation capacity at a lower cost than indoor facilities  Canopy also announced yesterday an increase to its hemp cultivation capacity with about 1 000 more acres being added to its existing 4 000 acres  The plan is to scale production of cannabinoids to supply beverage  edibles and vaping products 
Canopy investors may not have liked all the numbers last week  as the figures drive home the message that profitability is not a simple function of legalization  But legalization was not the end game  There is a lot more to come in this sector  including edibles and infused drinks poised to hit store shelves in Canada at the the of 2019 ",2019-06-25,Brenda O'Farrell/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/canopy-growth-200434340,200434340

112355,333870,STZ,Canopy Growth Earnings After Bell 6 20  Key Word Growth,opinion,"The largest publicly traded cannabis company is releasing its earnings tomorrow after the bell  Canopy Growth   NYSE CGC   has missed both top and bottom line estimates over the past 3 quarters  but somehow the stock has reacted positively on 2 of the 3 releases  CGC analysts are estimating an EPS of  0 17 and revenues of  71 million 
Shareholders are voting today on whether to acquire Acreage Holdings  which could propel CGC one way or the other 
Constellation s Stake
Constellation Brands   NYSE STZ   increased its stake in Canopy Growth to roughly 40   from the original 9 9  in 2017  for  4 billion back in August of 2018  Constellation targeted Canopy because of its diverse portfolio of cannabis based products and scalability that would allow STZ to get its foot in the door in an industry that is expected to take off 
Constellation Brands is the second largest U S  alcohol company with long standing distribution and supply chain operations  This partnership is one of the best things that could have happened to Canopy Growth  giving them access to Constellation s well established supply chain to quickly scale operations in Canada and in the ability to do so in the U S  when legislation legalizes marijuana federally 
Constellation and Canopy are working closely to come up with a fast acting marijuana infused beverage that provides the consumer with a mild buzz without the calories of beer 
CGC has been on an acquisition frenzy  buying up as many diverse cannabis players as they can to put their stake deep in the cannabis soil  This surge in cash from Constellations increased their acquisition ability with management putting C 1 billion  roughly  750 million US  aside for further purchases in this ripe industry 
Acreage Holdings
Canopy Growth acquired the rights to buy Acreage Holdings   back in April  on the contingency that marijuana is federally legalized in the United States  Canopy is now attempting to make this acquisition sooner with shareholders voting on this deal today 
Acreage Holdings is a U S  cannabis dispensary business operating in 17 states with 2 states pending on acquisitions  Its combination of medical and adult use products covers 176 million people with its pending acquisitions pushing this number to 185 million  more than half the U S  population 
Acreage holdings would give Canopy Growth the U S  marijuana exposure it needs to make a name for its products  This would also considerably increase its ability to scale once weed is federally legalized in the United States 
U S  Cannabis Industry 
A significant portion of the future growth priced into these cannabis stocks is contingent on the U S  federally legalizing weed  The market for marijuana in Canada is expected to grow at over 77  annually  according to Cannabis Business Plan  The market in the U S   if legalized  is anticipated to grow even faster  Some Analysts are predicting that it could even surpass the  100 billion U S  beer industry 
The modern consumer has changed as a generational consumption shift materializes  Millennials are now the largest consuming generation and purchases are becoming increasingly health motivated  A low calorie marijuana based beverage or snack could be just what this next generation consumers are looking for as an alternative to alcohol 
The Pot Stocks
Top Canadian cannabis stocks include Canopy Growth  Cronos Group   NASDAQ CRON    Aurora Cannabis   TSX ACB    and Tilray   NASDAQ TLRY    All but TLRY have seen returns north of 50  in 2019  with Canopy Leading the pack at 58  gains 

 
These Canadian marijuana stocks are trading at exceptionally high multiples and beta s north of 4  Since these firms are yet to turn a consistent profit a useful metric for valuation is forward price to sales  P S   As a group  these stocks are trading around 20x P S  multitudes higher than the S P 500 s 3x  This multiple is being propelled by the triple digit top line growth figures that are expected from all of these firms in the next 2 years  These upcoming earnings reports will be crucial in deciding whether the extreme valuations are warranted 
Take Away
Canopy Growth and its publicly traded peers are all very high risk stocks with an exceptionally large payout expected sometime in the future  Canopy is the clear leader in this space with a vastly diversified portfolio of cannabis products along with its STZ partnership and impending Acreage Holdings acquisition  CGC is making all the right moves to continue gaining market share as the market itself proliferates 
Before the U S  legalization push  another phase of Canadian regulation is expected to open up more streams of revenue for Canopy s diverse portfolio of cannabis products  Look for this regulation release in October of this year 
Tomorrow s earnings release is likely to be another crapshoot for CGC but look for management s guidance on expansion expectations  I would think that the Acreage Holdings deal outcome would have a more significant effect on CGC

112358,333873,STZ,Balanced Risk Reward For Keurig Dr Pepper  Stock Up 18  YTD,opinion,"Keurig Dr Pepper Inc    NYSE KDP   displayed immense strength  driven by robust retail market performance  with market share gains across all categories  Further  the company s strategy focused on partnerships and acquisitions bodes well for long term growth  These efforts have not only aided quarterly outcome but also boosted the share price  with gain of 18 7  recorded in the year to date period  This performance is well ahead of the  s growth of 13 1  for the same period 
 

However  like many in the industry  Keurig Dr Pepper is battling headwinds related to the CSD category and higher input costs  particularly for aluminum cans  These along with adverse effects of changes made in its Allied Brands portfolio  negative comparisons resulting from a calendar shift this year and negative currency translations have been impacting the company s top line  With these headwinds likely to continue through the rest of the year  let s see how this beverage and coffee company will retain stock momentum Factors Favoring the StockWe believe the aforementioned initiatives should provide enough support to maintain momentum in the Keurig Dr Pepper stock  Going into details  the company remains focused on partnerships and acquisitions  which form an important part of its growth strategy  Since the completion of the merger  it acquired Big Red and agreed to acquire CORE Hydration  adding these two partner brands to its owned portfolio Keurig Dr Pepper added Forto Coffee Energy Shots as a new partner and expanded distribution terms with Peet s for ready to drink Iced Expresso  It will distribute Forto throughout its network and Peet s  primarily with the help of its network of convenience stores The company recently signed a long term agreement to sell  distribute and merchandise the Evian brand across the United States  It also added the iconic Canadian coffee brand  Tim Horton s  and U S  based bakery cafe brand  Panera  as Keurig partners  Furthermore  it signed an agreement with Met Caf  in Canada  which was an unlicensed brand previously  and will begin distributing in 2020  Meanwhile  Keurig Dr Pepper exited FIJI Water and BODYARMOR drink brands as part of the recent reorganization of its allied brands Coming to market share gains  the company reported dollar consumption growth across the majority of its portfolio and KDP holding in the first quarter  with market share gains across all categories  Market share growth in its CSD premium unflavored still water  RTD coffee and shelf stable apple juice portfolios were backed by strength in Dr Pepper and Canada Dry CSD brands  CORE waters  Peet s and Forto RTD coffees  and Mott s apple juice  Further  retail consumption for the single serve pods manufactured by KDP rose almost in line with category unit growth of 5  These gains aided the company s bottom line  which beat estimates and improved year over year in the first quarter  This marked the second beat in the last three quarters Looking at the future  Keurig Dr Pepper remains on track with long term targets set out at the time of the merger in July 2018  It continues to anticipate adjusted earnings per share growth of 15 17  in 2019  in line with the long term target for the 2018 2021 period set at the time of the merger  This brings the company s adjusted earnings per share guidance to  1 20  1 22 for 2019  The earnings view for 2019 is supported by net sales growth of about 2   in line with Keurig Dr Pepper s long term sales growth target of 2 3  It anticipates capturing merger related synergies of nearly  200 million in 2019  consistent with the long term target of capturing  200 million synergies every year between 2019 and 2021  Additionally  the company expects significant cash flow generation and rapid deleveraging  targeting leverage ratio of less than 3 0 in two to three years from the closing of the merger Factors Hindering GrowthKeurig Dr Pepper is no exception to the headwinds arising from sluggish CSD category trends and currency headwinds in the soft drinks industry  Further  high input costs mainly due to rise in tariffs for aluminum has been hurting the company s performance  Though it witnessed operating margin growth in the fourth quarter  higher input and logistic costs slightly offset results Additionally  Keurig Dr Pepper displays a dismal sales history  which persisted in first quarter 2019  The company missed sales estimates in three of the last four quarters  Sales also declined year over year in the first quarter due to 2 5  adverse effects of changes made in its Allied Brands portfolio  0 6  negative comparisons resulting from a calendar shift this year and 0 5  negative currency translations  Notably  all of the company s segments reported sales growth except for the Packaged Beverages segment due to the effects of the aforementioned changes in the Allied Brands portfolio and the calendar shift ConclusionThe above discussion clearly shows that Keurig Dr Pepper has balanced risk reward  with its progress on efforts likely to offset hurdles  Further  its Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and expected long term earnings growth rate of 15 4  speak well of its growth potential Don t Miss These Better Ranked Beverage StocksMonster Beverage Corp

The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on June 28  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This wine  liquor and beer company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 09 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  5  
Revenues are expected to be  2 06 billion  up 0 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 06  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Constellation Brands 
For Constellation Brands  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  3 23  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination indicates that Constellation Brands will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Constellation Brands would post earnings of  1 71 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 84  delivering a surprise of  7 60  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Constellation Brands appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-06-20,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/constellation-brands-stz-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates-can-the-stock-move-higher-200433647,200433647

	And you can bet the market is certainly expecting those cuts in the coming months 
	We also enjoyed some good news on the trade front this week when it was announced that President Trump and China President Xi would be meeting at the G 20 in Japan

112398,333913,STZ,ViaSat  3D Systems  Constellation Brands  General Motors And Fiat Chrysler Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   June 3  2019    ViaSat Inc    NASDAQ VSAT   as the Bull of the Day  3D Systems Corp    NYSE DDD   as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Constellation Brands   NYSE STZ    General Motors   NYSE GM   and Fiat Chrysler   NYSE FCAU    Here is a synopsis of all five stocks   ViaSat Inc  is a global broadband services and technology company that connects international communities to the internet by offering residential internet service  The company also provides satellite based Wi Fi to JetBlue Airways and others  as well as communications services for a range of commercial and government customers Q4 Results Impressed Wall StreetRecently  shares of ViaSat popped more than 10  in early trading after the company reported better than expected fourth quarter results Earnings of  0 04 per share came in well ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of   0 25 per share  Revenues also surpassed consensus expectations  hitting  557 million for the quarter and increased 27  year over year Notably  the company s Satellite Services segment achieved another quarter of record revenue  Sales were  190 million  growing 31  over the year ago period For fiscal 2019  net contract awards were the highest on ViaSat s history at  2 4 billion  expanding  700 million year over year  We are energized by the opportunities before us in fiscal year 2020 that are enabled by our unique  highly integrated technology and business approach   said CEO Mark Danberg As a result of this good quarter  Needham analyst Richard Valera hiked his price target on VSAT to  100 from  78  saying the satellite communications company came in ahead of projections across the board  Because of things like in flight service and business contracts  Valera sees revenue and EBITDA growth opportunities in 2020 VSAT on the MoveYear to date  shares of VSAT have increased over 50  compared to the S P 500 s return of roughly 10  Earnings estimates have since been rising  and the stock is now a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  For the current fiscal year  one analyst has revised their estimate upwards in the past 60 days  and the Zacks Consensus Estimate has jumped eight cents during that same time period  2021 looks pretty strong too  with earnings expected to jump back into positive territory and grow over 900  year over year Thanks to bullish guidance  soaring sales and strong product acceleration  the future is looking promising for ViaSat  If you re an investor searching for a tech stock to add to your portfolio  make sure to keep VSAT on your shortlist   3D Systems Corp  is a leading provider of 3 D Modeling  rapid prototyping and manufacturing solutions  Its systems and materials reduce the time and cost of designing products and facilitate direct and indirect manufacturing by creating actual parts directly from digital input  These solutions are used for design communication and prototyping well as for production of functional end use parts Disappointing Q1 ResultsLast month  3D Systems reported earnings results for its fiscal 2019 first quarter  but shares of the 3D printer manufacturer plunged nearly 25  in the wake of the results On an adjusted basis  the loss per share grew to  0 09 per share from a loss of  0 03 per share in the year ago quarter  the bottom line also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Revenues fell 8  year over year to  152 million and lagged behind our consensus estimate as well Even though the company reported 90  higher unit sales  printer revenue decreased 29  year over year  Additionally  materials revenue fell 3   software decreased 8   and on demand services decreased 12  compared to Q1 2018 DDD was also hit hard by large orders placed at discounted prices  and the rougher than expected transition to metal printers in Q1 Estimates Keep FallingAnalysts have since turned bearish on 3D Systems  with six cutting estimates in the last 60 days for the current fiscal year  Earnings are expected to plunge over 130  for the year  and the Zacks Consensus Estimate has dropped 22 cents during that same time period from  0 17 to   0 05 per share This sentiment has stretched into 2020  Though earnings growth could bounce back into positive territory  our consensus estimate has dropped 14 cents in the past two months DDD is now a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  Shares of the 3D printing company have fallen almost 20  since January compared to the S P 500 s gain of 10  Bottom Line3D Systems did not provide official guidance in its earnings release  though CFO John McMullen did say back on the Q4 2018 earnings call that the company anticipates  continued revenue growth  improved profitability  and cash generation  in 2019 One bright spot to come out of DDD s Q1 numbers was actually   Paul Coster at JPMorgan  NYSE JPM  believes the worst might be over for the 3D printer  so he upgraded DDD to Neutral from Underweight  however  he said the company s Q2  may remain pressured  due to tough comps and a shift to lower priced printers Additional content  Immigration Tariff and Mexico Linked StocksOnce again President Trump threatens tariffs  but this time it s directed to our southern neighbor  Trump says that if Mexico doesn t take action to avert the flood of Central Americans illegally entering the US  we will impose more tariffs starting on June 10 with a 5  levy on all Mexican goods coming into the US   The Tariff will gradually increase until the Illegal Immigration problem is remedied   Trump explained in a tweet last night  The White House said this broad based tariff could hit 25  by October if issues aren t resolved This is a very unorthodox move for a president to impose trade restrictions on an issue unrelated to trade  It is disconcerting to investors because there is no telling what countries Trump may threaten next and for what reason The market broke on this news with the DOW  S P 500  and NASDAQ all down over 1   with Mexico linked firms being the catalyst of the drop  In this article  I will discuss some stocks that will be materially impacted if this tariff and its further escalation come to fruition Constellation BrandsSTZ has fallen over 6  today with this new threatened tariff having substantial implications on their Mexican made beers like Corona  Modelo  and Pacifico  Constellation has more than tripled its beer production capacity in Mexico since 2013 with roughly 75  of Constellation s beer portfolio being imported from there  A 5  tariff would have a 4  negative impact on STZ s bottom line  and if it reached 25  this could cut their profits by as much as 19   according to a WSJ article today which cited Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS  as the source STZ is up 10  YTD but down more than 20  over the past 52 weeks due to the massive sell off it saw at the end of 2018  I would expect earnings estimates to be revised down for this firm and STZ will likely drop to a Zacks Rank  4 5  Sell Strong Sell  US Automakers All of the big three automakers are going to be impacted by this newly imposed tariff  with the greatest exposure being held by General Motors and Fiat Chrysler  GM has the largest number of Mexican made cars sold in the US with 663 000 units and about 22  of its US sales being made up by these vehicles  Roughly 18  of domestically sold Fiat Chrysler vehicles were made in Mexico  These tariffs could cut bottom lines as much as 10  if they materialize  This automotive data was acquired through today s WSJ article which cited LMC Automotive and Evercore ISI as sources GM is down over 4  while FCAU saw a drop exceeding 5  in trading today  Both of these stocks have seen significant 52 week losses with GM down 22  and FCAU sliding over 45  FCAU and GM are subject to downwardly revised EPS estimates for the remainder of this year and likely next  Look to see these stocks drift down to Zacks Rank  4 5  Sell Strong Sell  Take AwayThis tariff isn t set in stone yet  and White House advisers are opposing it  citing that it could impact the impending NAFTA revision  which has already seen resistance from the Democratic Party  I don t believe that the full impact of this broad based tariff has been priced into the markets yet and these stocks that I mentioned above could see further declines if this issue isn t resolved  Look to buy these stocks on lower valuations if a resolution is imminent The Could

4 CBD Stocks to Win Big in June 
Cannabis stocks since inception have fascinated investors  Prolonged trade tensions will  no doubt  affect the global economy and squeeze corporate profits  To light things up a little  weed can be legalized  opening the door to a multi billion dollar industry 
Medical marijuana has already been legalized in 33 states and is being exported in large amounts  Europe  in particular  is open to marijuana based treatments  while some Asian countries have endorsed it as well 
But cannabidiol or CBD is a sensation right now  We all know that hemp got legalized in the 2018 Farm Bill  following which a slew of hemp based commodities were sold online and in mom and pop stores  However  CBD was placed under the review of the FDA  which recently said that there may be real risks associated with it 
But the regulatory authority acknowledged that there is immense public interest in CBD as a wellness aid  Lest we forget  CBD is widely used in treating pain  inflammation and epilepsy 
Talking about strong demand for CBD  analysts estimated that nearly 65 million Americans have tried CBD and 63  found it effective  What s more  CBD is a growing industry  Market research firm Brightfield projected that CBD sales in the United States alone will jump 55  to  648 million by the end of this year  In fact  they expect the U S  hemp CBD market to reach a worth of  22 billion by 2022 
And if we consider a more conservative estimate  the numbers are still encouraging  For instance  investment firm Piper Jaffray forecasted annual U S  hemp CBD sales close to around  15 billion by 2023 
Hence  this is the time to cash in on the hemp CBD craze  We have  thus  highlighted four CBD stocks that investors should keep an eye on this month  
GW Pharmaceuticals
GW Pharmaceuticals plc predominantly focuses on manufacturing CBD drugs  Last year  it s CBD drug Epidiolex was the first cure made from Cannabis sativa plant species to win approval from the FDA  The drug is primarily used to treat rare forms of epilepsy 
GW Pharmaceuticals reported higher than expected sales of Epidiolex during the first quarter  and the drug is also the primary reason for GW Pharmaceuticals  share outperformance against the broader  industry so far this year   80 3  vs  6 8   
GW Pharmaceuticals  by the way  has announced promising results from a phase 3 study of Epidiolex in treating another rare type of epilepsy  Meanwhile  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current year earnings has increased more than 100  over the past 60 days 
Canopy Growth
Canopy Growth is one of the first major Canadian marijuana manufacturers to enter the U S  hemp CBD market  The company is now expected to buy This Works  a London based skin care company  for around  55 million  Such acquisitions will bolster its plans to sell more hemp derived  CBD based wellness products to customers 
The company is also constructing a large scale hemp production facility in New York state  and has secured the rights to acquire U S  cannabis company Acreage Holdings  Notably  Constellation Brands  NYSE STZ  has a 38  stake in Canopy Growth and is helping the company produce and market cannabis related products 
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current year earnings has risen almost 108  over the past 60 days  The company has easily outdone the broader Medical   Products industry on a year to date basis   44 1  vs  6 8   
Aurora Cannabis
With a greater number of people using CBD to cure a variety of ailments  demand for cannabis has increased by leaps and bounds  And this is how Aurora Cannabis will benefit immeasurably  After all  Aurora Cannabis is currently the largest producer of cannabis  It is expected to produce more than 625 000 kilograms of cannabis annually by 2020  thanks to its acquisitions of MedReleaf  CanniMed and ICC Labs  to name a few 
Being the largest producer of cannabis  Aurora Cannabis enjoys a competitive advantage over small scale producers  The company can easily generate higher profit margins  thanks to its larger revenue base 
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its next year earnings has increased 3  over the past 60 days  The company has performed better than the broader Medical   Products industry on a year to date basis   44 4  vs  6 8   
Hexo
If you are late into the cannabis game  you might be reluctant to invest in the top tier names  as they might be pricey  So  beginners may consider Hexo  Yes  the company may not be known to all  but it s underdog status actually helped its share prices advance 18 8  so far this year  beating the broader Medical   Products industry s rise of 6 8  
That said  Hexo s share price has more upside left  After all  Hexo has tied up with alcoholic beverage maker Molson Coors Brewing  TAP  to produce CBD filled  non alcoholic drinks 
Nonetheless  while GW Pharmaceuticals flaunts a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   Canopy Growth  Aurora Cannabis and Hexo have a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see

112435,333950,STZ,Cannabis Goes Legal in Canada as Investors Ride Stocks Higher,news," Bloomberg     Canada s drive to legalize marijuana kicks off early Wednesday with store openings on the Atlantic Coast  giving the country a massive head start in developing a global pot market that some analysts peg at  150 billion 
Stores in St  John s  Newfoundland are set to be the first to sell recreational cannabis  with some planning to open at 12 01 a m  local time  followed by more than 100 outlets and websites opening across the country of 37 million people  It s an historic moment for an industry that has rapidly moved from the fringe to the mainstream 
 The eyes of the world are on are Canada and Canadians should feel very proud  because people have been fighting for decades to make this moment a reality   said Brendan Kennedy  chief executive officer of Tilray Inc   the largest cannabis company by market value 
Canada is the second country in the world to legalize recreational pot nationally after Uruguay  As a result  it has become thefront runner in the global cannabis industry  expected to reach  32 billion in consumer spending alone by 2022  according to Arcview Market Research and BDS Analytics  The entire global market  meanwhile  could eventually be worth  150 billion  according to estimates from Roth Capital Partners 
Medical marijuana has been legal in Canada since 2001 but it s only been about four years since the first cannabis companies began to list on Canadian exchanges  In that short time  about 140 pot companies have gone public in Canada  with a combined market value of more than C 60 billion   48 billion  
Parties are planned across the country to usher in the dawn of so called Green Day  In small towns like Smiths Falls  Ontario  home to Canopy Growth Corp   executives and employees will celebrate together  while several events are being planned in Toronto  including smoke outs   pop up  venues by marijuana companies  parties and other gatherings that start in the morning and carry into the evening 
In Quebec  the government controlled Societe Quebecoise du Cannabis plans to offer about 110 products at the dozen stores that are ready for Day 1  The number of locations could grow to as many as 150 within three years  the company estimates 
 We are very ready   Jean Francois Bergeron  a vice president at the liquor control board that s overseeing the new entity  told reporters Tuesday   We have inventory  we have the stock on site  we have all the points of sale ready to kick in  employees are trained  He said Quebec is prepared because it signed its supply agreements six months ago and has about 90 percent of the products listed 
Because cannabis remains federally illegal in the U S   Canada s investment bankers do most of the industry s deals and its stock exchanges list most of the industry s stocks  This has been a boon for the country as cannabis stocks have rocketed higher  drawing comparisons to cryptocurrency and the dot com bubble  Since Canopy Growth announced a  3 8 billion investment from alcohol giant Constellation Brands Inc  NYSE STZ   in mid August  investors have piled into the sector  sending the Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences Index ETF up by 70 percent 
Individual stocks have posted even more outsized gains  with investor darling Tilray gaining more than 800 percent since its July IPO  Tilray s market value is almost  15 billion  bigger than Campbell Soup Co  and on revenue of just  9 7 million in its last quarter 
Whatever your view on pot stocks  the world seems fascinated by Canada s legalization experiment 
 I think it s a very important moment in the history of this movement   Adam Bierman  CEO of U S  cannabis retailer MedMen Enterprises Inc   said in an interview   The whole nation is watching  
Supply Challenges
Still  the rollout of legal cannabis sales isn t expected to be totally smooth  Aphria Inc  CEO Vic Neufeld said he expects supply shortages in the early stages of adult use as licensed producers struggle to meet demand  Only a handful of retail locations were up and running on Oct  17  including just one store in British Columbia and none in Ontario  Canada s most populous province where only online sales will be allowed  And the black market is expected to stay in business  as the supply of legal pot will meet only 30 percent to 60 percent of demand after legalization  according to a study by researchers at the University of Waterloo and the C D  Howe Institute 
Kennedy predicted that legalization in Canada will follow the same trajectory as in states like Colorado  Oregon and California  with inevitable supply shortages in the early days 
 We ve seen that everywhere   he said   Most adult use programs are supply constrained at the outset but ramp up and reach an equilibrium between supply and demand in the first 6 to 12 months  
He also expects another country to follow suit with recreational legalization in the next year ",2018-10-17,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/cannabis-goes-legal-in-canada-as-investors-ride-stocks-higher-1647601,1647601
112436,333951,STZ,Constellation Brands  STZ  Up 10 4  Since Last Earnings Report  Can It Continue ,opinion,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Constellation Brands  STZ   Shares have added about 10 4  in that time frame  outperforming the S P 500 
Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is Constellation Brands due for a pullback  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers  Constellation Brands Q4 Earnings   Sales Beat EstimatesConstellation Brands delivered stellar fourth quarter fiscal 2019 results  wherein top and bottom lines surpassed estimates  With this  the company reported positive earnings surprise in 16 of the last 17 quarters  with the fifth straight positive sales surprise  However  investors were unimpressed with the guidance for fiscal 2020 due to the effects of the Canopy Growth investment Q4 HighlightsConstellation Brands  adjusted earnings in fourth quarter fiscal 2019 declined 3  year over year to  1 84 per share but outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 71  Moreover  reported earnings were  6 37 per share  up 40  year over year Net sales improved 2  to  1 797 2 million and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 725 million At the company s beer business  sales improved 9 3  to  1 090 1 million  driven by 8  rise in shipment volume and depletions growth of 8 1   Solid portfolio depletions and market share gains mainly stemmed from continued strength in Modelo and Corona brand families  During the holiday season  the company s beer business was the most significant growth contributor to the U S  beer market  courtesy of gains at Modelo Especial  Corona Premier and Corona Familiar In fiscal 2019  the Modelo family surpassed the 125 million case milestone  with the Corona family of brands achieving the 150 million case landmark  This led to depletion growth of 7  and 12   respectively  for the Corona and Modelo brand families during the fiscal year However  the wine and spirits segment s sales declined 7 6  to  707 1 million in the fiscal fourth quarter  owing to 9  fall in shipment volume and 4  decline in depletions MarginsAdjusted gross profit improved 4  year over year to  898 1 million  Moreover  adjusted gross profit margin expanded 90 basis points  bps  to 50  Constellation Brands  comparable operating income grew 5  to  570 8 million while comparable operating margin expanded 190 bps to 32 6   The increase was due to improved operating margins at both segments Operating margin at the beer segment increased 250 bps to 40 5   owing to gains from higher pricing and lower marketing expenses  which were partly compensated by higher transportation costs  Marketing expenses  as a percentage of sales  were 6 4  compared with 8  in the prior year quarter Moreover  the wine and spirits segment recorded operating margin expansion of 60 bps to 27 7  due to SG A leverage and favorable price  somewhat mitigated by increased cost of goods sold  COGS  Financial PositionConstellation Brands ended fiscal 2019 with cash and cash equivalents of  93 6 million  As of Feb 28  2019  it had  11 759 8 million in long term debt  excluding current maturities  along with total shareholders  equity of  12 837 2 million In fiscal 2019  the company generated operating cash flow of  2 246 3 million and free cash flow of  1 360 million  This enabled it to return more than  1 billion to shareholders in forms of share repurchases and dividends  Notably  it repurchased 2 4 million shares for  504 million in fiscal 2019 Backed by the ability to generate solid cash flows and core business strength  the company plans to return  4 5 billion to shareholders in forms of share repurchases and dividends over the next three fiscal years  or by fiscal 2022  On Apr 3  2019  the company announced a quarterly dividend of 75 cents per share for Class An and 68 cents for Class B stock  representing increase of 1  each from the prior dividend rates  This dividend is payable on May 24 to shareholders of record as of May 10 Other DevelopmentsOn Apr 3  2019  Constellation Brands revealed that it agreed to sell nearly 30 brands from its wine   spirits portfolio  which are priced at or below  11 per bottle  to E    J  Gallo Winery  The deal also includes the divestiture of related facilities in California  New York and Washington Constellation Brands is likely to receive about  1 7 billion for these low end wine and spirit brands as well as related assets  The sale is expected to conclude by the end of first quarter fiscal 2020  after satisfaction of regulatory and other customary conditions With the sale of these low end brands  the company expects to concentrate on the more lucrative premium brands in the wine and spirits portfolio  which should enhance returns and shareholder value After the sale  Constellation Brands  wine and spirits portfolio will include leading brands like the iconic Robert Mondavi brand family  The Prisoner Wine Company brand family  Kim Crawford   the  1 sauvignon blanc in the U S  market  Ruffino   leading brand family of Italian wines  Meiomi   the  1 pinot noir in the United States  and SVEDKA Vodka   the  1 imported vodka in the United States  Further  the company will continue to showcase high rated and high end brands like SIMI  Schrader Cellars and Mount Veeder Winery wine brands  and High West Whiskey and Casa Noble Tequila  Its portfolio will also include new premium wine innovations such as Cooper   Thief and Spoken Barrel Fiscal 2020 OutlookFollowing the strong end to fiscal 2019  the company issued guidance for fiscal 2020  To account for the adjustments related to Canopy Growth deal related losses and other activities  it provided earnings per share projections on a GAAP basis and comparable  excluding Canopy  basis For fiscal 2020  the company envisions comparable earnings per share  EPS  of  8 50  8 80 compared with comparable EPS of  9 28 and  9 34  excluding Canopy  in fiscal 2019  This guidance includes impacts of wine and spirits divestitures but excludes impacts of Canopy Growth equity earnings  share repurchases  and gain or loss on the wine and spirits transaction  On a reported basis  EPS for the fiscal year is anticipated to be  8 47  8 77 versus  17 57 reported in fiscal 2019 Constellation Brands anticipates net sales and operating income for the beer segment to increase 7 9  in fiscal 2020  Meanwhile  net sales for the wine and spirits business are estimated to decline 25 30   with operating income likely to fall 30 35  The guidance for the wine and spirits business includes estimated impacts from the sale of its brands to Gallo  The company expects to use proceeds from the transaction to reduce debt  Further  it expects the transaction to have a favorable impact of nearly  40 million on interest expenses in fiscal 2020 Despite these  the company projects organic net sales for the wine and spirits business to increase in the low to mid single digit in fiscal 2020  with organic operating income growth of a high single digit Certain other factors were taken into consideration in providing earnings guidance  These include an interest expense expectation of  420  430 million  including incremental interest of  105 million related to the financing of the 2018 Canopy investment  Further  the company expects tax rate of 17  and weighted average diluted shares outstanding of approximately 195 million Constellation Brands anticipates capital expenditure of  800  900 million for fiscal 2020  with roughly  600 million estimated to be incurred for the expansion of Mexico beer operations The company s free cash flow expectation for fiscal 2020 lies around  1 1  1 2 billion  Operating cash flow is projected to be  1 9  2 1 billion

112437,333952,STZ,Buy Marijuana Stocks  Tilray   Aurora Cannabis  Before Earnings ,opinion,"The marijuana industry has transformed from a widespread illegal market into a booming multibillion dollar legal industry  with companies from Scott s Miracle Grow   NYSE SMG   to GW Pharmaceuticals   NASDAQ GWPH   set to make money of the legalization of cannabis  With that said  the legal pot industry is still in the early stages  so let s see if investors should consider buying some pure play marijuana stocks heading into earnings 
Quick Overview 
Cannabis has been legalized in some form in 33 states plus D C  and it is completely legal in Canada for recreational and medicinal use  The industry is set to skyrocket from  9 billion in 2017 to an estimated  32 billion by 2020  As we mentioned  huge public companies such as Scott s Miracle Grow  Molson Coors   NYSE TAP    GW  Altria   NYSE MO    and Corona brewer Constellation Brands   NYSE STZ   have all made bets on the future of legalized marijuana in some form or another 
For instance  Constellation has invested roughly  4 billion into Canadian marijuana grower Canopy Growth   NYSE CGC    Meanwhile  GW has seen continued success its cannabis based epilepsy drug Epidiolex in phase 3 clinical trials  Epidiolex is already approved by the US FDA for two rare forms of epilepsy  but is still pending approval for a larger set of seizure disorders that could represent a huge windfall 
On top of that  marijuana REIT  Innovative Industrial Properties   NYSE IIPR    reported better than expected results earlier this week  The company now controls more than 1 3 million square feet of growing facilities  Meanwhile  shares of Canadian marijuana producer Cronos   NASDAQ CRON   have fallen over 20  in the last month in the lead up to its earnings  which were released on Thursday  May 9  based mostly on fears that the market for recreational sales of cannabis in Canada will continue to disappoint  as regulatory roadblocks constrain supply 
Cronos topped our Zacks Consensus Estimate for adjusted earnings and saw its quarterly revenue soar 120   Yet  shares of CRON fell over 8  through early afternoon trading  Therefore  some investors might have hoped for a larger climb as pot wasn t fully legal in Canada in the year ago quarter  The Toronto based firm s revenue did pop 15  quarter over quarter 
As we touched on already  we are still in the very early days of the marijuana industry and stocks have fluctuated somewhat wildly  So  let s take a look at what to expect from Tilray and Aurora Cannabis next week to see if investors might want to dip their toes into the market and buy some pot stocks 
 
 
Tilray   NASDAQ TLRY  
Tilray  which reports its Q1 fiscal 2019 financial results on Tuesday  May 14  is essentially a marijuana grower  The British Columbia based firm researches  cultivates  produces  and distributes cannabis and cannabinoids to twelve countries  Shares of TLRY are up over 100  since the company went public last summer  but are down 35  this year and are currently trading for roughly  46 a share 
Looking ahead  the company is projected to report revenue of  20 93 million  based on our current Zacks estimates  Tilray is also expected to report an adjusted quarterly loss of  0 25 per share and has seen its earnings revisions trend in the wrong direction  The company has also missed bottom line estimates by over 90  in two out of the last three quarters 
With that said  Tilray s full year revenue is projected to skyrocket 365  to  200 9 million  Despite the projected top line growth  its fiscal 2019 earnings are expected to fall by 56  
Aurora Cannabis   TO ACB  
Like its grower peer  Aurora Cannabis is set to report its third quarter fiscal 2019 results after the market closes on Tuesday  May 14  The Edmonton  Alberta  Canada headquartered firm hopes to benefit from the relatively quick expansion of the legalized recreational marijuana business  ACB stock is down roughly 22  since Aurora went public  Yet  shares of Aurora have soared 70  in 2019 to rest at around  8 45 per share 
The company s quarterly earnings are projected to jump 25  from a loss of  0 04 per share in the prior year quarter to  0 03 a share  More impressively  the company s revenue is projected to skyrocket roughly 300  to  50 9 million  fueled by Canadian legalization  Peeking ahead  the company s adjusted full year EPS figure is projected to tumble 250  on 360  revenue expansion 
Bottom Line
In the end  investors should remember that these marijuana pure plays aren t widely covered by analysts just yet  which can cause big quarterly beats and misses  Pot stocks have also seen their prices go on a roller coaster rides as demand often can t match supply  Therefore  most marijuana stocks should be considered home run type picks that could go boom or bust over the next several years which doesn t mean you shouldn t take a few swings

112442,333957,STZ,The Immigration Tariff And Mexico Linked Stocks,opinion,"Once again President Trump threatens tariffs  but this time it s directed to our southern neighbor  Trump says that if Mexico doesn t take action to avert the flood of Central Americans illegally entering the US  we will impose more tariffs starting on June 10 with a 5  levy on all Mexican goods coming into the US   The Tariff will gradually increase until the Illegal Immigration problem is remedied   Trump explained in a tweet last night  The White House said this broad based tariff could hit 25  by October if issues aren t resolved This is a very unorthodox move for a president to impose trade restrictions on an issue unrelated to trade  It is disconcerting to investors because there is no telling what countries Trump may threaten next and for what reason 
The market broke on this news  The DOW  S P 500  and NASDAQ all down over 1   with Mexico linked firms being the catalyst  In this article  I will discuss some stocks that will be materially impacted if this tariff and its further escalation come to fruition 
Constellation Brands   NYSE STZ  
STZ has fallen over 6  today with this new threatened tariff having substantial implications on their Mexican made beers like Corona  Modelo  and Pacifico  Constellation has more than tripled its beer production capacity in Mexico since 2013 with roughly 75  of Constellation s beer portfolio being imported from there  A 5  tariff would have a 4  negative impact on STZ s bottom line  and if it reached 25  this could cut their profits by as much as 19   according to a WSJ article today which cited Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS  as the source 
STZ is up 10  YTD but down more than 20  over the past 52 weeks due to the massive sell off it saw at the end of 2018  I would expect earnings estimates to be revised down for this firm and STZ will likely drop to a Zacks Rank  4 5  Sell Strong Sell  Constellation Brands Inc Price and Consensus   US Automakers 
All of the big three automakers are going to be impacted by this newly imposed tariff  with the greatest exposure being held by General Motors   NYSE GM   and Fiat Chrysler   NYSE FCAU    GM has the largest number of Mexican made cars sold in the US with 663 000 units and about 22  of its US sales being made up by these vehicles  Roughly 18  of domestically sold Fiat Chrysler vehicles were made in Mexico  These tariffs could cut bottom lines as much as 10  if they materialize  This automotive data was acquired through today s WSJ article which cited LMC Automotive and Evercore ISI as sources 
GM is down over 4  while FCAU saw a drop exceeding 5  in trading today  Both of these stocks have seen significant 52 week losses with GM down 22  and FCAU sliding over 45  

 
FCAU and GM are subject to downwardly revised EPS estimates for the remainder of this year and likely next  Look to see these stocks drift down to Zacks Rank  4 5  Sell Strong Sell  
Take Away
This tariff isn t set in stone yet  and White House advisers are opposing it  citing that it could impact the impending NAFTA revision  which has already seen resistance from the Democratic Party  I don t believe that the full impact of this broad based tariff has been priced into the markets yet and these stocks that I mentioned above could see further declines if this issue isn t resolved  Look to buy these stocks on lower valuations if a resolution is imminent

112443,333958,STZ,Why Constellation Brands  STZ  Is Poised To Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  Constellation Brands  STZ   which belongs to the Zacks Beverages   Alcohol industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
This wine  liquor and beer company has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 11 89  
For the most recent quarter  Constellation Brands was expected to post earnings of  1 71 per share  but it reported  1 84 per share instead  representing a surprise of 7 60   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  2 04 per share  while it actually produced  2 37 per share  a surprise of 16 18  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Constellation Brands lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Constellation Brands currently has an Earnings ESP of  4 42   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on June 28  2019 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-06-02,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-constellation-brands-stz-is-poised-to-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200427875,200427875
112475,333990,STZ,Day Ahead  Top 3 Things to Watch,news,"Investing com   Here s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow 
1  Will Pending Home Sales Buck the Housing Trend Again 
Economic indicators are likely to have the most influence on the market tomorrow  with more data on the of late struggling housing sector arriving 
The National Association of Realtors reports its pending home sales figures for July at 10 00 AM ET  14 00 GMT  
Sales are expected to have risen 0 3   compared with a 0 9  rise in June  according to economists 
Pending home sales were one of the few recent bright spots when it comes to housing numbers  rising more than expected in the last report 
The second measure of second quarter GDP will be reported at 8 30 AM ET  12 30 GMT   but little change is expected from the advance measure of 4 1  
Core PCE prices for the quarter are expected to stay at the previously measured rise of 2  
2  Jack Daniels Reports Numbers  Retail Earnings Continue
Liquor company Brown Forman  NYSE BFb  reports earnings before the bell tomorrow 
On average  analysts are looking for the maker of Jack Daniels and Herradura tequila to report earnings of 39 cents a share on sales of about  761 million for the quarter 
What may be of most interest to Wall Street  though  is whether the company has anything to say on the conference call about investing in or expanding into the cannabis business 
Cannabis stocks have been rallying since beverage company Constellation Brands  NYSE STZ   which owns Corona beer  said it would invest a further  4 billion in  Canopy Growth   NYSE CGC   Canada s top cannabis producer 
Brown Forman said late last year it was looking at the sector  but did not outline any specific plans 
Among retailers reporting results ahead of trading are Dick s Sporting Goods  NYSE DKS   Chicos FAS  NYSE CHS  and  American Eagle Outfitters   NYSE AEO  
3  Oil Inventories Should Give Market More Direction
It s been a push and pull week for oil prices so far  but tomorrow s weekly government inventory data should give oil and energy stock traders a little more definitive direction 
The EIA is expected to report U S  crude stockpiles fell by just 686 000 barrels last week  well below the 5 836 million barrel decline in the prior week at 10 30 AM ET  14 30 GMT  
Distillate stocks  which include heating oil  and gasoline inventories are expected to show an increase in weekly inventories  but lower than the build seen the previous week 
There are persistent concerns in the energy market about what will happen to supply when U S  sanctions on Iranian oil exports go into effect in November 
But the global market isn t likely to see pressure when that happens  as other OPEC members would raise output  Pimco said 
 It s estimated that upwards of 1 million barrels of daily output won t be available on the market  But other OPEC members are liable to increase their output by some 750 000 barrels   Pimco added ",2018-08-28,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/day-ahead-top-3-things-to-watch-1589924,1589924
112476,333991,STZ,American Investors Pile Into Marijuana ETF,news," Bloomberg     U S  investors are piling into an exchange traded fund that tracks the Canadian pot industry as the country moves toward legalization and liquor producers show growing interest in selling pot 
The U S  listed  436 million ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF  known by its ticker MJ  has taken in about  22 million in August  putting it on track for the largest monthly inflow since February  That asset growth has been fueled by a 35 percent surge in the fund s price since Aug  14 
Pot stocks have been soaring amid Canada s pending legalization of recreational cannabis on Oct  17 and growing speculation that other industries will buy in  For example  Tilray Inc   a Canadian marijuana pharmaceutical maker  has more than tripled since it started trading on July 18 
A major boost for cannabis shares came two weeks ago  when alcohol giant Constellation Brands Inc  NYSE STZ   invested  3 8 billion in Canadian marijuana maker Canopy Growth Corp   the biggest deal yet in the burgeoning industry  Since the move was announced on Aug  15  the BI Canada Cannabis Competitive Peers index has gained more than 30 percent  including 3 7 percent Wednesday 
 This reinforces the interest among large consumer companies in partnering with cannabis producers   said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Kenneth Shea   It also signifies the confidence that consumer companies have for the continued rise in consumer demand for legal cannabis infused beverages in Canada  but also eventually in the U S  and in international markets  
Last week  BNN Bloomberg TV reported that the global liquor giant  Diageo   LON DGE  Plc is seeking a cannabis partner  raising market speculation over who that may be  Molson Coors Canada Inc  also announced a joint venture with Hydropothecary Corp  to develop non alcoholic  cannabis infused beverages 
However  while the U S  listed fund is going strong  a Canada listed counterpart is struggling  The  703 billion Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences Index ETF  ticker HMMJ  is on track for its biggest month of outflows since it began trading in April 2017  with  6 1 million leaving the fund this month  including  5 1 million on Tuesday alone ",2018-08-29,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/american-investors-pile-into-marijuana-etf-1591514,1591514
112477,333992,STZ,Canada s maturing Big Weed hits up Europe hoping for expansion cash,news,"By Nichola Saminather and Simon Jessop TORONTO LONDON  Reuters    A favorite of DIY stock pickers  Canadian cannabis firms are trying to bolster their institutional investor base by ramping up efforts to woo European funds as countries across the region approve marijuana for medical use  For some time companies including Canopy Growth  TO WEED   Aurora Cannabis   TO ACB  and  Tilray Inc   O TLRY  have been signing export deals with European governments  buying local companies  even opening production facilities in the region  This year  they have also stepped up pitching their businesses to European funds at conferences and road shows  betting their size and first mover advantage will help replace fickle retail investors with more stable institutions  Canada was one of the first countries to approve medical marijuana in 2001  and legal recreational sales will begin inOctober  Until now  though  Canadian firms have had little success in drawing institutional investors because of high valuations and lingering concerns about the future and legitimacy of the industry   particularly in the United States  Executives say institutions are moving cautiously and acknowledge it will take time before their efforts translate into substantial investments  but cite some early results  For example  while Tilray s Nasdaq initial public offering in July primarily went to North American investors  12 percent of the  153 million offer was taken up by funds from London  Frankfurt  Sydney and Hong Kong  Brendan Kennedy  chief executive of Seattle based private equity firm Privateer Holdings  which remains Tilray s majority owner  said he met with more than 200 institutions  many inEurope  ahead of the listing   Some of the investors who participated in the IPO  they would ve been unimaginable eight years ago  of course  but a year ago as well   Kennedy told Reuters  One of those to take part  albeit with a symbolic stake  was global investment house Fidelity International  which bought around 0 15 percent of Tilray shares across several funds  Canopy s latest financing deal  a C 500 million   384 44million  convertible debt offering in June  was only pitched to institutions and drew about 60  mostly new investors  with a third coming from Europe  Chief Executive Bruce Linton told Reuters  A significant shift toward a more institutional and diverse investor base  however  has yet to happen  A Reuters analysis of publicly available shareholder data shows Canopy has just four Europe based active investors that use a common long term investing strategy  in contrast to 102for  Goldcorp   TO G   a similarly valued Toronto listed stock    Graphic    Still  investors  organizers and executives say this year s events mark a step up both in turnout and a shift to institutions compared with recent years when European conferences would primarily draw retail investors  Michael Barnes  professor of neurological rehabilitation at the University of Newcastle and chief medical officer at Scythian Biosciences  CD SCYB   said plans to relax rules later this year in Britain  home to many of Europe s top investors  could unlock institutional demand   I think we re close to a tipping point   In February  Canadian financial services firm CanaccordGenuity hosted Britain s first medical cannabis conference in London aimed solely at investors and attended by more than 100 fund managers  family office representatives and wealthy individuals  Three months later  another conference organized by advisory firm Prohibition Partners with Canaccord as one of the lead sponsors drew 450 participants  according to the organizer   A couple of months in cannabis is like two years in most industries   said Tristan Gervais  who leads Canaccord Genuity s cannabis investment banking and corporate broking in Britain and Europe  DIFFERENT KIND OF CASH On the face of it  Canadian cannabis firms do not need cash  In anticipation of a surge in sales after October and more medical marijuana approvals worldwide  the valuations of the five biggest Canadian companies have soared to about C 43billion  even though most have yet to turn a profit  Yet most shares are held by retail investors  which brings price volatility that complicates planning and expansion    It s smart strategy to    bring in institutions who will be with us as we expand   said Cam Battley  Aurora s chief commercial officer   Aurora last year bought Pedanios  which supplies marijuana to German pharmacies  and also operates in Denmark and Italy  Canopy has operations and partnerships in Germany  Spain and Denmark   For now  North American investors remain the main source of institutional capital   Despite a federal ban  the United States is also by far the biggest legal market  accounting for almost 90 percent of the 9 5 billion in global sales in 2017  according to research firms Arcview Group and BDS Analytics   But Europe  projected to become the world s largest medical cannabis market by 2028  could become a key source of funding   Over 20 European countries allow medical marijuana  providing incentives to invest in Canadian firms  which account for the majority of operating licenses in Europe and about 70percent of its imports  according to Prohibition Partners   The group predicts annual sales in Europe will reach 116billion euros   131 9 billion  by 2028  with growth of 40percent a year   Prohibition Partners  founder Stephen Murphy said the Cannabis Europa conference attracted alongside fund managers also executives from sectors such as pharmaceuticals  healthcare and insurance   Constellation Brands  N STZ   a U S  producer and marketer of beer  wine and spirits  set a high bar when it raised its stake in Canopy by  4 billion in August   Among European investors to take their first step this year is Felix Wintle  fund manager of the London based15 million pound   19 54 million  VT Tyndall North AmericanFund   Wintle said the fund had about 3 percent of its portfolio invested in Canopy Growth and Tilray  though lofty valuations made it tough to justify buying more

112478,333993,STZ,Canada s Legal Weed Creates Risk for Investors at U S  Border,news," Bloomberg     Canadians about to enjoy legal marijuana  or even investors in the sector  could be in for a new headache at the U S  border 
Border guards have broad powers to question Canadians on their current and past drug use and could declare users inadmissible  perhaps for life  immigration experts say  U S  officials also warn any form of participation in the sector could also see someone turned away  signaling potential headaches for investors 
Canada is due to legalize recreational use of the drug on Oct  17  but it is still illegal under U S  federal law  despite major states like Colorado and California loosening restrictions  Justin Trudeau s government and travel agents are warning Canadians to make sure they have no trace of the drug in their cars or luggage 
 Working or having involvement in the legal marijuana industry in U S  states where it is deemed legal or Canada may affect an individual s admissibility to the U S    Mike Niezgoda  a spokesman at the U S  Customs and Border Protection office in Buffalo  said in an email 
Similar comments made by a border official to Politico sent U S  traded shares of Canadian marijuana companies tumbling Thursday  Cannabis stocks have been soaring since mid August  when Canopy Growth Corp  announced a C 5 billion   3 8 billion  investment from Constellation Brands Inc  NYSE STZ    the biggest deal in the sector to date 
 Stay Off the Radar 
 A lot of people don t understand that they are still going to have problems after legalization   said Henry Chang  a partner at Blaney McMurtry LLP in Toronto who handles immigration law on both sides of the border   You need to stay off the radar    if there s something that prompts them to think that you are a marijuana user  the first question will be   Do you smoke marijuana   
Those at risk include people in border towns who frequently cross over to buy gas or milk  tourists and transport workers who haul billions of dollars a month of goods into the U S  Even executives at weed companies could be accused of bringing the trade where it s not welcome 
The rub is that it s illegal to have smoked the drug in Canada before Oct  17  and it s illegal to lie to any border agent who asks about it  Some 4 6 million Canadians use weed  about 16 percent of the adult population 
 Although medical and recreational marijuana may be legal in some U S  States and Canada  the sale  possession  production and distribution of marijuana remain illegal under U S  federal law   Niezgoda said 
Another official said those participating in the marijuana business may be turned away at the border   Facilitating the proliferation of the legal marijuana industry in U S  states where it is deemed legal or Canada may affect an individual s admissibility to the U S    Todd Owen  executive assistant commissioner for the Office of Field Operations at the U S  Customs and Border Protection agency  told Politico in comments published Thursday 
While Owen didn t specify any minimum level of investment  he signaled the focus was more on those bringing the sector to the U S   which could have implications for the burgeoning sector  Until his comments  the BI Canada Cannabis Competitive Peers index had gained nearly 50 percent since the Canopy Constellation deal was announced  Individual stocks have posted more outsized gains  with Tilray Inc  up more than 600 percent since its July IPO 
Seeking Clarity
Canadian Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale has often said he s working with U S  law enforcement to clarify the changes and make sure the border remains smooth  The advice of Goodale and Trudeau is to be honest at the border   and make sure you re not carrying 
 Despite one in eight Canadians using cannabis today  400 000 people move between our two countries every day almost entirely without incident   Goodale spokesman Scott Bardsley said by email   Officials from the United States have said that they do not plan on changing their questions at primary inspection after cannabis is legalized in Canada  
The government is also ramping up advertising reminding Canadians of their obligations to obey the laws of both countries  That message hasn t  fully sunk in  yet especially with more casual tourists  said Continental Travel Group President Daryl Silver 
Too much zeal by border agents could encourage even more Canadians to stay home  at a time when President Donald Trump is targeting the country in trade negotiations   We already notice somewhat of a trend of some people not going to the U S    said Silver   This could add to that  
Canadians spent  19 8 billion on tourism south of the border in 2016  according to the International Trade Administration  The figure was  27 2 billion in 2014 when the country s currency was close to par with the greenback 
 Caught by Accident 
 People are careless and I think people will be caught by accident and this will create problems   said Lorne Waldman  an immigration lawyer   No lawyer could counsel anyone to lie to a border agent  but if an agent asks the question  I suppose they could decline to answer  
That may be tricky for people who work in the marijuana industry  given border agents often ask for a visitor s occupation 
While you may not be barred entry just for having a job that s legal in Canada  marijuana executives who work with U S  companies may be seen as being engaged in criminal activity  Chang said   That you are going to start seeing some problems with    especially if they buy operations or start doing business with a U S  company   he said ",2018-09-14,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/canadas-legal-weed-creates-risk-for-investors-at-us-border-1610826,1610826

Chicago  IL   April 9  2019   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  Constellation Brand   NYSE STZ    Canopy Growth   NYSE CGC    Aurora Cannabis   TO ACB    Cronos Group   NASDAQ CRON   and Tilray   NASDAQ TLRY   
Here are highlights from Monday s Analyst Blog  
Constellation  STZ  Makes Big Cannabis Bet
 Constellation Brand s shares climbed 7  last Thursday after a 7 6  EPS beat  The company also just announced its  1 7 billion sale of 30 brands from its wine and spirits portfolio to E    J  Gallo  These lower end wines were bringing down top line growth  Constellation is now focusing on growing it higher end wines with more room for growth and higher margins 
Constellation s Cannabis Bet
Constellation is making big bets on cannabis  They have been continuously adding to their stake in Canopy Growth  which is the leading player in the Canadian cannabis market  STZ just added another  4 billion investment in August bringing its total stake in Canopy to 38  ownership  The Canadian cannabis industry is quickly expanding  with total sales for 2019 expected to be over  7 billion  Below is a projection of cannabis users and use for Canada in the coming years  data and graph provided by Cannabis Business Plans 
Constellation Brands CEO Bill Newlands told CNBC yesterday that Canopy Growth  being the industry leader for cannabis sales  could generate as much as  1 billion in revenue by the end of this fiscal year  They expect to roll out different types of attractive and delicious edibles as well as infused cannabis beverages  which should expand their customer base  Drinking a calorie free tasty beverage to get your buzz on opposed to a high calorie alcoholic drink might be exactly what our health conscious millennial generation is looking for 
The untapped potential in the cannabis market is exciting for a company like Canopy Growth  The United States is the golden goose that these cannabis companies are waiting for  and it s only a matter of time before we federally open the doors to them   10 states have fully legalized the consumption of marijuana  11 have decriminalized it  and 16 states have made it medically legal  Marijuana is now legalized decriminalized in some way in 70  of the US states  With the first states to legalize cannabis only occurring 7 years ago  the legalization process is escalating quickly and expect to see it federally legal in the coming years 
Constellation Brands saw an unrealized gain of  464 3 million from a change in fair value from Canopy and this fair value growth is only going to continue  Once marijuana is legalized in the US  the value of Canopy Constellation and other cannabis companies like Aurora Cannabis  Cronos Group and Tilray  is going to skyrocket 
STZ is going to be the safest cannabis play because of its  36 billion market cap and diversified portfolio 
Constellation Overview
Constellation Brands is Fortune 500 international producer of beer  wine  and spirits  best known for their beers Corona and Modelo  They have seen consistent net sales increases in the past 2 years  growing the top line 16  over the last 24 months  Last years sales growth was somewhat muted because of the 6 5  year over year loss in their wine segment  This declining business has been partially sold off to E   J Gallo as I discussed earlier  Constellation s beer portfolio  which makes up over 60  of total revenue  saw revenue expansion of over 10  in 2018 and about 17  growth in 2017 
Constellations portfolio reallocation  with their divestment from lower end wines and further investment into cannabis  is a very perceptive business strategy that should help Constellation Brands remain a leader in their industry  Understanding that marijuana beverages are going to have a cannibalizing effect on their core business makes their investment in Canopy Growth a good hedge 
Constellation is currently trading at very competitive multiples for a company expanding as fast as STZ is  They are being valued at 20 59x earnings  15  below the industry average  For a fast growing firm like constellation it is good to look at PE to growth  PEG  ratio  to evaluate whether the growth is equitably priced into the valuation  STZ is trading at a 1 96 PEG  much lower than the industry s 3 47 PEG ratio  Even after this surge in price yesterday STZ is still 20  off its all time high made last year  leading me believe that there is still a lot more runway for this stock to takeoff  STZ   Zacks Rank  3  Hold

Is it Time to Cash in on the Beaten Down Price 
The legalization in Canada seems to be largely priced in at the current level  But investors  interest has been veering toward the United States where the industry is still in its nascent stage 
Be it medical  food and beverage or cosmetics  marijuana is making its presence felt  Mergers and acquisitions have been rampant in the space  both across Canada and the United States 
Though pot remains entirely illegal at the federal level  the total number of U S  states greenlighting medical pot is now 33  And there are  states that approved the recreational use of marijuana 
Per    based on the kilograms sold to market cap ratio  Aphria and Aurora are the cheapest of the top producers   The figures  however  exclude the latest earnings figure of Aphria  Below we highlight  by the analyst 

However  three other key companies have also been growing inorganically and signing a number of deals  Tilray has been into inorganic expansion and research and development of late  In February  the company announced a deal to acquire the world s largest hemp food maker Manitoba Harvest for up to C 419 million   318 million   read    
 that it would partner with AB InBev   NYSE BUD   to research nonalcoholic cannabis infused beverages  In the same month  Tilray formed a pact with Sandoz  a segment of Novartis   NYSE NVS    The deal will increase the global availability of medical cannabis products  read

In late 2018  Marlboro cigarette maker Altria Group   NYSE MO   purchased a 45  stake in Canadian cannabis firm Cronos Group   NASDAQ CRON    read    
Signing deals with such big namesdoes its share of job in boosting investors  confidence  Against this backdrop  investors can consider entering the marijuana space  Having said that  we would like to note that marijuana investing is pretty volatile in nature

Acreage Holdings is one of the   multistate cannabis operators in the United States  Canopy is a big name in the space with a market cap of about  14 70 billion  Last August  U S  based Constellation Brands   NYSE STZ     a leading producer of alcoholic beverages   announced an expansion of its stake in Canopy  The investment was worth about  4 billion  The move corroborates the worth of Canopy Growth as a company  read    
Long Term Potential of the Deal
Canada has been at the center in cannabis investing as recreational marijuana was legalized there is last October  The legal market for marijuana is way larger in the United States  where sales were  while Canada s market was worth  1 6 billion  Overall  the North America market grew 30  last year   last April that the U S  legal marijuana market is expected to witness a CAGR of 24 9  from 2017 to 2025 
  American multistate operators continue to stretch their U S  market footprint  while the Canadian companies are looking to expand their territory internationally by purchasing foreign assets inexpensively  With the possible legalization of cannabis on the federal level some point down the line and the companies  increased access to the capital markets  the U S  market is the new name of the game since Canada s growth story looks a bit priced in 
Flurry of Deals Taking Place in the Industry 
Aurora Cannabis   TO ACB   made some other big acquisitions last year  including the purchase of Saskatchewan based CanniMed Therapeutics  and Ontario based MedReleaf in July  In late 2018  Aurora Cannabis announced expansion in Mexico with the acquisition of Farmacias Magistrales S A  This expansion will allow Aurora to have access to the

In February 2019   Tilray   NASDAQ TLRY   announced a deal to acquire the world s largest hemp food maker Manitoba Harvest for up to C 419 million   318 million   read

112483,333998,STZ,5 CBD Stocks That You Shouldn t Ignore,opinion,"CBD stocks have taken center stage as of late  and for good reason  Late last year  the 2018 Farm Bill passed in the United States  This bill opened the door to an entirely new industry 
With the Farm Bill  the United States legalized the manufacture and sale of hemp and its derivatives  A key derivative that is believed to have the most market potential is known as cannabidiol  or simply  CBD 
With a perceived benefit of relaxation and health benefits of inflammation relief  pain relief  epileptic seizure reduction  and more  it is expected that the CBD market will grow dramatically ahead  In fact  some estimates suggest that in the United States alone  the market will grow to be worth  22 billion per year by 2022 
With the expected growth in the CBD industry  there are several opportunities starting to emerge in the market  In my opinion  the 5 stocks below represent the largest opportunities in CBD 
 1  Canopy Growth Corporation  NYSE CGC 
Canopy Growth is currently the largest cannabis company in the world by market cap  That s a huge statement  While the company is referred to as a cannabis company  it s not a one trick pony  In fact  the company is working its way into the United States CBD market  where it is well positioned to dominate 
A big factor driving the company s positioning to take the US CBD market by storm is a  4 billion investment from Constellation Brands  NYSE STZ   Constellation Brands is a big money player that has a proven record of success in highly regulated markets in the United States and around the world 
This investment is key  as it not only gives the company a great partner  but it also gives Canopy Growth the funding that it needs to expand infrastructure in the United States  So  it s not surprising that Canopy was one of the first Canadian cannabis producers to enter the space 
In fact  back in January of this year  the company announced that it received a license from New York State to process hemp  I don t believe that this will be the last of the news we hear about the efforts that Canopy is making to break into the United States market  and with Constellation Brands as a partner and  4 billion to spend  the company has what it needs to take a controlling share 
 2  Aurora Cannabis  TO ACB 
Aurora Cannabis is a massive Canadian cannabis producer that has a clear interest in entering the United States CBD market  In fact  in January  Aurora told Business Insider that it would unveil a plan to enter the United States CBD market relatively soon  While this plan has yet to be seen  I believe that there s a reason for this 
For most of the year so far  the company s balance sheet only had about  100 million in cash  This is a big issue when trying to enter a market like the United States and sustain a business as big as the one it s operating 
Nonetheless  the company remedied this situation recently after announcing that it would pursue a  750 million fund raise  This capital raise will give the company the money it needs to continue expanding its global infrastructure  Most importantly  it will give the company the funding it needs to enter the United States market 
As a result of Aurora Cannabis  leadership position in the Canadian and global recreational and medical cannabis markets  the capital raise that gives the company the funding it needs to invest in infrastructure  and a clear goal of entering the United States market  I believe that Aurora Cannabis could take a large portion of the US CBD market share 
 3  Veritas Farms  VFRM 
Veritas Farms is an interesting play in the United States CBD market because it is already incredibly active in the space  Before CBD was legal on a federal level  the company was already producing  refining  and manufacturing products containing the substance in regions within the United States where it was already legal 
As a result of its head start  the company is already well on its way to taking a large share of the market  In fact  not only is the company already active in the United States  but it has a strong line of products already on the market at various brick and mortar locations throughout the region 
Moreover  Veritas Farms is one of very few full spectrum companies that control the entire process  At a massive  more than 100 acre facility  the company grows the hemp  extracts and refines the CBD  manufactures the products  and ships them to retailers  With full control over the entire process  the company is able to avoid middleman fees  issues with quality  and delays 
In a recent press release  the company said that its products are on shelves at select CVS locations  making this the first public CBD focused company to get its products into a big box store  This shows that the company s strategy is focused on expanding its retail footprint  a strong move in an emerging market 
At the end of the day  Veritas Farms is already established in the United States  This  combined with full control of the process from seed to sale  makes Veritas Farms a hard company to ignore 
 4  Tilray  NASDAQ TLRY 
Tilray is yet another enormous Canadian Cannabis producer  However  like many  the company is also working to get into the United States CBD market  In fact  it is the company that has made the most expensive move to date to break into the industry 
In mid February  Tilray spent more than  300 million to acquire Manitoba Harvest  This was an important move  as Manitoba Harvest is the world s largest CBD infused foods company  Located in Manitoba  Canada  Manitoba Harvest has a stronghold on the market in Canada and a stance that could give it a great chance in the United States space 
It s also worth mentioning that Tilray played a big role in the Canadian medical cannabis market for several years and quickly became a leader in the recreational market when it opened  As a result  the company knows the ins and outs of the market and has the expertise and funding needed to move into the United States 
All in all  with the Manitoba Harvest acquisition  Tilray is well positioned from a product standpoint  With a strong history in the Canadian market  a decent balance sheet  and a desire to get into the United States CBD market  this is a stock that s worth watching 
 5  Cronos Group  NASDAQ CRON 
Cronos Group is actually a Canadian cannabis producer  but I believe that it has the strongest potential to take a large share of the emerging United States CBD market  There are a couple of very good reasons that I believe that the company has the most potential to take this market by storm 
First and foremost  Cronos received a  1 8 billion investment from Altria Group  NYSE MO  back in December of last year  This investment was overwhelmingly important for the company and its investors  Not only did it give the company plenty of money to invest in the United States CBD space  but it gave the company a partner that has a proven record of success in a highly regulated industry 
With such a strong partner on its side  plenty of money to invest  and a strong history in the Canadian cannabis sector  I believe that an entrance into the US CBD market is coming soon for Cronos and that the company has the potential to take an incredibly large share of the market

112485,334000,STZ,A Big Deal Reignites Cannabis Stocks,opinion,"Late last Thursday  during the final trading session of a holiday shortened week  Canadian Cannabis company Canopy Growth Corp announced that it had reached an agreement to purchase 100  of US cannabis investment company Acreage Holdings in a uniquely structured deal 
It s a sign that the industry has come a long way in a very short time since the phrase  big marijuana deal  meant something else entirely 
Though the industry seems ripe for consolidation   with huge  established players with cash to spend hungrily eyeing smaller upstarts who have interesting intellectual property or market position   the patchwork of cannabis laws in North America has made traditional deal making a challenge 
Specifically  Canadian cannabis producers can list their shares on major US exchanges NYSE and NASDAQ  provided only that they don t do business in the US  as can US based companies like Tilray  who operate exclusively North of the border  Companies who sell cannabis in the US   even if only in the states where it is legal   are relegated to the OTC markets  or Canadian exchanges  
Canopy is a big player in the Canadian market and would love to increase it s reach into the much larger US market  but it prohibited from doing so because of its status as a US listed company 
Acreage is a US company that owns 87 dispensaries and 22 cultivation facilities in the US in jurisdictions where those activities are legal  as well as valuable  limited supply licenses and permits for that activity  They describe themselves as  vertically integrated   participating in cultivating  processing and dispensing 
Acreage also boasts former US House Speaker John Boehner  former Massachusetts Governor William Weld and former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney as members of the board  as well as other heavy hitters from the corporate world  It s a heavily stacked team 
The Deal
In an innovative arrangement  Canopy will acquire all of Acreage by paying  300M in cash up front and acquire the right to complete the deal by exchanging the rest of the Acreage shares for  58 shares of Canopy each  Current share prices imply a total purchase price of  3 4B 
The kicker is that Canopy has the right to back out of the deal if Marijuana is not legal at the federal level in the US within 7 years 
Canopy gets a foothold in the coveted US market while remaining clearly inside US laws and exchange requirements and Acreage gets a big pile of cash to fuel its voracious acquisition habits 
So what do you call it  an acquisition  Merger  Call option  In a way it s really all of these 
It could also be called a  win win   except that there s an extra factor   38  of Canopy is owned by US beverage giant Constellation Brands   which also holds warrants to take its ownership above 50   Because the Canopy Acreage deal would dilute that interest  Constellation has the right  per the terms of its original deal with Canopy  to extend the time period and increase the stake it can purchase 
So basically  Constellation owns options that just rose in value 
So it s a win win win 
Confused yet 
Stay tuned  because this is likely to be just the tip of the iceberg for creative M A activity in the cannabis industry 
The Takeaway
The markets appear to love the deal  with Canopy shares up more than 10  since last Wednesday before the deal was announced  and Constellation up more than 6   For a big cap Constellation  that amounts to more than  2 5 billion in added value in just two trading days 
This arrangement also highlights that although there remains an inconsistent set of laws and regulations that would appear to stifle the growth of the cannabis industry in North America  creative minds tend to find their way around senseless roadblocks 
It might also be a wake up call to US legislators who are on the fence about two current bills in Congress to make federal laws about marijuana more consistent

112487,334002,STZ,New Canopy Growth Deal Positions It In U S  Market  When Pot Is Fully Legal,opinion,"Just when a trend in the burgeoning marijuana sector in this case the heated pace of deal making has become easy to predict  along comes a new twist  And this one is big  to the tune of US 3 4 billion  Sector observers  as well as investors  will be closely watching this particular alliance for a variety of reasons 
Earlier this month  Canadian cannabis producer Canopy Growth  NYSE CGC    TO WEED  signed a deal to acquire U S  marijuana producer Acreage Holdings  OTC ACRGF   It is the first such deal between two cannabis producers on opposite sides of the border  It also could be the foundation for a North American cannabis superpower 

Since the start of 2019  Canopy shares have skyrocketed  gaining almost 73  to make it the largest cannabis stock by market cap  The stock closed at US 49 10 on Friday 
The current deal could push the stock s value much higher   at some point  But right now it s most prudent to view this deal as an engagement with no precise date yet for the wedding  Champagne corks will only be popped when the U S  federal government legalizes marijuana  because that s the date when this marriage can actually be consummated 
This contingency is necessary since under Canadian regulations  companies listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange cannot own assets in locations where marijuana isn t legal  And in the U S   this refers to federal laws  even though certain individual state laws have already legalized cannabis 
Still  it s interesting to note that observers are only speaking of  when  rather than  if  the U S  government formally recognizes the state by state movement toward legalization of marijuana 
According to the terms of the agreement  Canopy Growth will make an initial payment of US 300 million as soon as Acreage Holding shareholders approve the deal  Then  when Canopy Growth goes ahead with the takeover  Acreage shareholders will receive a little more than half the value of a Canopy share 0 5818 of a share to be exact for each Acreage share they hold 
Canopy Growth chairman and CEO Bruce Linton summed up the significance of the deal 

 Our right to acquire Acreage secures our entrance strategy into the United States as soon as a federally permissible pathway exists  

Gaining that pathway into the world s largest marijuana market is a colossal move for Canopy  Other cannabis companies looking to gain a foothold in the U S  have so far only sought to partner with firms that have operations in states that have legalized the product  Canopy will be able to leverage its expanding operation in not only the growing of marijuana space  but in the research and development of pharmaceutical cannabis and oils and edible products 
 When the right is exercised  having access to Canopy Growth s deep resources will enable us to innovate  develop and distribute quality cannabis brands across the U S  and continue expanding our U S  footprint   Linton explained   At the same time  a confluence of factors is making it much more difficult for a multi state operator to achieve its full potential  including the enormous amount of cash required to scale  
With the Acreage deal  Canopy will be active in 20 states  a market that has been valued at upwards of US 17 billion 
Acreage s other high profile Canadian connection
The plan for Canopy Growth to acquire New York based Acreage Holding is not the only Canadian connection for the U S  company  Among its high profile board or director members is former Canadian prime minister Brian Mulroney  Many have interpreted Mulroney s position on Acreage s board  which also includes former speaker of the U S  House of Representatives John Boehner  as a sign that legalization in the U S  is a bankable eventuality 
For those investors keeping count  however  this latest deal  although big  is not Canopy Growth s biggest  Last November  it signed a  US4 billion deal with Constellation Brands  NYSE STZ   the U S  based international beer and wine producer behind iconic brands that include Corona and Robert Mondavi  This deal gave Constellation a 37 percent stake in the Smith Fall  Ont  based company 
And the deals keep piling up  In March alone  Canopy announced three strategic agreements  the acquisition of U S  hemp producer AgriNextUSA  a multi year agreement with British Columbia based HollWeed North Cannabis  and an extension of its partnership with OG DNA Genetics 
The AgriNextUSA deal was struck on the heels of the passage of the U S  Farm Bill  which legalized hemp  The deal calls for Canopy to invest between US 100 million and US 150 million in AgriNextUSA s New York hemp operations

112520,334035,STZ,3 Reasons Why You Must Hold On To Boston Beer  SAM  Stock ,opinion,"The Boston Beer Company Inc    NYSE SAM   displays mixed sentiments  Robust quarterly performances driven by consistent momentum in shipment volumes and depletions have been providing a boost to the stock s performance  We believe that there is momentum left in the stock  courtesy of its vast non beer portfolio   including the Twisted Tea  Truly Spiked   Sparkling  and Angry Orchard brands  However  softness in the Samuel Adams brand  and higher packaging and transportation costs remain headwinds Let s delve deeper and find out reasons why we should retain this stock now Strong Depletions Aid Quarterly PerformanceBoston Beer has been witnessing sturdy depletions growth for a while now  which is aiding its top line performance  In fourth quarter 2018  revenues improved on the back of a 6 3  improvement in shipment volumes and 11  depletions growth  Depletions growth can be primarily attributed to major innovations  quality and strong brands alongside solid sales execution and support from distributors  Strength in the Twisted Tea  Truly Hard Seltzer and Angry Orchard brands also aided depletion growth  somewhat offset by fall in the Samuel Adams brand  Depletions for the year to date period through the six weeks  ended Feb 9  2019  have improved nearly 12  from the comparable year ago period In fact  the company is poised well to deliver significant depletions growth in future backed by expansion of distribution and customer base for the Truly brand  investment plans in packaging for the Angry Orchard Rose  and the emerging unit of Hard Seltzer brand s leadership position  Additionally  the Twisted Tea brand continues to deliver double digit volume growth owing to its increasing distribution and velocity  Based on the favorable trends witnessed in 2018  the company projects depletions and shipments to grow 8 13  in 2019 Robust Surprise Trend   OutlookBoston Beer displays solid top  and bottom line trend  which continued in the fourth quarter of 2018  While the company has surpassed earnings estimates in seven of the trailing nine quarters  it delivered positive sales surprise in five out of the last seven quarters  Driven by impressive quarterly results  the company expects double digit growth in revenues and robust increase in operating income during 2019  Adjusted earnings per share are now envisioned to be  8  9  up from  7 47 earned last year The Boston Beer Company  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Three Point Growth PlanBoston Beer remains committed to the three point growth plan  which is focused on the revival of its Samuel Adams and Angry Orchard brands  cost saving initiatives and long term innovation  Firstly  it plans to revive the Samuel Adams brand through packaging  innovation  promotion and brand communication initiatives  Further  it remains keen on retaining Angry Orchard and Twisted Tea s momentum while ensuring Truly Spiked   Sparkling s leadership position in the hard sparkling water category  Secondly  the company is focused on accelerated cost savings and efficiency projects with savings directed for further brand development  As a result  the company continues to anticipate improvement in the gross margin by one percentage point every year through 2019  Its third priority is long term innovation and maximizing the shareholder value  Boston Beer remains optimistic about the future of craft beer and cider categories What Holds Us BackDespite robust surprise trends and positive fundamentals  we remain on the sidelines due to persistent softness in the Samuel Adams brand as well as higher packaging and transportation costs Notably  the Samuel Adams brand is struggling due to the industry wide softening of the craft beer growth rates and increased choices for drinkers owing to entry of smaller craft brewers  Despite witnessing success in Sam 76 and Samuel Adams New England IPA products as well as major innovations  volumes for the Samuel Adams brand continued to decline in fourth quarter 2018  which partly hurt depletions Further  the company is witnessing soft gross margins due to higher processing costs on increased production at third party breweries and higher temporary labor at company owned breweries as well as escalated packaging costs  Moreover  higher freight costs to distributors on increased rates in volumes as well as less efficient truck utilization is weighing on gross margin Additionally  higher advertising  promotional and selling expenses along with increased general and administrative costs remain a threat to the company s overall profitability  For 2019  investment in advertising  promotional and selling expenses is envisioned to increase  20  30 million  Notably  this guidance excludes any changes in freight costs for the shipment of products to the company s distributors Boston Beer Remains Strong Vs PeersLooking closely at the stocks in the broader industry  we note that Boston Beer is quite ahead of the peer group  Notably  this Boston  MA based alcohol company has gained 57 2  in the past year against the  s decline of 22 4   Meanwhile  stocks like Molson Coors Brewing Company   NYSE TAP    Constellation Brands   NYSE STZ   and Anheuser Busch InBev SA NV   NYSE BUD   have witnessed declines of 18 4   23 2  and 22

A document proposed by a number of US senators that proposes making some legislative exceptions for banks working with the cannabis industry provided welcome news for the market  The Association of American Bankers has already supported this project

Constellation s Cannabis Bet
Constellation is making big bets on cannabis  They have been continuously adding to their stake in Canopy Growth   NYSE CGC    which is the leading player in the Canadian cannabis market  STZ just added another  4 billion investment in August bringing its total stake in Canopy to 38  ownership  The Canadian cannabis industry is quickly expanding  with total sales for 2019 expected to be over  7 billion  Below is a projection of cannabis users and use for Canada in the coming years  data and graph provided by Cannabis Business Plans 
 
 
Constellation Brands CEO Bill Newlands told CNBC yesterday that Canopy Growth  being the industry leader for cannabis sales  could generate as much as  1 billion in revenue by the end of this fiscal year  They expect to roll out different types of attractive and delicious edibles as well as infused cannabis beverages  which should expand their customer base  Drinking a calorie free tasty beverage to get your buzz on opposed to a high calorie alcoholic drink might be exactly what our health conscious millennial generation is looking for 
The untapped potential in the cannabis market is exciting for a company like Canopy Growth  The United States is the golden goose that these cannabis companies are waiting for  and it s only a matter of time before we federally open the doors to them   10 states have fully legalized the consumption of marijuana  11 have decriminalized it  and 16 states have made it medically legal  Marijuana is now legalized decriminalized in some way in 70  of the US states  With the first states to legalize cannabis only occurring 7 years ago  the legalization process is escalating quickly and expect to see it federally legal in the coming years 
Constellation Brands saw an unrealized gain of  464 3 million from a change in fair value from Canopy and this fair value growth is only going to continue  Once marijuana is legalized in the US  the value of Canopy Constellation and other cannabis companies like Aurora Cannabis   TO ACB    Cronos Group   NASDAQ CRON    and Tilray   NASDAQ TLRY    is going to skyrocket 
STZ is going to be the safest cannabis play because of its  36 billion market cap and diversified portfolio 
Constellation Overview
Constellation Brands is Fortune 500 international producer of beer  wine  and spirits  best known for their beers Corona and Modelo  They have seen consistent net sales increases in the past 2 years  growing the top line 16  over the last 24 months  Last years sales growth was somewhat muted because of the 6 5  year over year loss in their wine segment  This declining business has been partially sold off to E   J Gallo as I discussed earlier  Constellation s beer portfolio  which makes up over 60  of total revenue  saw revenue expansion of over 10  in 2018 and about 17  growth in 2017 
Constellations portfolio reallocation  with their divestment from lower end wines and further investment into cannabis  is a very perceptive business strategy that should help Constellation Brands remain a leader in their industry  Understanding that marijuana beverages are going to have a cannibalizing effect on their core business makes their investment in Canopy Growth a good hedge 
Constellation is currently trading at very competitive multiples for a company expanding as fast as STZ is  They are being valued at 20 59x earnings  15  below the industry average  For a fast growing firm like constellation it is good to look at PE to growth  PEG  ratio  to evaluate whether the growth is equitably priced into the valuation  STZ is trading at a 1 96 PEG  much lower than the industry s 3 47 PEG ratio  Even after this surge in price yesterday STZ is still 20  off its all time high made last year  leading me believe that there is still a lot more runway for this stock to takeoff  STZ   Zacks Rank  3  Hold

112560,334075,STZ,Analysts Estimate Constellation Brands  STZ  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"The market expects Constellation Brands  STZ  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended February 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 4  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This wine  liquor and beer company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 72 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  9 5  
Revenues are expected to be  1 73 billion  down 2 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 22  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Constellation Brands 
For Constellation Brands  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 18  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Constellation Brands will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Constellation Brands would post earnings of  2 04 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 37  delivering a surprise of  16 18  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss

112589,334104,STZ,Why Is Constellation Brands  STZ  Up 8 8  Since Last Earnings Report ,opinion,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Constellation Brands  STZ   Shares have added about 8 8  in that time frame  outperforming the S P 500 
Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is Constellation Brands due for a pullback  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts  Constellation Brands Tops Q3 Earnings  FY19 View CutConstellation Brands delivered stellar third quarter fiscal 2019 results  wherein the top and bottom lines surpassed estimates and improved year over year  With this  the company reported positive earnings surprise in 15 of the last 16 quarters  with the fourth positive sales surprise However  management cut its outlook for fiscal 2019  owing to higher interest expenses related to investment in Canopy Growth and expected softness in the wine and spirits business Q3 HighlightsThe company s adjusted earnings in third quarter fiscal 2019 increased 17 9  year over year to  2 37 per share and outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 04  Moreover  reported earnings were  1 56 per share  down 36 3  year over year Net sales improved 9 5  to  1 972 6 million and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 911 million At the company s beer business  sales improved 16  to  1 209 8 million  driven by 14 1  rise in shipment volume and depletions growth of 7 8   Solid portfolio depletions and market share gains mainly stemmed from continued strength in Modelo and Corona brand families  These brands were aided by superb distribution gains and strong innovations In the fiscal third quarter  the company s beer business was the most significant growth contributor in retail in the high end U S  beer market  courtesy of gains from Corona and Modelo Especial s brands Further  the wine and spirits segment s sales increased 0 4  to  762 8 million  owing to 1 5  growth in shipment volume  offset by 3 2  decline in depletions Margin PerformanceAdjusted gross profit improved 8 5  year over year to  991 9 million  However  adjusted gross profit margin contracted 40 basis points  bps  to 50 3  Constellation Brands  comparable operating income grew 10 7  to  611 9 million while comparable operating margin expanded 30 bps to 31  Operating margin at the beer segment declined 60 bps to 37 3  as gains from higher pricing were compensated by increased transportation and operating expenses as well as marketing investments  Marketing expenses  as a percentage of sales  rose nearly 11   owing to marketing investments for product launches of Corona Premier and Corona Familiar  and to back other portfolio growth initiatives However  the wine and spirits segment recorded operating margin expansion of 70 bps to 27  due to SG A leverage  somewhat mitigated by an unfavorable mix Financial PositionConstellation Brands ended the fiscal third quarter with cash and cash equivalents of  130 6 million  As of Nov 30  2018  it had  11 772 5 million in long term debt  excluding current maturities  along with total shareholders  equity of  11 520 million In the first nine months of fiscal 2019  Constellation Brands generated  2 billion of operating cash flow and  1 4 billion of free cash flow The company s solid cash flow and financials provide it with the flexibility to pay dividends  Consequently  the company plans to return  4 5 billion to shareholders in forms of share repurchases and dividends within the next three fiscal years  or by fiscal 2022  On Jan 8  2019  the company announced a quarterly dividend of 74 cents per share for Class An and 67 cents for Class B stock  This dividend is payable on Feb 26 to shareholders of record as of Feb 12 Fiscal 2019 OutlookDespite solid fiscal third quarter results  the company slashed its adjusted and GAAP earnings view for fiscal 2019  owing to higher interest expenses due to the Canopy Growth deal  and an anticipated softness in its wine and spirits business in the fiscal fourth quarter Constellation Brands completed its  4 billion investment in Canopy Growth in November 2018  which was financed with debt  Consequently  the company is likely to incur additional interest expenses  which are expected to lower earnings per share by nearly 25 cents in fiscal 2019 For fiscal 2019  the company now envisions adjusted earnings per share of  9 20  9 30  down from  9 60  9 75 mentioned earlier  On a reported basis  EPS for the fiscal year is now anticipated to be  12 95  13 05  down from  14 10  14 25 stated earlier Constellation Brands now anticipates net sales for the beer segment to be at the high end of the previously expected 9 11  growth  Further  operating margin is expected to be nearly 39   However  sales and operating income for the wine and spirits business is estimated to decline in a low single digit  Earlier  the company projected sales and operating income for the wine and spirits segment to improve by 2 4  Certain other factors were taken into consideration in providing the earnings guidance  These include an interest expense expectation of  380  390 million compared with  335  345 million mentioned earlier  Further  the company expects tax rate of 18  and weighted average diluted shares outstanding of approximately 196 million Constellation Brands anticipates capital expenditure for fiscal 2019 of  1 15  1 25 billion  with roughly  900 million estimated due to the expansion of Mexico beer operations  The company s free cash flow expectation for fiscal 2019 lies around  1 2  1 3 billion  Operating cash flow is projected to be  2 35  2 55 billion

STZ will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release  In that report  analysts expect STZ to post earnings of  1 77 per share  This would mark a year over year decline of 6 84   Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of  1 73 billion  down 2 08  from the year ago period 
Looking at the full year  our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of  9 20 per share and revenue of  8 06 billion  These totals would mark changes of  5 5  and  6 24   respectively  from last year 
It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for STZ  Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near term business trends  With this in mind  we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company s business outlook

112591,334106,STZ,Canopy Growth Rallied After Earnings Released,opinion,"Canopy Growth rallied Friday morning after the company reported that third quarter sales rose 282 percent over the past 12 months 
Profit was boosted by the company s first sales of legal recreational marijuana in Canada  which accounted for more than 70 percent of gross revenue 
The company missed profit expectations because operational costs remain elevated compared to peers  according to a top analyst 

Cannabis producer Canopy Growth Corp  NYSE CGC  rallied Friday after it reported third quarter revenue rose 282 percent over the last year in what represented one of Wall Street s first looks into the legal recreational marijuana market in Canada 
Here s how the company did compared with what Wall Street expected when it reported earnings on Thursday 

Net loss per share  38 Canadian cents   0 28  vs  a loss of 16 Canadian cents expected by analysts polled by Refinitiv  That compared with net income of 1 Canadian cent per share in the year ago period 
Revenue  CA 83 million   62 5 million  vs  CA 81 2 million expected by analysts polled by Refinitiv  That compared to net sales of CA 21 7 million in the year ago period 
Canopy sold 10 102 kilograms of pot and equivalents during the fiscal third quarter  Of that total  the company sold 7 381 kilograms of recreational cannabis in business to business transactions and 1 611 kilograms of medical cannabis 
Chief Financial Officer Tim Saunders has informed the company of his decision to retire from that position in mid  to late 2019 

Despite missing profit expectations  investors appeared relieved by the sales numbers  which were supported by sales of legal marijuana in Canada  Revenue numbers fell short of expectations in the prior quarter  The stock rallied 3 5 percent shortly after the opening bell Friday 
Hoping to address sector supply shortages and steep demand  the company said in a press release that it placed  significant focus  on shipping core products into retail locations in the third quarter  Oils  including the company s popular softgel capsules  accounted for 33 percent of product revenue for the three months ended Dec  2018 
 The Canadian recreational cannabis market will be dominated in the long term by businesses delivering excellent products and consumer experiences   Canopy CEO Bruce Linton said in a press release Thursday   Sales from the first wave of products and retail environments launched in the third quarter demonstrate that we are capturing consumers  attention  
Canopy also introduced new products such as oral cannabis sprays and pre rolled joints made by its custom built  proprietary automated cannabis rolling machines at its headquarters in Smiths Falls  Ontario  Still  operational costs remain elevated at Canopy when compared to peers  said top cannabis analyst Vivien Azer  and likely contributed to the profit miss 
 While industry disclosure around gross margin can vary from company to company  for Canopy  cash cost of goods sold per gram of  5 11 looks to be meaningfully higher than its peers  having climbed 15 percent sequentially   Azer wrote in a note to clients  But  from a gross revenue perspective  adult use was a much bigger contributor than we had modeled  accounting for 86 percent of sales  
The past few months have been eventful for the cannabis industry as a whole and Canopy in particular 
In the United States  the  867 billion farm bill signed into law in December included a provision for industrial hemp legalization that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell  R Ky   had introduced  The provision removed industrial hemp from the federal government s list of controlled substances  making it a lawful agricultural commodity 
That legislative development has acted as a sort of catalyst for many of the largest cannabis companies  which can now extract cannabidiol  CBD  from hemp in the United States  CBD  a chemical compound found in both marijuana and hemp  is a non psychoactive agent claimed to have a wide range of health benefits  including a calming effect 
How the compound is consumed  however  remains a point of confusion and safety for many regulatory and law enforcement agencies  The U S  Food and Drug Administration prohibits companies from adding active ingredients in drug products to foods and beverages  CBD falls into this category because it s the main ingredient in Epidiolex  a drug the regulator approved last year to treat severe childhood epilepsy 
Still  the farm bill and its impact on hemp production acted as a trigger for Canopy Growth  The company was granted a license by New York state to process and produce hemp with the help of Democrats Gov  Andrew Cuomo and Sen  Charles Schumer 
Depending on board approval of a specific site  Canopy plans to invest between  100 million and  150 million in its New York operations   capable of producing tons of hemp  on an annual basis  It plans to locate its new operation somewhere in southern New York  putting it in close proximity to international alcohol giant and business partner Constellation Brands  NYSE STZ  
Canada became the first Group of Seven country to approve the recreational use of cannabis on Oct  17  though each of the country s 10 provinces are able to regulate the market  Marijuana use is still illegal in the United States at the federal level  though many states have passed laws legalizing the use of cannabis for medical or recreational uses 
Canopy Growth Corp   CGC  was trading at  47 50 per share on Friday afternoon  up  1 38   2 99    Year to date  CGC has declined N A   versus a 4 09  rise in the benchmark S P 500 index during the same period ",2019-02-17,ETF Daily News,https://www.investing.com/analysis/marijuana-etf-rallies-after-canopy-growth-reports-earnings-200389079,200389079
112592,334107,STZ,Earnings Show These 2 Marijuana Stocks Won t Be Going Up In Smoke,opinion,"Once a popular trade among investors wanting to turn a quick buck  last year  with Canada s legalization of recreational marijuana in October  pot stocks gained legitimacy  So much so that it might be time to take these stocks more seriously and consider a few for a long term  buy and hold portfolio 
However  the cannabis sector is still in its infancy  so tread carefully before making any selections  Nevertheless  there are a handful of companies  and their stocks  that look like clear winners in this early stage of the game  Recently released earnings reports provide some insight into which players are on the right track to profitability  Below  our two favorite picks 
1  Canopy Growth
Canopy Growth Corp   NYSE CGC  is an emerging  dominant player in the global marijuana trade  The Smiths Falls  Ontario based producer proved its superiority quickly  by expanding its production  making strategic alliances and capturing significant market share in both recreational and medical cannabis businesses ahead of its competitors 

Canopy  whose stock closed at  47 56 on Friday  is the largest marijuana company by market cap  It currently has a 30  share of Canada s rapidly expanding recreational market 
It also has the backing of alcoholic beverage giant Constellation Brands  NYSE STZ   which  in August announced it was investing  4B USD in the marijuana grower  to acquire a nearly 40  stake  putting the Canadian company on a solid footing as it continues to grow 
The most recent evidence of Canopy s positive growth momentum came last Friday after it reported its fiscal Q3 results  The company saw revenue of C 83 million  a jump of 282  from the same period a year earlier  The past quarter was particularly important for cannabis producers since it reflected the first full period during which recreational sales in Canada were legal 
Though Canopy reported a wider loss than the Street was expecting  its strong sales and recent growth initiatives point to a bright future  For example  Canopy is developing vape pens and marijuana infused beverages with help from Constellation Brands  as a way to expand its offerings 
Canopy s other big advantage  the company is a market leader in both recreational and medical marijuana  During its latest quarter  medical cannabis accounted for about 23  of sales 
Shares of Canopy have already surged more than 78  since the beginning of 2019  gaining more than 125  in the past year  We see a lot of potential growth remaining for this stock  particularly when the producer is well on track to expand into new value added products 
As well  last month it established a foothold in the U S  In January Canopy announced that it will spend up to  150 million to build a hemp processing and production facility in New York state 
2  Aurora Cannabis
Another strong player in the industry is Aurora Cannabis  NYSE ACB   The Edmonton based company also reported its latest quarterly earnings last week  showing the strength of its business  which is almost equally divided between medical and recreational segments 

Shares of Aurora Cannabis  which closed on Friday at  7 05  have been under pressure since October  just after it debuted on the NYSE  falling alongside other stocks in the sector  During the spring and summer prior to its NYSE listing  the company announced two major acquisitions  MedReleaf Corp  and CanniMed Therapeutics  which together consolidated Aurora s market position in the medical segment 
Both deals also helped the company produce a whopping 363  increase in its fiscal second quarter sales  released last week  to  54 4 million  The company sold  21 6 million of legal recreational cannabis in the quarter  and made another  26 million from the sale of medical cannabis 
What we particularly like about Aurora is its transparency  The company has been quite open about its opportunities and challenges  highlighting supply issues in Canada that are stopping producers from ramping up sales  Unlike Canopy  Aurora has released its cost of selling per gram and the average net selling price 
This is particularly refreshing in an industry where analysts have no clear idea how to value these new players as they figure out how to make money in this burgeoning market 
Aurora posted a  237 7 million loss in its most recent quarter  dropping from  7 7 million in profit during the same period a year ago  citing  operating inefficiencies  that led to higher labor costs and unrealized fair value losses on derivatives  Gross margins fell 54  from 63  a year earlier 
Aurora operates in 21 countries with a strong presence in the European Union  It expects its global medical cannabis business to accelerate significantly in the coming years 
Aurora shares are up 30  since the beginning of the year after declining from their 52 week high of  12 52 in October  We see this stock continuing to gain momentum as Aurora overcomes its early stage growth problems and consolidates its acquisitions 
Bottom Line
Betting on the future profitability of marijuana companies remains risky  Any investment might take longer to pay off than expected  given the evolving nature of the business and indeed the entire segment 
But if you re looking to invest over the long term  say for the next five years  it s better to stick with the most powerful players in the industry  From that perspective we believe Canopy and Aurora are the two safest bets ",2019-02-18,Haris Anwar/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-show-these-2-marijuana-stocks-wont-going-up-in-smoke-200389187,200389187
112593,334108,STZ,4 Marijuana Stocks To Watch In 2019,opinion,"Marijuana stocks may not have had a stellar year in 2018   But  this year could easily bring better news as things continue to expand and more new marijuana markets open up 
Canada became the first country to legalize recreational weed last October  This development has  undoubtedly  cemented the way for billions of dollars in legitimate annual sales and has helped the pot market to come out from the shadows and into the limelight as a reliable business model 
A number of developments happened in the United States as well  President Trump signed the Farm bill into law last November  legalizing hemp and cannabis based products throughout the country 
To top it off  the U S  Food and Drug Administration approved the first cannabis derived drug  with quite a number of U S  states giving green signal to cannabis in some capacity last year  Nearly two thirds of all states in the U S  have legalized medical marijuana and 10 of them  in fact  allowed adult consumption 
Companies in this up and coming industry  thus  have taken aggressive steps to raise cash  go public and list their shares on the U S  exchanges to access capital  Hence  looking at some of the stocks from this fast growing industry doesn t seem like a bad proposition 
Marijuana Sales to Skyrocket
According to Arcview Market Research and BDS Analytics  global consumer marijuana outlays are estimated to climb 38  to  16 9 billion this year  up from a projected  12 2 billion last year   9 5 billion in 2017  and  6 9 billion in 2016  Additionally  compounded global annual sales growth of cannabis from 2017 to 2022 is expected at  31 3 billion 
While legalization of marijuana in several U S  states and in Canada will surely help cannabis growth to hit such a promising number by 2022  a number of dispensaries have been given the permit to sell legalized cannabis  At the same time  mergers and acquisitions between large beverage  tobacco  pharma and cannabis companies should certainly help the weed market grow  After all  deal making will diversify their product portfolio and propel growth 
Investment bank Cowen   Co said that the legal weed market is expected to reach a value of as much as  75 billion by 2030  This indicates that there are plenty of opportunities for investors to make money from both direct and subsidiary players

from Tuesday s Analyst Blog 4 Marijuana Stocks to Watch in 2019Marijuana stocks may not have had a stellar year in 2018   But  this year could easily bring better news as things continue to expand and more new marijuana markets open up Canada became the first country to legalize recreational weed last October  This development has  undoubtedly  cemented the way for billions of dollars in legitimate annual sales and has helped the pot market to come out from the shadows and into the limelight as a reliable business model A number of developments happened in the United States as well  President Trump signed the Farm bill into law last November  legalizing hemp and cannabis based products throughout the country To top it off  the U S  Food and Drug Administration approved the first cannabis derived drug  with quite a number of U S  states giving green signal to cannabis in some capacity last year  Nearly two thirds of all states in the U S  have legalized medical marijuana and 10 of them  in fact  allowed adult consumption Companies in this up and coming industry  thus  have taken aggressive steps to raise cash  go public and list their shares on the U S  exchanges to access capital  Hence  looking at some of the stocks from this fast growing industry doesn t seem like a bad proposition Marijuana Sales to SkyrocketAccording to Arcview Market Research and BDS Analytics  global consumer marijuana outlays are estimated to climb 38  to  16 9 billion this year  up from a projected  12 2 billion last year   9 5 billion in 2017  and  6 9 billion in 2016  Additionally  compounded global annual sales growth of cannabis from 2017 to 2022 is expected at  31 3 billion While legalization of marijuana in several U S  states and in Canada will surely help cannabis growth to hit such a promising number by 2022  a number of dispensaries have been given the permit to sell legalized cannabis  At the same time  mergers and acquisitions between large beverage  tobacco  pharma and cannabis companies should certainly help the weed market grow  After all  deal making will diversify their product portfolio and propel growth Investment bank Cowen   Co said that the legal weed market is expected to reach a value of as much as  75 billion by 2030  This indicates that there are plenty of opportunities for investors to make money from both direct and subsidiary players Fast Growing Marijuana Stocks to Consider in 2019As excellent prospects are expected to make marijuana stocks winners this year  take a look at these selected few poised to move north this year  All these stocks possess at least a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  right now  You can see GW Pharmaceuticals focuses on discovering  developing  and commercializing cannabinoid prescription medicines using botanical

to gain approval from the FDA Earnings for GW Pharmaceuticals  a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  stock  is projected to gain 5 13  in the next quarter  The company has outperformed the  industry so far this year

112612,334127,STZ,Softness In Beer Hurt Alcohol Stocks  Can Cannabis Change Fate ,opinion,"Companies producing  importing  exporting  marketing and selling alcoholic beverages like beer  craft beer  draft beer  ciders  wine  rums  whiskey  liqueurs  vodka  tequila  champagnes  brandy  amaretto  ready to drink cocktails  malt and other spirits  mainly constitute the Zacks  industry 
However  some of industry players also engage in production and sale of non alcoholic beverages including carbonated soft drinks  sparkling waters  bottled water  energy drinks  powdered and natural juices  and ready to drink teas These companies  mostly the brewers  beer makers   sell products through a network of wholesalers  as well as to retailers like supermarkets  warehouse clubs  grocery stores  convenience stores  package stores  drug stores  and other retail outlets  These also sell beer directly to consumers in cans and bottles at restaurants  pubs  bars and liquor stores  Additionally  some brewers operate brewpubs or taste rooms at its breweries engaging consumers in the freshest beers Here are the industry s three major themes Beer brands in the United States are struggling due to the industry wide softening beer shipment volumes  This is mainly due to increasing health consciousness among consumers and strong competition from other alcohol beverages  Consumers are now drinking less  emphasizing quality drinks  With growing importance of premiumization  premium and super premium beer varieties are witnessing growth  Additionally  health conscious consumers are turning to low and no alcohol varieties  which have given wine greater prominence of late  Consequently  beer makers are now concentrating on introducing flavored varieties with low alcohol content  alongside diversifying to include non alcoholic beverages and energy drinks in their portfolio  Another major headwind facing the industry is higher input costs  particularly due to increased tariffs on aluminum  which have raised packaging costs  and higher freight costs  These along with higher advertising and promotional expenses as well as increased SG A costs are weighing on margins  Additionally  some companies in the space have started experiencing the negative effects of increased tariffs on exports of spirits  due to the U S  China trade war   which is beginning to hurt top and bottom lines  A key trend that is driving the alcoholic beverage market is cannabis infused beverages  Alcoholic beverage makers are exploring the cannabis segment to recover lost sales as the beer market has taken a hit  Notably  alcohol companies including Constellation Brands  STZ   Molson Coors and Heineken have expanded in the Canadian marijuana space to develop cannabis infused drinks  More recently  Anheuser Busch entered into a partnership with Tilray  TLRY  to conduct joint research on non alcoholic  cannabis infused beverages Per market research firm IRI Worldwide  beer sales volume across retail stores were down 0 3  from Jan 1  2018 through Nov 4  Per the Beer Institute  a trade group that represents the largest beer companies in the United States  shipments of beer brewed in the country declined about 2 9  in 2018 as of the same date  This was clearly demonstrated by soft beer sales of biggies like Heineken  HEINY   Molson Coors  TAP  and Anheuser Busch  BUD   
Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Cloudy ProspectsThe Zacks Beverages   Alcohol industry  which is housed within the broader Zacks  sector  currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank  216  This rank places it at the bottom 16  of more than 250 Zacks industries The group s   which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks  indicates bleak near term prospects  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 The industry s positioning in the bottom 50  of the Zacks ranked industries is a result of negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate  Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions  it appears that analysts are losing hope in this group s earnings growth potential  In the past year  the industry s earnings estimates for the current year have declined by nearly 18 4  Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio  let s take a look at the industry s recent stock market performance and valuation picture Industry Lags in Terms of Shareholder ReturnsThe Zacks Beverages   Alcohol industry has underperformed both the S P 500 and its own sector over the past year The stocks in this industry collectively slumped 27 1   much wider than the Zacks S P 500 composite s decline of 7  and the Zacks Consumer Staples sector s fall of 18 6  over this period One Year Price Performance
 
Beverages   Alcohol Industry s ValuationOn the basis of forward 12 month price to earnings  P E  ratio  which is commonly used for valuing Consumer Staples stocks  the industry is currently trading at 19 25X compared with the S P 500 s 15 38X and the sector s 16 81X Over the last five years  the industry has traded as high as 27 48X  as low as 18 50X  and at the median of 22 69X  as the chart below shows Price to Earnings Ratio  Past 5 Years 

Bottom LineThe alcohol beverages space is in the doldrums due to the change in consumer preference and higher costs  Further  the company is likely to witness pronounced impacts from the increased tariffs on the export of spirits  Nonetheless  investments in cannabis infused drinks and focus on innovative low alcoholic beverages to satisfy the health conscious consumers should present a long term growth opportunity None of the stocks in the Zacks Beverages   Alcohol universe currently holds Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   However  we suggest four stocks with Zacks Rank  3  Hold  from the same industry  which investors may hold on to  You can see  Let s have a look at them The Boston Beer Company Inc   SAM   The stock of this Boston  MA based company  which is the largest craft brewer in the United States  has rallied 23 4  in the past year  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has been stable in the last 60 days  It carries a Zacks Rank  3 Price and Consensus  SAM

Tracey is joined by Zacks Stock Strategist  and the editor of Zacks new upcoming newsletter the Marijuana Innovators  David Borun to discuss the events of 2018 that took the marijuana industry in a new direction and what it will mean for investors getting into the pot stocks in 2019 2018  The Year of Hope2018 was filled with great expectations for pot stock investors  Canada was set to legalize the recreational use of marijuana on October 17 In anticipation  the publicly traded pot stocks like Tilray   NASDAQ TLRY    Aurora Cannabis and others saw big gains But October 17 came and went and the  hope trade  turned into the  reality trade  as now companies had to execute in an environment that was still fraught with different regulations and expectations The hot pot stocks also saw big declines in the market correction at the end of the year Is this a buying opportunity in some of the names 2019  The Year of RealityThere seem to be more opportunities than ever before in the cannabis industry  The American Farm Bill   which was signed by President Trump into law on Dec 20  2018  could also have a big impact on the agriculture and consumer product industries The bill classified hemp as an agriculture commodity and removed it from the DEA s list of controlled substances  This will free up farmers to grow hemp  at least in the states where it is currently legal to do so  which must have less than 0 3  of THC Hemp can be used in a variety of ways including in clothing  can be put in food and drink  as a supplement and in make up and beauty products But it s wrong to think that companies will just jump into the hemp market  The FDA has already warned that food and drink products with CBD must get FDA approval In 2019  while growth opportunities are there  the stakes are getting much higher  That s why investors might want to go with some of the established names already in the industry 3 Stocks Already in the Cannabis Industry1  Constellation Brands   NYSE STZ   was

About half the policymakers factored in expectations in December that incoming President Donald Trump would implement expansionary fiscal policies when they evaluated that there could be three rate hikes in 2017 
On the labor market front  the minutes showed that  many participants judged that the risk of a sizable undershooting of the longer run normal unemployment rate had increased somewhat and that the Committee might need to raise the federal funds rate more quickly  
Overall  Fed members emphasized the  considerable uncertainty  surrounding fiscal policy changes 
Traders continued to price in only two rate hikes this year with only a 35 5  chance of a third  according to Investing com s Fed Rate Monitor Tool

112634,334149,STZ, U S  stock futures recover post Fed minutes  Xi Trump meeting on tap,news,"Investing com   Wall Street futures pointed to a slightly higher open on Thursday as markets took a breather after disappointment from the Federal Reserve  Fed  meeting minutes released a day earlier and looked ahead to the widely anticipated meeting between U S  President Donald Trump and China s President Xi Jinping 
The blue chip Dow futures gained 29 points  or 0 14   by 6 51AM ET  10 51GMT   the S P 500 futures rose 3 points  or 0 14   while the tech heavy Nasdaq 100 futures traded up 8 points  or 0 15  
The minutes from the Fed meeting in March when the central bank raised interest rates by 25 basis points showed that most policymakers believed they should start unwinding its massive balance sheet  later this year   much sooner than many had expected  despite comments to that effect just last week by New York Fed president William Dudley 
The tone of the minutes surprised markets causing the Dow to post its largest intraday downside reversal in 14 months 
Markets  however  made little adjustment to rate hike expectations with odds for a June increase still priced in  just as before the release  at around 59   according to Investing com s Fed Rate Monitor Tool 
However  it should be noted that the start of balance sheet reduction would be considered as a de facto rate hike 
 If we start to normalize the balance sheet  that s a substitute for short term rate hikes because it would also work in the direction of tightening financial conditions   Dudley explained last week 
San Francisco Fed president John Williams indicated Thursday that two further rate hikes this year was a good starting point and added that there could be a total of four hikes if inflation data improves 
Regardless  Williams insisted that normalizing interest rates and the balance sheet was something that would occur over years 
With Fed policy tightening in the backdrop  the main focus of the market on Thursday is the highly anticipated meeting between the leaders of the world s two largest economies at Trump s Mar a Lago retreat in Florida 
The two day summit between the world s two most powerful leaders is expected to cover differences over trade  currencies and North Korea 
Trump has repeatedly criticized China s economic policies and pledged to label China a currency manipulator on the first day of his administration  but so far he has not 
The U S  President warned in a tweet last week that the meeting will be  a very difficult one  
Also on the docket for Thursday  market players will digest weekly jobless claims  coming just after the ADP report released a day earlier showed the creation of a blockbuster 263 000 jobs in March and while investors wait for the official government data on Friday

112644,334159,STZ,Steelcase  Apollo Global Management  Lennar  Constellation Brands And Bed Bath   Beyond Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   January 7  2019    Steelcase   NYSE SCS   as the Bull of the Day  Apollo Global Management   NYSE APO   as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Lennar Corporation   NYSE LEN    Constellation Brands   NYSE STZ   and Bed Bath   Beyond Inc    NASDAQ BBBY    Here is a synopsis of all five stocks   Steelcase is a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and it is the Bull of the Day   Let s take a look at how this stock became a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and why I think this play belongs in your portfolio DescriptionSteelcase Inc  is a designer and manufacturer of products used to create high performance work environments  Its product portfolio includes furniture systems  seating  storage  desks  casegoods  interior architectural products  technology products and related products and services  The company reports two geographic furniture segments  North America and International Recent EarningsOn December 18  the company reported earnings that beat estimates   I see EPS of  0 36 coming in  0 06 ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate for a 20  positive earnings surprise Importantly  the company will not report again until March  thus removing the chance of an earnings blow up in the coming weeks as earnings season gets started again This was the second straight beat of the Zacks Consensus Estimate  as the company reported a solid 24  positive earnings surprise in the previous quarter EstimatesFollowing the recent beat  I see the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2019 moving from  1 13 to  1 17   That upward movement is what the Zacks Rank is looking for The 2020 Zacks Consensus Estimate moved from  1 31 to  1 34   Again  just what the rank likes to see I also wanted to point out that there is some solid implied earnings growth   Add to that a good history of beating the number and higher estimates and you can see how this stock became a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  ValuationI see a 13x forward PE and that is really good considering there is nearly 17  topline annual growth  That means we are getting a good price here  I see a 2x price to book  so the value players love that too A 0 5x price to sales is the only thing that I don t like here as I like that number to be closer to 1x  I see margins as being rather thin  3 5  6 months ago and inching higher to 3 6  and 3 99  over the next two reports End of the day  this is a conservative play with good value and an improving financial picture   Apollo Global Management is a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  and today it is the Bear of the Day    Let s take a look at how this stock became a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  and where it could be headedDescriptionApollo Management  L P  operates as an alternative asset manager globally  The Company operates in three business segments  private equity  capital markets and real estate  It raises  invests and manages funds on behalf of pension and endowment funds  as well as other institutional and individual investors  Apollo Management  L P  is headquartered in New York  New York Recent EarningsOn October 31  the company reported earnings that missed estimates   I see EPS of  0 81 coming in  0 05 below of the Zacks Consensus Estimate for a 5 8  negative earnings surprise This was the third straight miss of the Zacks Consensus Estimate  as the company reported misses of 48  and 650  in previous reports EstimatesFollowing the recent miss  I see the Zacks Consensus Estimate for2018 moving from  1 35 to  1 14   That downward movement is what the Zacks Rank is looking for and why the stock slipped to a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell The 2019 Zacks Consensus Estimate moved from  3 13 to  2 90   I also wanted to point out that there is some solid implied earnings growth  Just because a stock is a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  doesn t mean there are good things to see too Additional content Upcoming Earnings to Watch  LEN  STZ  BBBYStocks whipsawed this week  as market bears raised concerns about sluggish manufacturing activity and Apple s profit warning  while bulls touted the solid jobs report and trade war progress as reasons to remain optimistic about the economy Trade officials from the U S  and China will meet next week in Beijing  and it feels like Wall Street is expecting the negotiations to go well  This  on top of another reminder that the domestic employment situation is historically strong  could help stocks rip higher Another important catalyst will be the upcoming earnings season  The bulk of Q4 reporting is still on the horizon  but next week will see a small wave of notable companies publishing their latest results  and that could help set the tone for the next month or so With that said  investors should remember to use the  to plan out their schedules for earnings  dividend announcements  and other important financial releases  This handy tool is your perfect one stop shop to properly prepare for the market events that will have an impact on your own portfolio We have made this task even easier today by selecting a few of next week s top reports to preview right now  Let s take a closer look at a few of the earnings announcements due during the

has faced its own batch of issues lately  and that has dragged LEN shares down more than 40  in the past year  The stock has tested a bottom  though  and it could always mount a recovery on the back of a strong earnings report Lennar is expected to post earnings of  1 93 per share and revenue of  6 53 billion  according to our Zacks Consensus Estimates  These results would represent year over year growth rates of 49 6  and 72 5   respectively  Comparisons will continue to be lifted by the acquisition of CalAtlantic earlier this year  In recent weeks  earnings estimates for the current and upcoming fiscal quarters have been revised downward 2  Constellation Brands  Beer giant  and minority owner of cannabis producer Canopy Growth  Constellation Brands will also join the fray of earnings

Every week  host and Zacks stock strategist  Tracey Ryniec  will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks  bonds and ETFs and how it impacts your life 
In this episode  Tracey is joined by Zacks Stock Strategist  and the editor of Zacks new upcoming newsletter the Marijuana Innovators  David Borun to discuss the events of 2018 that took the marijuana industry in a new direction and what it will mean for investors getting into the pot stocks in 2019 
2018  The Year of Hope
2018 was filled with great expectations for pot stock investors  Canada was set to legalize the recreational use of marijuana on October 17 
In anticipation  the publicly traded pot stocks like Tilray   NASDAQ TLRY    Aurora Cannabis   TO ACB   and others saw big gains 
But October 17 came and went and the  hope trade  turned into the  reality trade  as now companies had to execute in an environment that was still fraught with different regulations and expectations 
The hot pot stocks also saw big declines in the market correction at the end of the year 
Is this a buying opportunity in some of the names 
2019  The Year of Reality
There seem to be more opportunities than ever before in the cannabis industry  The American Farm Bill   which was signed by President Trump into law on Dec 20  2018  could also have a big impact on the agriculture and consumer product industries 
The bill classified hemp as an agriculture commodity and removed it from the DEA s list of controlled substances  This will free up farmers to grow hemp  at least in the states where it is currently legal to do so  which must have less than 0 3  of THC 
Hemp can be used in a variety of ways including in clothing  can be put in food and drink  as a supplement and in make up and beauty products 
But it s wrong to think that companies will just jump into the hemp market  The FDA has already warned that food and drink products with CBD must get FDA approval 
In 2019  while growth opportunities are there  the stakes are getting much higher  That s why investors might want to go with some of the established names already in the industry 
3 Stocks Already in the Cannabis Industry
1        Constellation Brands   NYSE STZ   was one of the first in when it took a big stake in Canada s Canopy Growth with the purpose of making new beverages 
2        Altria Group   NYSE MO    the tobacco giant  just made waves by announcing a 45  stake in Canada s Cronos Corporation  That s a  1 8 billion bet on the cannabis industry 
3        GW Pharmaceuticals   NASDAQ GWPH   is a British drug company that is the first to get a cannabis drug approved  It s cannabis drug  Epidiolex  is used by epilepsy patients  
2019 should also be a big year with new companies jumping into the cannabis fray 
What else should you know about the pot stocks in 2019

112669,334184,STZ,2 Commodities That Are Ready To Burst In 2019,opinion,"MarijuanaDespite all the legalization news surrounding cannabis  investors still view it as a speculative market at best  while many others take issue with buying stock in something that  on a federal level  is still illegal  It looks like  even after the rise an fall of pot stocks this August  they may be on the rise once more 
Writing off marijuana stocks at this point in time would be a bad move  especially for those who missed out on the first major run made back in 2017 
Unsurprisingly  though it still isn t legal on a federal level  a recent Gallup poll pulled results that stated about two thirds of America support complete legalization  With that in mind  we shouldn t expect a pot friendly country any time soon  the legalization of many new states barely made a dent on existing legislation and cannabis stocks are still in the doghouse for now 
An end to the flood of pot stock selling may be on the horizon  with the bumps in the road serving as an effective  test run  for pot distributors  The company Constellation Brands  NYSE  NYSE STZ  just upped its interest in the marijuana giant Canopy Growth Corp   NYSE CGC  by making a  4 Billion investment in the company  In addition  Cronos  NASDAQ CRON  caught the eye of the tobacco giant Altria  NYSE  NYSE MO  who acquired almost half of the company 
Even with their rocky past these last few months  Canopy Growth and Cronos have nabbed two of the biggest  vice  companies in the industry due to the expectation that weed interests are going to explode very soon  There are far worse moves to make than investing in a down and out marijuana company when a pot stock rise is on the horizon 
GoldNext up  Five gold rings   Had to get that Christmas reference in somewhere  
While gold may not be the adrenaline inducing market that cannabis is  that doesn t make it any less appealing for investors  In such a volatile market  it s nice to fall back on something dependable like precious metals  which have all enjoyed a nice recovery these past few weeks 
While silver and copper have also risen  gold is the Beyonce of this metals trio  having risen about 5  since October  Gold s rise also benefitted mining companies such as Barrick Gold Corporation  NYSE ABX  and AngloGold Ashanti  NYSE AU  
Adding fuel to the fire  it looks like inflation may increase in the very near future  stoking the fears of investors who had worried about inflation s seemingly inevitable rise  In light of the uncertainty that long term bonds once provided  many investors are turning back to gold 
It s been long enough since gold had a nice run  even with the economic instability and its oversold state  2019 might just be a return of the all time high in gold prices we saw back in 2012 ",2018-12-13,Bill Poulos,https://www.investing.com/analysis/two-commodities-that-are-ready-to-burst-in-2019-200367970,200367970
112670,334185,STZ,Can Constellation Brands  STZ  Keep The Earnings Surprise Streak Alive ,opinion,"If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report  you should consider Constellation Brands  STZ   This company  which is in the Zacks Beverages   Alcohol industry  shows potential for another earnings beat 
This wine  liquor and beer company has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 1 07  
For the last reported quarter  Constellation Brands came out with earnings of  2 87 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 58 per share  representing a surprise of 11 24   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  2 42 per share and it actually produced earnings of  2 20 per share  delivering a surprise of 9 09  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Constellation Brands lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Constellation Brands currently has an Earnings ESP of  1 52   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on January 9  2019 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2018-12-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-constellation-brands-stz-keep-the-earnings-surprise-streak-alive-200369159,200369159

112687,334202,STZ,Craft brewers tap down resistance to Wall Street investors,news,By Lauren Hirsch NEW YORK  Reuters    Brooklyn Brewery  the craft beer maker operating from New York City s most populous borough  resisted taking money from investment firms for almost three decades  according to co founder and Chairman Steve Hindy  Now the brewer of Brooklyn Lager is having second thoughts  Hindy  who sold control of the brewery three years ago to one of his early backers  the wealthy Ottaway family  said the company needs capital to expand its business and meet rising demand for its beer  So it s considering selling some equity with the help of investment banks  becoming one of more than a dozen U S  craft brewery companies thinking about accessing the deep pockets of institutional investors   We want to stay independent   said Hindy  66  a former reporter who keeps a piece of shrapnel at his desk as a memento from his time in Beirut  in an interview at his Brooklyn office   But we are looking at building a very large brewery in New York City  which will probably cost in the neighborhood of  150 million   The craft beer industry is booming  buoyed by deregulation and the increased buying power of its largely millennial customer base  The  19 6 billion U S  craft beer market grew by about 18 percent in barrel volume in 2014  according to the Brewers Association  By contrast  the U S  beer industry as a whole saw volumes rise by only by 0 5 percent in 2014     These are fascinating times in U S  craft beer  and like many of our brethren  we talk to many different people who are interested in participating in this dynamic business   said Robin Ottaway  president of Brooklyn Brewery  who said the new brewery will likely be in Staten Island  The list of those vying to participate in the business includes private equity firms  family investors and large alcohol brands  Some of these investors are hoping it will include the public market as well   INVESTOR GOLD RUSH Investors  interest has already become apparent in some of the prices paid for entry   When Oskar Blues Brewery  the Longmont  Colorado based maker of Dale s Pale Ale  was sold to an affiliate of investment firm Fireman Capital earlier this year  it was valued at as much as 20 times its 12 month earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortization  EBITDA   By comparison  beer conglomerates  Anheuser Busch InBev  SA   BR ABI  and  Heineken  NV  AS HEIN  trade at 13 4 times and 12 5 times EBITDA over the last 12 months  respectively    Anyone who does want to sell  should be selling right now   said Hindy  who retains common stock in Brooklyn Brewery   Valuations are out of this world  There are people swarming all of us wanting to give us money  In a two week period  I had 17 different private equity firms that called   Brewers are seeking outside investment as the burgeoning craft beer market heralds an expensive fight for shelf space  To compete  brewers have to invest in new production facilities  distribution systems and styles of beer   A lot of craft brewers are capacity constrained  selling every drop they can make   said Andy Goeler  CEO of craft for Anheuser Busch InBev   Some of the craft brewers exploring selling part of themselves  in private placements or initial public offerings  include Lagunitas Brewing Company of Petaluma  California  Ballast Point Brewing Company in San Diego and SweetWater Brewing Company in Atlanta  according to sources who asked not to be identified because these plans are confidential  Each of them is estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars  Representatives for these companies declined to comment  Still  these investments are not without risk  and it is not clear what the marriage of institutional money and independent brewer will bring   The money guys make money and that s a whole different way of looking at the world   said Hindy   We make beer and the money follows    IMAGE RISK Craft beer is defined by the Brewers Association as beer that comes from a company that produces fewer than 6 million barrels a year  Hindy  whose Brooklyn Brewery shipped about 252 000 barrels last year  says the definition of craft beer is in the glass of the drinker   Anheuser Busch InBev  maker of Budweiser and Stella Artois  has made a string of craft beer company acquisitions in the last 18 months that include Blue Point Brewing  Elysian Brewing and 10 Barrel Brewing  Constellation Brands  N STZ   the distributor of Corona Extra beer in the U S   said this week that it was creating a ventures arm to invest in new and distinctive concepts in alcoholic beverages  which may include craft beer  While the craft brewers stand to benefit from the access to equipment  raw materials and the bigger distribution network of their larger peers  such deals also pose significant reputational risk to their independent brands  When Anheuser Busch InBev bought 10 Barrel Brewing last year  for example  the deal triggered a social media backlash that included threats of a boycott and angry Facebook  NASDAQ FB  posts   Naturally there was a push back from the local community   Goeler said  Still  he said customers returned when it realized the acquisition would not lead to changes in cost or quality   An Anheuser Busch InBev spokesman declined to comment on 10 Barrel s performance since its acquisition  A source that was not authorized to publicly discuss financial details said 10 Barrel has seen revenue grow 20 percent since the acquisition   Private equity firms have also historically posed risks to the image of craft brewers as community oriented companies that value their product above profit  Craft brewer owners have sought to address these concerns by offering only minority stakes  allowing founders to keep control of the companies  Sam Calagione  founder of Dogfish Head Craft Brewery in Milton  Delaware  a craft brewer that is exploring selling a minority stake  said in an interview that many private equity firms will introduce themselves as potential minority investors and then try to negotiate a deal structure that gives them control or quickly takes the company public   There is an initial position of only wanting a minority investment  and within the first meeting they talk about a path to majority control or an IPO   Calagione said  He said he s also met some firms that were happy to remain minority investors  GOING PUBLIC An IPO is seen by many craft brewing companies as less dilutive to their brand  But companies have to reach a certain size to float in the stock market  and some of them opt for a private investment as a bridge to an IPO  Industry sources said that a  500 million valuation is a rough threshold appropriate for a listing  After U S  President Jimmy Carter signed a law in 1978 legalizing the home production of beer  the craft brewing industry saw a major wave of IPOs in the 1990s  The most successful of them was Samuel Adams maker Boston Beer Co  N SAM   which now has a  3 billion market capitalization  Several others jumped on the IPO bandwagon but  by 2000  nearly 200 craft breweries had gone out of business as their beers could not keep up with the quality that consumers expected  It was not until the rise of Millennials in the last few years that the industry underwent a renaissance  Some craft brewer founders such as Hindy and Calagione resist taking their companies public on concern that shareholder pressure to meet quarterly earnings targets can erode their creativity  Boston Beer adopted a dual class share structure so that founders could maintain control of the company  For craft brewers like Hindy  the biggest challenge to getting bigger may be in retaining their identity     Craft breweries have a soul  and I think the big money coming into the industry is kind of a challenge to that soul   he said

Notably  Cronos Group s shares have gained 38 7  in the year so far  against the  s decline of 22 6  

 
Financial Details of the Transaction
The investment will be made on a private placement basis in exchange for common shares in the capital of the company  Per the agreement  Altria has agreed to acquire 146 2 million shares at a price of C 16 25 per share  As a result  Altria will have roughly 45  ownership in Cronos Group 
In addition  Altria will also receive warrants of Cronos Group that  if fully exercised  would provide the former with an additional approximately C 1 4 billion of proceeds  Moreover  the exercise of the warrants would result in incremental ownership of 10  for a total potential ownership position of 55  
The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2019  subject to certain customary closing conditions including the receipt of approval from the TSX  and the receipt of regulatory approval pursuant to the Investment Canada Act 
Strategic Value of the Transaction
The influx of funds will provide Cronos Group with additional financial resources  product development and commercialization capabilities  which  in turn  will enable the company to compete  scale and lead the rapidly growing global cannabis industry  The additional capital will allow Cronos Group to achieve a better position to support cannabinoid innovation  create differentiated products and brands across medicinal and recreational categories  and expand its global footprint and grow its production capacity 
Moreover  Altria has decades of experience in regulatory and government affairs  compliance  product development  and brand management that Cronos Group expects to leverage  particularly with markets for cannabis opening up around the world  Cronos Group also anticipates to take advantage of Altria s expertise to rapidly expand its offerings including its device technology 
Altria has significant expertise that can serve as building blocks for cannabis vape products  Moreover  Altria also brings considerable experience in large scale manufacturing automation  pre roll technology and supply chain management 
Further  Cronos Group expects other medicinal and consumer focused companies to invest in the company  following the investment by Altria

Both the companies are likely to enter into commercial support agreements  under which Altria will provide services related to marketing and brand management  government affairs  regulatory affairs and research and development  
We note that in October 2018  Canada became the first G7 country and the second country in the world to legalize cannabis sales for adult recreational use  This  in turn  should lead to many such deals for companies like Cronos Group  The cannabis space is grabbing headlines  lately  In August 2018  Constellation Brands  Inc    NYSE STZ   also increased its stake in Canopy Growth   NYSE CGC

112701,334216,STZ,Canopy Growth  CGC  Gains On Hemp Legalization  Institutional Interest,opinion,"Shares of Canopy Growth   NYSE CGC   were up more than 6  in late afternoon trading Tuesday  as investors expressed optimism about the Senate s hemp legalization bill and management s comments about interest from institutional investors 
Members of the U S  Congress added a hemp legalization provision to the final version of the 2018 Farm Bill  and that law is now expected to be voted on later today  The provision received bipartisan support  with Senator Ron Wyden  D OR  helping the Democratic push and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell  R KY  signing the final bill language with a hemp pen on Monday 
McConnell called the inclusion of a hemp legalization provision a  victory for farmers and consumers throughout our country   while Wyden declared it a  huge win for Oregon farmers and rural communities across the country  
The news also excited investors following Canadian marijuana stocks  as hemp a species of cannabis with limited psychoactive effects but high value for production of papers  textiles  and other materials offers a potential entrance to the U S  market 
Other news on this front was breaking on Tuesday afternoon  too  According to the New York Post   today that New York Governor Cuomo will introduce a plan for legalizing marijuana in the state 
Cuomo recently held listening sessions across New York to gather residents  thoughts on legal cannabis  and now his team will review that feedback in the hopes of releasing a comprehensive proposal in early 2019 
A study published earlier this year by Comptroller Scott Stringer projected that legal marijuana could be a  3 1 billion market in New York State  the Post reported  This could potentially generate hundreds of millions of dollars in state and city tax revenue 
Canopy Growth CEO Bruce Linton  BNN Bloomberg earlier Tuesday to tout the recent institutional support witnessed by cannabis producers 
 What you re seeing is retail jumping in and out  But when they get out  I think a lot of stocks like ours are getting institutional support   the CEO said   We re going to see a shift in the 2019 theme  those which are institutional investable and those whose aunts and uncles buy and sell in the morning and afternoon  
Canopy Growth has seen larger investments from Canadian pension funds and familiar institutions such as Vanguard Group  Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS   and Macquarie Group  Beer maker Constellation Brands   NYSE STZ   also owns a good chunk of Canopy Growth  upping its stake from 10  to 38  earlier this year 
Linton s comments and today s legalization news follow another massive partnership in the cannabis space  with fellow Canadian producer Cronos Group   NASDAQ CRON   announcing this week that tobacco behemoth Altria   NYSE MO   has agreed to take an approximately C 2 4 billion equity investment in the former

112717,334232,STZ, Stupid Time  For Pot Stocks,opinion," This is just stupid time  I can t believe the valuations at this stage   says Investitute co founder Jon Najarian 
The new mania is pot stocks  Valuations are beyond absurd  which is what always happens in bubbles  Investitute co founder Jon Najarian says It s Stupid Time 

In June  Canada announced it will legalize recreational marijuana use effective Oct  17  sparking a series of industry moves  Soon after Canadian marijuana producer Tilray filed for an initial public offering  which occurred in July 
In August  Molson Coors said it will partner with The Hydropothecary Corporation to develop cannabis infused beverages for the Canadian market  Later that month beer maker Constellation Brands  NYSE STZ  invested an additional  4 billion in Canadian cannabis producer Canopy Growth Corp  TO WEED  
Tilray shares are up more than 800 percent through Wednesday morning since its first day of trading after its July IPO and rose nearly 600 percent in the past month  The stock is also up nearly 50 percent Wednesday  a day after its CEO Brendan Kennedy told CNBC s Jim Cramer that pharmaceutical companies should partner with cannabis producers as a  hedge  against the space 
The company now has a market value of more than  20 billion with its stock price at  233  trading at nearly 500 times its 2018 estimated sales versus the S P 500 s 2 2 times sales  according to FactSet 
Tilray reported just  17 6 million in sales over the last two quarters with a net loss of  18 million in the same time period 
 This is just stupid time  I can t believe the valuations at this stage   Investitute co founder Jon Najarian said in interview Wednesday 

Bitcoin vs Pot

Another Wall Street trader compared the mania surrounding pot stocks this year to 2017 s cryptocurrency market craze  For example  Riot Blockchain shares surged by more than 400 percent during the fourth quarter last year 
 It reminds me of Bitcoin   Blockchain late in 2017   There was a stock called RIOT who experienced explosive growth in its stock price simply because it was one of the few ways to invest in bitcoin publicly   Baird institutional sales trader Michael Antonelli said in an email Wednesday   Humans are emotional creatures and nothing is worse than seeing your friend get rich in a pot stock  while you sit in an index fund  So I have little doubt that people are chasing the stock higher so they don t feel left behind  
Riot Blockchain shares are down more than 85 percent this year 

Pot Shot
From  17 to  280 and Tilray is losing money  Wow 
I certainly wish I took a crack at that pot shot ",2018-09-20,Mike (Mish) Shedlock,https://www.investing.com/analysis/stupid-time-for-pot-stocks-200344705,200344705

rise in shipment volume and depletions growth of 10 1   Solid portfolio depletions and market share gains mainly stemmed from strength in Modelo and Corona brand families During the reported quarter

112731,334246,STZ,With Marijuana Legal In Canada  2 Pot Stocks Are Lit For The Long Term,opinion,"Since October 17  when recreational marijuana was legalized in Canada  high flying pot stocks have had a hard landing  Losses for the top cannabis equities  such as Canopy Growth  NYSE CGC  and Tilray  NASDAQ TLRY   range from 30 50  
The recent price action clearly indicates the sector was a bubble on the verge of bursting  just as soon as the pre legalization excitement faded  The biggest reason for the abrupt decline in share prices  the majority of investors built up false expectations of sales growth for companies that still have unproven business models 
As well  the expected  after legalization pot party hasn t been as merry as expected  Canada has been experiencing widespread marijuana shortages  forcing analysts to trim their sales forecasts for producers  In a recent note  GMP Securities analyst Martin Landry cut his sales and profit estimates for Canopy  the biggest cannabis producer 

 The first 12 days of the recreational marijuana market have been disappointing from a distribution standpoint    We now expect that Canadian recreational sales will be more muted than expected in the near term  

There is no doubt that marijuana stocks reside in a highly speculative segment of the market  where it s tough to come up with credible valuation models based on company fundamentals in this early stage of the market s development  However  if pot stocks are appealing for your investing portfolio  it s prudent to stick with the biggest names  They have both production capacity and the financial muscles to survive 
For this reason  we like Canopy and Tilray  After the recent sell off we see each as a buy for long term positioning 
Tilray  Positioning For Future US Growth

The British Columbia based medical marijuana company is uniquely positioned to benefit from any possible federal legalization of marijuana for recreational use in the US  In fact  Tilray recently gained approval from the US Drug Enforcement Administration to import medical cannabis into the US for testing purposes 
Investors have been pushing Tilray s price higher on hopes that the company will get a share of the potentially massive American market  Recreational marijuana is currently legal in 10 states and many now see federal US legalization as inevitable within the next five years 
Tilray s  500 million in cash holdings  its NASDAQ listing and its global reach would allow it to very quickly scale its business in the US if Congress passes the STATES act  which would legalize non intoxicating cannabidiol  CBD  derived from hemp  said Brendan Kennedy  the company s CEO during the company s third quarter earnings call last week  He said he was also closely watching the legislation  which would give individual states the power to legalize marijuana without the threat of federal interference 
Since its IPO in July  Tilray shares have surged more than 400   The stock has been on a roller coaster ride  with shares ranging from  20 10 to  300  Tilray closed yesterday at  109 31  If you re investing for the long haul  Tilray could be worth considering 
Canopy Growth  Diverse Offerings  Global Reach

The world s largest cannabis company  Canopy Growth is another potential play for long term investors due to its dominant position in Canada and its fast growing global operations Constellation Brands  NYSE STZ   the maker of Corona beer and other alcoholic wines and spirits  boosted its stake in the company to 38  in August via a  3 8 billion investment 
What makes Canopy different from other producers is its market size  capacity to ramp up production and diversity of product offerings  alongside its international reach  Canopy currently operates weed growing facilities with over 2 4 million square feet of space 
But the producer has been expanding its operations quickly  which will deliver the potential to manage more than five million square feet of production space by next year  The stock is currently trading at  34 74  about midway within its price range  which has seesawed between  12 60 and  59 25 over the past 52 weeks

112758,334273,STZ,Bull Market Benefits From Jackson Hole Pop,opinion,"Get out your party hats ladies and gentlemen  the S P 500 closed at all time highs on Friday  finally eclipsing the January peak  After 145 days of slogging  the  bull market is back  baby  
Well  at least for now 
Last week  we discussed how the market has become distracted from the bigger picture by any piece of news that supports the bullish narrative  But  as Jerry Seinfeld once quipped   Not that there s anything wrong with that  
The bullish momentum has kept stocks buoyed over the last several months and during that time we have been increasing equity exposure since March opportunistically using pullbacks to do so  Despite concerns of a political debacle in the White House  the markets rose last week on hopes the  trade dispute  with China would be quickly resolved  That hope vanished on Friday as Bloomberg reported 

 The trade war between the U S  and China is primed to escalate after their governments failed to make progress in two days of talks 
The two sides had met with low expectations for this week s meetings and no further talks had been scheduled  a person familiar with the discussions said  The person  who requested anonymity to discuss the private deliberations  also said Chinese officials had raised the possibility that no further negotiations could happen until after November s mid term elections in the U S  

Oh  and remember the whole  North Korean  deal  Yeah  that is over too   As I stated two months ago  it was  all show and no go  for North Korea  There was never any intention of actual denuclearization   


Furthermore  Germany has begun to look to move away from the U S  dollar  Russia remains a geopolitical risk  The Iranian saga continues and  most importantly  the  global economic acceleration is over    chart courtesy of Zerohedge 

Regardless of all those reasons to be concerned  attention was quickly shifted to focus on Jerome Powell s Jackson Hole  sentence   

 The economy is strong  Inflation is near our 2 percent objective  and most people who want a job are finding one  My colleagues and I are carefully monitoring incoming data  and we are setting policy to do what monetary policy can do to support continued growth  a strong labor market  and inflation near 2 percent 
There is good reason to expect that this strong performance will continue  I believe that this gradual process of normalization remains appropriate  

Well  what did you expect him to say 

 The economy is doing okay  but real wage growth and full time employment for most American s remains elusive  Real inflation  when you look at what the average household deals with is north of 5  and our policy actions have really done nothing more than enrich all of our friends here in Washington and on Wall Street  

I know it s a bit  tongue in cheek   however  any statement that was not strongly supportive would have sent asset prices plunging  Of course  with the President already  not so happy  with Jerome Powell anyway  it keeps concerns of interference from the White House minimized 
However  while  revised  statement was entirely sarcastic  is not so far from the truth as shown in the charts below  It is hard to support the claim that  anybody who wants a job can find one   It is full time employment that supports home buying and increased consumption in the economy 


 But  that s because all the  baby boomers  are retiring 

Okay  let s strip them all out 

And wage growth remains non existent 

Yes the economy has indeed grown since the recessionary lows  but  strong  is not exactly the word to use  Furthermore  the bounce from the 2016 slowdown coincides directly with the billions spent on natural disaster recovery from 2017  That  stimulus  has likely reached its end 

As Doug Kass noted late on Friday  the Citigroup Surprise index doesn t really agree with Mr  Powell s statement either 

And neither did traders 

 Today was by far the slowest volume trading day of the year  not including the half day on July 3rd      Doug Kass


And bonds simply aren t  buying it  

Nonetheless  stocks not only hit all time highs on Friday  but by the mainstream media s measures it also qualifies as the longest bull market in history 
My friend  David Rosenberg from Gluskin Sheff  brought a little sanity back to the conversation 

 Keep in context how weird it is to have the longest bull market in equities in the context of the weakest economic expansion of all time  and how do you square that circle  It s because of the long arm of the central banks  

While the Fed is in the process of trying to reduce their balance sheet  there is still plenty of liquidity sloshing around as financial conditions remain extremely easy 

And timely injections of liquidity into the financial markets never hurts 

While the market was temporarily distracted by  Jerome Powell  on Friday in the rush to push the S P 500 to  all time highs   insert roar of crowd   earnings season is coming to its conclusion and all eyes will refocus back on trade  tariffs  and geopolitical risks 
I noted the biggest threats we are watching last weekend 
Technical deviations
Emerging market debt and economic stabilities
U S  dollar strength
oil prices  below  60 
Interest rates  Fed 
Economic strength
Earnings 
Leverage  Margin 
As I stated then  the issue isn t any one of them in particular   but the linkages between all of them which is important to watch 
We can now add back to that list 
Geopolitical Risk  China  Russia   North Korea 
Tariffs
Trade
The Fed
Again  it is never just  one thing  that causes a reversion  Rather  it is the  one thing  that triggers the cascade of dominoes to fall 
Unfortunately  we generally never know what the  one thing  is until after the fact  This is why having a plan to manage risk  a discipline to act  and a process to follow which is critically important to long term investing success 
Still Long Markets  But September Approaches
While I point out the prevailing risks  and the disconnect between bullish sentiment and hard data  the reality is the bull market remains intact 
Over the last several months we have been tracking the progress of the S P 500 with pathways back to  all time  highs  The very quick retest of support  as noted last week  set the stage for the push to market highs 

With portfolios still long biased  the question is what happens next  and how to play it 
I have updated our pathway analysis to account for the breakout to new highs and the fact we are heading into September which has one of the poorest historical performance records 
Pathway  1  An uninterrupted advance of the bull market with an expansion of volume and market breadth  This is a lower probability event currently given the extreme short term overbought condition  light volume of the breakout and a negligible  buy signal  in place   20  
Pathway  2  Is a bit more of an  exuberant  advance early next week which pulls back to the recent breakout level  The pullback consolidates a bit  works off some of the overbought condition  and then begins the next advance  Such a pullback would turn the previous resistance into support and provide a short term  buyable  entry   30  
Pathway  2a  Is a higher probability event given the overbought conditions currently  A pullback to 2800 2820 which works off the overbought condition and builds support at previous bottoms  This would also coincide with a  September  type performance and would set the stage for a traditional year end rally  This would provide the best opportunity to bring portfolios to target weights   40  
Pathway  3  This path is the least likely currently  but should be considered nonetheless  With all of the risks laid out above  something that triggers a credit related worry in the market could send stocks lower  There is strong support built at 2740 which should initially hold  If it doesn t we have other issues to discuss   10  
Again  with portfolios primarily invested  there is little for us to do  We did let some weak performers go last week and will look for a pullback to add to winners and make some new bets 
As always  when it comes to your portfolio 

 Do more of what works  and less of what doesn t     Dennis Gartman

See you next week

Sector and Market Analysis 

Discretionary  Technology and Healthcare   continue to pace the way higher in the market over the last few weeks  We continue to hold our weightings in these sectors  outside of just trimming position sizes to account for gains for now  With the sectors VERY overbought and extended currently use pullbacks for adding to exposure or increasing target weights 
Staples and Utilities   have regained strength after a very tough start to the year  As we stated last week  there is a movement to more defensive sectors of the market  late economic stage sectors  that is still occurring  Use pullbacks to support  and oversold conditions  to add exposure accordingly 
Financial  Energy  Industrial and Material   while Industrial finally gained a bit of momentum due to earnings season  the risk of an ongoing  and acceleration of  tariffs and  trade wars  keeps us out of both the Industrial and Materials sector for now  However  with that said  Industrials  performance is improving and on a pullback to support that doesn t violate it  we may consider adding a small exposure  Energy s recent slump successfully tested the 200 dma  With the sector oversold  a trading entry is available  but with the 50 dma just overhead stops should be placed at the recent lows  Financials continue to languish along support but not showing much in the way of strength to support overweighting the sector currently 

Small Cap and Mid Cap continue to perform well and after adding exposure to these areas a few weeks ago  there is little to do currently  With these markets extremely overbought and extended  pullbacks to support is needed to add additional exposure 
Emerging and International Markets were removed in January from portfolios on the basis that  trade wars  and  rising rates  were not good for these groups  With the addition of the  Turkey Crisis   ongoing tariffs  and trade wars  there is simply no reason to add  drag  to a portfolio currently  These two markets are likely to get much worse before they get better  Put stops on all positions  
Dividends and Equal Weight continue to hold their own and we continue to hold our allocations to these  core holdings   We will overweight these positions on a pullback to support that does not violate that level 
Gold   If you are still hanging onto gold  we have been consistently providing stop loss levels and sell points since May of this year  These points have continued to decline  With gold very oversold on a short term basis  if you are still long the metal  your stop has been lowered from  117 four weeks ago  to  111 this week  A rally sale point has also declined from the previous level of  121 to  114 
Bonds   This past week  bonds continued to rally as money looked for  safety  amid the concerns of a collapse in the Turkish lira  The rally over the past two weeks establishes a series of rising bottoms for bonds AND we have now registered an important  BUY  signal for bonds as the 50 dma crosses back above the 200 dma  As noted previously  we remain out of trading positions currently but remain long  core  bond holdings mostly in floating rate and shorter duration exposure  However  with a  buy  signal in place  we will look to add trading positions back into portfolios as necessary 
REITS keep bouncing off the 50 dma like clockwork  Despite rising rates  the sector has continued to catch a share of money flows and the entire backdrop is bullish for REITs  However  with the sector very overbought  take profits and rebalance back to weight and look for pullbacks to support to add exposure 
The table below shows thoughts on specific actions related to the current market environment  
 These are not recommendations or solicitations to take any action  This is for informational purposes only related to market extremes and contrarian positioning within portfolios  Use at your own risk and peril  

Portfolio Client Update 
Over the last few weeks  I have discussed the increases to equity exposure in portfolios as the market s momentum has continued to push higher  However  we have done this cautiously by using pullbacks to support that subsequently broke out above resistance to do so  As I stated last week 

 The recent corrective action was not sustained long enough to provide an opportunity to add to existing positions  However  we suspect over the next month or so that opportunity will present itself given what is happening globally  As long as the cluster of support at the 50  and 100 dma remains in place  which limits much of the downside risk currently  and pullback to support at 2800 will provide an opportunity to add further exposure and bring portfolios closer to target model weights  

Over the past two weeks  the market did pull back to support at 2800 and subsequently broke out to new highs on Friday  With that  we will look to add equity exposure opportunistically over the next couple of weeks in accordance with the model allocations 
New clients  Add 50  of target equity allocations  
Equity Model  We sold three laggards last week  Chevron  NYSE CVX   Constellation Brands  NYSE STZ  and Eastman Chemical  NYSE EMN   and will replace with new positions opportunistically  
Equity ETF blended   Same as with the equity model  
ETF Model  We will overweight core  domestic  indices by adding a pure S P 500 index ETF to offset lack of international exposure  We remain overweight outperforming sectors to offset underweights in underperforming sectors  
Option Wrapped Equity Model sold CVX and will add two new positions opportunistically  
Again  we are moving cautiously  There is mounting evidence of short to intermediate term risk of which we are very aware  However  the trend of the market remains positive  and we realize that short term performance is just as important as long term  It is always a challenge to marry both 
It is important to understand that when we add to our equity allocations  ALL purchases are initially  trades  that can  and will  be closed out quickly if they fail to work as anticipated  This is why we  step  into positions initially  Once a  trade  begins to work as anticipated  it is then brought to the appropriate portfolio weight and becomes a long term investment  We will unwind these actions either by reducing  selling  or hedging  if the market environment changes for the worse ",2018-08-26,Lance Roberts,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-jackson-hole-pop--082418-200340616,200340616
112763,334278,STZ,Cannabis Hype Building Up  Bubble Or Opportunity ,opinion,"Over the past couple of months  we have seen a surging interest in marijuana stocks  This has come after Canada was discussing and then finally passed legislation  which will come to effect from October this year  to allow recreational use of marijuana making it the first G7 country to do so  The first country to legalize cannabis was Uruguay in 2013 while a number of US states also permit recreational use of this drug 
The hype over this sector has more recently reached higher levels as earlier this month  Constellation Brands Inc   NYSE STZ   the brewer of Corona  announced it will spend US 3 8 billion to increase its stake in Canopy Growth Corp  TO WEED   the largest deal in Canada s embryonic marijuana industry  Molson Coors Brewing Co Class B  NYSE TAP  is also starting a joint venture with Hydropothecary Corp  TO HEXO  to develop cannabis drinks in Canada 
The Global Cannabis Stock index  which includes 52 companies across the U S   Canada and Australia that deal in medical and legal marijuana sector  has now a market cap of around  37 billion  The cannabis market cap has been growing a lot lately and has also been massively affected by the Canopy deal which from a valuation of almost  4 billion is now at  10 billion  that is an increase of  6 billion over two weeks   
The world s biggest alcohol company Diageo  LON DGE   maker of Guinness  Smirnoff  Baileys  Johnnie Walker amongst others  is also looking for a partner in this segment  This is mostly being done due to a decline in the sale of beers and spirits and thus beverage firms need to find areas of growth to produce cannabis infused drinks  The idea that a genuinely global player like Diageo is also interested in cannabis is a very stimulating and is putting more limelight on the sector 
Any opportunities on the horizon 
Identifying new sectors and niche markets is very crucial when investing but we do must always understand potential pitfalls along the way and not get too excited when we see huge return numbers 
Over a two week period  the Global Cannabis Stock Index registered strong return of  23   massively pushed by the CGC deal that on its own increased by 90  over the same period  looking at moving averages on chart number 2 it seems that the upside is not over yet  
Looking at the index yearly chart however  see chart number 1   we can notice that after heating up late last year due to the build up in the Canada legalization discussions  majority of the gains made were crushed in a matter of few weeks  Does this pattern remind you of something 

NCV Global Cannabis Stock Index as at 28 08 2018 over a 1 year period 

Canopy Growth Corporation  CGC  as at 28 08 2018 over a 1 year period 
I am sure you are familiar with the Crypto currencies volatility and massive price hike over the course of last year that eventually declined all along  Although you might think that these investments are behaving in a similar manner  and you might be partially right when looking just at this chart  there are some fundamental differences which need to be pointed out 
a  Marijuana is something feasible  people can understand it and there is actually huge demand for it  It is basically like Food  alcohol or tobacco and also has medical use too so it is something which some consumers need 
b  Legalizing cannabis is basically legalizing a big  black  market and hence there is proof that the market already exists   it just needs to pass through the new channel 
c  Once recreational marijuana becomes legal in Canada  other countries will slowly follow and hence we will see demand increasing for cannabis growers and sellers as the public can access it easier  People are less afraid to try it and consume it once it is legal  think about other drugs vs alcohol for instance  both are harmful but the legality of alcohol makes it much more demanded  
d  Medical marijuana is already accepted and being produced in various countries in the world so demand is already growing in that area 
e  It will not just be the smoking of the drug  but can also be infused with foods and drink thereby we should see more food and drink companies heading this way 
f  This is a new thing   much like internet was in the 2000s  Canopy Growth CEO actually was reported saying that the firm has potential to become  google of cannabis  over time  Imagine having invested in Google  NASDAQ GOOGL  or Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  10 years ago 
Apart from CGC which is now the largest company in this space and has seen a lot of attention following the deal  it is imperative to look at others as well and below you can find a list of the largest stocks in the marijuana global index  We mentioned Diageo before that is looking for cannabis partners so with CGC out of the question following their ties with Constellation  there have been reports that potential names for Diageo might be Cronos  Tilray or Aphria which have all seen their share prices increasing drastically 

Of course  the market is in its early stages and investors will surely face huge volatility and lower volumes as compared to a traditional blue chip equity investment  Like mentioned  there seems to be the  bubble  pattern like we had for Bitcoin for instance and also due to the heavy hype being built around it with promotions on how to make a quick buck in a short period of time  Unlike cryptos and blockchain investments however  whereby these are still facing hurdles from governments  regulators and big financial institutions alike  marijuana investing is not just much simpler for people to understand but there is already a global acceptance for medical marijuana now in major countries and slowly  with Canada leading the pack  recreational use discussions will start in other countries too ",2018-08-28,Christian Buhagiar,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cannabis-hype-building-up--bubble-or-opportunity-200341016,200341016
112764,334279,STZ,Bulls Hold On Into Labor Day,opinion,"Bulls Hold Into Labor Day
Last week  we discussed the S P 500 breakout to all time highs 

 Get out your party hats ladies and gentlemen  the market closed at all time highs on Friday finally eclipsing the January peak  After 145 days of slogging  the  bull market is back  baby   

Over the last several months  we have been discussing the ongoing  pathway s  leading us back to these current levels  Each breakout above previous resistance was used to add equity exposure into portfolios while maintaining some cash to hedge against a potential downside break 
However  as I laid out last week 

 While I point out the prevailing risks  and the disconnect between bullish sentiment and hard data  the reality is the bull market remains intact 
Over the last several months we have been tracking the progress of the S P 500 with pathways back to  all time  highs  The very quick retest of support  as noted last week  set the stage for the push to market highs  


As I noted last time 

 With portfolios still long biased  the question is what happens next  and how to play it 
I have updated our pathway analysis to account for the breakout to new highs and the fact we are heading into September which has one of the poorest historical performance records 
Pathway  1  An uninterrupted advance of the bull market with an expansion of volume and market breadth  This is a lower probability event currently given the extreme short term overbought condition  light volume of the breakout and a negligible  buy signal  in place   20  
Pathway  2a  Is a bit more of an  exuberant  advance early next week which pulls back to the recent breakout level  The pullback consolidates a bit  works off some of the overbought condition  and then begins the next advance  Such a pullback would turn the previous resistance into support and provide a short term  buyable  entry   30  
Pathway  2b  Is a higher probability event given the overbought conditions currently  A pullback to 2800 2820 which works off the overbought condition and builds support at previous bottoms  This would also coincide with a  September  type performance and would set the stage for a traditional year end rally  This would provide the best opportunity to bring portfolios to target weights   40  
Pathway  3  This path is the least likely currently  but should be considered nonetheless  With all of the risks laid out above  something that triggers a credit related worry in the market could send stocks lower  There is strong support built at 2740 which should initially hold  If it doesn t we have other issues to discuss   10  
Again  with portfolios primarily invested  there is little for us to do  We did let some weak performers go last week and will look for a pullback to add to winners and make some new bets  

Currently  it is pathway  2a that continues to play out  This past week so a bit of an exuberant jump in the markets as traders scrambled to  get long  following the breakout to new highs  albeit it was on very light volume and participation  

Nonetheless  the current breakout is bullish and any pullback in September that doesn t violate any important support levels  technically  will provide an opportunity to increase equity exposure for a potential  year end  advance 
With earnings season winding down  trade wars heating up  again   and the Fed committed to hiking rates further  there certainly seems to be plenty of reasons for something to  go wrong  
However  so far  the bulls haven t seemed to care about such  risks  at all 
Kevin Giddis  via Raymond James  summed this issue up well   H T to Gerry  my Canadian researcher 

 A lot of what we have seen in the month of August seems to suggest that while the U S  economy is on very solid ground  corporate earnings continue to grow  confidence at a near term high  and the equity market wakes up looking to make a new record with almost every session  there is a sense of nervousness that something is going to go wrong soon 
Is this what a peak looks like  
The Fed keeps harping on the continuation of its tightening cycle even though wages aren t really growing and the core rate of inflation vacillates back and forth between 2   the Fed s target 
Is it worrying investors that they are going too far too fast  
How about trade  If we  the U S   keep applying pressure to our trade partners by adding tariff after tariff  could that backfire on the U S  and slow the economy without seeing prices rise 
As we climb this wall of worry  the bond market seems to be running in place  waiting for something else to happen  Maybe it s the inversion of the curve  maybe it s the continuation of a trade war  or maybe it s a breakdown in the numbers  none of us really knows  
Then there s the Fed  We are beginning to see more and more debate about whether the Fed might be going too far with its tightening policy  If the long end of the Treasury market doesn t budge  and the Fed keeps tightening  the yield curve is likely going to invert  Historically  inversions haven t ended well for the U S  economy  The point that I am trying to make is that there are a number of balls in the air  and there is a good chance that not all of them will bounce 
Even in what appears to be the best of times  cracks may be starting to show that we are closer to the end vs  the beginning of what has been a miracle recovery  

I agree with Kevin on his views  Last week  I noted that currently  everything is as good as it can get   which could be seen in our composite economic output index  EOCI  

 To understand this we can look at our own RIA Economic Output Composite Index  EOCI  which is an extremely broad indicator of the U S  economy  It is comprised of 
Chicago Fed National Activity Index  an index comprised of 85 subcomponents 
Chicago Purchasing Managers Index
ISM Composite Index  composite of the manufacturing and non manufacturing surveys 
Richmond Fed Manufacturing Survey
New York  Empire  Manufacturing Survey
Philadelphia Fed Manufacturing Survey
Dallas Fed Manufacturing Survey
Markit Composite Manufacturing Survey
PMI Composite Survey
Economic Confidence Survey
NFIB Small Business Index 
Leading Economic Index  LEI 
All of these surveys  both soft and hard data  are blended into one composite index which  when compared to U S  economic activity  has provided a good indication of turning points in economic activity  


I went into substantially more detail about the index in the article  but the main point is that historically when the index has been at this level  bull markets did NOT keep rising indefinitely into the future 
While many are quick to dismiss the trend of the yield curve currently under a  this time is different  scenario  such has been a dangerous premise in the past 
Pick A Side
This is the point where readers often get confused  and I get a comment demanding me to  pick a side   
Investing is not about taking sides 
Being a  full time bull  is just as dangerous as being a  full time bear   
In the short term  as I discussed on Tuesday  the market is indeed bullish  The trend is positive  supports are in place and any pullback that reduces the short term overbought condition should be bought 

 Regardless of the reasons  the breakout Friday  with the follow through on Monday  is indeed bullish  As we stated repeatedly going back to April  each time the market broke through levels of overhead resistance we increased equity exposure in our portfolios  The breakout above the January highs now puts 3000 squarely into focus for traders  


I am indeed  bullish  at the moment 
However  in the longer term  the market dynamics and fundamental backdrop are concerning  The full cycle will complete itself and there will be a  mean reversion  process along the way  As I noted 

 With markets extended  extremely deviated from long term means  and at the third most overbought level since the turn of the century  the longer term outlook remains bearish  


As an investor  you have two choices 
Ride it out
Reduce risk when the trend changes and protect capital 
What you decide to do is up to you 
However  my clients didn t hire me to sit around and watch 50  of their investment portfolio evaporate  They also didn t hire me to regurgitate the false narrative they shouldn t worry because  it will come back someday   
Getting  back to even  is not an investment strategy as it destroys the  time  required to reach your financial goals  
Managing money through 2 massive bear markets taught me better 
So  I will opt for  2 
See you next week

S P 500 Tear Sheet

Performance Analysis

ETF Model Relative Performance Analysis

Sector and Market Analysis 
Despite the markets breaking out to all time highs last week  there are definitely signs of rotation from previously leading sectors of the market to the laggards  This is shown below in the 10 week relative rotation graph which compares performance relative to the S P 500 index 

While emerging and international markets are beginning to show a bit better relative performance to the S P 500 in the short term  with the issues internationally in both dollar funding status  economic growth and geopolitical risks  there is no reason to add exposure currently  We are watching for a potential entry point for the industrial sector which has begun to improve performance wise  but we remain wary of the  tariff  risk as the White House and China continue to scale up the rhetoric 

Discretionary  Technology  and Healthcare   continue to pace the way higher in the market over the last few weeks  We continue to hold our weightings in these sectors  outside of just trimming position sizes to account for gains for now  With the sectors VERY overbought and extended currently use pullbacks for adding to exposure or increasing target weights 
Staples and Utilities   have regained strength after a very tough start to the year  As we stated last week  there is a movement to more defensive sectors of the market  late economic stage sectors  that is still occurring  Use pullbacks to support  and oversold conditions  to add exposure accordingly 
Financial  Energy  Industrials  and Materials   while Industrial finally gained a bit of momentum due to earnings season  the risk of an ongoing  and acceleration of  tariffs and  trade wars  keeps us out of both the Industrial and Materials sector for now  However  with that said  Industrials performance is improving and on a pullback to support that doesn t violate it  we may consider adding a small exposure  Energy s recent slump successfully tested the 200 dma  As we stated last week  the 50 dma acted as resistance  Stops should remain at the recent lows  Financials continue to languish along support but not showing much in the way of strength to support overweighting the sector currently 

Small Cap and Mid Cap continue to perform well and after adding exposure to these areas a few weeks ago  there is little to do currently  With these markets extremely overbought and extended  pullbacks to support is needed to add additional exposure 
Emerging and NYSE EFA Markets were removed in January from portfolios on the basis that  trade wars  and  rising rates  were not good for these groups  With the addition of the  Turkey Crisis   ongoing tariffs  and trade wars  there is simply no reason to add  drag  to a portfolio currently  These two markets are likely to get much worse before they get better  Put stops on all positions  
Dividends and Equal Weight continue to hold their own and we continue to hold our allocations to these  core holdings   We will overweight these positions on a pullback to support that does not violate that level 
Gold   If you are still hanging onto gold  we have been consistently providing stop loss levels and sell points since May of this year  These points have continued to decline  Last week we gave a rally sale point of  114 which was achieved this past week  With gold very overbought on a short term basis  if you are still long the metal this is your opportunity to rethink your strategy  Stops remain at  111 this week  
Bonds   The rally over the past three weeks establishes a series of rising bottoms for bonds AND we have now registered an important  BUY  signal for bonds as the 50 dma crosses back above the 200 dma  As noted previously  we remain out of trading positions currently but remain long  core  bond holdings mostly in floating rate and shorter duration exposure  However  with a  buy  signal in place  we will look to add trading positions back into portfolios as necessary 
REITs keep bouncing off the 50 dma like clockwork  Despite rising rates  the sector has continued to catch a share of money flows and the entire backdrop is bullish for REITs  However  with the sector very overbought  take profits and rebalance back to weight and look for pullbacks to support to add exposure 
The table below shows thoughts on specific actions related to the current market environment  
 These are not recommendations or solicitations to take any action  This is for informational purposes only related to market extremes and contrarian positioning within portfolios  Use at your own risk and peril  

Portfolio Client Update 
Over the last few weeks  I have discussed the increases to equity exposure in portfolios as the market s momentum has continued to push higher  However  we have done this cautiously by using pullbacks to support  which then subsequently broke out above resistance  to do so 
Last week  the market was able to hold above the  breakout  levels once again  so we will look to take the following actions within the next week or so  We are looking for a bit of pullback which provides a better entry point as we enter into the seasonally weak month of September  The goal is to be positioned in portfolios for the potential year end upside bias 
New clients  Add 50  of target equity allocations  
Equity Model  We recently sold three laggards last week  Chevron  NYSE CVX   Constellation Brands Class A  NYSE STZ   and Eastman Chemical  NYSE EMN   and will replace with new positions opportunistically  
Equity ETF blended   Same as with the equity model  
ETF Model  We will overweight core  domestic  indices by adding a pure S P 500 index ETF  NYSE SPY  to offset lack of international exposure  We remain overweight outperforming sectors to offset underweights in under performing sectors  
Option Wrapped Equity Model sold CVX and will add two new positions opportunistically  
Again  we are moving cautiously  There is mounting evidence of short to intermediate term risk of which we are very aware  However  the trend of the market remains positive  and we realize that short term performance is just as important as long term  It is always a challenge to marry both 
It is important to understand that when we add to our equity allocations  ALL purchases are initially  trades  that can  and will  be closed out quickly if they fail to work as anticipated  This is why we  step  into positions initially  Once a  trade  begins to work as anticipated  it is then brought to the appropriate portfolio weight and becomes a long term investment  We will unwind these actions either by reducing  selling  or hedging  if the market environment changes for the worse ",2018-09-02,Lance Roberts,https://www.investing.com/analysis/bulls-hold-into-labor-day--090118-200341820,200341820
112787,334302,STZ,3 Staples ETFs   Stocks To Buy On Retail Sales   Geopolitics,opinion,"It might be time for the U S  retail sector to rejoice after March sales registered an increase since November  But we believe consumer staples will emerge as the real beneficiary  Agreed  vehicle sales hogged attention in the March retail sales report  but sales rose at grocery stores  restaurants and bars  and drug stores on a wider scale 
Staples Sales Stand Out in March
Overall  retail sales rose 0 6  sequentially in March 2018  rebounding from a 0 1  decline in February and beating market expectations of   Food   beverage stores  0 2   the same clip as in February  and health   personal care stores  1 4  versus  1 1   were some of the categories that drove the staples sector  Food services   drinking places also registered an increase of 0 4   the same pace noticed last month 
Huge Room for Growth in Online Grocery
Per a study by the Food Marketing Institute conducted by Nielsen  online grocery sales are estimated to make up about  by 2025 to reach  100 billion in consumer sales  Wal Mart  WMT  and Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  both are betting on this evolution  Walmart and logistics firm Postmates are joining hands to expand the retailer s online grocery delivery option to more than  
Amazon is also striving to strengthen its presence in that category  With about  in the online grocery  Amazon is leading the space  Within only four months of the acquisition  Whole Foods  365 Everyday Value brand became  after AmazonBasics  per One Click Retail  Whole Foods delivery via Amazon Prime is now accessible in  and continued expansion across the United States is planned throughout the rest of the year  read    
Consumers Still Value Conscious  
 that healthy consumer confidence  a solid job market and the tax reform tailwind will boost consumer spending growth in the months ahead  But according to Wall Street Journal  the wider trend in consumer spending hints at moderate growth despite an uptick in worker paychecks  If this is the situation of consumers  spending pattern  they would probably buy more staples than discretionary items 
Geopolitical Tension
Recent geopolitical tensions related to U S  led airstrikes on Syria may not be given much importance but souring relations of the United States with Russia  slapped with sanctions for supporting Syria government  and China  the latter may involve in a trade war with the United States  are causes for concerns and can disrupt market movement any time 
If this happens  investors will invariably flee to a safe sector like consumer staples  Moreover  safe haven assets like U S  Treasury gains in market volatility and yield falls  Staples stocks perform better in a low rate environment  read

112788,334303,STZ,What Lies Ahead For Vice ETFs ,opinion,"Vice ETFs primarily target companies dealing in products seen as vices  such as alcohol  tobacco or marijuana   These ETFs are attractive options for those seeking some diversification in their portfolio by investing in the so called sin stocks 
The need to form such a category was primarily because of some investors  inclination toward sustainable investing  which mainly seeks to avoid sin stocks  However  some investors choose such stocks for their attractive return potential 
How to Add Sin Stocks to Your Portfolio 
Investors have multiple ways to gain exposure to the space  Depending on their preference  investors can choose pure play alcohol stocks  tobacco  marijuana stocks or form a diversified portfolio of the entire space  However  owing to high volatility in this space and stringent regulations  it is advisable to go the ETF way to gain exposure to the sector 
With experienced managers handling money  investors will be in a good spot when the sector performs well  When AdvisorShares Vice ETF was launched last September  the fund s portfolio manager Dan Ahrens said   We re not making any kind of moral judgment or statement about what people want to consume with this focus  there s a strong economic argument for looking at these sectors  
Another positive for this segment s investors is that these products are somewhat staples  Even when the economy is not performing well  people drink and smoke  As a result  even if the sector takes a beating at the time of a recession  it will outperform other segments of the markets  owing to its demand interdependency 
The alcohol  has been looking up  with growth surpassing expectations  Volumes for spirits grew 2 6  last year  according to data provided by the Distilled Spirits Council  while supplier revenue was up 4 0  to  26 2 billion  Moreover  the cannabis and legal marijuana industry is seeing strong growth although tobacco sales are seeing a slight decline 
Let us now discuss a few ETFs providing exposure to the space 
Spirited Funds ETFMG Whiskey   Spirits ETF

112789,334304,STZ,Alcohol High On Demand  Will These Stocks  Q1 Earnings Cheer ,opinion,Alcohol is hardly ever in bad taste  especially American whiskey s popularity among the spirit enthusiasts continues unabated  This is evident from the U S  Alcohol market s expansion spree owing to rising demand and improving consumer spending  Among the host of diverse spirts  craft beer seems to be hogging the limelight at the moment  courtesy of its popular fan base and convenient size production  Per BMI Research  global spirits sales are expected to increase by 4 3  in 2018 In view of these above mentioned tailwinds  the  industry ranks among the top 45   116 of 256  of all Zacks industries The first quarter 2018 earnings season has seen releases from nearly 87 S P 500 members as of Apr 20  Per the latest   the scenario looks quite compelling  with 82 8  of the members delivering positive earnings surprises and 67 8  trumping top line expectations  In fact  the proportion of companies pulling off earnings and revenue beats is a stellar 62 1  The momentum is likely to continue as total earnings for the S P 500 index are still anticipated to increase 18 3  from the year ago period on 7 7  growth in revenues  As the earnings season gets into groove  we expect the scenario to become much more transparent Why the Consumer Staples Sector Alcohol stocks form part of  sector  We believe the sector is well poised to grow on a buoyant U S  economy driven by rising consumer confidence  improving consumer spending and an accelerating labor market  In fact  Consumer Staples sector carries a Zacks Rank  8  placing it at the top 50  among 16 Zacks sectors Per the latest Earnings Preview  total first quarter earnings for the sector are likely to grow 6 2  year over year with revenues expected to increase 2 8   In fact  margins are also estimated to edge up 0 4  year over year Notably  Constellation Brands  Inc    NYSE STZ    the world s leading wine company has already released its earnings numbers on Mar 29  The company delivered better than expected quarterly results  witnessing margin expansions  significant market share gains  strong free cash flow and solid execution  As a result  it issued an upbeat outlook for fiscal 2019 Furthermore  our research shows that when a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  stock is combined with a positive   the chance of beating earnings estimates is high  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  All said  let s take a look at the performance of a few alcohol stocks ahead of their earnings releases The Boston Beer Company  Inc    NYSE SAM   is slated to report its first quarter 2018 results tomorrow  Although the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 10 6  last quarter  it pulled off a positive surprise in each of the trailing three quarters  Per the Zacks model  Boston Beer is unlikely to deliver earnings beat this quarter  This is because the company has an Earnings ESP of  35 65 and a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   which makes our surprise prediction difficult You can see  Though the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 38 cents for the quarter remained stable in the last 30 days  it portrays a decline of more than 15  year over year  Also  it has been witnessing lower shipment volumes and depletions due to challenges in Samuel Adams and Angry Orchard brands along with soft hard cider category  However  management remains confident about its growth plan focused on cost saving initiatives  long term innovation and the revival of Samuel Adams and Angry Orchard brands  Moreover  Boston Beer s brand building efforts and initiatives to add new products bode well for the company s top line growth Molson Coors Brewing Company   NYSE TAP   is scheduled to release first quarter 2018 results on May 2  Though the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 10 7  last quarter  it recorded an average miss of 13 2  in the trailing four quarters  Per the Zacks model  the trend is likely to continue as Molson Coors  Earnings ESP of  0 21  and Zacks Rank  4  Sell  indicate that it is unlikely to beat earnings  Also  the consensus estimate of 80 cents moved south by a penny in the last seven days but depicts year over year growth of 5 3   Notably  the company has been gaining from its focus on above premium brands  which form nearly 20  of its total annual brand volumes  Also  management is making efforts to gain share in the U S  premium light segment through Coors Light and Miller Lite brands Craft Brew Alliance  Inc    NASDAQ BREW   is expected to report first quarter 2018 results on May 2  The company boasts an impressive earnings surprise history with a beat in each of the trailing four quarters  delivering an average of 275 9   Although the company s Zacks Rank  3 increases the predictive power of earnings beat  an Earnings ESP of 0 00  makes surprise prediction difficult  However  the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 3 cents for the quarter remained stable in the last 30 days and reflects a substantial improvement from a loss of 9 cents incurred in the year ago quarter  Additionally  management remains optimistic on continuing growth momentum  strategic local brands and partnerships as well as bolstering revenue management and operational improvements  In fact  Kona s potential of delivering robust growth in 2017 is also impressive Anheuser Busch InBev SA NV   NYSE BUD    alias AB InBev  is slated to report first quarter 2018 results on May 9  Although the company came up with a positive earnings surprise of 6 1  last quarter  it lagged earnings estimates in the preceding seven quarters  The company has a Zacks Rank  3 which increases the predictive power of EPS  However  an Earnings ESP of 0 00  makes surprise prediction difficult  Also  the consensus mark shows an improvement of 6 8  from the year ago quarter despite the downtrend in the estimate in the last seven days  While AB InBev s fourth quarter 2017 results marked a return to the positive earnings trajectory  it envisions a soft first quarter due to difficult comparisons  and phasing of marketing and sales initiatives  Nevertheless  robust brand portfolio and solid geographical reach remain major strengths  It also anticipates delivering strong top line growth in 2018 backed by impressive brands performance and robust commercial plans Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars  Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply  one company stands out as the  1 stock to buy according to Zacks research It s not the one you think ,2018-04-23,Zacks Investment

112817,334332,STZ,Should You Buy Constellation Brands  STZ  Stock Ahead Of Earnings ,opinion,"Shares of Constellation Brands   NYSE STZ   climbed nearly 1  on Tuesday  just a couple days before the alcoholic beverage giant is set to post its fourth quarter financial results  Investors are often on the hunt for stocks that look poised to top earnings estimates  but after the recent  nearly market wide downturn  expect Wall Street to really hone in on Constellation when it reports on Thursday 
Constellation s brands include import beer powers Corona and Modelo  Kim Crawford Wines  and Casa Noble Tequila  The New York based company s stock has gone on an outstanding run over the last six years  with its stock price skyrocketing from roughly  22 per share in March 2012 all the way up to its current price tag of  222 per share 
It seems clear that Constellation has been a growth company for years  and most investors hope that this remains the case for years to come  However  shares of Constellation have sunk by 3 6  over the last 12 weeks 
With that said  let s take a closer look at some of Constellation s current estimates to understand if investors should consider buying the stock ahead of earnings 
Latest Outlook and Valuation
Based on our latest Zacks Consensus Estimates  we expect Constellation to report adjusted earnings of  1 74 per share  which would mark 17 6  growth from the year ago period  The company is also projected to see its revenues jump by nearly 8  to hit  1 76 billion 
Heading into the report  STZ is trading with a Forward P E of 22 7  This marks a discount compared to the  Beverages   Alcohol  industry s average P E of 26 9  Constellation is also currently trading at a lower earnings multiple than its high point of 25 3x forward earnings over the last year and is almost directly in line with its median 52 week P E of 22 9 
Earnings ESP Whispers
Investors will also want to anticipate the likelihood that Constellation surprises investors with better than anticipated earnings results  For this  we turn to our Earnings ESP figure 
Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst estimates  This is done because  generally speaking  when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release  it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago 
A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat  In fact  our 10 year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70  of the time 
STZ is rocking a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and an Earnings ESP of 1 64   This is because the company s Most Accurate Estimate for earnings sits at  1 77 per share  meaning that the most recent analyst estimates have been higher than the consensus  This improved outlook is a good sign just two days out from Constellation s earnings report 
Price Performance and Surprise History
Another important thing to consider ahead of Constellation s report is the company s history of earnings surprises and the effect that these surprises have had on share prices Constellation Brands Inc Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   We can see that Constellation boasts a strong earnings surprise history  yet its bottom line results have not always translated into positive momentum for the stock  Looking at a more consolidated period  the company has posted strong earnings beats in the trailing four quarters  with an average surprise of 11 9  
We judge the price effect of these earnings beats by comparing the closing price of the stock two days before the report and two days after the report  Constellation has seen its stock price surge immediately following its earnings release in three out of the last four quarters   
As most investors know  past performance is hardly an indicator of future success  but we can see that investors have tended to reward STZ s earnings beats recently  On top of that  Constellation looks poised to beat earnings yet again and marks a discount to an industry that is has  for the most part  outperformed 
Constellation is set to report its fiscal fourth quarter and full year financial results before the markets open on Thursday  March 29

112856,334371,STZ,The Super Bowl Is Over  But You Can Still Buy These 3 Sin Stocks,opinion,"Super Bowl LII in Minneapolis turned out to be a fantastic game between the Philadelphia Eagles and the New England Patriots  And while the teams battled it out on the field in historic high scoring fashion  people around the country gathered in living rooms and bars happily sipping their favorite adult beverages 
The Super Bowl is one of the biggest get together events of the year  and for many  it signals the start of post football season life  This also means that warmer weather  as well as spring and summer parties  are on the horizon  In short  while football is over for now  people around the country will still be drinking plenty of booze 
But not all beer and liquor companies are well positioned to capitalize in the current U S  drinking market  Domestic beer sales have slowed  wine and spirits sales are up  and imports from south of the border and craft brews have become more and more prevalent  
With that said  let s take a look at three companies with strong Zacks Ranks that also stand to profit from these new booze trends 
1        Diageo  LON DGE  plc   NYSE DEO  
Shares of Diageo plc slipped on Monday as part of a now two day  market wide sell off  But before today s retreat  shares of this liquor giant had surged more than 27  over the last year  The maker of brands such as Johnnie Walker  J B  Smirnoff  C roc  Ketel One  Don Julio  and Tanqueray has also earned multiple upward earnings estimate revisions for its current fiscal year within the last 30 days 
Diageo plc is currently a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and rocks an  A  grade for Growth in our Style Scores system  The multinational spirits company could be poised to expand even further amid shifting drinking habits  Investors should be happy to note that the company currently sits nearly 8  below its 52 week high  which should give its shares room to rebound without having to jump into a new range 
2        Boston Beer Company   NYSE SAM   
Despite Boston Beer Company s hometown Patriots losing 41 33 in the Super Bowl  the company has a stronghold in the craft beer world  In fact  the maker of Samuel Adams helped kick off the mass appeal of this beer revolution  and it continues to introduce new flavor forward beers and other alcoholic drinks to this day 
Boston Beer also owns two hard cider powers  Twisted Tea Brewing Company and Angry Orchard Cider Company  These two brands should help the company expand its reach as the hard cider drinking trend proliferates  Lastly  Boston Beer quietly entered the even more nascent spiked sparkling water market in 2016 with its Truly Spiked   Sparkling brand  SAM is currently a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy 
3        Constellation Brands  Inc    NYSE STZ  
Constellation boasts beer brands such as Corona and Ballast Point  The company also owns Black Box and Kim Crawford wines as well as Casa Noble Tequila and Svedka vodka  Constellation also owns Mexican beer Modelo Especial  which is one of the  beer brands in the U S  These brands have helped shares of this alcohol distribution powerhouse skyrocket over 44 63  in the last 52 weeks 
Looking forward  Constellation is expected to see its full year earnings jump 26 18  year over year  Constellation has also experienced a great deal of upward earnings estimate revisions recently  Investors will also be happy to note that the company is expected to see its EPS figure grow at an annualized rate of 19 05  over the next three to five years  What s more  Constellation is currently a Zacks Rank  2  Buy

line improved year over year and the latter also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Further  the company exceeded its cost savings target for the year  encouraging management to raise its three year target for 2019 The solid results helped this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock gain 2 7  in the pre market trading hours  Let s see if this can bring a turn around to the stock s otherwise drab performance  Well  Molson Coors  shares have plunged 22 5  in a year  as against the  s growth of 14   Molson Coors  adjusted earnings of 62 cents per share surged 31 9  year over year and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 56 cents  The upside is attributable to favorable global pricing  net pension benefits  MG A efficiencies and indirect tax provision cycling  However  this was partly countered by reduced volumes  inflation  greater underlying tax rate and investments in global business capacities  Molson Coors Brewing Company Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise     Delving DeeperNet sales  excluding excise taxes  advanced 4 5  to  2 579 6 million but was below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 597 million  The sales growth was backed by better global pricing  royalty volume  cycling of indirect tax provision and currency translations  somewhat negated by soft financial volumes  On a constant currency basis  net sales climbed 2 4   While sales declined in the United States  it witnessed improvements in all other regions  Notably net sales per hectoliter improved 5 8   up 3 7  on a constant currency basis   on the back of the same factors that drove net sales Molson Coors  worldwide brand volume inched lower by 1 1  to 22 4 million hectoliters owing to soft U S  and International volumes  partly compensated by strength in European and Canadian regions  Global priority volumes dipped 1 9   while financial volumes slipped 1 2  to 23 1 million hectoliters  Financial volumes were hurt by softness in United States Underlying EBITDA was  480 3 million in the quarter  marking a 17  jump from the year ago period  Further  underlying EBITDA ascended 14 3  on a constant currency basis Segment DetailsThe company operates through the following geographical segments Canada  Molson Coors Canada net sales rose 7 1  to  352 9 million in the quarter  Net sales per hectoliter grew 1  in local currency  driven by better pricing  partly countered by unfavorable sales mix  Further  Canada brand volume climbed 0 8   thanks to increased sales of craft and import brands  Financial volumes  which includes contract brewing volumes  inched up 1   Underlying EBITDA fell 4 2  to  79 million due to higher COGS  partly made up by better pricing  favorable currency and reduced MG A costs United States  MillerCoors   Molson Coors now has complete ownership rights to all the

and company owned distributor sales  improved 1 4   This stemmed from favorable pricing  partly countered by negative mix  However  U S  domestic sales to retailers volume  STRs  and domestic sales to wholesalers volume  STWs  declined 3  and 1 5   respectively  The former was accountable to soft Premium Light volumes  The segment s underlying EBITDA grew 4 9  to  346 million thanks to higher net pricing  lower M A costs and cost savings  This was partly offset by reduced STW volumes and COGS inflation Europe  The segment reported net sales growth of 29  to  473 2 million in the quarter  Europe net sales per hectoliter jumped 16 3  in local currency driven by positive mix  inclusion of export brand and royalty revenues and cycling of indirect tax provision  Additionally  Europe brand volume improved 10 4  in the quarter  whereas financial volume  including contract brewing and factored brands  excluding royalty volume  went up by 2 7   Brand volumes were aided by strength in above premium brands  transfer of royalty and export brand volumes into this segment from the International segment  Underlying EBITDA surged considerably year over year  from  28 1 million to  102 7 million International  Segment net sales surged 19   71 4 million  Net sales per hectoliter grew 6 1   courtesy of changes in sales mix and better pricing  However  International brand volume plunged 15 1  in the quarter  marred by transfer of export and royalty volumes to European segment and Modelo contract loss in Japan  This was partly cushioned by inclusion of Puerto Rico s business from MillerCoors and growth in various markets of Latin America  Segment underlying EBITDA came in at  0 4 million in the quarter  much lower than  1 4 million the year ago period  This was accountable to increased MG A costs associated with Miller International s addition  loss of the Modelo deal and transfer of export and royalty volumes to Europe Other Financial UpdatesThe company s net cash from operating activities in 2017 came in at  1 866 billion  while underlying free cash flow was  1 449 billion  Underlying free cash flow jumped 67 8  year over year The company ended 2017 with cash and cash equivalents of  418 6 million and net debt of  10 895 billion  Notably  the company s net debt declined substantially from the beginning of 2017  The company also made contributions to its defined benefit pension plans during the year thus moving ahead with its deleveraging targets Notably  the company generated cost savings of more than  255 million in 2017  that surpassed its target by more than  80 million  Encouraged by this  the company raised its three year savings goal to  600 million  which is expected to be generated by 2019 OutlookManagement remains impressed with its 2017 results  which was marked by enhanced top line  global brand volume growth and higher net sales per hectoliter  even amid tough market conditions  Notably  the company s focus on portfolio premiumization and revenue management have been paying off  Also  the company enhanced its financial position by paying down debt and increased market share in Canada and Europe  while it also exceeded its cost savings and free cash flow target  Moreover  Molson Coors optimized commercial expenditure  which helped it deliver solid net income and underlying EBITDA growth in 2017 Further  the company remains committed toward First Choice  and remains focused on strengthening its brand portfolio  Given these factors  along with focus on achieving cost savings and solidifying balance sheet  we remain optimistic about Molson Coors ongoing prospects For 2018  Molson Coors anticipates generating cost savings of roughly  210 million  Further  it expects to deliver underlying free cash flow of around  1 5 billion in 2018   plus or minus 10    Capital spending is expected to be roughly  670 million  plus or minus 10    Underlying tax rate for the year is likely to range from 18 22

112905,334420,STZ,Will Trump Terminate NAFTA  If So  How Will it Affect Markets ,opinion,"The sixth round of talks between the U S   Mexico and Canada over the North American Free Trade Agreement  NAFTA  kicks off today in Montreal  moved forward two days from the original January 23 start date for reasons unknown  and markets are watching to see if an actual deal will ever be penned and what the fallout might be 
President Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed that the 24 year old pact is perhaps the worst trade deal that the U S  ever made and has vouched to either achieve a better agreement in line with his  America First  ideology or terminate it all together 
While the baseline claim that the U S  needs to force firms to produce products back within its borders in order to create jobs for Americans is popular with the voter base that made Trump president  several homegrown factions are actually against the revamp of the NAFTA agreement amid fears that a change in policies would actually hurt their business 
Debate Over Economic Impact
One of the major sticking points in negotiations has been the U S  insistence on the rules of origin for the auto industry  The U S  wants to raise the minimum threshold for sourcing auto production to be 85  from NAFTA members and 50  of the total from the U S  itself  compared to the current agreement for 62 5  to be sourced from the member countries 
U S  automakers Ford  NYSE F   General Motors  NYSE GM  and Fiat Chrysler  NYSE FCAU  have not been quiet in their insistence that these changes would not be positive for the American people  arguing that it would add thousands of dollars to car costs in the U S 
Aside from the debate over the economic effects  taking a look at the stock moves on January 10  image below   when Canadian government sources said they were increasingly convinced that Trump would pull out of NAFTA  gives a clear signal of what investors think the move would imply for company value 

Apart from the drops in the aforementioned stocks  other firms were also affected such as railroad track owner Kansas City Southern  NYSE KSU  which offers significant cross border transportation services for companies or Constellation Brands  NYSE STZ  which imports beer brands such as Corona Extra and Modelo Especial to the U S  as part of its international alcohol operations 
As recently as January 18  Trump continued the attack the trade agreement via his Twitter account   NAFTA is a bad joke  



Trump has been very outspoken about the  evil  of trade deficits  However  it s worthwhile to remember that they are simply a matter of subtracting exports from imports and are not inherently bad 
In economic terms  a country s trade balance tends to move toward surplus during recessions  as its citizens cannot afford imports  and tends to shift toward a deficit during periods of economic growth when internal supply cannot handle strong demand  As a rule consumers need outside products 
Eliminating NAFTA would theoretically increase the number of jobs domestically if the producers in the U S  are actually able to increase output and replace imports to meet internal demand  but  at the same time  it would also likely mean more expensive goods for American consumers as external competition is quashed 
It also is relevant to note that trade wars could cut down on demand for  Made in USA  products as any retaliatory tariffs would make American products less competitive price wise  In short  shrinking the trade deficit makes sense  but not if doing so comes at the expense of export growth 
American Farmers Could Suffer
Such a situation may well be a concern for American farmers  long thought to be a large portion of the Trump voter base 
The  from the the U S  Department of Commerce s International Trade Administration  ITA  shows that Mexico remained the U S   third largest agricultural trading partner in 2016  accounting for nearly 12  of total American agricultural exports and 53  of Mexico s total agricultural imports 
The report does in fact inarguably state that Mexico is  favored  via trade  Mexico exported a record  23 8 billion worth of agricultural products to the U S  in 2016  while total agricultural exports from the U S  were valued at  18 7 billion 
However  a strict numbers game does not necessarily reflect the reality for American consumers  The U S  population is much larger than Mexico s and cutting off the Mexican supply could mean possible shortages and or increasing costs for American households 
Plus  American farmers could be hit  The report  released in September 2017  evaluating current NAFTA negotiations  warned that 

    the geographic and tariff advantages that are enjoyed in Mexico are likely to continue to make the United States the best import option for most major agricultural goods  That said  Mexico is looking for alternate sources of supply given the charged political climate  

 Since 1994  when NAFTA entered into effect  bilateral agricultural trade between the United States and Mexico has expanded almost fivefold   the ITA  which collaborates with 19 U S  government agencies on its fact finding mission  found 
 At the same time  agricultural exports from the United States to Mexico have grown at similar rates  reflecting the mutually beneficial outcomes NAFTA has provided   the report added 
 If we lose Mexico as a customer  it will be absolutely devastating to the ag economy   Philip Gordon  a longtime farmer of wheat  corn and soybeans in Michigan  told The New York Times in April 
U S  State by State Exposure to NAFTA
A  looked at the regional impact on trade with a focus on individual states 
Fitch used U S  Census Bureau data to ascertain that North Dakota was first among states in terms of its export exposure to Canada  By merchandise value  82  of North Dakota s exports were sent to Canada in 2016  while New Mexico ranked number one by volume of exported goods shipped to Mexico  43  of total exports  
After North Dakota  Maine  Montana  Michigan  Vermont  Ohio  Missouri  South Dakota and Indiana had the largest export exposures to Canada  Fitch noted that major export industries in these states include farm products  energy  i e  oil and natural gas   machine parts  and automotive products 
The report highlighted that 11 U S  states  including those listed above  send 30  of more of their exports to Canada  and 24 others rely on the Canadian market for at least 20  of their export volumes  Goods imported into these states are also heavily weighted towards Canada  in terms of both industrial and consumer goods 
Meanwhile  Canadian goods accounted for 82  of Montana s imports by merchandise value  69  of Vermont imports  and more than 50  of the value of all goods imported into North Dakota  New Hampshire  and Wyoming in 2016 
Mexico absorbed 40  of Texas  exports by product value in 2016  putting into question if the state will allow NAFTA termination to  mess with Texas  
Similarly  according to Fitch  the Mexican domestic market received 38  of Arizona s and 15  of California s exports 
Fitch also made special mention of Michigan because of the complex automotive supply chain that has developed with NAFTA 
 Mexico was the destination for 22  of Michigan s exports by value  consisting chiefly of automotive and heavy machine components  in 2016   these analysts found 
 Likewise  South Dakota  25    Nebraska  23    Iowa  19    Kansas  18   and Missouri  18   have deep exporting relationships with Mexico  mainly because of their large agricultural sectors   Fitch noted 
 A unilateral U S  withdrawal from NAFTA would sharply increase import tariffs overnight  entailing potentially substantial costs for U S  importers and consumers   Fitch concluded in one of its reports 
In another warning  the credit rating agency stated that  U S  states and regions along the borders are vulnerable to falling tax receipts resulting from reduced border traffic  
NAFTA Status Quo
Trump has  quite logically  been playing hardball  as would any politician  pumping his rhetoric for what his voter base wants to hear  but investors may do well lay aside the subjective political diatribe and evaluate the possible real outcomes on their stocks 
 Ultimately  if negotiations fail and NAFTA ends  it is likely to be politics that is responsible  as each government has infused the talks with homespun political considerations that are largely defensive and intended for domestic audiences   Fitch global head of sovereign ratings James McCormack said 
 None appears willing to tolerate an outcome in which its electorate could perceive political leaders as either surrendering new found principles or allowing the country to be taken advantage of in reaching an agreement   he added 
This political  reality show  may well be what has convinced economists that the threat of ending NAFTA all together is nothing but talk  That may well be why only four of 45 economists from Mexico  Canada and the U S  polled last week by Reuters said they thought the deal would be terminated  with the rest expecting an updated trilateral agreement that  would not differ radically from the current one  
Respondents in the poll cited the energy and technology industries as among potential winners from renegotiation while autos  manufacturing and agricultural companies could suffer 
However  the economic impact of a modernized pact will largely be neutral or positive for each country and their currencies  the economists forecast 
The fact that negotiations in Montreal were moved forward two days from the original January 23 date  actually took us by surprise although it s not clear that anything has really changed 
We think the move was likely designed simply to gain  political points  for all three countries  especially since it moves in direct contradiction to prior indications from political leaders 
Trump himself recently appeared to soften his urgency on an outcome with regard to NAFTA in the face of the July presidential elections in Mexico  saying in an interview with The Wall Street Journal   I m leaving it a little flexible because they  Mexico  have an election coming up  So I understand a lot of things are hard to negotiate prior to an election  
 I thought that was a sensible suggestion from the President  I think all of us are mindful of the Mexican elections   Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland said after Trump s remarks 
Bloomberg  citing sources close to the matter  said that January 27 and 28 have been tentatively reserved for reports to chief negotiators  who handle some of the toughest issues  and were preparing for a January 29 ministers  meeting 
Talks beginning on Sunday were said to focus on energy  investment  financial services  agriculture and some  other issues   The high tension subject of rules of origin  particularly relevant with regards to the automotive sector  was reported to be reserved for the final days of talks  as in previous rounds 
All in all  it s unclear that this expanded schedule for the Montreal talks is anything more than a political slight of hand to show that all three countries are  working hard  to reach an agreement  Trump needs to show his commitment to campaign promises while Mexico is preparing for elections 
Markets are still likely to be jittery when it comes to U S  stocks with high exposure to trade issues  while currency markets  particularly the Mexican peso  could see some jolts as the political soap opera plays out 
Our assumptions are that politicians on all sides will make a lot of noise and all claim victory at the end  with an updated pact that will have little economic impact  Such is politics ",2018-01-21,Jason Martin/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-trump-terminate-nafta-and-how-will-it-affect-markets-200282024,200282024

112936,334451,STZ,5 Best Sinfully Good Stocks To Buy Ahead Of 2018,opinion,Does morality matter to you  If yes  then you may abhor the idea of putting money into  sin stocks  that are into activities considered unethical  However  products or services in this space are relatively inelastic  and business is recession proof  The very nature of their business ensures a steady stream of consumers irrespective of market conditions  which eventually lead to higher margins and solid profits And why not  While legalization of both recreational and medical marijuana will propel the pot industry to new highs  reduction in taxes will help alcohol producers save more  The cigarette industry  meanwhile  continues to make headway despite legal restrictions  As far as the gaming industry is concerned  growth in the Macau market and Japan opening to casinos will surely boost their bottom line heading into the New Year But before we zero in on stocks from this tempting space  let s take a look at what s in store for these companies Cannabis Sales Up This Year  With More Room to ExpandPer Marijuana Business Daily s annual report  legal pot sales have skyrocketed 30  so far this year  which is equivalent to  5 1  6 1 billion in total revenues  In fact  sales are expected to reach  6 7  8 8 billion in the coming year  which will result in a whopping gain of at least 31   Further  sales could top  17 billion by 2021 Such a stellar growth is possible  as a number of U S  states have voted to legalize recreational pot  Legalization of recreational weed in the state of California is helping Cannabis stocks move north  California s weed market is expected to open in January  with weeds costing around  500 a pound Lest we forget  as of now  29 states and the District of Columbia have already legalized the usage of medical marijuana  An increasing number of people are appreciating the medical value of marijuana as they believe it is safer compared to alcohol and a few other legal prescription drugs  Thus  medical marijuana industries in Illinois  Nevada and New York are poised to make the most as the pot market matures Alcohol Producers See Reduced Taxes  Cigarette Industry Fights Regulations Recently  jubilant Republicans delivered a tax bill to President Donald Trump before Christmas  as promised  The Republican tax plan got the final approval by the House that gave Corporate America a massive permanent tax break  The tax bill also has a provision that will give alcohol producers a two year reduction in federal excise tax worth  4 2 billion  Reduction in such taxes will encompass brewers  distilleries and wineries Kevin McElroy  the lead brewer at Random Row Brewing company  said   I think it s great   as the company will save  3 50 per barrel of beer from the tax break  He added that the new provision will save them  1 500 to  2 000 next year However  the same cannot be said of the U S  tobacco industry  Cigarette sales have fallen considerably in the U S  as the industry witnessed an increase in federal excise tax  The industry also faces stiff regulations and restrictions  Nevertheless  despite cigarette sales tanking  sales of flavored cigars continue to gain traction  Menthol cigarettes  meanwhile  continue to hold a constant market share  Smart marketing and advertising moves played a major role in helping the cigarette industry stay afloat Gambling Stocks Make Attractive Buys   Macau is the KeyThe year 2017 has been superb for gaming stocks  with Wynn Resorts   NASDAQ WYNN   and Melco Resorts   NASDAQ MLCO   comfortably outperforming the broader market  The climb in casino stocks was mostly due to the uptick in Macau s gambling market  In the first 11 months of this year  revenues surged 19 5   Macau s momentum has also been hitting highs lately  giving investors enough reason to be bullish going into next year That said  the big expansion for casino companies in 2018 will be in Japan  The country is expected to approve two more gaming licenses next year  while estimates are that Japan s market could be worth  40 billion  Major casino players have made Japan their top priority for next year with an outlay of around  10 billion in building a single resort  This property from Las Vegas Sands Corp    NYSE LVS   will eventually become the biggest license opening since Singapore  a key market for owners of integrated resorts Top 5 Sin Stocks to Buy for 2018As mentioned above  sinful stocks are well poised to gain traction in next year  Such stocks not only celebrate good times but are also useful during

112970,334485,STZ,Canopy Growth Reports Impressive Topline Growth In Q2,opinion,"Shares of Canopy Growth Corp  TO WEED  ended lower Tuesday despite announcing second quarter revenue that more than doubled
SmallCapPower   November 15  2017  Canopy Growth Corporation    reported strong second quarter results on Tuesday  with revenues more than doubling to  17 6 million as compared to  8 5 million in the same period last year  Sales of oils  including gel caps  accounted for 18  of revenue in the quarter  a 400 bps increase from prior year quarter  The Company first began selling cannabis oil in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 under the Tweed brand  The total quantity of cannabis sold during the quarter was 2 020 kilograms at an average price of  7 99 per gram  up from 1 169 kilograms at an average price of  7 01 in the same period last year  driven mainly by an increasing mix of oil products and oil based soft gel caps  Canopy Growth believes the sale of cannabis oils will represent a significant revenue stream going forward 
Despite this  shares of Canopy Growth Corporation eased 2  to close at  19 96 on Tuesday 
Average production cost per gram decreased by 1  to  2 73 as compared with the preceding quarter  This is one of metric where Canopy Growth lags behind the other players  who are producing at average cost of  1 5 per gram 
Gross margin before accounting for biological assets and inventory came in at  10 1 million  57  of sales   as compared to  5 1 million  60  of sales  in the prior year quarter  The lower gross margin percentage was due primarily to the impact of the write down of Hemp based inventory due to discontinued product lines and the temporarily idling of the Mettrum Creemore site for improvements  Its bottom line worsened further  though  with the net loss totaling  1 6 million for the quarter  as compared with the net income of  5 4 million in the prior year quarter 
Backed by the recent  245 million investment from Constellation Brands  NYSE STZ   Canopy Growth remains focused on the expansion of its cultivation capacity  extraction platform and finished branded products programs  The relationship with Constellation to work together to develop and market regulated recreational cannabis based beverages  when and where they are federally legal  is a critical step in the move up the value chain  Additionally  the historic cannabis supply MOU signed during the quarter with the province of New Brunswick confirms the Company s long held belief of investment in brands  quality and scale

112971,334486,STZ,Canopy Growth Vs  MedReleaf  Which Stock Has Greater Upside ,opinion,"MedReleaf Corp  TO LEAF  has an edge in its production cost profile  while Canopy Growth Corp  TO WEED  has the clear upper hand with higher production capacity
SmallCapPower   November 17  2017  Canadian marijuana stocks have been receiving much investor interest in recent days following the decision of Constellation Brands  NYSE STZ  to take an ownership interest in Canopy Growth  as well as Aurora Cannabis  takeover bid for CanniMed Therapeutics  As most marijuana investors know  the top spot in the cannabis industry belongs to the incumbent Canopy Growth Corp  which has taken advantage of its branding  early Health Canada approvals for sale and export  and a first mover position in the market  However  the entry of new players has changed the competitive landscape  with the top players fighting for a share of the large opportunity with heavy investments in expanding their production capacity  One among those players is MedReleaf Corp   which is Canada s first and only ISO 9001 and ICH GMP certified producer of medical cannabis 
Quarter to Quarter Growth
For these companies  revenue growth is the most significant factor and it is quickly reflected in stock prices as quarterly reports roll out 
MedReleaf posted negative revenue growth in its most recent quarter due to the impact of volume and price restrictions imposed by the VAC policy in November 2016 and May 2017  respectively  Canopy Growth has not been affected by the VAC policy  which shows how well the Company s management had overcome the regulatory change  posting decent growth 
Production and Supply
There is currently a lack of supply in the industry  Additionally  the upcoming legalization of recreational marijuana use in Canada in July 2018  will further drive demand  Both companies are ramping up their production facilities but there will be a period of time before these facilities can come online  So  it is important to understand production profiles of both companies 

With three times the current and expected production  Canopy Growth wins this metric  Canopy s humongous capacity will play a huge role in capturing the market as  and when  recreational marijuana use gets legalized 
Production Cost Gram
Cost to produce will significantly define the companies  margin levels  so it is important to compare this metric for the recent quarter  This is a factor that will scale in importance as revenues grow 

Clearly MedReleaf wins in this metric  MedReleaf is able produce with almost 50  less cost as compared with Canopy Growth  which is a big plus for MedReleaf  Due to the very low production cost  MedReleaf is able to generate profits at the operating level and has positive EBITDA levels  On the other hand  Canopy Growth is unprofitable at the operating level 
Recent Developments
Canopy Growth recently  October 2017  announced plans to expand production capacity by about 3 0 million sq ft in British Columbia  The Company is currently licensed to produce 31 000 kgs of marijuana and related products  and aims to triple that by July 2018 
Recently  in November 2017  MedReleaf received a sales license for its second facility in Bradford  Ontario  The Company received the sales license within six months after getting the cultivation license in April 2017  This development has helped MedReleaf increase the total current licensed production and sales capacity by 80  to   12 600 kg per year  And once the construction of the Bradford facility is fully completed in the summer of 2018  total licensed production and sales capacity from MedReleaf s two facilities in Markham and Bradford will be 35 000 kg per year 
Valuation 
Most of the Canadian marijuana stocks are trading at higher valuations due to the future expectations and the nascent stage of the industry  Recent valuations are astronomically high given the increased investor activity in the cannabis space as the recreational legalization date in Canada is fast approaching 
In terms of price to sales  Canopy Growth currently trades at a 100  premium to MedReleaf  This premium can be easily justified given that Canopy Growth has better growth prospects  higher production capacity and huge international opportunity 

Conclusion
Overall  both companies have the potential to provide monstrous returns for investors heading into recreational legalization in Canada  While MedReleaf has an edge only in its production cost profile  Canopy Growth has the clear upper hand with higher production capacity  decent growth rates and huge international opportunities  Thus  Canopy Growth is more attractive from an investment perspective and has the potential to provide much higher returns as compared with shares of MedReleaf

earnings surprise in third quarter 2017  which also marked its third straight quarter of year over year bottom line growth  However  top line fell year over year and lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Nonetheless  the company kept its 2017 earnings guidance intact Quarter in detailAdjusted earnings of 90 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 87 cents  Also  earnings increased 9 8  year over year  on the back of higher operating income in the smokeable and smokeless segments and lower outstanding shares  This was somewhat offset by reduced equity earnings from the company s investment in beer Altria Group Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    However  net revenues fell 2 5  to  6 729 million in the quarter  owing to soft net revenues in the smokeable products segments  Revenues net of excise taxes slipped 1 3  year over year to  5 123 million  This also came below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  5 196 million In e vapor  Altria s subsidiary Nu Mark LLC

volumes in those channels However  if we look into Altria s stock performance over a year  we note that the stock has moved up just 3 9   in comparison to the  s growth of 11 4  We believe declining demand for cigarettes due to the ongoing anti tobacco campaigns  government restrictions and higher cigarette prices in response to rising taxes have been weighing on the stock  Strict Food and Drug Administration  FDA  regulations on cigarette packaging dissuade customers from smoking  Additionally  consumers  preference for e cigarettes or substitutes for cigarettes are largely affecting the cigarette volume  Evidently  Altria s top line lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in seven of the last nine quarters  including this quarter Segment DetailsSmokeable Products Segment  Revenues net of excise taxes dipped 1 5  year over year to  4 410 million  due to soft volumes that was somewhat compensated by better pricing  Cigarette shipment volumes fell 6 2  year over year  stemming from lower cigarette industry volumes  unfavorable trade inventory movements and decline in retail share  On the other hand  shipment volumes for cigars rose 6 6  in the quarter  Total cigarette retail share declined to 50 5   representing a 0 6 percentage point slip Adjusted operating companies income  OCI  increased 7 7  to  2 300 million  while adjusted OCI margins jumped 4 5 percentage points to 52 2  Smokeless Products  Revenues net of excise taxes advanced 4 5  to  515 million in the quarter  This was driven by better pricing and reduced promotions  partly countered by unfavorable mix and soft volumes  Shipment volumes fell 1 8  to 212 6 million units  where Copenhagen and Skoal shipment volumes dropped 2  and others increased 1 2  in the quarter  Total smokeless products retail share grew 1 1 percentage points to 53 8  in the quarter Adjusted OCI surged 15 7  to  362 million and margins expanded 6 8 percentage points to 70 3  Wine  The segment s revenues  net of excise taxes  remained nearly flat year over year at  175 million  Results here were impacted by trade inventory reductions  heightened competition and sluggish growth of premium wine  Wine shipment volume was also almost flat at 2 2 million units Adjusted OCI declined 5 3  to  36 million  mainly accountable to soft volumes and escalated expenses  OCI margin decreased 1 percentage point to 20 6  Financial UpdatesIn

Quarter in Detail 
Adjusted earnings of  1 27 per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 39  While the company benefited from strong pricing and growth in Reduced Risk Products  lower cigarette volumes hurt its performance  Nevertheless  adjusted earnings in the reported quarter inched up 1 6  from the year ago period
Net revenue  excluding excise taxes  was  7 473 million  which increased 7   up 9  excluding unfavorable currency of  136 million  in the third quarter  Favorable pricing and volume mix in the quarter drove revenues  While  revenue increased across Asia  Latin America   Canada and the European Union  EU   the same had declined in Eastern Europe  the Middle East   Africa  EEMA  
During the quarter  revenues from combustible products declined 3 6   down 4 6  excluding negative currency  to  6 5 billion  On the contrary  Reduced Risk Products  RRPs  reported a whopping increase from last year quarter  stemming from the shift of customer preference away from tobacco products  The company generated revenues of  947 million from RRPs  significantly higher than  212 million reported last year 
However  net revenues lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  7 616 million 
Total cigarette and heated tobacco unit shipment volume fell 0 5  to 208 2 billion units  The figures were unfavorable in the EU  EEMA region and in Latin America   Canada mainly owing to low cigarette shipment volumes  These were offset by increased volumes in Asia  as well as higher heated tobacco unit shipment volume across all regions  While cigarette shipment volume declined 4 1  in the quarter  heated tobacco unit shipment volume of 9 7 billion units  increased significantly from 2 1 billion units recorded in third quarter 2016 
Adjusted operating companies income was up 2 2  year over year to  3 1 billion due to favorable pricing and growth witnessed in Asia  Excluding currency impact of  140 million  adjusted operating income increased 6 8   However adjusted operating margin was down 190 basis points to 42  Philip Morris International Inc Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

113033,334548,STZ,SUPERVALU  SVU  Tops Q2 Earnings   Sales  Reiterates View,opinion,SUPERVALU INC   NYSE SVU   reported better than expected sales and earnings in second quarter fiscal 2018 The company reported adjusted earnings per share of 46 cents that surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 35 cents and the year ago earnings of 21 cents  Robust earnings were driven by higher sales in the Wholesale business and the benefits from the completed acquisition of Unified Grocers in June Though the company reported a strong second quarter  its share performance has been unimpressive due to negative surprises reported in two of the past four quarters  In fact  the Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company s shares have underperformed the  over the last three months  The stock has lost 27 7  in the last three months  wider than the industry s decline of 3 8  Quarter in Detail SUPERVALU s net sales rose 35  year over year to  3 800 million  Also  the top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 3 758 million  This upside was backed by increased sales witnessed at the Wholesale segment  but were hurt by decline in Retail net sales Gross profit for the quarter amounted  428 million that depicted 8  growth from the prior year  However  margin contracted 280 basis points to 11 3   owing to store closing costs and changes in business segment mix  Wholesale segment accounted for a large portion of the total sales and gross profit during the quarter During the quarter  SUPERVALU s operating loss was of  7 million  as compared with the operating earnings of  58 million in the prior year period  This was caused by higher selling and administrative expenses SuperValu Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Segment DetailsWholesale  Net sales at Wholesale business grew 58  year over year to  2 74 billion  mainly driven by the revenues from Unified Grocers business  Additionally  the segment also gained from sales to new customers and stores  These were partially offset by reduced military sales and stores that no longer receive supplies from SUPERVALU  Also  the segment s operating income totaled  61 million  up from  58 million in the year ago quarter Retail  Net sales at Retail slipped 1 1  to  1 02 billion  This decrease represents store closures and unfavorable identical store sales of 3 5   partly mitigated by sales from acquired and new outlets In fact  we note that this leading grocery dealer is witnessing sluggish sales in the retail business due to competitive pressures  This is the tenth consecutive quarter of sales decline of the retail segment Further  the segment reported operating loss of  58 million  wider than the operating loss of  12 million in the year ago quarter  The downside was driven by lower sales and reduced gross margin owing to enhanced promotional activities Corporate  During the second quarter  fees earned under services agreements were down 2 4  to  40 million  Further  the segment delivered operating loss of  10 million  as against operating income of  12 million delivered in the year ago quarter Financial Update The company s cash and cash equivalents stood at  209 million as of Sep 9 compared to  252 million as of Jun 17 Long term debt was  1 601 million and total stockholders  equity totaled  373 million as of Sep 9  compared with long term debt of  1 282 billion and stockholders  equity of  397

We note that the shares of this Zacks Rank  4  Sell  company have declined 6 4  in the past three months  almost in line with the  s fall of 7 8  
Fourth Quarter Earnings
This distributor of food and non food products reported fourth quarter adjusted earnings of 72 cents that came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 cents and also depicted an increase of 2 9  from earnings of 70 cents in the prior year quarter  Earnings were positively impacted by the gains arising from the sale of the company s stake holdings in Kicking Horse coffee  Moreover  increased adjusted operating income and EBITDA complimented the higher earnings recorded during the period 

Q4 Revenue and Margin Details
Net sales of  2 34 billion lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 37 billion  We note that sales have been lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 11 straight quarters  including the current one  However  net sales for the fourth quarter depicted a 5 7  growth from the year ago period  owing to acquisition integrated benefits from Gourmet Guru  Inc  and Haddon House Food Products 
Also  during the fourth quarter  the company experienced inflation of 13 basis points  bps   thereby breaking the chain of deflation experienced over the past few quarters 
Gross margin during the period expanded 15 bps to 15 8   Fuel surcharges and margin enhancement initiatives aided gross margin expansion  which was slightly offset by competitive pricing 
Further  adjusted operating income increased 1 3  to reach  64 4 million  Adjusted EBITDA also went up 3 5  from the prior year period to  86 5 million

Net sales of food services went up by 0 6   gaining from e commerce growth of 22 4   The channel sales  however  slowed down owing to rationalizing efforts incurred for the less profitable businesses 
Full Year Fiscal 2017 Results 
Adjusted earnings for the fiscal year 2017 amounted  2 57 per share that declined 0 8  from the prior year  However earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 54 per share 
Net sales for the fiscal year of  9 3 billion depicted a rise of 9 5  from last year  mainly due to gains from the acquisitions of Nor Cal Produce  Inc   Global Organic Specialty Source  Inc   Haddon House Food Products  Inc  and Gourmet Guru  Inc  Sales  however  lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  9 30 billion 
Other Financial Update 
During the fourth quater of fiscal 2017  the company gained approximately  6 1 million from the divestiture of its stake in Kicking Horse Coffee  Though the transaction was carried out in the third quarter  benefits pertaining to it were received in the fourth quarter 
United Natural ended fiscal 2017 with cash and cash equivalents of 15 4 million  Long term debt for the year amounted to 28 3 million 
Capital expenditures were approximately  56 1 million during the year  resulting in free cash flow of  224 7 million 
Fiscal 2018 Guidance
United Natural expects net sales for fiscal 2018 to be in the range of  9 6 billion to  9 8 billion  This depicts a rise of 3 8  to 5 8  over the net sales of fiscal 2017  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for net sales during fiscal 2018 is currently pegged at  9 7 billion  which falls within management s guidance 
Further  the company expects earnings for fiscal 2018 to be in the range of  2 67 to  2 77 per share  The current Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 64 is below this guided range  The company also expects a negative impact of 3 cents upon the projected earnings  due to the adoption of ASU  Accounting Standard Update  2016 09  which would lead to raising the tax rate 
Our Take 
While United Natural has been gaining from its strategic acquisitions  competitive pricing has been hindering its performance 
Moreover  although United Natural s sales have finally begun benefiting from inflation  its growth rate has been meager in the fourth quarter

113103,334618,STZ,Why You Shouldn t Tap Into Molson Coors  TAP  Right Now,opinion,"Despite of the harmful effects  alcohol stocks have been performing quite well of late  The rise in demand for flavored whisky  premium tequilas and spirits seems to be doing the trick for the industry  In fact  in the alcohol market  the spirits segment has been gaining momentum  accounting for about 36  of the total alcohol market 
However  Molson Coors Brewing Company   NYSE TAP   is one stock in the industry that has been in the red zone for quite some time now as can be seen from its dismal earnings and sales surprise history  Disappointing volumes  weak margins and significant currency headwinds amid difficult economy and competitive pressure have been the major deterrents 
Notably  Molson Coors is making efforts to bring the stock back on growth trajectory  The company is focusing on increasing its marketing for beers and targeting above premium brands to help grow its market share  Further  the company s recent agreements with Heineken and Hornell Brewing are in line with Molson Coors  current business expansion initiatives and are expected to enhance its portfolio  However  looking at the headwinds and the company s Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   it seems that these initiatives are yet to bear fruits 
If we analyze the share price performance of the company on a year to date basis  we note that the stock hasunderperformed both the  and the broader  sector in the said time frame  The stock has declined nearly 10  against the industry s gain of 22 3   Meanwhile  the sector  of which they are part of  has improved 7 3  

Let s now take a closer look at the challenges that the company is grappling with  which makes it a no no for investors 
Weak Earnings and Sales History
Molson Coors has a dismal track record of earnings  The company has reported negative earnings surprises in five of the trailing seven quarters  Sales have also lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in 10 out the last 14 quarters 
Molson Coors posted weaker than expected earnings in second quarter 2017  while revenues marginally beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate  While earnings increased 3 1  from the prior year figure driven by increased brand volume  higher net pricing  positive sales mix  cost savings and lower marketing spending  sales dipped 0 6  year over year due to a 0 2  fall in net sales per hectoliter  Currency also had a negative impact of  57 3 million on overall sales 
The company has also seen significant downward estimate revision following the lower than expected second quarter 2017 results  The Zacks Consensus Estimate has gone down 33 5  to  4 34 in 2017 and down 29 8  to  4 78 in 2018 in the past 60 days Molson Coors Brewing Company Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Continued Decline in Volumes
Molson Coors has been struggling with weak sales volume trends in the United States  Canada and Europe for the last few years  Though the acquisition of the Miller global brands  in October 2016  has boosted sales in Europe and international regions  volume continued to decline in Canada 
Among the core brands  while Miller Lite and Staropramen brands witnessed volume growth  Carling volume in Europe decreased by 2 6  during second quarter 2017 and Coors Light global brand volume decreased 2 2  due to lower brand volume in the United States and Canada  slightly offset by strong growth in Europe and International 
The volume declines in Canada are attributed to the overall weak industry performance along with the ongoing competitive pressure in Quebec and Ontario and a continued shift in consumer preference to value brands in the West  Molson Canadian volume in Canada also decreased 5 5  in the quarter due to overall weak industry conditions and competitive pressures in the West and Ontario 
Since 2001  the premium beer segment in Canada has been gradually losing volume to the above premium and value segments  Aging population  a stalled economy and strong competition from other alcohol beverages led to the decline  The termination of the Modelo brands agreement in Canada in February 2014 also resulted in volume decline  In the United States  the company suffered declines due to reduced labor participation rates and lower consumer confidence 
Though economic conditions improved slightly  competition from outside the beer category persisted  In Europe too  the company has been witnessing volume declines since 2013 due to a shift from the higher margin on premise channel to the lower margin off premise channel  The loss of the Modelo brands in the U K  in 2015 is also contributing to lower volumes 
Foreign Currency Headwinds
The company is also plagued by currency headwinds due to the recent weakening of many foreign currencies against the U S  dollar  Unfavorable foreign currency translations impacted sales by more than  180 million in 2016 and will continue to deter the company s profits in the near term

113107,334622,STZ,Will NIKE s  NKE  CDO Strategy Fuel Q1 Earnings Amid Hurdles ,opinion,NIKE  Inc    NYSE NKE   is slated to release first quarter fiscal 2018 results on Sep 26  The question lingering in investors  minds is whether this athletic goods behemoth will be able to post a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported  Notably  NIKE has delivered positive earnings surprises for 20 straight quarters   In the trailing four quarters  the company delivered an average positive surprise of 25   So  let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement What to Expect The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 48 cents  which is way below the year ago period figure of 73 cents  We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has remained nearly stable over the past 30 days  Additionally  analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of roughly  9 1 billion  up slightly by 0 2  from the year ago quarter Factors at PlayNIKE s progress on its strategic initiatives has been reflected in every quarter s results for over three fiscal years now  The company has been gaining from its robust growth and innovation efforts  which along with reduced expenses fueled the bottom line in the last quarter  The company is also benefiting from strong e commerce initiatives  Notably  the enhancement of digital platform has led NIKE to nearly double its revenue contributions from NIKE com and its apps in just two years  going over the  2 billion contribution mark in fiscal 2017  Incidentally  global Direct to Consumer businesses and growth at international locations largely augmented NIKE s top line in fourth quarter fiscal 2017 Nike  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise    Apart from this  management remains confident of growth drivers like efficient supply chain and enhanced sync between the digital and physical experiences  Moreover  the company is focused on Consumer Direct Offense   CDO   plan  which focuses on using digital methods for rapid innovation and product development  along with strengthening consumer relations by operating through core regions  This  in turn is backed by its  triple double  strategy which is aimed at doubling innovation  speed and direct connection with customers  All these factors reflect Nike s growth prospects However  NIKE has been battling soft sales in North America owing to lackluster product assortments and intensified competition  The company s wholesale business in the region has also been impacted due to increased focus on online sales  Moreover  the overall environment is expected to remain promotional in North America  which is likely to hurt results in this segment  Furthermore  adverse currency movements are expected to continue weighing upon NIKE s performance  as evident from its outlook  Evidently  the company anticipates reported revenues to be flat in first quarter fiscal 2018  with gross margin forecasted to contract 150 180 bps due to currency headwinds Together  currency woes and difficult trends in North America make us cautious about the company s overall performance  So  let s see if NIKE s robust strategies and e commerce strength can manage to offset the hurdles and keep its splendid surprise streak alive  While the company s shares have jumped 5 7  year to date  it has lagged the  s 13 8  growth What the Zacks Model Unveils Our proven

113130,334645,STZ,Will McCormick s  MKC  Buyout Gains Offset The Cost Woes ,opinion,McCormick   Company  Inc  s   NYSE MKC   strategic growth efforts which include acquisitions and innovation have been boosting its portfolio  Moreover  its cost saving initiatives has significantly aided improving profitability  Nevertheless  raw material cost inflation and weak sales in the U K region have raised concerns for sustaining the company s performance Let s now delve deeper into some of the factors that have been aiding the company s performance and hindering its growth     Acquisitions   Innovations Aiding Growth McCormick has been strategically increasing its presence through acquisitions in order to grow its spices and seasonings portfolio  It recently completed the acquisition of the food division of Reckitt Benckiser Group plc  a British consumer products company  The acquisition is expected to significantly boost the company s robust spices portfolio with iconic brands like Frank s RedHot and French s Mustard that hold top positions in their respective categories in the United States and Canada  The buyout will position McCormick as one of the leading companies in the U S  condiments category  In the past  the company has made several acquisitions including Italy based Enrico Giotti SpA and Australia based Botanical Food Company  both carried out in 2016   The buyouts have aided the company to expand its distribution network and increase brand investment McCormick has also been investing in innovation in order to develop healthy food products as consumers turn toward fresh food items  In this respect  the company has been partnering with government and trade agencies  It is also shaping up its portfolio with gluten free  non GMO and organic products to satisfy the evolving needs of consumers Cost Saving Initiatives The company s dedicated focus toward cost savings is quite evident from the Comprehensive Continuous Improvement  CCI  program  Cost savings through CCI and streamlining actions reached  109 million in 2016  up from  98 million in 2015  Further  it expects to deliver cost savings of at least  100 million in fiscal 2017 and savings of around  400 million by Nov 30  2019  McCormick uses its CCI savings to increase investments and productivity  thereby leading to higher sales and profits Headwinds Posing concerns McCormick has been suffering from higher input costs since past many quarters  Prices of raw materials such as vanilla  garlic  cinnamon  oregano and rice  as well as packaging costs have been steadily increasing  and thereby affecting McCormick s margins  For fiscal 2017  the company expects material cost inflation in mid single digits  Further  the company s sales in Europe  Middle East and Africa  EMEA  have remained sluggish of late due to difficult economic  political and competitive factors  Moreover  its business in the U K has been sluggish as large retailers reduce shelf space for food products to

quarterly dividend  amounting 66 cents per share as compared with the previous rate of 61 cents  The newly hiked dividend is payable on Oct 10  2017  to shareholders of record  on Sep 15 The company s current annualized rate of dividend is  2 64 per common share  compared with  2 44 previously  Since Philip Morris International s   NYSE PM   spin off in 2009  Altria has increased its dividend every year by 8  in 2016 and 8 7  in 2015  Notably  the company has raised its dividend 51 times in the last 48 years  It maintains a dividend payout ratio target of around 80  of its adjusted earnings per share  which is among the highest in its peer group Altria has been consistently returning value to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks  In the second quarter of 2017  the company paid almost  1 2 billion in dividends and nearly  2 4 billion in the first half of 2017  During the second quarter  Altria also repurchased 14 4 million shares under its existing share repurchase program

shareholders despite industry wide headwinds  The tobacco stocks have been primarily hurt by the declining use of tobacco since past many quarters  Strict anti smoking regulations by governments  globally  in the form of restrictions on packaging and high excise duties are also affecting the stock  Additionally  consumers  preference for e cigarettes or substitutes for cigarettes are largely affecting the cigarette volume  The recent FDA proposal to lower nicotine in cigarettes to non addictive or minimally addictive levels has also added to the company s woes Most recently on Jul 28  U S  Food and Drug Administration  FDA  has proposed to lower nicotine in cigarettes to non addictive or minimally addictive levels A look into Altria s price performance over the past six months  projects that the company s shares have decreased 14 7   wider than the  s decline of 5 2   The broader  sector depicted a growth of 3 6  in the said time frame Proactive Measures to Remain Afloat Despite unfavorable tax environment and declining cigarette volumes  Altria has been able to remain afloat and generate revenues with higher cigarette pricing  Though higher pricing might lead to possible decline in cigarette consumption  it is seen that smokers tend to absorb price increases owing to the addictive quality of cigarettes Additionally  Altria has promptly responded to the general shift among consumers toward low risk  smokeless tobacco products due to serious health hazards of smoking cigarettes  Altria offers several reduced risk tobacco products that helped it to maintain its market share  Altria collaborated with Okono A S and developed innovative  non combustible nicotine containing products for adult smokers  Further  Altria s marketing and technology agreement with Philip Morris  under which the latter markets its MarkTen e cigarettes internationally  is boosting the company s business prospects  Altria also distributes two of Philip Morris

113193,334708,STZ,Molson Coors  TAP  Prospects Bleak  Time To Sell ,opinion,"Molson Coors Brewing Company   NYSE TAP   has been in troubled waters for quite some time now as evident from its dismal earnings and sales surprise history  Lower volumes and significant currency headwinds amid difficult economy and competitive pressure have been the other major dampeners 
If we analyze the share price performance of the company over the last six months  we note that the stock has underperformed both the  and the broader  sector in the said time frame  The stock has declined 6 3  against the industry s gain of 10 4   Meanwhile  the sector  of which they are part of  has improved 7 3  

 
Let s now take a closer look at the challenges that the company is grappling with rendering it a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  
Weak Earnings and Sales Trend
Molson Coors does not have a good track record of earnings  The company has reported negative earnings surprises in five of the trailing seven quarters  Sales have also lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in 10 out the last 14 quarters 
Downward Estimate Revision
The company has also seen significant downward estimate revision following the lower than expected second quarter 2017 results  The Zacks Consensus Estimate is going down 21 8  to  4 35 in 2017 and down 20 2  to  4 77 in 2018 in the past seven days 
Continued Decline in Volumes
Molson Coors has been struggling with weak sales volume trends in U S   Canada and Europe for the last few years  Though the acquisition of the Miller global brands has boosted sales in Europe and international regions  volume continued to decline in Canada 
Among the core brands  while Miller Lite and Staropramen brands witnessed volume growth  Carling volume in Europe decreased by 2 6  during second quarter 2017 and Coors Light global brand volume decreased 2 2  due to lower brand volume in the U S  and Canada  slightly offset by strong growth in Europe and International  The declines in Canada are attributed to the overall weak industry performance along with the ongoing competitive pressure in Quebec and Ontario and a continued shift in consumer preference to value brands in the West  Molson Canadian volume in Canada also decreased 5 5  in the quarter due to overall weak industry conditions and competitive pressures in the West and Ontario 
Since 2001  the premium beer segment in Canada has been gradually losing volume to the above premium and value segments  Aging population  a stalled economy and strong competition from other alcohol beverages led to the decline  The termination of the Modelo brands agreement in Canada in Feb 2014 also resulted in volume decline  In the U S   the company suffered declines due to reduced labor participation rates and lower consumer confidence 
Though economic conditions improved slightly  competition from outside the beer category persisted  In Europe  the company witnessed volume declines since 2013  as volumes continued to shift from the higher margin on premise channel to the lower margin off premise channel  The loss of the Modelo brands in the U K  in 2015 is also contributing to lower volume 
Weak EBITDA Margins
CNBC had pointed weak EBITDA guidance during investors meeting in June  Per reports  the company now expects underlying EBITDA margins to grow 30 60 bps per year for the next three to four years  This is weaker than the company s previous expectation of 50 60 bps per year for the next three years  as announced during earnings conference 
Foreign Currency Headwinds
With a major portion of its revenues coming from outside the U S   the company s profits are being affected by currency headwinds due to the recent weakening of many foreign currencies against the U S  dollar  Unfavorable foreign currency translations impacted sales by more than  180 million in 2016 and will continue to negatively impact the company s profits in the near term Molson Coors Brewing Company Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Bottom Line
Molson Coors  management is leaving no stone unturned to bring the stock back on growth trajectory  The company is focusing on increasing its marketing for beers and targeting above premium brands to help grow its market share 
Further  the company s recent agreements with Heineken and Hornell Brewing are in line with Molson Coors  current business expansion initiatives and are expected to enhance its portfolio  However  whether these ongoing initiatives will be able to spark a turnaround in the company s performance is a wait and watch story 
Stocks to Consider
Investors interested in the same space may consider some better ranked stocks like Inter Parfums  Inc    NASDAQ IPAR    Nu Skin Enterprises  Inc    NYSE NUS   and Constellation Brands Inc    NYSE STZ    all are carrying a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  
Inter Parfums has an average positive earnings surprise of 15 6  over the last four quarters  It has a long term earnings growth rate of 12 3  
Nu Skin has an average positive earnings surprise of 10 8  over the last four quarters  It has a long term earnings growth rate of 8 7  
Constellation Brands has an average positive earnings surprise of 11 7  over the last four quarters  It has a long term earnings growth rate of 18 2  
Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars 
Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge

line topped estimates  Moreover  both earnings and sales improved year over year  While this marked the company s third straight earnings beat  sales returned to growth after three consecutive misses

nearly 14 6  in the after hours trading session on Jul 27  However  the shares of Boston Beer have declined 5 9  in the last three months  underperforming the  s growth of 4 5  Q2 HighlightsBoston Beer s second quarter earnings per share of  2 35 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 29 and improved 14 1  year over year  The outperformance stemmed from solid top line growth and gross margin expansion partly offset by rise in advertising  promotional and selling expenses  Moreover  the company s earnings included a tax benefit of 2 cents owing to the adoption of the new Accounting Standard  Employee Share Based Payment Accounting    ASU 2016 09   effective Jan 1  2017 Boston Beer Company  Inc   The  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    Net revenue rose 1 3  year over year to  247 9 million  Excluding excise taxes  revenue increased 1 3  year over year to  264 7 million  Revenues  both including and excluding excise taxes  surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  228 9 million  Core shipments remained flat at 1 1 million barrels  while depletions were down 3  In the second quarter  depletion volumes were primarily impacted by persistent decline in the Samuel Adams and Angry Orchard brands  as well as fall in Coney Island  This was partly mitigated by growth in Twisted Tea  and Truly Spiked   Sparkling brands  alongside slight gains from the shift in its second  quarter end timing  particularly related to the fourth of July holiday Though the company pointed to some improvement in the depletion trends from the beginning of the year  it stated that trends in the craft beer and cider categories continue to remain soft  Further  challenges related to a competitive retail backdrop persist  providing lot of drinking options Further  the company continues to project soft depletion trends for 2017  Evidently  depletions for the year to date period through the 29 weeks ended Jul 22  2017 are estimated to have declined nearly 7  from the comparable year ago period in 2016 Costs   MarginsGross profit increased 5 6  year over year to  134 million  while gross margin expanded 230 basis points to 54 1  in the quarter  The improvement in gross margin can be attributed to higher revenue per barrel that resulted from better pricing and package mix  along with lower brewery processing cost per barrel due to its cost saving initiatives Advertising  promotional and selling expenses rose 7 1  to  67 8 million due to higher salaries and benefits costs along with media spending  offset by fall in point of sale costs and lower freight to distributors  General and administrative expenses slumped 11  to  19 4 million due to a favorable stock based compensation  consulting and legal costs FinancialsAs of Jul 1  2017  Boston Beer had cash and cash equivalents of  71 7 million and stockholders  equity of  421 7 million In first half 2017  the company generated approximately  61 million of cash from operating activities  while it deployed nearly  16 7 million toward capital expenditure  primarily to be invested in breweries Growth PlanManagement remains committed to a three point growth plan  One  revival of the Samuel Adams and Angry Orchard brands through packaging  innovation  promotion and brand communication initiatives  Further  it targets maintaining momentum for the Twisted Tea brand Two  accelerated focus on cost savings and efficiency projects  with savings directed for further brand development  In this regard  the company has adjusted the organization to the new volume environment  while at the same time retained its capability to innovate and return to growth  Evidently  the results of these initiatives reflected in gross margin improvements and lower operating expenses in the second quarter  Further  this has led the company to increase spending on brands during the quarter  On the back of this early success  the company reiterated the previously revealed target of improving gross margin by one percentage point every year through 2019 Third  long term innovation  with current focus maintaining the leadership of Truly Spiked   Sparkling brand and ensuring it reaches full potential Moreover  Boston Beer remains focused on making investments to revive hard cider category and Angry Orchard brand  while maintaining category leadership  Though management is prepared for not so impressive bottom line results in the short term  it remains on track to boost long term profitability  Going forward  the company remains optimistic about the future of craft beer and cider category growth GuidanceFor 2017  the company narrowed its previously stated earnings per share guidance range based on an uncertain volume outlook  The company now estimates adjusted earnings per share  excluding the impact of ASU

the company affirmed that 2017 will include 52 weeks as against 53 weeks in 2016 Other assumptions for earnings include depletions and shipments changes of  7  to  1   The company anticipates revenues

the range of  20  30 million Effective tax rate for 2017 is anticipated to nearly 37   excluding the impact of ASU 2016 09  However  the company revised capital expenditure guidance for the year to

113238,334753,STZ,Pinnacle Foods Down 4  In A Month  What s Hurting The Stock ,opinion,"Pinnacle Foods Inc  s   NYSE PF   strong portfolio  robust acquisitions and efficient productivity remain its strengths  The stock has increased 2 7  in the past three months compared with the Zacks categorized  industry s decline of 4 2   However  the company s shares have been facing pressures lately 
We note that in the past month  shares of Pinnacle Foods have declined 4 6   Analysts believe that shunned merger speculations with Conagra Brands  Inc    NYSE CAG   may be one of the primary reasons behind the fall  We also observed that sluggish Specialty segment and Pickle business coupled with increased expenses have also impacted the company s performance  
Let s delve deeper and try to find out what s taking this Zacks Rank  4  Sell  company downhill 
Speculated End of Deal with Conagra
Talks of possible acquisition of Pinnacle Foods by Conagra Brands have come to a conclusion and it is believed that the two firms have no plans to join hands  If market sources are to be believed  the deal talks which began since May 31  2017  was shunned within a few days due to price disagreement between the parties 
However  the management of Pinnacle Foods has not provided any official statement on the supposed deal  The share price of Pinnacle Foods has fallen 3 7  approximately  since speculations of this merger to remain immaterialized began making rounds 
Specialty Segment and Pickle Business under Pressure
The company has witnessed sluggish net sales and adjusted EBIT for the Specialty segment since the last three quarters  despite solid growth in the Snacks business  Due to a highly competitive and bidding environment for the already low margin USDA stew business  the company continues to expect Specialty to remain challenged through 2017 

Pinnacle Foods witnessed sluggishness in its Pickle business due to continued category weakness and a heightened competitive environment over the past several months  The competition has increased in the form of pricing and innovation  which has put pressure on Vlasic pickles  Though innovation and in store support for the brand is rolling out in the second quarter 2017 and is expected to strengthen trends in the second half of the year  we believe the turnaround might take some time 
Higher Expenses 
Regular innovations and related introductory costs have been increasing the company s expenses  Higher expenses were also caused by the enhanced overhead structure of the Boulder business  Increased investment in consumer marketing and input cost inflation also adds to the expenses  
Other Headwinds
Consumer buying patterns are shifting for grocery products due to macroeconomic weakness  This has resulted in a decline in industry volumes   Severe increase in inflation is adversely impacting the company s profits 
Estimates Moving South
We note that estimates for the second quarter 2017 have declined in the past thirty days  although it remained stable for fiscal 2017   Moreover the company carries a  of  D   which indicates that the stock is not favorable at the moment

113266,334781,STZ,Estee Lauder Ahead Of Industry  What s Behind The Rally ,opinion,"Est e Lauder Companies Inc  s   NYSE EL   shares have been gaining momentum driven by brand strength  rising demand for beauty products and a strong presence in emerging markets  In the past six months  shares of this leading manufacturer and marketer of cosmetics have outperformed the Zacks categorized  industry  In the said time frame  shares reflected a growth of 21  compared with the industry s gain of 10 1  
So what are the factors contributing towards the growth of the company  Let s find out 
Factors Driving Performance  
As a global leader in prestige beauty products  Est e Lauder sells more than 25 brands in over 150 countries  A formidable portfolio of globally recognized flagship brands  which includes M A C and Jo Malone London  have provided a competitive advantage and bolsters the company s well established market position 
Estee Lauder has been able to enhance its portfolio  through several strategic acquisitions  The acquisitions of BECCA and Too Faced has strengthened its fastest growing portfolio and contributed approximately half the reported sales growth in the third quarter of fiscal 2017  The recent investment in DECIEM  a rapidly growing multi brand company  will also boost sales 

Further  the company ensures constant revenue growth through innovation  This has helped Est e Lauder to venture into manufacturing different types of skin care and makeup products  Moreover  the rising demand for beauty products  particularly in the luxury arena and makeup  has contributed toward robust growth  Looking forward  the company expects to remain focused on prestige cosmetics industry that has been growing steadily for many years and continues to grow faster than other household and personal care sectors 
The company has also been able to insulate itself from the macroeconomic headwinds in the matured markets by establishing a strong foothold in emerging ones  The Middle East  North Africa  sub Saharan Africa and Asia Pacific markets offer extensive untapped potential for the company  Moreover  increasing demand for make up is fuelling sales of products like M A C  and Tom Ford in China 
In addition to expansion  innovation and strategic acquisitions  Estee Lauder also banks upon aggressive marketing strategies through television and digital media  The company focuses on cost reduction and resource reallocation through initiatives such as the Leading Beauty Forward program 
Comparison with Industry 

Bottom Line 
Lower retail growth in Hong Kong  decline in spending by travelers and currency headwinds have posed a few concerns for Est e Lauder  of late  However  the company s focus on expanding in emerging markets  aggressive marketing strategies and focus on e commerce growth are expected to deliver sturdy growth  Better than expected earnings and sales in the third quarter fiscal 2017 have also enhanced investors confidence in this Zacks Rank  2  Buy  stock

113281,334796,STZ,Dean Foods  DF  Shares Slump On Higher Costs  Low Volumes,opinion,"Dean Foods Company   NYSE DF   has been in the red of late owing to a dismal earnings history  Shares of this Zacks Rank  4  Sell  stock fell 6 9  in the last three months  underperforming the Zacks categorized  sector s gain of 3 3  

 
Let s now look deeper into the factors that have been holding down the performance of this processor and distributor of milk  dairy products and other specialty food products in the U S 
Factors Impacting Performance
The company s dismal stock performance can be attributed to its lower than expected bottom line performance  Notably  the company has reported negative earnings surprise in three of the trailing four quarters  with an average of 8 4  
The first quarter fiscal 2017 marked the company s second consecutive earnings miss  Further  earnings dipped year over year mainly due to a rise in raw milk costs and lower milk volumes 
The company witnessed escalated raw milk costs in the first quarter of 2017 on a year over year and sequential basis  During the same quarter  raw milk costs rose about 6  from fourth quarter 2016 and jumped 18  from first quarter 2016 
The USDA data through February 2017 revealed that fluid milk volumes dipped 1 8  year over year  on an adjusted basis  Also  total volumes of 633 million gallons dipped 1 3  from 641 million gallons in the prior year quarter  The Class I Mover  a measure of raw milk expenses  increased year over year in the second quarter 
Apart from this  the company is facing severe competition from other dairy products suppliers due consolidations in the retail grocery industry 
Positive Side of the Coin
However  the company posted top line growth in the fiscal first quarter driven by contributions from Friendly s  which drove ice cream sales volumes  We applaud the company s efforts to expand its dairy business  evident from its recent deals with Good Karma and Organic Valley milk brands  Further  the company s focus on its cost productivity and growth plans bode well 
Bottom Line 
Although the company has been trying to improve performance and develop a competitive edge by expanding its product portfolio  which are yet to reflect in the company s performance  Hence  we would suggest investors to stay away from the stock at the moment

MarkTen XL   a variant on MarkTen launched by the company in 2016 has been encouraging in lead markets  At the end of 2016  MarkTen represented about 55  of the e vapor category volume in retail channels  including c stores 
Altria also signed an agreement with another tobacco maker Philip Morris International  Inc   NYSE PM  under which the latter markets Altria s MarkTen e cigarettes internationally and distributes two of Philip Morris  heated tobacco products in the U S  The joint venture has made excellent progress on branding and go to market strategies for non conventional cigarettes in the U S  market 
On Mar 31  Philip Morris has applied for pre market approval of its iQOS heated tobacco product with the U S  Food and Drug Administration  which will be sold by Altria in U S   if the FDA grants Philip Morris  request  Such collaboration is encouraging as it will help the participating companies maintain market share amid declining volume and growing awareness against tobacco products 
Despite such positive attributes  the company remains highly concerned regarding the declining demand for cigarettes due to the strict anti tobacco regulations and campaigns  Nevertheless  Altria has managed to remain consistent with its performance and generate revenues with higher cigarette pricing in the face of unfavorable tax environment and declining cigarette volumes  In fact  Altria raised its cigarette prices in March 2017 to offset the impact of increased state excise taxes in California

   Revenue and Margin Details
Net sales of  2 37 billion lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 42 billion and also came in below management s expectations  primarily due to overall soft retail sales  margin expansion initiatives and reduced inflation  We note that sales have been lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate for eleven straight quarters

United Natural continues to experience deflation pressures that went down 17 bps during the quarter  In terms of produce  deflation was approximately 2  as compared with the 1 3  inflation of the prior year period 
Adjusted operating income increased 2 9  to  68 9 million for the quarter   Adjusted EBITDA was  90 4 million that increased 6 3  from the prior year period

Also  United Natural announced an extension to their restructuring plan announced on Mar 8  whereby the company expects additional restructuring charges between  3  4 million for the fourth quarter fiscal 2017  During the third quarter  the company incurred restructuring charges of  3 9 million before taxes  The expenses are mainly related with severance and other employee separation costs driven by the recent integration and acquisition activities  These actions are expected to result in overall expense reductions in fiscal 2018 
Fiscal 2017 Guidance 
United Natural has revised its fiscal 2017 sales guidance in view of the third quarter s dismal performance  The company now expects net sales in the range of  9 29 billion to  9 34 billion  which is lower than the earlier projection of  9 38 billion to  9 46 billion 
Earnings for fiscal 2017 have been reiterated and are projected in the range of  2 49 to  2 54  The Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 54 is at the higher end of the guidance range 
Our Take
United Natural has been able to thrive in the industry on the back of acquisition related gains   The company has been striving hard to continue the positive integration of their acquisitions and implementing efficiency within their internal activities  Nevertheless  the company has been grappling with heightened competition coupled with no meaningful improvement in inflation

113345,334860,STZ,Go The Driehaus Way  Pick These 5 Momentum Stocks,opinion,Pioneer of momentum investing  Richard Driehaus was known for developing a  buy high and sell higher  strategy  Following the success of the strategy  Driehaus earned a place in Barron s All Century Team  Investors with a high risk appetite might think of using the Driehaus  Strategy to rake in healthy returns from momentum stocks The American Association of Individual Investors  AAII  proved that the strategy has the potential to offer high returns  AAII s portfolio  which was developed following the strategy  returned 13 5  and 18 1  in thefive  and 10  year timeframe  respectively  compared with  1 1  and 4 2  returns registered by the S P 500  Thus  investors with a high risk appetite might give   the Driehaus strategy a thought to boost returns A Brief Note on Driehaus  StrategyRegarding the strategy  Driehaus once said   I would much rather invest in a stock that s increasing in price and take the risk that it may begin to decline than invest in a stock that s already in a decline and try to guess when it will turn around   In line with his insight  AAII took into account the percentage 50 day moving average as one of the key criteria before designing a portfolio It is calculated by dividing the numerator  month end price minus 50 day moving average of month end price  by the 50 day moving average of the month end price  Another momentum indicator   positive relative strength   has also been included  A positive percentage 50 day moving average indicates that the stock is trading at a price higher than its 50 day moving average level  indicating an uptrend Moreover  AAII found that Driehaus primarily focused on strong earnings growth rates and impressive earnings projections

Go the Driehaus Way  Pick These 5 Momentum Stocks

	Pioneer of momentum investing  Richard Driehaus was known for developing a  buy high and sell higher  strategy  Following the success of the strategy  Driehaus earned a place in Barron s All Century Team  Investors with a high risk appetite might think of using the Driehaus  Strategy to rake in healthy returns from momentum stocks 

	The American Association of Individual Investors  AAII  proved that the strategy has the potential to offer high returns  AAII s portfolio  which was developed following the strategy  returned 13 5  and 18 1  in thefive  and 10  year timeframe  respectively  compared with  1 1  and 4 2  returns registered by the S P 500  Thus  investors with a high risk appetite might give   the Driehaus strategy a thought to boost returns 

A Brief Note on Driehaus  Strategy

	Regarding the strategy  Driehaus once said   I would much rather invest in a stock that s increasing in price and take the risk that it may begin to decline than invest in a stock that s already in a decline and try to guess when it will turn around   In line with his insight  AAII took into account the percentage 50 day moving average as one of the key criteria before designing a portfolio 

	It is calculated by dividing the numerator  month end price minus 50 day moving average of month end price  by the 50 day moving average of the month end price  Another momentum indicator   positive relative strength   has also been included  A positive percentage 50 day moving average indicates that the stock is trading at a price higher than its 50 day moving average level  indicating an uptrend 

	Moreover  AAII found that Driehaus primarily focused on strong earnings growth rates and impressive earnings projections to pick potential outperformers  Companies with a strong history of beating estimates are also given importance in this strategy  which was made to provide better returns over the long term 

Screening Parameters 

	In order to make the strategy more profitable  we have considered stocks that have a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and a momentum score of  A  or  B   Our research shows that stocks with a of  A  or  B  when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 offer the best upside potential

Constellation Brands   
Whether it s been a good day or a bad one  there s nothing better than a glass of wine at the end of the day  or in the middle of one   Better yet  how about a beer  Either way  Constellation Brands  STZ  has got you covered  It is the largest wine company in the world with brands such as Robert Mondavi  Clos du Bois  Arbor Mist and Blackstone  NYSE BX   among others  But STZ is also the third largest beer company in the U S  with brands like Corona and Modelo  and it is this business that has made the biggest impact of late  Beer sales were up 11  in the recently announced fiscal fourth quarter  and gained 17  for the full year  It s no wonder the CEO calls this business a  powerhouse for growth  
STZ has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 10 straight quarters  To put it an even more impressive way  it has only missed twice in the last 5 years  The past four quarters have amassed an average beat of nearly 7 7   Most recently  it announced earnings per share of  1 48 for its fiscal fourth quarter  which was more than 8  better than our expectations  Net sales climbed 5  to  1 63 billion  It has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales for eight straight quarters now  Results were helped by effective integration of recently acquired brands and  of course  customer demand for having a good time  The consistent focus on brand building is one of the main reasons why the company is encouraged for this fiscal year  while also being able to hike its dividend and initiate share buybacks 
Currently  seven analysts make up the Zacks Consensus Estimate for this fiscal year  ending February 2018   but there are still only six for next fiscal year  ending February 2019   Earnings estimates for this fiscal year are up 5 5  in the past 30 days to  7 99  and have risen 3  in that time for next year to  8 94  So at the moment  next fiscal year is expected to gain nearly 12  from this fiscal year  STZ expects beer sales to rise 9  to 11  this fiscal year  and issued a higher than expected guidance between  7 70 and  8  Shares are up more than 10  so far this year  which is ahead of the beverages alcohol industry at only 7

113352,334867,STZ,5 Low Beta Stocks For Investors Who Hate Market Volatility,opinion, An investment in knowledge pays the best interest      Benjamin Franklin The only thing that can fetch rewards from an investment is proper research and analysis  Hence  proper knowledge in the investment field is the key to success It is not like that  investing only in risky assets will bring more returns than the market  Many strategies can be built for investing in low risk portfolios that could end up with a lucrative outcome Since risky securities give below average returns when the market is walking on the bearish path  we think building up a portfolio of low beta stocks would be a better way if some other parameters are considered What is Beta Beta measures the volatility or risk of a particular asset in comparison to the market  In other words  beta measures the extent of a security s price movement relative to the market  In this article  we are considering the S P 500 as the market If a stock has beta of 1 then the price of the stock will move with the market  So the stock is more volatile than the market if its beta is more than 1  In the same way  the stock is not as volatile as the market if its beta is less than 1 For example  if the market offers a return of 20   a stock with beta of 3 will return 60   which is overwhelming  Similarly  when the market slips 20  the stock will sink 60   which is devastating Screening Criteria We have taken beta between 0 and 0 6 as our prime criterion for screening stocks that are less volatile than the market  But this should not be the only factor to be considered while selecting a winning strategy  We need to take into account other parameters that can add value to the portfolio Percentage Change in Price in the Last 4 Weeks greater than zero  This ensures that the stocks saw positive price movement over the last one month Average 20 Day Volume greater than 50 000  A substantial trading volume ensures that

5 Low Beta Stocks for Investors Who Hate Volatility 

 An investment in knowledge pays the best interest      Benjamin Franklin 

	The only thing that can fetch rewards from an investment is proper research and analysis  Hence  proper knowledge in the investment field is the key to success 

	It is not like that  investing only in risky assets will bring more returns than the market  Many strategies can be built for investing in low risk portfolios that could end up with a lucrative outcome 

	Since risky securities give below average returns when the market is walking on the bearish path  we think building up a portfolio of low beta stocks would be a better way if some other parameters are considered 

What is Beta 

	Beta measures the volatility or risk of a particular asset in comparison to the market  In other words  beta measures the extent of a security s price movement relative to the market  In this article  we are considering the S P 500 as the market 

	If a stock has beta of 1 then the price of the stock will move with the market  So the stock is more volatile than the market if its beta is more than 1  In the same way  the stock is not as volatile as the market if its beta is less than 1 

	For example  if the market offers a return of 20   a stock with beta of 3 will return 60   which is overwhelming  Similarly  when the market slips 20  the stock will sink 60   which is devastating 

Screening Criteria 

	We have taken beta between 0 and 0 6 as our prime criterion for screening stocks that are less volatile than the market  But this should not be the only factor to be considered while selecting a winning strategy  We need to take into account other parameters that can add value to the portfolio 

Percentage Change in Price in the Last 4 Weeks greater than zero   This ensures that the stocks saw positive price movement over the last one month 

Average 20 Day Volume greater than 50 000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stocks are easily tradable 

Price greater than or equal to  5  They must all be trading at a minimum of  5 or higher 

Zacks Rank equal to 1  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  stocks indicate that they will significantly outperform the broader U S  equity market over the next one to three months You can see   

	Here are five of the 13 stocks that qualified the screening 

	Headquartered in Victor  NY Constellation Brands Inc   NYSE       is the producer  importer and marketer of beer  wine  and spirits in the U S   Canada  Mexico  New Zealand and Italy  The company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the prior four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 7 65  

Ollie s Bargain Outlet Holdings Inc   NASDAQ         headquartered in Harrisburg  PA   primarily provides food products  housewares  books and stationery products  Over the last four quarters  the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings at an average rate of 16 80   Moreover  for the current year  we are expecting the company to witness year over year earnings growth of 17 9

Ellington Financial LLC   NYSE         based in Old Greenwich  CT   is mainly involved in the management of mortgage related assets that comprise residential mortgage backed securities  For the current year  we are expecting the company s earnings to increase by 30 8   On top of that  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter has been revised upward 

	Based in Freehold  N J Monmouth Real Estate Investment Corporation  NYSE        primarily leases assets to investment grade tenants on long term leases  Over the last four quarters  the company posted an average positive earnings surprise of 2 9   Moreover  for the current year  the company s earnings will likely increase 11 4

5 Top Ranked Stocks with Impressive Sales Growth to Bet On 

	With the Q1 reporting cycle in full swing  everyone must be looking forward to earnings performance  But one should keep in mind that solid sales growth is one of the major factors for the long term success of any company 

	Continuous growth in sales holds the key to survival of any business  For any company  sales growth not only provides an insight into product demand and pricing power  it is important for growth projections and strategic decision making 
	However  individual investors often fail to take into account sales growth as a dependable metric  This could be because of investors  preconceived notion that a company s stock price is generally sensitive to its earnings momentum 
	Nevertheless  it should be kept in mind that in case a company incurs a loss  albeit temporarily   it is valued on its revenues as top line growth  or decline  is usually an indicator of a company s future earnings performance 
	Also  in an improving economy  the absence of sales growth indicates that the company s market share is not increasing  So  some sustained sales growth is required to support the bottom line 
	Therefore  Price to Sales  P S  ratio can turn out to be a suitable metric for stock valuation  The importance of the metric lies in the fact that management has limited opportunities to manipulate revenues unlike earnings 
	However  a huge sales number does not necessarily convert into profits  Hence  it s more prudent to consider a company s cash position along with its sales number  Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow lend a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and investments Picking the Winners
	In order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance  we have selected 5 Year Historical Sales Growth     greater than X Industry and Cash Flow greater than  500 million as our main screening parameters 
	But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks  So  we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy Price to Sales  P S  Ratio less than X Industry  This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company s revenues  The lower the ratio  the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales   Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions  4 Weeks  greater than X Industry   Better than industry estimate revision has often been seen to trigger an increase in the stock price Operating Margin  Average Last 5 years  greater than 5   Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company s sales translates into profits  A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs  an optimal situation for the company Return on Equity  ROE  greater than 5   This metric will ensure that sales growth is being translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash  A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment 
	Here are five of the 13 stocks that qualified the screening Morgan Stanley  NYSE       provides various financial products and services  This New York based company currently has long term expected earnings per share  EPS  growth rate of 13 20  and carries a Zacks Rank  2 Constellation Brands  Inc   NYSE        based in Victor  NY  produces  imports  and markets beer  wine  and spirits  It has long term expected EPS growth rate of 17 80   The company sports a Zacks Rank  1  You can see   
	Headquartered in Auburn Hills  MI  BorgWarner Inc   NYSE        provides solutions for combustion  hybrid  and electric vehicles worldwide  The company currently has a long term expected EPS growth rate of 8 60  and a Zacks Rank  2 Western Digital Corporation  NASDAQ        based in Irvine  CA  develops  manufactures  and sells data storage devices and solutions  The company has a long term expected EPS growth rate of 12 10  and sports a Zacks Rank  1 AMETEK  Inc   NYSE       manufactures electronic instruments and electromechanical devices  This Berwyn  PA based company has a long term expected EPS growth rate of 11  and carries a Zacks Rank  2

113362,334877,STZ,Boston Beer  SAM  Beats On Q1 Earnings  2017 View Intact,opinion,Boston Beer Co  Inc    NYSE SAM   reported robust first quarter 2017 earnings  wherein the bottom line topped estimates  However  both earnings and sales declined year over year  Further  the company reiterated earnings forecast for 2017 Following the unimpressive results  the stock fell nearly 0 3  in the after hours trading session on Apr 26  Overall  the shares of Boston Beer have declined 16 6  year to date  underperforming the Zacks categorized  industry s growth of 10  Q4 HighlightsBoston Beer s first quarter earnings per share of 45 cents surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 26 cents but declined 15 1  year over year  The year over year decline stemmed from lower revenues and gross margins that were partly mitigated by fall in operating expenses and a tax benefit from the adoption of the new Accounting Standard  Employee Share Based Payment Accounting    ASU 2016 09   Total revenue dipped 14 4  year over year to  161 7 million  while excluding excise taxes net revenue increased 14 7  year over year to  172 4 million  The Zacks Consensus Estimate was  169 7 million  The fall in the top line resulted from lower shipments offset by price increases  Core shipments declined 15  to 707 thousand barrels  while depletions were down 14  In the first quarter  depletion volumes were primarily influenced by the persistent decline in the Samuel Adams and Angry Orchard brands  partly negated by growth in Twisted Tea  and Truly Spiked   Sparkling brands The challenging depletion trends continued into the first quarter due to the weakness in Samuel Adams brand  particularly the seasonal beers  alongside a soft craft beer category that remains competitive  The competition in the craft beer segment has intensified as new craft brewers are entering the market and existing ones are expanding distribution and tapping capacities  providing more options for drinkers Further  the company notes that the soft depletion trends in 2017  Evidently  depletions through the 15 weeks ended Apr 15  2017 have fallen nearly 13  from the comparable year ago period in 2016 Costs   MarginsGross profit fell 16 6  year over year to  76 3 million while gross margin shriveled 130 basis points to 47 2  in the quarter  The contraction can be attributed to adverse product mix and unfavorable fixed costs absorption  partially neutralized by improved prices and cost saving initiatives at the breweries Advertising  promotional and selling expenses dropped 9 1  to  53 8 million due to lower freight to distributors and fall in point of sale costs  General and administrative expenses slumped 11 4  to  18 6 million owing to a favorable stock based compensation  decreases in salaries and benefits  and consulting costs FinancialsAs of Mar 31  2017  Boston Beer had cash and cash equivalents of  59 9 million and stockholders  equity of  435 4 million In the first quarter  the company used approximately  5 million of cash in operating activities  while it deployed nearly  7 million toward capital expenditure  primarily to be invested in breweries Growth PlanManagement remains committed to a three point growth plan  One  revival of the Samuel Adams and Angry Orchard brands through packaging  innovation  promotion and brand communication initiatives  Two  accelerated focus on cost savings and efficiency projects  with savings directed for further brand development  Third  long term innovation  with current focus maintaining the leadership of Truly Spiked   Sparkling brand and ensuring it reaches full potential Moreover  Boston Beer remains focused on making investments to revive hard cider category and Angry Orchard brand  while maintaining category leadership  Though management is prepared for not so impressive bottom line results in the short term  it remains on track to boost long term profitability  Going forward  the company remains optimistic about the future of craft beer and cider category growth GuidanceFor 2017  the company reiterated the earnings per share forecast of  4 20  6 20  based on an uncertain volume outlook  However  the company stated that the actual results may deviate significantly from current projections  Moreover  the company affirmed that 2017 will include 52 weeks as against 53 weeks in 2016 Other assumptions for earnings include depletions and shipments changes of  7  to  1   The company continues to anticipate price increases of 1 2   Gross margin is expected to range from 51 52  due to increased cost savings  Investment in advertising  promotional and selling expenses are envisioned to increase in the range of  20  30 million Effective tax rate for 2017 is anticipated to nearly 37   excluding the impact of ASU 2016 09  which has been effective for the company from Jan 1  2017  However  the company lowered capital expenditure guidance for the year to  30  50 million  which will be directed toward investment in breweries  Earlier  the company had anticipated capital spending of  40  60 million Boston Beer Company  Inc   The  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    Zacks RankBoston

113371,334886,STZ,Company Notes Digest 1 13 16,opinion,"Earnings season really kicks off next week  but there were a few companies that reported this week that had interesting things to say  We also reached back into last week for some calls that we missed while we were on hiatus 
Overall optimism about the economy is running high  Corporations and the stock market are especially excited about the prospect of lower corporate taxes  However  not as many people are focused on the other side of tax reform  House Republicans have proposed a  border adjustment  tax as part of their tax plan  The border adjustment tax would prevent companies from deducting foreign COGS from their taxes  If it passes it could be a major paradigm shift for the current structure of the economy and redesign the global supply chain  However  it could take some time before tax reform is addressed  Obamacare is apparently up first 
The Macro Outlook 
Companies are excited about tax reform
 I could spend all day on tax reform  Maybe I ll hit two of the things that obviously we find very  very positive in terms of some the items being proposed now the lowering of the corporate tax rate would be a good thing And then the other one is obviously what they re talking about relative to overseas earnings and repatriation For us  this is potentially a really big positive It gives us huge capital firepower as a corporation for all of the things that we talked about  to return capital to shareholders  to do strategic business development  to invest in our business  It s a huge potential positive for us    CFO Frank D Amelio  Pharma 
All things equal  lower taxes mean higher valuations
 I hope everyone walks away and has the same concept that we do that lower taxes are definitely a good thing in relation to our company and the valuation of our company  The base concept that a lower tax rates drive higher future net income and enhance cash flows is a very solid concept and should lead to an increase in value     CEO Jeff Mezger  Homebuilder 
But there are going to be other taxes too
 You want to move your plant and you think  as an example  you re going to build that plant in Mexico and you re going to make your air conditioners or your cars or whatever you re making  and you re going to sell it through what will be a very  very strong border   not a weak border like it is   we don t even have a border  It s an open sieve  But you re going to sell through a very strong border   not going to happen  You re going to pay a very large border tax     Elect Donald Trump  Government 
Republicans have already proposed a  border adjustment  tax
 One specific aspect of a proposed Republican tax reform plan called border adjustability could potentially disallow a deduction for foreign sourced COGS or cost of goods sold we are told that other companies that should be concerned about this are just waking up to the whole matter    CEO Robert Sands  Beverage 
This would be a major change
 this sort of tax reform really isn t about just setting up back office accounting departments to manage the new tax code  This kind of tax reform would require a time horizon that would allow companies to change their entire supply chain     CFO David Klein  Beverage 
A huge percentage of many companies  COGS are foreign sourced
 right now our U S  based component of our beer COGS  inclusive of freight  is about 40   I mean 60  of the COGS is from Mexico    Constellation Brands CEO Robert Sands  Beverage 
 about 12  to 15  of our cost of goods sold comes directly from outside the U S  And we believe that U S  purchases that are actually foreign sourced it s roughly about 40     MSC Industrial CFO Rustom Jilla  Industrial Distributor 
You could turn the whole supply chain on its head
 Some of the things being talked about are pretty exciting in terms of the combination of tax and incentives for exports  So you could just turn the whole supply chain around and it could be a big win for some companies that have experienced in international trade     CEO Bill Furman  Railcars 
Ultimately it s too early to say what the tax system will look like
 In any case we will not have a new tax system tomorrow morning  it will take months and we will have time to see how this will shape over time now it s too early to distract how people   to do things  which should probably will never happen before the end  the mixture will be completely different     CEO Stefano Pessina  Pharmacy 
Obamacare is probably going to be prioritized over tax reform anyways
 I mean it s probably a year off at best We can only tell you what our legislators have been telling us  right  But the first thing that s going to happen in Congress  which you are seeing right now is Obamacare So Congress has a lot on its plate right now  And to work through all of the details and get  tax  legislation like that passed  well  Congress is telling us it s going to be a while in any event  And it is clear cut and again this is literally what we have been told by the leaders that Obamacare is the first thing on their plate And that s going to take a while     CEO Robert Sands  Beverage 
Meanwhile the industrial economy continues to stabilize
 the environment is showing potential signs of stabilizing  We ve also seen increased optimism from our customers over the past couple of months    CEO Erik Gershwind  Industrial Distributor 
 I think since the election  there is a lot more activity in positioning by major customers who might have been on the sidelines    CEO Bill Furman  Railcars 
The improvement is broad based and a long time coming
 It has been at least three years since we ve seen anything resembling this This stabilization has been pretty broad machine and equipment folks  primary metals  metal fabrication  All of those are seeing an improvement over the last couple of months  I think some of that is driven by oil and gas    CEO Erik Gershwind  Industrial Distributor 
Trump wants to create jobs
 We re going to create jobs  I said that I will be the greatest jobs producer that God ever created  And I mean that  I really   I m going to work very hard on that  We need certain amounts of other things  including a little bit of luck  but I think we re going to do a real job  And I m very proud of what we ve done    Elect Donald Trump  Government 
But labor markets have tightened
 One of the major issues in America will be the labor pool  If we create more jobs in America where will the labor come from  because many factories in America today are having trouble filling slots for workers    CEO Bill Furman  Railcars 
Tight labor markets are a precursor to inflation
 The industry continues to face cost pressures due to a shortage of labor within a subcontractor base  For 2016  our cost to build increased about 4 8  versus the prior year  roughly  5 000 per house  And we were able to cover most of these cost increases with higher prices    CEO Jeff Mezger  Homebuilder 
International 
Rex Tillerson sees China as sometimes a friend  sometimes and adversary
 China s economic and trade practices haven t always followed commitments to global agreements  It steals our intellectual property and is aggressive and expansionist in the digital realm  China has proven a willingness to act with abandon in the pursuit of its own goals which at times put it in conflict with American interests but we need to see the positive dimensions in our relationship with China as well  The economic well being of the two nations is deeply intertwined We should not let disagreements over other issues exclude areas for productive partnership    Nominee Rex Tillerson  Government 
British consumers are feeling fine about themselves  but down about the economy
 The consumer Brexit I think I ve said over the last quarter has been sort of fairly stable at the top level  It s bubbling around  consumers have actually felt quite good about themselves  But what I think is interesting  I think GfK highlighted this  is that what happened during the course of November and December was consumer confidence in the forward looking economy came down substantially  And I think that there is this discrepancy in how they feel about themselves versus the economy and we re not sure how that s going to mature  but you will expect that much to mature over the next quarter     CEO Steve Rowe  UK Retail 
Financials 
Higher interest rates have not affected real estate markets yet
 Rates did pick up in November  they ve kind of paused right now from that initial 50 basis point  And I heard some anecdotes about buyers moving to lock quickly that hadn t locked  I ve heard one story of a buyer who purchased now because of concerns that rates would go up  But in terms of our overall backlog we really haven t seen or heard anything yet on the rates having an impact yet     CEO Jeff Mezger  Homebuilder 
Consumer 
E commerce customers tend to be more loyal
 Yes  our experience so far with our e commerce customers is that they buy more  they have bigger baskets and they shop more often and they also skew higher on our private label assortment that it really goes to the loyalty of that shopper    CFO CEO  Grocery Store 
Technology 
Monsanto  NYSE MON  hopes to have gene edited  CRISPR  products by the middle of the next decade
 So  I think first of all as you recognize there is a variety of gene editing tools  There is protein base  There is nucleic acid base  And just in the last few weeks  there has been a couple of publications on two brand new gene editing systems that have been discovered  In any case  what these tools allow you to do is to go in and precisely change basically any base pair or any gene in the crop  And so there are very powerful tool for making precise changes I think they will allow us to further accelerate that rate of gain we are now fully utilizing these tools and certainly by the beginning or middle of the next decade we will see these gene editing products work their way into the marketplace  Really an exciting technology   CTO Robb Fraley  Agriculture 
Healthcare 
Trump singled out the Pharma industry in his press conference
 We ve got to get our drug industry back  Our drug industry has been disastrous  They re leaving left and right  They supply our drugs  but they don t make them here  to a large extent  And the other thing we have to do is create new bidding procedures for the drug industry because they re getting away with murder  Pharma  pharma has a lot of lobbies and a lot of lobbyists and a lot of power and there s very little bidding on drugs  We re the largest buyer of drugs in the world and yet we don t bid properly and we re going to start bidding and we re going to save billions of dollars over a period of time    Elect Donald Trump  Government 
But there s no need to panic
 probably the outcome will be quite rational and at that time we will be able to organize ourselves and prepare our business to respond to the new environment  We don t have to be taken by panic  just because the rules  mainly rules   the rules are changed  We have to wait for the changes and after rationally we will decide how to react without panicking     CEO Stefano Pessina  Pharmacy 
Pfizer s CFO argues that our drug spending isn t that out of step with other countries
  we don t anticipate any major changes in how we do drug pricing if you look at healthcare as a percentage of GDP  in the U S  it s about 17   Of that 17   about 2  is prescription drugs  If you compare that to the OECD countries  healthcare as a percentage of their GDP is about 6  to 7   1 5  of that is prescription drugs  There is not some big disconnect or big difference between what we spend on prescription drugs as a percentage of GDP and what the OECD countries do    CFO Frank D Amelio  Pharma

GM expects auto sales to plateau here
 we expect to see another strong year in 2017 from a US industry perspective  We had another record year in 2016  We think we are going to plateau at these kinds of strong levels  I think the fundamental drivers of what s been driving the industry may change a little bit from a kind of credit driven tailwind into more of economic growth GDP type growth tailwind over the next number of years  Is there upside to the industry  Perhaps   CFO Chuck Stevens  Automobiles ",2017-01-13,Scott Krisiloff,https://www.investing.com/analysis/company-notes-digest-1.13.16-200172323,200172323

Handicapping Q1 Earnings Season

	The Q1 earnings season has gotten underway with earnings reports from 17 S P 500 members already out  All of these initial Q1 earnings reports are from companies that have their fiscal quarters ending in February  which form part of our Q1 earnings tally  The results thus far are tracking better than what we have been seeing from this same group of 17 index members  but it s premature to draw any firm conclusions from the unrepresentative sample at this stage 

	This Week s Key Reports include 

Acuity Brands  NYSE         Acuity Brands  the maker and distributor of lighting fixtures  reports results before the market s open on Tuesday  April 4th  with the company expected to earn  1 70 per share on  825 million in revenues  Acuity shares have struggled lately  with the stock losing ground following each of the last two quarterly earnings releases  Estimates have been coming down in the run up the Q1 earnings release  with the current  1 70 per share estimate down from  1 99 per share three months ago  The stock is down  11 4  in the year to date period  underperforming the Zacks Construction sector  up  7 8   and the S P 500 index  up  5 7   

Monsanto  NYSE         Monsanto reports results before the market s open on Wednesday  April 5th  with company expected to earn  2 76 per share on  4 82 billion in revenues  up  14 1  and  6 3  from the year earlier period  respectively  The stock has been a strong performer lately  up  8  this year on a steadily improving earnings outlook  outperforming the Zacks Basic Materials sector  up  7 1   and the S P 500 Index   5 7   in the same time period  The stock was up following positive surprises in each of the last three quarters  The revisions trend has been positive  with the current  2 76 per share EPS estimate for Q1 up  10 8  over the last three months 

Constellation Brands   NYSE         Spirits maker Constellation Brands reports results on Thursday  April 6th  The company is expected to earn  1 37 per share on  1 59 billion in revenues  up  14 9  and  2 8  from the year earlier period  respectively  The stock was down following the last earnings release when it beat on the top  and bottom lines  but guided lower  Year to date  the stock is up  6 1  vs   7  gain for the Zacks Consumer Staples sector 

	Other notable reports this week include Walgreens Boots  NASDAQ       on Wednesday and CarMax  NYSE        on Thursday 

Expectations for Q1

	Total Q1 earnings are expected to be up  6 5  from the same period last year on  6 4  higher revenues  This would follow  7 4  earnings growth in 2016 Q4 on  4 7   the highest growth pace in all most two years 

	Estimates for Q1 have come down as the quarter has unfolded  with the current  6 5  growth down from  10 4  at the end of December 

	Please note that while Q1 estimates have followed well traversed path that we have been seeing consistently over the last few years  the magnitude of negative revisions compares favorably to other periods  particularly in the first half of last year and all of 2015  In other words  Q1 estimates have come down  but they haven t come down by as much 

	Please note that the Q1 earnings season would follow the strong showing on the earnings front in the preceding reporting cycle  Not only did 2016 Q4 growth reach the highest in two years  but total earnings for the quarter also reached a new quarterly record  The strong Q4 performance came after the first positive earnings growth in 2016 Q3  having declined in each of the preceding 5 quarters 

Expectations Beyond Q1

	Please note that the earnings backdrop has not changed in any meaningful way since the November elections  notwithstanding the market s strong gains since then  The only exception to this comment is the Finance sector whose earnings outlook has improved as a result of the uptrend in interest rates since November 8th  It is reasonable to expect that earnings estimates will move favorably once the new administration s growth friendly policies get enacted  For now  however  estimates are following the long established trend of coming down

113392,334907,STZ,Constellation Brands Expands Further  Buys Mexican Brewery,opinion,In line with its strategy of expanding operations aimed at achieving business growth  Constellation Brands Inc    NYSE STZ   recently agreed to buy the Obregon Brewery from Grupo Modelo  a subsidiary of Anheuser Busch InBev SA NV   NYSE BUD    Valued at  600 million  the news of the buyout did not significantly impact the company s stock price CONSTELLATN BRD Price   The Obregon Brewery  situated on Mexico s west coast in the state of Sonora  is expected to generate nearly four million hectoliters of production capacity on deal closure  The acquisition will enable Constellation Brands to capture immediate functional brewery capacity that will help serve its high end Mexican beer portfolio  alongside providing it with the flexibility for future innovation strategies  The brewery will mainly serve Constellation s largest beer markets in western U S In this regard  Constellation Brands submitted a proposal to the U S Department of Justice  DOJ  earlier this week  Additionally  the acquisition is subject to approvals from the U S  DOJ and Mexican regulators  along with the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions Apart from expanding its Mexican beer portfolio  the world s largest wine company will assume complete control of the Obregon brewery with this deal  relieving itself from the existing supply agreement inked with Grupo Modelo in 2013  Per the agreement  Constellation Brands obtained the U S  distribution rights for a portfolio of Grupo Modelo s Corona brand  as well as several Mexican beer brands  AB InBev had facilitated this agreement in order to obtain regulatory approvals for acquiring Grupo Modelo Earlier  the company announced plans to build a new brewery at Mexicali in Mexico and further expand the capacity of its Nava brewery to support the future growth of its Mexican beer business  The Obregon brewery buyout is likely to support ongoing improvement at the Nava brewery and the buildout of the Mexicali brewery  while keeping the company s targeted long term investments in Mexico intact  Therefore  the company has shifted some of its spending outlays from the Mexicali brewery to the Obregon brewery  This is likely to result in an increase in the company s free cash flow estimate for fiscal 2017 to  575  675 million At the Mexicali brewery  the company plans to initially expand production capacity by 10 million hectoliters with the provision to later expand its capacity to 20 million hectoliters  The buildout of 10 million hectoliters at Mexicali is expected to be carried out in a phased manner with the first five million hectoliters of expanded capacity likely to be operational by Dec 2019  while the remaining will be planned in line with future growth targets Following the Obregon acquisition  the company has trimmed its Capex for Mexicali Brewery Build to approximately  1 4 billion  including  125 million for fiscal 2016 and  225  275 million for fiscal 2017  Earlier  the company had planned to spend about  1 5 billion for the 10 million hectoliters expansion At the Nava brewery  the company intends to expand capacity to 27 5 million hectoliters from the existing 25 million hectoliters  Expected to be completed by early calendar year 2018  the project calls for total capital spends of about  2 5 billion  including about  650 million for fiscal 2016 and  550  600 million for fiscal 2017 We believe that the Obregon brewery acquisition will help Constellation Brands to grab various growth opportunities in the U S  beer market  alongside providing cushion to its expansion and innovation plans Zacks RankCurrently  Constellation Brands has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   Other favorably ranked stocks in the beverages alcohol industry include Craft Brew Alliance Inc    NASDAQ BREW   and Molson Coors Brewing Company   NYSE TAP    also carrying a Zacks Rank  2  You can see  Craft Brew Alliance  with a long term earnings growth rate of 25   has surged nearly 80 4  year to date Molson Coors  with a long term earnings growth rate of 6   has jumped nearly 18 6  in the past 12 months Confidential from ZacksBeyond this Analyst Blog  would you like to see Zacks  best recommendations that are not available to the public  Our Executive VP  Steve Reitmeister  knows when key trades are about to be triggered and which of our experts has the hottest hand ,2016-11-02,Zacks Investment Research,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/constellation-brands-expands-further,-buys-mexican-brewery-200162571",200162571

113394,334909,STZ,Donald Trump Wins U S  Election,opinion,"Donald Trump  the first U S  nominee in modern history to have never held elected office  has shocked the world by winning the office of the Presidency  When results in the later states began to hit the tape last night  Dow futures sank deeply  By the time the announcement was made that Trump had won  the Dow was down a whopping 800 points 
It has since rebounded to only semi disastrous levels   266 points  The S P 500 is down 34 points and the Nasdaq down  100  Digging deeper than the overall indices  we are seeing Mexico related shares   Trump has been emphatic on the campaign trail about building a war on the Mexican border  and making the Mexicans pay for it    such as the iShares MSCI Mexico ETF  and Mexican been distributor Constellation Brands  NYSE STZ   tumble precipitously in the pre market  The Mexican peso is now trading at all time lows 
European stocks slid following the election results  as did the Japanese Nikkei market  which fell 5 4   Obamacare centric healthcare organizations like Tenet Healthcare  NYSE THC    down 31   and HCA Holdings   down 14 7   are faring even worse  Canadian Solar is  9  
On the other hand  we are seeing a boost to things like Gold futures   2 5   and coal focused energy firms like Consol Energy    8 4   We see a spike in bond yields  the U S  10 year has bounced up to 1 95  though still in historically low territory 
As we ve discussed in this column and elsewhere in recent weeks  the stock market prefers gridlock  Slow advancement in changes to policies   where there is change at all   helps the market digest what s happening easier in real time  and the best way for that to happen is for the Executive branch  White House  under the control of one party and Congress under control of the other  This election throws all that out the window   the GOP now holds all three  the main question looks to be how much Trump is interested in keeping with what his party wants 
Much will ride on the deals Mr Trump has insisted he will be able to make on behalf of the country  Whether or not the Trans Pacific Partnership  TPP  will be torn to shreds and replaced with something else   and whether or not our main trading partners  the Chinese  will go along with it   remain to be seen  Trump s lack of a voting record on geopolitical issues like the Middle East are also big question marks going forward for sectors like the Defense industry 
Finally  will Trump s stunning   nay   yuge    upset have any affect on the Federal Reserve  Meaning  more than whether the Fed will decide to raise interest rates a quarter percent next month  but even whether the institution deserves to exist  Perhaps Janet Yellen will offer her resignation in the wake of Trump s victory  Or  maybe more fitting  Trump will sit her down in his office  cameras rolling  and utter his well known trademark phrase   You re fired  ",2016-11-08,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/donald-trump-wins-u.s.-election-200163685,200163685

113500,335015,STZ,You Want This Stock In Your Portfolio,opinion,"Constellation Brands  NYSE STZ  has done nothing but go up  The chart below shows the last 3 years of price action on a weekly timeframe  Yes it has had some periods where it went up fast and others when it consolidated    and even other periods when it has pulled back  But in general  the price has moved from the lower left to the upper right portion of the chart 

This is the type of stock you want to have in your portfolio  You could go out and buy it and sit back and watch  But I have noticed that the stock does go through retrenchments that might give a better entry point  The chart shows that the price has pulled back to the rising 50 week SMA a few times when it has then bounced and started higher  It may or may not do that again  There is a potential catalyst for a move when it reports earnings on October 5 
To take advantage of this you can use an options strategy known as a 1 2 Put Spread  In this trade you buy a Put and then sell two of a lower strike Put  For Constellation Brands look at the October 160 155 150 1 2 Put Spread  This is buying the October 160 Put for about  3 50 and then selling both the October 155 Put for  2 and the October 150 Put for  1 15  The total cost is 35 cents 
This trade would participate in any pullback to 155 and then give an entry to the stock should it fall under 150  but with a basis of 145  Would you like to own Constellation Brands at  145 ",2016-09-12,Gregory W.

113502,335017,STZ,Molson Coors Closer To Miller Takeover  Megabrew On Track ,opinion,"Shares of  Molson Coors Brewing Company   NYSE TAP   gained almost 2  on Sep 28  2016  driven by the news that shareholders of London based SABMiller  LON SAB  PLC voted in favor of its  103 billion merger with Anheuser Busch InBev   NYSE BUD   
This brings Molson Coors a step closer to the takeover of the remaining 58  stake in MillerCoors  the joint venture formed between SABMiller and Molson Coors  Molson Coors already owns 42  of MillerCoors  The acquisition deal  announced in Nov 2015  came as a requirement for securing regulatory approval for big beer deal between AB InBev   SABMiller  MOLSON COORS B Price
 

   The Big Beer Deal 
Anheuser Busch reached a deal to acquire London based SABMiller in Oct 2015  Per the deal  AB InBev is offering common SABMiller shareholders  67 59 per share  while SABMiller s two biggest investors  Altria Group  Inc    NYSE MO   and the Santo Domingo family from Columbia will be offered cash and shares alternative worth about  60 per share 
AB InBev agreed to divest SABMiller s 58  stake in MillerCoors to Molson Coors  in order to satisfy the U S  regulators 
Besides purchasing SABMiller s 58  stake in MillerCoors  Molson Coors plans to buy the Miller brand portfolio globally and retain the rights to all the brands currently in the MillerCoors portfolio for the U S  market  including Redd s and import brands such as Peroni and Pilsner Urquell  The deal is valued at  12 billion and will be financed through a combination of cash on hand and proceeds from issuances of new debt and equity 
Molson Coors  purchase of SABMiller s stake would allow it to take strategic control of its operations in its biggest market  Molson Coors would also be in a position to gain significant synergies  which would allow the company to cut costs quickly  As the U S  beer market grows slowly  lower costs will help Molson Coors to increase its profits in the coming years 
However  Molson Coors  acquisition of the remaining Millers Coors is conditioned upon the closing of AB InBev s  107 billion takeover of SABMiller 
The mega merger  expected to close in Oct 2016  has received shareholder approval  but is yet to get a final approval by a court in U K 
Molson Coors currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold

113536,335051,STZ,Boston Beer  SAM  Beats On Q2 Earnings  Curtails 2016 View,opinion,"Boston Beer Co  Inc    NYSE SAM   posted better than expected earnings for second quarter 2016  while sales were in line with estimates  However  both top and bottom lines fell year over year  largely affected by lower shipments and depletion trends  along with higher costs and intense competition from other craft brewers  Based on the year to date trends and weak results  the company lowered its outlook for 2016 Q2 HighlightsBoston Beer s second quarter earnings per share of  2 06 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 97  However  earnings fell 5 5  year over year  mainly on account of a revenue decline  elevated general and administrative costs  and soft gross margin partly offset by lower advertising  promotional and selling expenses Net revenue was down 3  year over year to  244 8 million and was almost in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  244 million  The decline in the top line resulted from a 4  drop in core shipments to 1 1 million barrels  along with a 5  fall in depletions  which was consistent with the first quarter trend While the overall beer and craft categories remain strong  the soft depletion trend at Boston Beer is due to the continued weakness at the Samuel Adams brand  which is losing share to the rising competition in craft beer and the shift of consumers  interest toward trying new styles  Additionally  declines at the Angry Orchard and Traveler brands contributed to the fall in depletions  partially offset by growth at the Twisted Tea  Coney Island and Truly Spiked   Sparkling brands Though the company has seen some improvement in the depletion trends since mid June  it is unsure if these trends will sustain  For the rest of 2016  it expects to witness more favorable hard cider comparisons and positive impact from Truly Spiked   Sparkling  However  the fate of the broader hard cider and craft beer categories as well as the company s new brand launches remains unpredictable Costs   MarginsGross profit fell 3 8  year over year to  126 9 million while gross margin shriveled 220 basis points to 51 8  in the quarter  The contraction can be attributed to unfavorable product mix coupled with higher brewery processing expenses per barrel  partly offset by improved prices Advertising  promotional and selling expenses dipped 11 3  to  63 3 million due to lower freight to distributors stemming from lower volumes and freight rates as well as lower media spending  partially offset by increased points of sale General and administrative expenses surged 21 1  to nearly  21 8 million owing to hikes in salaries  benefits  stock compensation and facilities expenses FinancialsAs of Jun 25  2016  Boston Beer had cash and

half of 2016 and the period from Jun 26  2016 through Jul 16  the company bought back nearly 743 000 shares for  127 7 million  As of Jul 16  Boston Beer had roughly  12 2 million remaining under its standing share repurchase authorization of  586 million Growth PlanManagement intends to focus on aggressively aligning its cost structure with volumes  to achieve efficiencies across the organization and generate cost savings  The company plans to utilize these cost savings in making strategic investments  apart from developing its brands The company maintains its commitment to innovate within the Samuel Adams brand  promote and advertise all its brands  and increase distribution of its core styles within each brand  It plans to introduce new packaging and advertising in the second half of 2016 for the Samuel Adams brand  in order to support its promotional plans  The company also remains keen on sales execution and a completely reviewing brand messaging and packaging across all its brands  along with persistent innovation for existing brands and utilizing any growth opportunity that might arise Also  Boston Beer plans to step up investments to revive its hard cider category and Angry Orchard brand  while maintaining category leadership  The company is on track with the roll out of the Truly Spiked   Sparkling brand  which has been well received by distributors  retailers and drinkers  In the third quarter  the company expects to support this roll out with media and increase investments above planned levels in case of a positive response Though management is prepared for not so impressive bottom line results in the short term  it remains on track to boost long term profitability GuidanceTaking into consideration the first half trends  management lowered its earnings

113541,335056,STZ,5 Consumer Staples Stocks To Bet On This Earnings Season,opinion,"After the Brexit referendum  which shook the global economy in Jun 2016  investors have become jittery and are resorting to safe haven stocks  In this scenario  the consumer staples sector appears to be quite reliable 
Overall  the sector has reported modest results this quarter  Lower gas prices  an improving job scenario and increasing consumer confidence have been supporting the improvement in results 
Improving home sales  stepped up economic activities  higher business and government spending and a buildup in inventories have boosted U S  economic growth  While gradual improvement in the macro economic scenario will act as a growth driver  decreasing commodity costs will also help improve profit margins for certain staples companies 
Though lower crude oil prices are leading to worries related to global deflation and an economic slowdown  subsiding oil and natural gas prices mean that consumers are left with more disposable income  A rise in wages has also increased household wealth and boosted consumer spending  We expect these positive sentiments to translate into higher consumer spending in 2016 
However  there are many consumer staple stocks  which are still suffering from continued pressure in the face of limited consumer spending  foreign exchange headwinds  declining unit volumes and other global issues  Continued appreciation of the U S  dollar relative to most foreign currencies has become a serious headwind to the earnings of U S  based staples companies with significant international operations like Kimberly Clark Corporation  NYSE KMB   Mondelez International  Inc   MDLZ   The Procter   Gamble Co   PG   Altria Group  Inc   NYSE MO   ConAgra Foods  Inc   NYSE CAG  and General Mills  Inc   NYSE GIS  
In such an investment climate  we have identified five stocks  which not only have strong fundamentals but are also likely to report solid quarterly numbers  So it s better to grab these retail stocks now before they start touching new highs after their results The Way to Pick the Right Stocks 
Obviously  there are quite a few companies in the consumer staples space  so it may be difficult to pick the right stocks for your portfolio  One way to narrow down the list of choices is by looking at stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy    2  Buy  or  3  Hold    and a positive  
Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology to determine which stocks have the best chance to surprise in their next earnings announcement  It shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Our research shows that for stocks with this combination  the chance of positive earnings surprise is as high as 70  5 Prominent Choices
You may bet on Dean Foods Company     which processes and distributes milk  and other dairy and dairy case products in the United States  The stock carries a Zacks Rank  1 and has an Earnings ESP of  2 56   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter of 2016 stands at 38 cents a share  This Dallas  TX based company delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 17 81  over the trailing four quarters and has a long term earnings growth rate of 12 00   The company is slated to report results on Aug 8

The company registered an average negative earnings surprise of 5 37  over the trailing four quarters  and has a long term earnings growth rate of 15 00   The company is expected to report results on Aug 9 
We also suggest investing in food manufacturer B G Foods  Inc      Based in Parsippany  NJ  B G Foods carries a Zacks Rank  1 and has an Earnings ESP of  1 92   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter of 2016 stands at 52 cents a share  The stock has a long term earnings growth rate of 10 25   The company is expected to report results on Oct 25 
Orrville  OH  based The J  M  Smucker Co     can also be an attractive stock for investors  This food and beverage company has a Zacks Rank  1 and an Earnings ESP of  4 07   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter of 2016 stands at  1 72 a share  The stock has a long term earnings growth rate of 8 36   The company is expected to report results on Aug 25 
Another beverage company that can add value to the portfolio is Constellation Brands Inc  NYSE STZ       The company registered an average positive earnings surprise of 8 89  over the trailing four quarters  Currently  it has a Zacks Rank  2 and an Earnings ESP of  0 60   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 stands at  1 66 a share  The stock has a long term earnings growth rate of 16 34   The company is expected to report results on Oct 5 Bottom Line

The company has managed to deliver a 7 60  average increase in annual EPS in British pounds since 2006  Diageo is expected to earn 88 71p per share in 2016 and 95 74p per share in 2017  In comparison  the company earned the equivalent of 94 60p share in 2015  Each American Depository Receipt  ADR  that you can purchase on the NYSE is equivalent to four shares that are traded on the London Stock Exchange  If we convert the numbers to US dollars using the exchange rate on 06 17 2016  we have expected earnings of  5 10 for 2016 and  5 50 share in 2017  The earnings for 2015 are equivalent to  5 94 share  using the exchange rate on June 30  2015  The British pound has depreciated by 9 40  since June 30  2015  Using today s rate  those same earnings are worth  5 43 

Between 2006 and 2016  the number of shares decreased from 2 85 billion to 2 52 billion 
Diageo owns a portfolio of strong brands  with wide consumer appeal  which are usually number one or two in their respective categories  A few include Smirnoff  Johnnie Walker  Guinness  Baileys and Captain Morgan  The company also has a wide distribution network on a global scale  which might be difficult for a competitor to replicate  Diageo is the largest spirits company in the world  which provides it with the advantage of scale  relative to its competitors 
Future growth could be driven by organic expansion of its premium brands as well as through strategic acquisitions  The company has also focused on its core competencies  by disposing of Pillsbury and Burger King in the early 2000s  North America accounts for one third of sales but over 45  of operating profits  Emerging markets in Asia  Africa and Latin America account for 43  of sales by 29  of operating profits  Europe accounts for 24  of sales and 25  of operating profits  Continued investments in strategic emerging markets could translate into higher sales in the future  particularly as the number of middle class consumers who will be able to afford premium drinks rises significantly 
The annual dividend payment has increased by 6 70  per year over the past decade  which is lower than the growth in EPS 

A 6  growth in distributions translates into the dividend payment doubling every twelve years on average  The expected dividends in 2016 are roughly double the dividends paid in 2005 
Dividends on the ordinary shares are normally paid twice a year  an interim dividend in April and a final dividend in October  The approximate split between the two payments is 40 60 
The dividend payout ratio has decreased from 46 50  in 2006 to 59 60  in 2015  A lower payout is always a plus  since it leaves room for consistent dividend growth minimizing the impact of short term fluctuations in earnings 

The company has a high return on equity  which is common for most high quality dividend payers that do not require a lot of equity to operate the business  Rather than focus on absolute values for this indicator  one generally wants to see at least a stable return on equity over time 

Currently  the stock is fairly valued  as it trades at a forward P E of roughly 20 and yields 3 30   I am analyzing the company because I believe it is quality dividend growth stock  which is very good addition to my portfolio when it is below a P E of 20 and at a current yield above 3   I currently find Diageo to be a much better value than Brown Forman  at 27 times forward earnings and yield of 1 60   I recently nibbled on some Diageo shares and would consider adding a little more if the Brexit situation gets out of hand

Notably  Pepsi s recent innovation efforts in snacks focus mainly on higher margin healthy and premium salty snacks as there is a definitive market for such products now  Nooyi said on the call that Frito Lay has less exposure in the premium snacks business  It is   just getting started   and so there is a huge opportunity for Frito Lay to grow in the premium side 
Its newly launched premium snacks include Quaker Breakfast Flats crispy baked snack bars which contain real ingredients like oats and pieces of fruits  are low in calorie and are made without any artificial flavors or added colors  Under the Frito Lay business  Pepsi has expanded the Simply line with the introduction of Simply Tostitos Black Bean chips made from real black beans

The Macro Outlook 

To the extent that Greece drives the Euro lower  Greece is a tragedy for Greece but not for Europe

 Currencies are making exports much more attractive in those currencies  particularly in agriculture and manufactured products increased geopolitical stresses create upward pressure in the value of fungible commodities  While Greece is a tragedy for the Greece  it is not for Europe      Railroad Equipment 

Currency fluctuations have a real effect on foreign trade

 Currencies do matter  Currencies are one of the major drivers for reduction in agricultural  the demand exports for coal and so on  That in turn has affected velocity  But oil prices are settled in U S  dollars and U S  dollars are stronger while other currencies are weaker      Railroad Equipment

On McCormick s call one analyst noted that the e commerce trend has accelerated in China

 The shift to e commerce in China  it s hurt a lot of consumer companies lately  McCormick seems to be bucking the trend I m just curious for your thoughts here because it does seem to be a little bit of an anomaly versus what we re seeing elsewhere      Spices 

Consumer 

General Mills  NYSE GIS  said that it will be spending less on media advertising and more on direct consumer marketing

 Media is down and what I said is our total consumer will be up  And just let me parcel that out  So media is obviously what you see on air  what you see in digital or in print  It will be slightly down And then total consumer will be up low single digit  So when I talk about total consumer  that takes into things like in store events And then sampling falls into it as well      Packaged Foods 

Product samples have become increasingly effective

 Sampling is perhaps the most powerful penetration driver that we have and many of our natural and organic businesses are not really driven in the traditional media  They are in fact driven almost entirely by getting the products into people s mouths  So that s a growing part of our marketing mix and one that is not really counted in the media thing  So that s an important highlight for you      Packaged Foods 

Constellation Brands  NYSE STZ  is increasing ad spend to maintain  out of the ballpark  growth

 we continue to increase our spends in advertising and marketing because we think that it s critical to continue to drive the kind of success that we ve had we can t just take our current growth and be penny wise and dollar foolish for the future  We have to make sure that we are taking all of the right steps to ensure that we are able to maintain this kind of hit it out of the ballpark growth that we ve been enjoying      Alcoholic Beverages 

Conagra s new CEO laid out a vision of cutting SG A to grow

 On SG A  we are well into mobilizing an intensive SG A reduction effort that is aimed not only at offsetting stranded cost associated with a Private Brands divesture  but moving ConAgra into the top quartile of SG A efficiency in our space over time      Packaged Foods

PC demand is even weaker than people expected

 PC builds declined well below seasonally slow demand in the first half of the year I think it s fair to say that probably nobody expected the PC segment to be as slow as it s been      Semiconductors 

Micron s other end markets were stable though  They expect demand to pick up in the back half of the year  even in PCs

 we saw relative stability in other end markets we believe that demand is going to be higher in the back half of the year Even PCs I think  our view is that by the time we get to the end of the year notwithstanding the decrease in unit sales  there will be a small net growth in bits into the PC segment      Semiconductors 

Healthcare 

Many businesses are just starting to pay more attention to ACA requirements

 I think as clients started to really pay attention to it and I do think now we ll probably see another resurgence of interest in it I think when you get to the end of the year and those first filings have to be done and the penalty start to come into the 100 plus employee clients  I think they are really going to get a lot of attention at that point  And so the 50 or up  below a 100 will have to file  or the 50 to 100 will have to file  So that will be an awakening  I think for them that well this is a lot more difficult  And I think this is going to be another good year for the ESR product that we have  that helps them with Affordable Care Act      Payroll Processing

Dry Bulk shippers are finally canceling orders and scrapping ships  These are the ingredients to a lasting recovery

 During the first months of 2015 we have experienced record high levels of demolition and significant delays in scheduled deliveries  Furthermore orders have been running at record low level since October  14  In fact also after we adjust for conversions and cancellations we can say with confidence that we have practically experienced negative contracting of vessels  The above adjustments have put a ceiling for medium term fit growth and as a consequence the fundamental requirements for a sustainable recovery are slowly being built      Dry Bulk Shipping 

Almost 3x as many ships have been scrapped in 2015 vs 2014

 During the first five months of 2015  we have identified more than 20 million deadweights that has already been scraped and or committed for demolition  This compares with 16 2 million deadweight demolished throughout 2014 and 7 million deadweight demolished during the first five months of 2014      Dry Bulk Shipping 

Of course  if the market improves people may not scrap ships as quickly

 I agree with you if the market goes up in the next couple of months it has already started improving actually it s possible that we might see a better market during the second half of this year  Unfortunately this will probably have an effect on scrapping so it is possible that scrapping will slow down and if that happens we ll probably see again a slow beginning of next year      Dry Bulk Shipping

113644,335159,STZ,Company Notes Digest 10 8 15,opinion,"The Macro Outlook 
I seem to be the only person who thinks that the Fed is signaling that it will raise rates soon unless something goes really  really wrong 
The Fed was not concerned about the decline in stock prices
 equity prices fell  on balance  amid significant volatility  and risk spreads for businesses widened  Many participants judged that the effects of these developments on domestic economic activity were likely to be small     Central Bank 
They did not let the market decline factor into their policy choice
 participants indicated that they did not see the changes in asset prices during the intermeeting period as bearing significantly on their policy choice     Central Bank 
The Fed recognized that valuations were relatively high
 Some participants commented that the recent decline in equity prices needed to be viewed in the context of overall valuation levels  which they saw as relatively high  and a couple noted that volatility had begun to subside      Central Bank 
Some are concerned that if they wait to raise rates it could lead to financial market instability
 Some other participants  however  expressed concerns about delaying the start of normalizing the target range for the federal funds rate much longer  For example  a significant delay risked an undesired buildup of inflationary pressures or economic and financial imbalances that would be costly to unwind and that eventually could have adverse consequences for economic growth      Central Bank 
Most agreed that the conditions for firming have been met
 Most participants continued to anticipate that  based on their assessment of current economic conditions and their outlook for economic activity  the labor market  and inflation  the conditions for policy firming had been met or would likely be met by the end of the year     Central Bank 
A quick read on the economy from Dominos  the inflation picture is mixed
On one hand this isn t the type of economy that you can take price easily
 But in terms of is there significant pricing power for us  no  there is not  I don t think you can take aggressive price in this economy right now and not expect that s it s going to hit your order counts      Pizza 
On the other hand Dominos has seen an uptick in labor rates
 on labor rates specifically around our company owned store first  we saw a little bit of an uptake in that line  Some of it wage rate  some of it just higher bonuses I d say is kind of despite any wage inflation  we haven t seen a ton of wage inflation     Pizza 
Indra Nooyi s message was to get used to the volatility
 the macro volatility is here to stay     Beverages 
International 
Yum saw the environment in China decline  very rapidly and without much warning 
 the deceleration in China sales was led by Pizza Hut and the drivers behind that decline emerged very rapidly and without much warning  In today s volatile environment with the recent macro and competitive pressures we mentioned  it continues to be difficult to forecast sales in China for both brands      Restaurants 
Financial markets are weighing very heavily on the Chinese economy
 extraordinary volatility in financial markets  the surprise currency devaluation and overall softer economic conditions are weighing more heavily on the higher ticket casual dining sector in China      Restaurants 
Companies in China are cutting back on entertainment expenses
 in recent weeks  we ve seen companies cut back on parties  dinners and entertaining      Restaurants 
Pepsi expects Forex to impact EPS by 10 11 points
 We now expect foreign exchange translation to negatively impact net revenue and core earnings per share growth by approximately 10 and 11 percentage points respectively based on current market consensus rates      Beverages 
Financials 
Dominos has taken on quite a bit of leverage
 the company intends to issue approximately  1 5 billion of new fixed rate notes in the fourth quarter would bring our total debt to EBITDA leverage ratio from approximately 3 6 times at the end of Q3 to approximately 5 8 times at closing      Pizza

Zero Based Budgeting is so hot right now
 we have also embarked on our version of zero based budgeting  something we call smart spending      Beverages 
Companies have been relying on price to drive top line as volumes are under pressure
  I would say that the CSD market continues to be under pressure from a volume perspective  From a value perspective  because of good revenue management and good pricing in the industry  the value numbers are way better than the volume numbers     Beverages 
 the industry is definitively premiumizing  while volume remains sort of flat so that there is a shift internally towards more premium products      Alcoholic Beverages 
Startups are finding out that it s not so easy to move packages around profitably
 clearly we are kind of the world leaders in real time delivery there are a lot of people who have gotten into the space  My understanding is that as it relates to moving packages and food  very few if any of them are today making money doing that  There are folks that are doing pretty well out there moving people around  but I think people are learning that you know moving packages around and the scale that you need to do that it s not easy      Pizza 
Food delivery services are in a  savage battle for supremacy  in China
 there is definitely what we call a savage battle for supremacy going on about   around the aggregators who are obviously heavily discounting we don t believe that the economics will sustain all the people that are currently in the market playing at these discounted prices China is not the only place where this is occurring  what tends to happen is they are all fighting for market share dropping the prices but then eventually the prices have to go up      Restaurants 
Technology 
Technology is spreading to all industries  including agriculture
 As we look at the next decade for digital agriculture  one thing is clear  This platform will change the way farmers manage their operation  it will change who we are as a company  and it will transform the industry  In fact  we are targeting expansion of the platform into new crops in the next three to five years  including  but not limited to  soybeans  wheat and canola      Agriculture 
And pizza delivery 
 Switching to technology  the story continues to be about investing in innovation  Technology is now an absolutely critical part of our brand and an undeniable element of what Domino stands for  We don t just talk about innovating  it s generating real results  And for the second time this year we are using national television to promote a technology driven message      Pizza 
And Finance 
 There are 160 steps and processes a company must do from the time leadership decides they want to do an IPO to the time the company starts trading on an exchange  We are working on automating that entire process and making it more efficient with software     Investment Bank 
CPG companies are being disrupted by technology too
 with digital technologies disrupting many aspects of our business  productivity has never been more important     Beverages 
Technology makes it easier for small brands to establish themselves  so it s critical to have control of manufacturing and distribution
 Innovation is becoming more fragmented and the life cycle of innovation is being shorter and the trade becoming more and more complex  Having control of the manufacturing and distribution systems becomes critical      Beverages

These are tough times in agriculture
 We fully recognize that these are tough times in agriculture     Agriculture Chemicals 
Demand is growing to meet oversupply though
 the world is consuming the current oversupply at a record pace with demand for corn growing by an average of 1 3 billion bushels per year over the past three years  More than 90  of this growth in demand over this timeframe has been driven by feed and underpinned by middle class protein consumption  which we expect to continue      Agriculture 
Eventually a lack of investment should lead to a rebound for mining companies
 Right now  everybody is focused on hunkering down and cutting costs and no new investment Exploration spending is significantly down and there hasn t been a major discovery in over four years  Gold production has peaked and it will continue to decline in the coming years  Without major gold deposits like Donlin  the industry cannot sustain itself      Gold Mine ",2015-10-09,Scott Krisiloff,https://www.investing.com/analysis/company-notes-digest-10.8.15-267579,267579

World leaders wrapped up G 20 meetings in Turkey with a vow to boost intelligence sharing  cut off terrorist funding and strengthen border security in Europe  as they sought to show resolve and unity following the deadly terror attacks in Paris  This year s G 20 agenda also included efforts to hasten global economic growth  with a particular focus on addressing the effects of China s economic slowdown  French warplanes launched an assault on ISIS targets in Raqqa  Syria  Meanwhile  the authorities in France announced that they had conducted sweeping police raids around the country overnight  detaining two dozen people 
ISIS released a video today saying they will strike Washington  The Department of Homeland Safety said it had no  specific credible information of an attack on the U S  homeland   CIA Director John Brennan said he would be surprised if the group doesn t have additional attacks in preparation 
Markets across the globe are still processing the weekend s coordinated terrorist attacks in Paris  Asian exchanges traded lower overnight  European shares reversed early losses and closed in positive territory  The euro dropped  as investors scrambled for safe havens like the U S  dollar 
French President Hollande declared that France is at war  Hollande urged lawmakers to approve a three month extension of the nation s state of emergency  new laws that would allow authorities to strip the citizenship from French born terrorists  and provisions making it easier to deport suspected terrorists 
The attacks are also likely to hit France s economy  which has the largest number of tourists in the world  The sector accounts for almost 7 5  of the country s GDP  The specific wording by President Hollande is of note  because of course it opens up a can of worms about NATO  the EU  and various agreements for open borders in the EU  This means likely restrictions on import export activity 
It is nearly impossible to calculate the side effects of the Paris attacks  A couple of quick thoughts include an increase in surveillance  UK Prime Minister David Cameron has already announced the Brits will hire 1 900 new spies to deal with ISIS  The CIA is surely going to place a few ads as well  This will drive the tech heads in San Jose even crazier 
Next  think about the role of Russia in Syria and then expand it out to the role of Russian oil and Saudi Arabian oil vying for global market share  The oil market has been bound up with geopolitics and the threat of conflict for a century  and today s trading in the oil patch is far from the final word on the direction of those markets 
White House officials confirmed Putin and Obama met privately at the G 20 in Turkey and agreed to  a Syrian led and Syrian owned political transition   These are delicate positions in the dangerous dance between Sunni and Shia playing out in the deserts of Syria and Iraq 
The major stock indices in the US started in negative territory  but then rallied  There were some interesting theories bandied about for the recovery  One story talked about the increase in oil stocks as investors looked for safe havens  although the story didn t go so far as to suggest that increased military action in the Middle East threatens oil supply routes or even that cutting off ISIS black market oil trading removes a small chunk of supply 
Another story mentioned the travel and tourism industry had a bad day  but then explained that previous terror attacks have taught investors that it doesn t make financial sense to panic  And then the idea that citizens steadfastly refuse to allow terrorists to dictate how we will live our lives because terrorism won t succeed in the long run 
I missed a good discussion on whether traders felt the terror attacks might push the Fed to pass on a rate hike in December  Nor was there much discussion about the probability of the stock markets  bullish affection to war  I don t know why the markets moved higher  Maybe after a lousy week last week  the shorts closed out positions because it was just time for an up day 
The response in the US has been to fly French flags at football games  The NYSE and Nasdaq observed a minute of silence at 9 25 AM Eastern  before the opening bell  And already  nine states  at last count  have said they would shut their doors to Syrian refugees  in direct violation of the Pottery Barn Rule  The governors of Florida  Alabama  North Carolina  Texas  Arkansas  Louisiana  Indiana  Illinois  and Massachusetts all said they would not accept refugees fleeing the Syrian conflict  go ahead and connect the dots 
There has yet to be a single Syrian refugee resettled in Alabama to date  even though there is a US State Department approved refugee processing center in Mobile  And it is uncertain whether any governor would have the power to ban refugees from a given country  as resettlement is handled at the federal level  The State Department said this morning that the US still plans to try to admit 10 000 Syrian refugees into the country in the coming year  final destination to be determined 
Marriot International  O MAR  said that it had agreed to buy Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide  N HOT  for  12 2 billion in cash and stock  creating the world s largest hotel company  The timing of this acquisition was just exquisite  Under the terms of the deal  Marriott will pay  72 08 a share in cash and stock for Starwood  whose brands include Westin  the W  Sheraton and St  Regis  Starwood shareholders would own 37 percent of the combined company  Combined  the companies operate more than 5 500 hotels with 1 1 million rooms worldwide in 30 countries  with 300 000 employees 
For the first time in at least a decade  imports fell in both September and October at the three busiest seaports in the US  The three   Los Angeles  Long Beach  and New York harbor   handle more than half of the goods coming into the country  and saw imports fall just over 10  between August and October  typically known as peak shipping season  The slowdown in imports is likely an adjustment from a sizable inventory build up earlier this year 
S P 500 earnings are on track to close their first season of negative growth since 2009  with more than 90  of components having already reported results  S P 500 earnings are down 0 9 percent in the third quarter  Estimates call for sub zero growth in the current quarter as well setting up for a bona fide  earnings recession   two consecutive periods of declines   According to FactSet  this already occurred in the second and third quarters  All this comes as the Fed prepares to hike rates for the first time in almost a decade   a move that could weaken corporate earnings even further 
Japan has unofficially entered recession  Japan just booked two consecutive quarters of negative gross domestic product  GDP contracted at an annualized pace of 0 8  in the third after a 0 7  pace of contraction in second quarter  The Nikkei 225 share index dropped 1 percent

113646,335161,STZ,Stalking Entry On Constellation Brands,opinion,"The stock market has been in turmoil for 6 weeks now  The Indexes are well off of their highs and some more than 20  lower  This can go on forever but history suggests probably not  In the meantime  while you wait for a bottom to form what is there for an investor to do  You can trade on the short side of the market  This is difficult for professionals though  You can put together a list of stocks you want to buy when that turn happens  Or if you are comfortable with options there is a grey area in between 
Options allow you to tailor a risk management strategy to the stocks in your portfolio  But they also allow you to in a sense  name your own price  where you want to buy a stock  One stock that I have liked for a while is Constellation Brands  N STZ   This stock has had a great trend higher since mid 2012  That is until last week  Since then the stock has fallen from a high over 154 to a low Monday at 130  That is more than a 15  drop 

Is it time to buy this stock  Maybe  The chart shows a Hammer forming and if that is confirmed by a higher close Tuesday it would be a buy signal  But the broad market still feels weak and could overwhelm any stock  dragging it lower  You want it but not if it has not stopped falling  I did  buy  it today  but with an options strategy 
One way to trade into this type of a stock is by using a 1 2 Put Spread  This is buying a Put at one strike and then selling 2 Puts at a lower strike  For Constellation Brands I chose a March 130 125 1 2 Put Spread  buying the March 130 Put and selling 2 of the March 125 Puts 
If the price ends up between 130 and 125 on March Expiry I make money on the 130 Strike Put  If it closes at 125 I make  5  And a close below 125 means I will be put the stock  but with a basis of 120  So this strategy gives downside participation and a price entry point at a lower level  Best of all this trade can be put on today for  1 10 credit  So it makes money anywhere above 118 80 on the March close  whether you get your stock or not ",2016-02-08,Gregory W.

113648,335163,STZ,Bear Of The Day  AB Inbev  BUD ,opinion,"Yesterday  AB InBev    announced it would switching up its marketing of the popular Budweiser brand  The company wants to call the beer  America  and change the label to reflect all sorts of patriotic themes  That s not the reason I m making the stock today s Bear of the Day but it sure makes for a great story  You can check out my stance on the subject by viewing this light hearted video I made about it titled 
The reason I m bearish on InBev is it s a Zacks Rank  5 Strong Sell  with a Value Style Score of F and a Momentum Style Score of D  That tells me the valuations are a little out of whack and the estimate revisions haven t been moving in the right direction 
Over the last ninety days two analysts have dropped their earnings estimates for the current year  while a single analyst has done so for next year s numbers  The bearish sentiment has dropped the current year Zacks Consensus Estimate from  5 23 to  3 96  Looking at next year s numbers  consensus has gone from  5 67 down to  4 50  The bearishness follows up on a drastic quarter for the company where EPS came in at 51 cents versus estimates calling for 87 cents 
The stock has been surprisingly resilient in the face of these downward earnings estimates  Since bottoming out just above  100 in October  the stock has approached  130 on several occasions  The most recent push to the highs stalled out just a few weeks ago  There is a bullish trend line providing support just below the current price action  And the Commodity Channel Index just crossed the zero line  So in the short term there s actually a lot of momentum here 
However  eventually the fundamentals win out  Stocks tend to track with their earnings and if analysts are right about dropping their estimates  then this stock could be setting up for disaster in the intermediate term  If your bent on getting exposure to this industry  you should look at Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  Molson Coors    or Zacks Rank  2 Buy  Constellation Brands  NYSE STZ     ",2016-05-10,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/bear-of-the-day:-ab-inbev-(bud)-200129390,200129390

2 Top Wine Picks
Amid such strong industry fundamentals  there are a couple of wine stocks with attractive valuation metrics backed by a favorable Zacks Rank  Let s take a closer look at these companies that appear to be well positioned to benefit from the solid sector dynamics 
Constellation Brands Inc   NYSE STZ 
Constellation Brands is the leading wine company in the world with a strong portfolio of premium wine brands complemented by spirits  imported beer and other select beverage alcohol products  Since its inception in 1945  this Victor  NY based firm has evolved as a significant player in the beverage alcohol industry with over 100 brands in its portfolio  Constellation Brands primarily focuses on premium wine brands  which includes Robert Mondavi  Clos du Bois  Arbor Mist and Blackstone 
In 2013  Constellation Brands was one of the best performing stocks in the S P 500  Earnings estimate revision for the current quarter and fiscal for this Zacks Rank  2  Buy  stock has moved up in the last 60 days  implying bullish sentiments for the long term growth of the company  With a forward PE of 19 9x  long term earnings growth expectations of 17 3  and a one year return of 60 3   Constellation Brands is surely a solid pick 
Truett Hurs  NASDAQ THST 
Based in Healdsburg  CA  Truett Hurst produces a range of varietals of wine products  including Pinot Noir  Chardonnay  Sauvignon Blanc  Merlot  Cabernet Sauvignon and Zinfandel wines primarily in the U S  and Canada  With long term earnings growth expectation of 40 0  and a year to date return of 20 5   this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock has managed to outperform the broader equity market  Furthermore  earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter have been moving up  implying bullish sentiments for the long term growth of the company Moving Forward According to conservative estimates  worldwide luxury goods spending are expected to grow by about 2  year over year in 2014  tapered by the sedate recovery in Europe and China  However  global growth in luxury cars  wine and spirits  and hotels are billed to outpace personal luxury goods spending with 6  growth in these categories in 2014  Consequently  this is the most opportune time to bet on these wine stocks ",2014-05-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/raise-a-toast-to-these-wine-stocks-213766,213766
113671,335186,STZ,Beer Money Stocks To Consider,opinion,There s something about an ice cold beer on a hot summer day  The effervescence  the cool bubbles  the refreshing taste  So there I was this weekend having just cut the grass  drenched with sweat  thinking to myself  I sure could use a cold one   I went to the fridge  cracked one open  sat on the stoop and took in the summer day  Then I started to think about how much beer is sold in a given day in Chicago  Then extrapolated that to the state  the country  the world  Somebody has got to be making a mint  I fired up my computer  logged onto Zacks com and started searching for stocks that could earn me some beer money  I found several companies in the industry that are Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or Zacks Rank  2  Buy  stocks  In fact  the alcoholic beverage industry is in the top 11  of our Zacks Industry Rank  What started off as a good idea turned out to be a great idea This BUD s For You Boasting a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  is Anheuser Busch InBev  NYSE BUD   You may remember when the European company Inbev bought the St  Louis brewer a few years back  Among Anheuser s brands are Busch  Budweiser  Stella Artois and Becks  Analysts have been very bullish on BUD recently  In the last 30 days two analysts have upped their estimates for the current year and next year  pushing consensus up from  5 14 to  5 19 per share for this year  Hopefully BUD can avoid a miss like last quarter  Earnings came in at 87 cents versus  1 01 analysts were expecting  After hitting a fresh 52 week high June 20th  BUD has sold off a bit  Recently the stock dipped below its 40 day moving average  indicating the onset of a downtrend  Stochastics are showing BUD in extreme oversold territory  Earnings are coming up later this week and may be the catalyst for a reversal of the short term trend Life s A Beach Lime or no lime is the question when ordering one of Constellation Brands  NYSE STZ  best selling beers  Corona  The company is the largest multi category alcohol supplier in the US  Constellation is a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   A big reason for the ranking is five analysts raised their earnings estimates for the current year and four have done so for next year  This pushed consensus up from  4 12 to  4 26 for this year and up from  4 61 to  4 78 for next year  This is likely a conservative estimate as well as STZ has surprised to the upside four quarters in a row  beating the street by 12 cents on average  The stock s chart is very similar to the BUD chart  Constellation Brands peaked on July 2nd and has slowly sold off since  Just like BUD  STZ recently dropped below its 40 day moving average indicating a fresh downtrend  Stochastics are also extremely oversold on this stock as well  Investors looking to cash in should wait for a small bounce before jumping on board Play It Again  SAM One of the tastier brands is Sam Adams from Boston Beer Company  NYSE SAM   Sam Adams is famous for its commercials featuring its eccentric CEO  SAM currently is a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   The stock sort of flies under the radar as average daily volume is about 60 000 shares  Analysts have raised guidance for the current year as well as next year  Consensus jumped from  7 35 to  8 for next year and from  6 24 to  6 33 for this year  Over the last several years the company has achieved significant earnings growth  The stock has been somewhat of a rollercoaster ride for investors as of late  SAM got up to nearly  250 in March before beginning a downtrend that took the stock all the way down to  208 in May  Since then there s been another leg up followed by a sharp drop  Just like the other two stocks SAM has just dipped below its 40 day moving average and has stochastics in extreme oversold territory  With earnings around the corner this stock should wake up from its doldrums ,2014-07-29,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/beer-money-stocks-to-consider-220883,220883
113672,335187,STZ,Here s Why AB InBev SABMiller Won t Merge,opinion,"Heineken  AMS HEIN    the world s third largest brewer   made news over the weekend by rejecting a merger offer from rival Sabmiller  LONDON SAB    the world s second largest brewer   Apart from creating a global beer brewing juggernaut  SABMiller s offer was an attempt to fend off a potential bid by Anheuser Busch Inbev  NYSE BUD   the world s largest brewer  according to Bloomberg 
I ve got news for you  A mega beer merger isn t happening 
Consider the trouble Anheuser Busch InBev had in getting its 2013 acquisition of Mexican brewing group Grupo Modelo approved   BUD had to sell its American distribution rights to Corona and Negra Modelo to Constellation Brands  NYSE STZ  in order to keep the regulators happy  but they didn t get it right the first time   The U S  Department of Justice initially torpedoed the deal on anti competitive grounds 
If BUD had a hard time sealing the deal with Modelo   a medium sized player at most among global brewers   then it s hard to see the regulators allowing a merger between two of the big three   Anheuser Busch InBev  SAB Miller and Heineken have global market shares of 20 0   9 6  and 9 3   respectively 
Drilling down into specific markets  the numbers get a lot bigger   Anheuser Busch InBev reports market shares of   58 4  of the Mexican market and 56 0  of the Belgian market   Were BUD to make a serious offer for SABMiller  it would have to divest so much of the combined company as to make the deal unworkable 
Yet it appears that BUD s interest is legitimate  What s going on here  and why the sudden interest by Big Beer in getting even bigger 
In a word   growth   or the distinct lack of it in the developed world   U S  beer sales   even while craft beers enjoyed an impressive 17 2  pop 
Craft beers which include everything from the larger independent brands like Boston Beer Company  NYSE SAM  Samuel Adams and the Spoetzl Brewery s  Shiner Bock  a favorite of mine  to the new  upstart brewpub down the street   now account for 7 8  of all American beer sales  with no sign of slowing down   This is bad news for the likes of Bud  Miller and Coors  but it actually gets worse   Even the large  mainstream imports   which have been a major source of growth in recent decades   saw declining sales last year of nearly 1    Americans are drinking less beer overall and being a lot more choosy about the beer they do drink 
It s not just Americans who are sobering up  European beer sales have been disappointing for the better part of the past decade   Even Germany the mecca for beer is seeing declines in drinking   Germans have been drinking less beer every year for seven years running 
The one bright spot for Big Beer is its exposure to emerging markets and particularly to frontier markets like Africa   As I noted in     AB InBev gets about 52  of its earnings from Latin America  including Mexico  But its exposure to Africa is close to nil   Meanwhile  SABMiller s African operations are responsible for 31  of profits  about 17  of which is from South Africa 
This is the real story behind all of the Big Beer merger talk  BUD s management is salivating at the prospect of getting access to Africa s up and coming consumers   African per capita GDP has more than doubled in the past decade  and according to Deloitte    As African living standards rise  so do the standards of African drinkers   But today  only about 20  of the beer consumed in Africa is branded or bottled  The remaining 80  is essentially glorified moonshine 
Is There A Trade Here 
Maybe   As I wrote in July  SABMiller is a stock worth buying on any pullbacks   The stock had a pullback in July and early August  dropping about 10  peak to trough   But the weekend s merger talk sent shares sharply higher on Monday  to fresh 52 week highs 
At 28 times trailing earnings  SABMiller stock is pricey   Don t buy at these levels   But if we get another pullback following a failed acquisition attempt by AB InBev  then I would recommend seizing the opportunity

There were some crazy things that our ancestors saw in the stars as their brains sought to find patterns  We still look for patterns in life today  As a technical trader  I look for them in price charts  And one stock  Constellation Brands  NYSE STZ  has a pattern setting up for victory higher 

This chart shows the weekly price action and several reasons why it may be ready to make an assault on  100  It is easy to see the rising trend since the stock price crossed the 50 week SMA in June 2012  It has touched that level twice since  most recently with the market low in mid October  Since that last touch it has been moving higher in a consolidation range that began in June this year 
It is now at the top of that range  and as it arrives the Bollinger  bands are opening higher to allow it continue to move up  The momentum indicators  RSI and MACD  are also showing strength  A push over 95 would trigger a buy signal and look for continuation of the trend higher  Perfect timing for a wines and spirits company as the world enters the holiday season  Why not bring a few shares to the host of your next party instead of a bottle of wine

113674,335189,STZ,Is Constellation Brands A One Trick Pony  ,opinion," NYSE STZ  will report its FQ1  16 results Wednesday morning and both Estimize and Wall Street are predicting a solid lift in EPS QoQ  Constellation Brands has performed extremely well year to date  YTD  posting a capital return of 18 68  compared to the broader S P 500 index which has only risen 0 35   The share price surge can be attributed to Constellation Brands  surge in earnings over the past two years  Since FQ1  14  EPS has increased from  0 38 to the reported figure of  1 03 in FQ4  15  representing an astronomical increase of 172  in only 7 quarters 
Estimize are predicting the upcoming result to produce an EPS figure of  1 24 and a revenue number of  1 622B  This compares to Wall Street s estimates of an EPS figure of  1 22 and a revenue projection of  1 615B 

Constellation Brands is a global producer  importer and marketer of alcoholic beverages including beer  wine  and spirits  The company sports a variety of premium brands and has been a direct beneficiary of high demand for imported products in the United States  Constellation Brands distributes household name brands such as Corona and Modelo  Modelo in particular has been a fantastic revenue generator for Constellation Brands and has contributed to the company s rapid sales growth  Investors will want to see a continuation in sales growth from its Modelo brand and other contributing brands 

Constellation Brands is expected to further benefit from its imported beer brands as demand continues to grow  Imported beer volumes rose by a staggering 13 0  in the first quarter of 2015 year on year  YoY  in the United States  Circa 60  of the imported beer value came from Mexico  the homeland of Corona and Modelo  An increasing Hispanic population in the United States will likely translate to further growth in demand for these two products stimulating Constellation Brands sales and earnings

113720,335235,STZ,Week in Review Part IV  Random Musings,opinion,The first real polls pitting President Obama head to head with Mitt Romney since the departure of Rick Santorum from the race are now flooding in   Nationwide  registered voters Gallup Romney 48 44Fox News Romney 46 44CNN ORC Obama 52 43Pew Research Center Obama 49 45Quinnipiac Obama 46 42ABC News Washington Post Obama 51 44NBC News  Wall Street Journal Obama 49 43CBS News New York Times 46 46In the NBC WSJ survey  taken in late February and early March  Mitt Romney s positive rating was just 28  and now it s up to 33   some progress  48  have a positive view of President Obama  basically in line with the winter s data  By a six point margin  more Americans saw Romney rather than Obama as having good ideas for improving the economy Obama s overall approval rating stood at 49  in the NBC WSJ poll   The low in this survey was 44  from August through November   Among independents  47  approve  43  disapprove But one major headwind for the president  59  still believe the country is on the wrong track  though down from a high under Obama of 74  in October   In the Pew survey  86  said the economy was the most important issue   In the CBS N Y  Times poll  Obama was favored by women 49 43  but was tied 43 43 among independents   In the CNN ORC survey  Obama was favored by women 55 39  and 48 43 among independents    In the Pew poll  Obama beats Romney 67 27 among Hispanic voters  In 2008  Obama defeated Sen  John McCain 67 31 among this group  The RNC recently announced it would target Hispanic voters with an outreach program in Florida  New Mexico  Colorado  Virginia  North Carolina and Nevada  Look for the Dos Equis if you opt to attend an event  Or rather  demand it  You call this stinkin  outreach   Where s the Dos Equis   Stay thirsty  my friends   In the Quinnipiac poll  New Jersey Gov  Chris Christie is the choice among Republicans to be Romney s running mate at 31   ahead of 24  for Florida Sen  Marco Rubio and 23  for Wisconsin Rep  Paul Ryan   Kathleen Parker   Washington Post For reasons that don t interest me much   girl fights  have always had a particular tug on our imaginations  Thus  when consultant pundit Democrat Hilary Rosen commented on CNN that Ann Romney had never held a job  and therefore was ill suited to advise her husband on women s employment concerns   the body politic convulsed in paroxysms of outrage  And off they went  Stay at home moms  SAHMs  allegedly were insulted  Working mothers who allegedly envy SAHMs recoiled from the blinding truth of Rosen s observation  Single moms with mouths to feed and no jobs allegedly were furious at the Romneys  apparent cluelessness  Regular folks  meanwhile  who know better than to argue about  women issues  when the political masses are engaged  somehow managed to get through another night without pondering whether the gender gap can ever be bridged   President Obama  reminding folks that he was raised by a single mom  noted that women who stay home with children are doing hard work and that anyone who argues otherwise should  rethink their statement   Rosen quickly rethunk and apologized for saying something true  which is never allowed in politics   but the heat is still high   Only gravel doesn t know that the women s vote is all important this election season  Never mind the perennial insult that women are monolithic and vote only as their female parts dictate  Women  as Ann Romney has tried to point out  care about jobs and the economy because they are sentient human beings who do  in fact  work  57 7  of those over 16   or want to  And they do  in fact  worry that there will be no recognizable nation left if we don t get serious about the debt and deficit in ways that don t split the country into warring factions of haves and have nots  Nothing like using women to emotionalize and distract from the hard work of governance  Women and men should be angry  all right  but not at Ann Romney or Hilary Rosen  who are entitled to both their opinions and their choices without fear of censure or condemnation  Anger is better directed at those who take tiny utterances and inflate them into phony distractions  Visitors to preschool playgrounds have witnessed disagreements of greater import    Thomas Friedman   New York Times I had to catch a train in Washington last week  The paved street in the traffic circle around Union Station was in such poor condition that I felt as though I was on a roller coaster  I traveled on the Amtrak Acela  our sorry excuse for a fast train  on which I had so many dropped calls on my cellphone that you d have thought I was on a remote desert island  not traveling from Washington to New York City  When I got back to Union Station  the escalator in the parking garage was broken  Maybe you ve gotten used to all this and have stopped noticing  I haven t  Our country needs a renewal  And that is why I still hope Michael Bloomberg will reconsider running for president as an independent candidate  if only to participate in the presidential debates and give our two party system the shock it needs   After his mayoral term is over in 2013  Bloomberg will apparently spend more time running his foundation  That s commendable  But the single greatest act of philanthropy he could do for the country is right now  run for president as an independent If he doesn t  and this turns into a presidential race to the bottom  he could donate every dollar he has to fix things in America and they d be wasted  or  more accurately  overwhelmed by our mounting problems  The most patriotic thing Bloomberg could do is become an unpaid lobbyist for the country   and for the next generation of Americans    It s really amazing how the Secret Service scandal in Cartagena could have gone down  and how these supposed professionals could have allowed themselves to be vulnerable to blackmail and thus risk the security of the president and others they are charged with protecting  And as we learn more about these clowns that we grew up once respecting  it s amazing that you have the guy who had been responsible for vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin s security actually commenting on her physical appearance on his Facebook page Republican Congressman Darrell Issa  Calif    Things like this don t happen once if they didn t happen before  We have got to ask   where are the systems in place to prevent this in the future   It s the reason that the investigation will not be about the 11 to 20 or more involved  It will be about how did this happen and how often has this happened before     It s not about whether the president was in danger this time  It s whether or not you need to make changes so the American people can have confidence in their  entire  workforce  President Obama  We re representing the people of the United States  and when we travel to another country  I expect us to observe the highest standards  because we re not just representing ourselves  we re here on behalf of our people    George Zimmerman s bail was set at  150 000 and he could be free in a few days  He ll be required to wear a GPS device  In a hearing  he told Trayvon Martin s parents   I wanted to say I am sorry for the loss of your son    Two years after the BP oil spill  there is no doubt some prized fish such as grouper and red snapper are diseased  which kind of sucks   Across Africa more than 300 million people are said not to have access to safe drinking water  but now scientists say they have discovered the volume of water in aquifers underground is 100 times the amount on the surface  according to BBC News  Some of the largest underground water sources are said to be in Libya  Algeria and Chad  The scientists disagree on the best ways of accessing the supply  with some saying large scale borehole developments could actually rapidly deplete the resource  Emphasis  instead  should be placed on slower means of extraction to support drinking and community irrigation   A report out of Yale University and George Mason University finds that 69  of Americans agree that global warming is affecting weather in the United States  70  or more believe it was responsible for the unusually warm 2011 2012 winter and the record high temperatures in 2011 Separately  Richard Alley  a glaciologist at Penn State University  had some of the following in an op ed for USA TODAY  Out in the climate  the dice are being loaded to favor some unusual events  We can t prove that global warming caused any single new record  just as we can t prove that the weighted dice caused a run of double sixes  But for many extreme weather events such as record heat  it is much harder to prove that our CO2 is innocent  just as it is very hard to prove that loaded dice didn t affect the game  Science doesn t have a good understanding of warming s impact on the occurrence and strength of small  fierce storms such as tornadoes  so it would be very difficult to show a human fingerprint in the severity of the recent outbreaks  But extra heat and water vapor are up there  so it could be harder to show that we haven t boosted the destructive power  More important  if we continue to burn fossil fuels and release the CO2 to the air  we re loading the dice more and more  Today s youngsters might live to see so much warming that the hottest summer now on record becomes commonplace or even cool in many places   Even so  the best science is clear  We get many benefits from burning fossil fuels  but the CO2 is projected to change the climate in costly ways  As the easy fossil fuels are exhausted  more and more we will want sustainable alternatives  Careful lottery players check the jackpot and their cash reserves before buying the next ticket  But though the scientific community is working to calculate the odds in the climate game  society is still rolling the increasingly loaded dice through accelerating fossil fuel burning    That was pretty cool to learn that Antarctica has twice as many emperor penguins as once thought after an extensive British and U S  study using satellite imaging  As in there are 595 000 living in 46 colonies along the coast of the place  compared with previous estimates of 270 000 to 350 000 Maybe they ll band together and attack worthless Argentina    Charles Krauthammer   Washington Post As the space shuttle Discovery flew three times around Washington  a final salute before landing at Dulles airport for retirement in a museum  thousands on the ground gazed upward with marvel and pride  Yet what they were witnessing  for all its elegance  was a funeral march  The shuttle was being carried   its pallbearer  a 747   because it cannot fly  nor will it ever again  It was being sent for interment  Above ground  to be sure  But just as surely embalmed as Lenin in Red Square  Is there a better symbol of willed American decline  The pity is not Discovery s retirement   beautiful as it was  the shuttle proved too expensive and risky to operate   but that it died without a successor  The planned follow on   the Constellation rocket capsule program to take humans back into orbit and from there to the moon   was suddenly canceled in 2010  And with that  control of manned spaceflight was gratuitously ceded to Russia and China   Who cares  you say  What is national greatness  scientific prestige or inspiring the young   legacies of NASA   when we are in economic distress  Okay  But if we re talking jobs and growth  science and technology  R D and innovation   what President Obama insists are the keys to  an economy built to last    why on earth cancel an incomparably sophisticated  uniquely American technological enterprise  We lament the decline of American manufacturing  yet we stop production of the most complex machine ever made by man   and cancel the successor meant to return us to orbit  The result  Abolition of thousands of the most highly advanced aerospace jobs anywhere   its workforce abruptly unemployed and drifting away from space flight  never to be reconstituted   There are always excuses for putting off strenuous national endeavors  deficits  joblessness  poverty  whatever  But they shall always be with us  We ve had exactly five balanced budgets since Alan Shepard rode Freedom 7 in 1961  If we had put off space exploration until these earthbound social and economic conundrums were solved  our rocketry would be about where North Korea s is today   NASA will tell you that it s got a new program to go way beyond low Earth orbit and  as per Obama s instructions  land on an asteroid by the mid 2020s  Considering that Constellation did not last even five years between birth and cancellation  don t hold your breath for the asteroid landing  Nor for the private sector to get us back into orbit  as Obama assumes it will  True  hauling MREs up and trash back down could be done by private vehicles  But manned flight is infinitely more complex and risky  requiring massive redundancy and inevitably larger expenditures  Can private entities really handle that  And within the next lost decade or two      Neil Armstrong  James Lovell and Gene Cernan called Obama s cancellation of Constellation a  devastating  decision that  destines our nation to become one of second or even third rate stature     Without the skill and experience that actual spacecraft operation provides   they warned   the USA is far too likely to be on a long downhill slide to mediocrity   This  from  the leading space faring nation for nearly half a century      Today  we can t even do what John Glenn did in 1962  let alone fly a circa 1980 shuttle    Finally  I m in Johnson City  Tenn   for no other reason than I needed a decent place to bang out a column and the Carnegie Hotel where I m staying is one of the more pleasant surprises of my recent travels  I ve done a lot of history sightseeing this week  particularly Lexington  Virginia  Appomattox and Bedford  Va   the last one where the National D Day memorial resides Lexington is home to Washington   Lee University and VMI  as well as the final resting place for Robert E  Lee  president of W L the last five years of his life  and Confederate Gen  Stonewall Jackson  who taught at VMI before he was called into service But George Washington was the original benefactor of W L and among his many firsts  call him the first education president  In 1784  he said   the best means of forming a manly  virtuous and happy people  will be found in the right education of youth  Without this foundation  every other means  in my opinion  must fail  In 1790  Washington said  Knowledge is in every Country the surest basis of public happiness  VMI was also where George C  Marshall went to school and there is an excellent museum to honor one of the Greatest Americans of all time  I didn t realize he was born on West Main Street in Uniontown  PA  being familiar with the area   He lived near George Washington s Ft  Necessity  so Marshall s father  George Sr   would take him there often which instilled in his boy a love and respect for history But in touring the Marshall museum  I was struck by this one quote of his  Discouraged people are in sore need of the inspiration of Great Principles  Such leadership can be the rallying point against intolerance  against distrust  against that fatal insecurity that leads to war  It is to be hoped that democratic nations can provide the necessary leadership  Lord  oh how we need such leadership today  Lastly  as we roll through the 150th anniversary of the Civil War from 2011 2015  I hope many of you get to go to Appomattox  Leave enough time to walk the historic trail and visit the cemetery about a   mile from McLean House  where the surrender took place  For ten years I ve had an essay written by the late Dr  Joseph Harsh  who was a Professor of History at George Mason University  He used to teach a summer course that ended with his students sitting around Stonewall Jackson s tomb in Lexington  a beautiful spot where 144 Confederate veterans are also buried  Here is just some of what he would tell those students  as published in Hallowed Ground  summer 2002 They are all gone now The dewy cheeked boys  who left home before their first shave  their older brothers  who marched away from young wives clutching infants in their arms  and their grizzled fathers  whose gray streaked hair and beards belied arms as stout as their hearts They are all gone The men who discovered at Bull Run that war was not a lark  but a vulture  who crept through the Bloody Cornfield and knelt in the Bloody Lane  who crawled through the snows on Marye s Heights  who would not yield on Little Round top and who climbed the post and rail fence on the Emmittsburg Pike amidst a hail of bullets  they who lay among the burning trees of the Wilderness  and who endured the dank  stinking trenches of Petersburg They who surrendered at Appomattox  and they who did not jeer the vanquished there They are all gone  We who are their great  and great great  and great great great grandchildren can never know them now  We can never see them  or hear them  or touch them We can know them only through the ancient photographs of faded brown and white  where they stand mute  unmoving  mysterious to our gaze  And the least that we can do   and  sadly  the most that we can do   to reach back through fast receding years and thank them for the pain  the suffering  the sacrifice  to thank them for our United States  is to preserve  to protect  and to defend the ground they hallowed But our obligation is much greater than to thank them  Our most sacred duty  our ultimate loyalty  is to remember  to keep alive  and to pass on their willingness to sacrifice  their love of country  their devotion to freedom We are the future now  but ultimately we are only a link between the past and the future  This generation may never be called upon to make huge  soul wrenching sacrifices of life and fortune But someday   and it is as inevitable as the rising of the sun   a future generation will again be touched by fire and will be summoned to defend our country and our freedom If your children  or grandchildren  or great grandchildren  when that call comes  are too soft  too lazy  too uncaring to meet the challenge  not only will they fail  but we fail also  and so will fail every generation which has preceded us Antietam  Gettysburg and Appomattox will have been in vain Yes  they are all gone now And soon   in a blink of the cosmic eye of time   we also will all be gone  But we are all connected The Civil War is not a closed book It is a continuing story that never ends    Pray for the men and women of our armed forces and all the fallen God bless America    Gold closed at  1642Oil   103 88Returns for the

113722,335237,STZ,Constellation Brands  New High Moves With Elevated Volume,opinion,Constellation Brands  Inc   STZ  is a wine company  The Company is a marketer of imported beer in the United States  through its investment in Crown Imports  LLC  Crown Imports   a joint venture with Grupo Modelo  S A B  de C V   GMODELOC MX   pursuant to which Modelo s Mexican beer portfolio  the Modelo Brands  are imported  marketed and sold by the joint venture in the United States This is a multi level note in that the stock has breached a new high  the IV30  has triggered the one day vol gain scan  there is an interesting calendar vol diff and the overall level of the IV30  has triggered the annual elevated vol scan Oddly  I can t really find any news for the stock or vol move yesterday  Let s look at the Charts Tab  one year  below  The top portion is the stock price  the bottom is the vol  IV30    red vs HV20    blue vs HV180    pink  On the stock side we can see the large price appreciation over the last year  with the stock rising from  20 66 to now over  38 50  I note in particular that earnings gap up on 6 29 2012 which acted as a catalyst for the price rise  I also note that with the move today  STZ has set a new multi year high in stock price In order to better examine the implied  I have included the one year IV30  chart in isolation  below We can see how the implied is spiking of late with the stock rise  The 52 wk range in IV30  is  18 41   56 52    putting the current level in the 94th percentile  annual   So  here we have an example of a stock that is rising to new highs and the vol is also rising    a good reminder that while the rule of thumb of rising stock and falling vol is a good one  it s not always true Let s turn to the Skew Tab  and we ll find some more interesting phenomena with the vol The company just released earnings on 1 9 2013  with the next earnings release due out in Apr  However  we can see that Apr vol is priced below Feb  and Jan   3 days   This presents an interesting opportunity where we have elevating vol in a stock hitting new multi year highs with the catalyst to that stock break out being an earnings report    yet the vol for the next earnings report is priced lower than the months in front  Very cool   Finally  let s turn to the Options Tab Across the top we can see the monthly vols are priced to 54 49  and 47 28  for Feb and Apr  respectively  Again  if the next earnings report is in Apr  that s quite a discount to Feb and potentially to Mar in a stock where owning vega has been a winner Disclosure  This is trade analysis  not a recommendation Images provided by Livevol ,2013-01-17,Ophir Gottlieb,https://www.investing.com/analysis/constellation-brands:-new-high-moves-with-elevated-volume-151282,151282
