21972,243487,AVAV,Timing The Market  Is It Possible    October 02  2019,opinion,"Being that unique investor who has the power to constantly time the market and continually make a profit is the dream for most traders and investors 
Indeed  even among the individuals who don t seek to be the ideal market timer  many feel they can call a top and act in accordance  It is these tendencies that make investors sit on the sidelines and hang tight for a better chance to put money into the market 
Lost chances by those who attempt to time the market is a common mistake among those who trade their own accounts  How many traders have lost investing opportunities by choosing to wait for the Aerospace stocks to correct or reach attractive entry levels  Only for them to continue to move higher and achieve new all time highs  The Boeing Company   NYSE BA    AeroVironment  Inc    NASDAQ AVAV    Astronics Corporation   NASDAQ ATRO    Air Industries Group   NYSE AIRI    AAR Corp    NYSE AIR  
Dread and exuberance regularly propel investors into merely  reacting  to market volatility  rather than envisioning market trends 
Successful market timing requires three key ingredients  1  A reliable signal to tell you when to get in and out of stocks  or bonds  gold or other types of investments   2  The ability to interpret the signal correctly  3  The discipline to act on it 
Market timing is commonly perceived as the ability to guess the exact market top or bottom and make moves accordingly  However  there is a less common  rather straightforward market timing strategy that has been utilized effectively by insightful financial specialists like Warren Buffet for a considerable length of time 
Rule 1  Never try and time tops and bottoms 
Forget tracking for market tops or bottoms to expand your odds for success with a longer timeline and give yourself the flexibility to eventually profit  regardless of whether your calls are spot on or way off base 
Rule 2  Make an effort not to sell in the midst of little crashes  Muster the courage to trust your gut and buy best in class stocks at a discount 
Warren Buffett has made his fortune based of this straightforward guideline  He cautions not to sell amid little crashes and to instead endure the temporary hardship and profit by concentrating on the long haul 
There is a big difference between a stock market crash and small correction  If the companies you own are established and successful  they are likely to return to their pre   crash price before long  making holding on the wisest decision  Warren Buffett takes this thought one step further by often buying outsized positions in value stocks he likes across the board when markets turn  essentially leveraging his bottoms up analysis and stock picking acumen 
A Risk Adjusted Trading Strategy Should be Followed for Your Retirement Assets
It s only human that many succumb to greed and try and game the system by timing the market  But  think about this  Nobel Laureate William Sharpe found in 1975 that a market timer would need to be precise 74  of the time to beat a passive portfolio  Even a slight outperformance probably wouldn t be worth the energy   and given that even the experts generally fail at it  market timing shouldn t be your exclusive investing strategy of choice  especially using assets earmarked for your retirement 
Chasing alpha  outsized  short   term returns through market timing and other high   risk bets is acceptable only within a small part of your investable resources  however for your long   term retirement assets a  risk adjusted  investment discipline is what largely bodes well

Specifically  AVAV was higher one day after six of the past eight earnings reports  averaging a 14 3  swing in either direction    with its biggest pop coming in at 25 9  in January 2017  This time around the options market is pricing in a post earnings move that s just about in line with this average  at 14 4  
While some traders have been cooling to AVAV  the options market has been a bit more bullish  Today  244 calls have crossed the tape today  two times what s typically seen at this point  The July 85 call is by far the most popular  with selling action seemingly taking place here 
Should tomorrow s results prove favorable  some analysts might start coming around to AVAV  Right now  only one broker in coverage considers the equity a  strong buy  while six say it s a  hold   The consensus 12 month target price  on the other hand  sits all the way up at  74 60    a region AVAV hasn t touched since mid March

Resolving the U S  China trade war  That is a key fundamental earnings and revenue growth factor underpinning the next leg of this long U S  bull market 
I am of the strong opinion it will not be the details of the U S  China trade deal itself that rally stock markets more  sometime this spring or summer  It will simply be the lifting of tariffs 
Without lifting tariffs  I can t see the global growth situation improving  Tariffs took down global growth last summer  Only lifting tariffs can restore the same growth 
Let s make sure we remember how the U S  got here  
The Trump tariffs were imposed by executive order  not by act of Congress  during the presidency of Donald Trump as part of his economic policy           In January 2018  Trump imposed tariffs on solar panel and washing machines of 30 to 50 percent           He soon imposed tariffs on steel  25   and aluminum  10   from most countries  On June 1st  2018  this was extended on the European Union  Canada  and Mexico  The only countries that remain exempted from the steel and aluminum tariffs are Australia and Argentina           Separately  on July 6th  2018 the Trump administration set a tariff of 25  on 818 categories of goods imported from China worth  50 billion  
The tariff history of the United States spans from 1789 to the present  
 1  The first tariff law passed by the U S  Congress  acting under the then recently ratified Constitution  was the Tariff of 1789  Its purpose was to generate revenue for the federal government  to run the government and to pay the interest on its debt   and also to act as a protective barrier around newly starting domestic industries  Treasury agents collected an import tax set by tariff rates before goods could be unloaded at U S  ports 
 2  Tariffs have historically served a key role in the nation s foreign trade policy and as a source of federal income  Tariffs were the greatest  approaching 95  at times  source of federal revenue until the Federal income tax began after 1913  For well over a century the federal government was largely financed by tariffs averaging about 20  on foreign imports 
 3  Tariffs were the main source of all Federal revenue from 1790 to 1914  At the end of the American Civil War in 1865 about 63  of Federal income was generated by the excise taxes  which exceeded the 25 4  generated by tariffs  In 1915 during World War I tariffs generated only 30 1  of revenues  Since 1935  tariff income has continued to be a declining percentage of Federal tax income 
 4  Woodrow Wilson made a drastic lowering of tariff rates a major priority for his presidency  The 1913 Underwood Tariff cut rates  but the coming of World War 1 in 1914 radically revised trade patterns  Reduced trade and  especially  the new revenues generated by the federal income tax  bolstered by the ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment in 1913  made tariffs much less important in terms of economic impact and political rhetoric 
 5  After the WWII  the U S  promoted the General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade  GATT  established in 1947  to minimize tariffs and other restrictions  and to liberalize trade among all capitalist countries 
 6  In 1995 GATT became the World Trade Organization  WTO   with the collapse of Communism its open markets low tariff ideology became dominant worldwide in the 1990s 
Presidential quotes of note 
President Trump has plenty of tariff enacting company    respected U S  Presidents from the past  just not many U S  Presidents from the last century  
Here are a few nice quotes to show that 
 A   I use no porter or cheese in my family  but such as is made in America   the inaugural President George Washington wrote  boasting that these domestic products are  of an excellent quality  
One of the first acts of Congress Washington signed was a tariff among whose stated purpose was the encouragement and protection of manufactures  
In his 1790 State of the Union Address  Washington justified his tariff policy for national security reasons   A free people ought not only to be armed  but disciplined  to which end a uniform and well digested plan is requisite  and their safety and interest require that they should promote such manufactories as tend to render them independent of others for essential  particularly military  supplies  
 B  After the War of 1812  Jefferson s position began to resemble that of Washington  some level of protection was necessary to secure the nation s political independence He said   Experience has taught me that manufactures are now as necessary to our independence as to our comfort  and if those who quote me as of a different opinion will keep pace with me in purchasing nothing foreign where an equivalent of domestic fabric can be obtained  without regard to difference of price  
 C  Henry Clay s longtime rival and political opponent  President Andrew Jackson  in explaining his support for a tariff  wrote 
 We have been too long subject to the policy of the British merchants  It is time we should become a little more Americanized  and  instead of feeding the paupers and laborers of Europe  feed our own  or else  in a short time  by continuing our present policy  we shall all be paupers ourselves  
 D  President Abraham Lincoln declared   Give us a protective tariff and we will have the greatest nation on earth   Lincoln warned  The abandonment of the protective policy by the American Government  must produce want and ruin among our people  
Lincoln similarly said that   if a duty amount to full protection be levied upon an article  that could be produced domestically   at no distant day  in consequence of such duty   the domestic article will be sold to our people cheaper than before  
 E  President Theodore Roosevelt believed that America s economic growth was due to the protective tariffs  which helped her industrialize 
He acknowledged this in his State of the Union address from 1902 
 The country has acquiesced in the wisdom of the protective tariff principle  It is exceedingly undesirable that this system should be destroyed or that there should be violent and radical changes therein  Our past experience shows that great prosperity in this country has always come under a protective tariff  
In sum  the WWI and WWII era caused U S  Presidents to shift course and lower tariff rates to stimulate the global economy  as the world was coming out of those conflicts It remains to be seen if the U S  China trade war has it right  in calling for a new global trade regime  with higher tariff barriers protecting manufacturers and steel makers and the like from low cost competition 
Will the change in direction to higher tariffs be reversed in due course  by another election 
Or ignored or altered substantially by the U S  Congress We shall see

22251,243766,AVAV,4 Defense Stocks Your Portfolio Must Have In 2019 ,opinion,Defense stocks have had a great run since Donald Trump s ascension to the post of the United States  President  courtesy of his humongous defense spending plan  Further  Trump s efforts to improve the U S  defense forces have also paved the way for the sector s gains Meanwhile  geopolitical conflicts continue to flare up on a global scale  and the magnitude of existing issues carries the potential to bolster growth for U S  defense companies in 2019 as well Moreover  President Trump has allegedly asked his Defense Secretary to present a  750 billion defense budget proposal for fiscal 2020  per a report by Politico  Under such circumstances  adding defense stocks to one s portfolio seems prudent Defense Stocks on a TearPresident Donald Trump has just finished two years in office and defense stocks have rallied significantly  As a matter of fact  the iShares U S  Aerospace   Defense  ITA  ETF has surged more than 30  since Jan 19  2017  Moreover  in the same time period  the ETF has also outperformed the S P 500  which has gained 18  Further  gains for the ITA were buoyed by the steady increase in shares of Boeing   NYSE BA    AeroVironment   NASDAQ AVAV   and Aerojet Rocketdyne   NYSE AJRD    These stocks have surged more than 200  in the past two years America s Space AmbitionsAs proposed by both Vice President Mike Pence and President Trump  the newest branch of U S  military would be incorporated by 2020  The force would be officially called  Space Operations Force   America is specifically interested in laying out a layer of sensors in space that can easily detect enemy strikes at the moment of launch Pence urged the U S  Congress to earmark  8 billion over the next five years for the much ambitious project  He also stated that a fully incorporated space force is going to cost much more Notably  the Deputy Defense Secretary  Patrick Shanahan has stated that Pentagon has not commented on the exact cost of the project  Meanwhile  Defense Secretary  James Mattis  who had earlier objected to the program  has now stated that he supports it    Defense Budget to Rake in Big Gains for the SectorAmerica s defense sector has gained significantly from the Republican controlled Congress  humongous defense budget  Moreover  it goes without saying that GOP s tax overhaul late last year also provided the sector with the required stimulus for growth According to a Bloomberg report  the United States increased missile defense spending by 25  to  9 9 billion in the current fiscal year  Also  in September 2018 the Pentagon announced it would approximately spend  2 billion over the next five years on development of artificial intelligence  AI  Interestingly  the removal of  sequestration  budget caps last year by the Congress has been a welcome relief for the sector  The amendment also lifted limits on defense spending that have been around from 2013  Finally  the most recent defense spending bill was passed without any  continuing resolution  which enabled companies to gauge their future sales better 4 Best ChoicesPresident Trump s huge defense spending bill

Winners from Trump s First 2 Years in OfficeIt s been two years since businessman and television personality Donald Trump has been elected as the President of the United States  During this phase  Trump has taken credit for how well the stock market has performed due to some of his signature policies  However  it wasn t all hunky dory for the market In his first year  stocks scaled record highs  with the tech laden Nasdaq surging 27  since January 2017  marking the index s best rally under a Republican president  according to Dow Jones Market Data But  last year was pretty rough for the stock market  The Nasdaq lost 2 4  in 2018  sharply underperforming its yearly average gain of 6 9   The broader S P 500 also shed 4 9  versus an average gain of 5 4  during a similar time frame  while the Dow Jones fell 5 2  compared with a rise of almost 5 5  A rough 2018  indeed  dented Trump s two year performance  with the S P 500 leaving him with the 10th best percentage gain among the 23 presidents  Compared to Republican presidents  it was the fifth best performance out of 11  data showed So  what haunted the markets last year   The Federal Reserve s hiking of interest rates took a toll  The hike in rates  especially  increases the cost of lending money from financial institutions for small and medium business houses  This in turn could exert more pressure on the U S  economy that is on the cusp of a slowdown this year Prolonged trade war with China coupled with the fallout from the partial government shutdown might also cap the market s upside  Needless to say  that these concerns easily overshadowed the benefits of the large tax cuts and deregulatory efforts taken by the Trump administration Thus  not all stocks have performed well over the president s two years in office  Still  there are stocks that did outperform the broader S P 500 during the Trump presidency  which makes them enticing investment picks Defense   Tech Stocks Are Big Winners Defense and tech stocks have gained the most since Trump became the President  Since Jan 19  2017 the iShares U S  Aerospace   Defense  ITA  ETF has jumped more than 30   Meanwhile  the S P 500 tech sector has risen more than 37   Both of them  thus  have easily surpassed the S P 500  which is up 18  Defense stocks  in particular  benefited from Trump policy  The fiscal 2018 federal budget saw massive increase in military spending through 2020  Trump assured that despite high profile troop withdrawal by the end of last year  he won t be curtailing military outlays  Rather  he promised to increase spending during a visit to Iraq after Christmas Promises of pro business legislation by Trump have primarily supported the gains for the software industry and the manufacturers of the internal technologies   the semiconductor makers  The House has lowered the corporate tax rate  As a result  tech companies  after tax earnings improved and led to repatriation of trillions of dollars held abroad by such companies  Tech companies used this extra cash for research and developments  and mergers and acquisitions Top 5 PicksGains in the ITA were largely driven by a select group of companies   Over the past two years  these stocks have more than doubled  Other solid stocks from the defense sectors were up nearly 100  during the time period In the tech sector  several companies more than doubled

22387,243902,AVAV,Raytheon Secures  205 2M Deal For Phalanx Weapon System,opinion,"Raytheon Company s   NYSE RTN   Missile Systems   MS   unit recently won a contract to manufacture land based Phalanx weapon system  Work related to the deal is scheduled to be completed by Dec  27  2023 
The contract  valued at  205 2 million  was awarded by the U S  Army Contracting Command  Redstone Arsenal  AL 
Significance of Phalanx Weapon System
The Phalanx weapon system is a rapid fire  computer controlled  radar guided gun that can destroy anti ship missiles and other close in threats on land as well as sea  On land  as part of the U S  Army s counter rocket  artillery and mortar systems  it detects and destroys incoming rounds  It also helps provide early warning of attacks 
Phalanx combines a proven 20 mm M61A1 Gatling gun  firing M 246 or M 940 self destruct rounds at a selectable rate of 3 000 or 4 500 shots per minute  It also includes advanced search and track Ku band radar featuring closed loop spotting technology to provide autonomous target detection and engagement  It can be interfaced with a multitude of sensors and systems designed to provide an overarching protection umbrella of sites on the ground 
What Favors Raytheon  
Raytheon is one of the best positioned large cap defense players  courtesy of non platform centric focus  The company is heavily investing in technological upgrades that boosted growth  The company s MS division recorded third quarter 2018 net sales of  2 082 million  up 7  from the year ago quarter s tally  Moreover  the company witnessed an increase in its order backlog of 8 9  year over year to a new record backlog of approximately  41 6 billion in the third quarter of 2018 
In recent times  increasing geographical tensions has boosted the demand for missile defensesystems  In June 2018  the U S  Senate approved the fiscal 2019 defense budget worth  717 billion  up 5  from the initial fiscal 2018 budget  We believe that Raytheon  being one of the prominent defense contractors  will benefit from the budget decision and similar contracts that will boost growth in the MS segment 
Other companies from the same space like Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings   NYSE AJRD    AAR Corp    NYSE AIR   and AeroVironment  Inc    NASDAQ AVAV   are also expected to gain significantly from the upward budget revision

22436,243951,AVAV,Trump Likely To Raise 2020 Defense Budget  5 Great Picks ,opinion,Even as markets continued to experience volatile trading on Dec 10  aerospace and defense stocks were staging a midday rally  Gains for the sectors were fueled by a report that President Trump has asked the Pentagon to raise its budget proposal for fiscal 2020  This is a complete turnaround from Trump s recent commitment to reduce defense spending in line with cuts planned at other federal agencies U S  companies ended up at the summit of the top 100 defense companies in the world in terms of sales in 2017  per a fresh study  Another factor boosting the defense sector at this point is a divided Congress  While the Trump administration is intent on boosting defense spending  Democrats have agreed to the defense budget for fiscal year 2019  Taking these factors into account  it makes sense to bet on defense stocks at this time  Defense Stocks Surge  Trump Proposes Budget HikeU S  stocks endured a particularly volatile Monday with the Dow recovering from a 500 point drop at the end of the session  Ultimately  markets finished in the green because of a tech stock rebound  But even when markets were moving lower early in the session  defense stocks were notching up gains Shares of Raytheon   NYSE RTN    Lockheed Martin   NYSE LMT   and Northrop Grumman   NYSE NOC   gained 3 7   4 6  and 4 9   respectively  General Dynamics   NYSE GD   increased 2 9  even as Boeing   NYSE BA   recovered to gain 1  The immediate trigger for these gains was a report by Politico per which President Trump has asked Defense Secretary James Mattis to present a  750 billion defense budget proposal for 2020  This is significantly higher than the  733 billion proposal which the Pentagon has been fighting for to date This also represents a complete turnaround for Trump  who has gone on record to describe the 2019 budget as  crazy   The President has even vowed to cut defense spending by around 5   in line with proposed cost cuts at other federal agencies Apparently  Trump believes that an inflated proposal will act as a  negotiating tactic   ensuring that the Democrats fail to push the final budget below the Pentagon s initial target of  733 billion  Divided Congress a Boon  US Companies Top ChartsMid term results have delivered a divided Congress with Democrats firmly in control of the House of Representatives  However  earlier this year  House and Senate Democrats voted overwhelmingly for the  716 billion defense budget for 2019  This means that defense stocks will not be harmed by the current gridlock in Washington since Democrats are unlikely to derail defense spending Meanwhile  U S  companies continued their dominance of the defense industry  per a fresh report from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute  SIPRI   According to the study  42 U S  companies were part of the top 100 largest defense companies in the world in terms of sales in 2017  Arms sales by U S  companies increased 2  during this period  accounting for 57  of the top 100 arms sales Our ChoicesDespite earlier promises to cut defense spending  Trump is likely to support a higher Pentagon budget for 2020  Also  Democrats are unlikely to derail 2019 s increase in defense spending despite gaining control of the House after recent mid term polls Additionally  U S  defense

InterestShares of Canopy Growth were up more than 6  in late afternoon trading Tuesday  as investors expressed optimism about the Senate s hemp legalization bill and management s comments about interest from institutional investors Members of the U S  Congress added a hemp legalization provision to the final version of the 2018 Farm Bill  and that law is now expected to be voted on later today  The provision received bipartisan support  with Senator Ron Wyden  D OR  helping the Democratic push and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell  R KY  signing the final bill language with a hemp pen on Monday McConnell called the inclusion of a hemp legalization provision a  victory for farmers and consumers throughout our country   while Wyden declared it a  huge win for Oregon farmers

Linton  BNN Bloomberg earlier Tuesday to tout the recent institutional support witnessed by cannabis producers  What you re seeing is retail jumping in and out  But when they get out  I think a lot of

missile defense system is specifically designed to counter threats from tactical ballistic missiles  cruise missiles and attacks from other advanced fighter aircraft  It also develops interceptors and has consistently upgraded this missile defense system in order to keep pace with the changing dynamics of modern warfare  The system s importance has shifted a notch higher wih the introduction of a

Purchase In the past few months  Sweden s political tensions with Russia have increased  Per a news com au release  this has been due to Russia s invasion and hostility towards Crimea and Ukraine

the accomplishment of repair  alteration  maintenance  and or modernization requirements on Navy nuclear aircraft carriers  Work related to the deal is scheduled to be completed by October 2022 Details of the DealValued at  91 million  the contract was awarded by the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard and Intermediate Maintenance Facility  Per the terms  the aforementioned tasks will be carried out in Puget Sound Naval Shipyard and Intermediate Maintenance Facility  PSNS and IMF  supported locations  It will be executed by personnel who are uniquely trained  qualified  and authorized to perform nuclear carrier propulsion plant maintenance Moreover  under the agreement  the PSNS and IMF labor force will accomplish time critical propulsion plant and plant related work on nuclear powered aircraft carriers scheduled for repair  alteration and or modernization over the next five years  Notably  the nuclear propulsion plant related efforts include technical support  planning  maintenance  repairs  corrective measures  testing and performance evaluations  and modernization efforts  Majority of the work related to this deal will be carried out in Bremerton  WA  Fiscal 2018 operations and maintenance  Navy  funds will be utilized to partially finance the contract Huntington Ingalls  Expertise in Aircraft CarriersAircraft carriers are the largest ships in the U S  Navy s fleet  Notably  Huntington Ingalls  Newport News has designed and built more than 30 aircraft carriers for the U S  Navy since 1933  These include all 10 Nimitz class  CVN 68  aircraft carriers currently in active service and the first ship of the next generation Gerald R  Ford class  CVN 78  aircraft carriers In 2017  the company delivered the U S  Navy s newest carrier   USS Gerald R  Ford  CVN 78    and continues to be the exclusive prime contractor for nuclear aircraft carrier refueling and complex overhaul  RCOH   It is currently performing the RCOH of USS George Washington  CVN 73   The aforementioned developments reflect the valued experience that Huntington Ingalls has in constructing nuclear aircraft carriers Our ViewHuntington Ingalls is one of the largest military shipbuilders in the United States  Over 70  of the active Navy fleet consists of this company s ships Also  this military shipbuilder s Newport News division is the nation s sole designer  builder and refueler of nuclear powered aircraft carriers  It also offers one of only two shipyards capable of designing and building nuclear powered submarines  As a result  this division frequently secures shipbuilding related contracts from the U S  Navy and the country s foreign allies  In the first quarter of 2018  this segment witnessed more than 11  sales improvement owing to higher revenues in naval nuclear support services and aircraft carriers Considering this division s proven expertise in delivering top notch aircraft carriers to the U S  Navy  we may expect the company to go on winning contracts like the latest one  This  in turn  is likely to enable the Newport News division to deliver solid top line result in quarters ahead The U S  budget proposal for fiscal 2019 includes incremental funding for nuclear aircraft carriers  CVN 79 and CVN 80  For CVN 78  the financial plan aims at spending  1 8 billion Moreover  the fiscal 2019 baseline budget submission of  179 1 billion for the Department of the Navy reflects an increase of 4  from the fiscal 2018 budget request  Such impressive budget plan further strengthens growth prospect for shipbuilders like Huntington Ingalls Price PerformanceIn a year s time  shares of Huntington Ingalls have rallied about 13 1  compared with the broader  s 41 3  gain  The underperformance can be attributed to the company s limited commercial

22705,244220,AVAV,Boeing Secures Navy Deal To Modernize F A 18   EA 18G Jets,opinion,The Boeing Company   NYSE BA   recently won a task order to support F A 18 A F and EA 18G aircrafts for the U S  Navy and the government of Australia   Work related to the deal is scheduled to be over by July 2022 Details of the DealValued at  22 6 million  the contract was awarded by the Naval Air Systems Command  Patuxent River  Maryland  Per the terms  this aircraft behemoth will procure the non recurring engineering required for the redesigning of the Data Bus Interface Unit and the Deployable Flight Incident Recorder of the Deployable Flight Incident Recording Set  DFIRS  to support the aforementioned jets Apart from addressing obsolescence issues  this redesigning will provide additional memory and a 406 MHz beacon capability  The latest order also includes the development of three DFIRS Automated Test Station testing assets to support the modernizing process and development related activities  These testing assets will be used during the production of the redesigned DFIRS system  The majority of the work will be performed in St  Louis  MO and Ontario  Canada  Fiscal 2018 aircraft procurement  Navy  and foreign military sales funds will be utilized to finance this project A Brief Note on F A 18 and E A 18Boeing s F A 18 Block III Super Hornet is a twin engine  supersonic  all weather multirole fighter jet  The U S  Navy s tactical and air superiority aircraft is capable of performing virtually every mission in the tactical spectrum  including air superiority  day night strike with precision guided weapons  fighter escort  close air support  suppression of enemy air defenses  maritime strike  reconnaissance  forward air control and tanker missions Boeing s EA 18G Growler is the most advanced airborne electronic attack platform which operates from either an aircraft carrier or from land bases  The Growler aircraft has 11 weapon stations for carrying electronic mission systems and weapons  The major contractor Northrop Grumman  NYSE NOC  manufactures the rear and center fuselage sections and is also responsible for the manufacture of the structural components Notably  DFIRS provides rescue teams with an efficient means of finding survivors in case of accidents  Therefore  we believe that the system redesigning and upgrade should ensure further flight safety for the aforementioned military jets What s Favoring Boeing Boeing is one of the major players in the defense business and stands out among its peers by virtue of its broadly diversified programs  strong order bookings and solid backlog  In first quarter 2018  revenues at its defense segment   Boeing Defense  Space   Security  BDS    increased 13  year over year to  5 76 billion  Boeing s backlog at BDS stood at  50 billion  36  of which comprised orders from international clients  In particular  among other defense equipment  the company s key forte has been combat proven aircraft  Also  Boeing has been winning a huge number of contracts from the Pentagon for long  courtesy of its proven expertise in aerospace programs Inevitably  Boeing has been witnessing strong demand for its fighter aircrafts and major aerospace programs  including the F 18 and EA 18 aircrafts  This is evident from the contract that it secured for 28 F 18 Super Hornets in the first quarter  for Kuwait  We believe this latest contract to substantiate Boeing jet fighters  strong position in the global market Meanwhile  in February 2018  President Trump proposed fiscal

22773,244288,AVAV,Trumpiversary  Here Are The Winners   Losers,opinion,Before President Trump s election  many pundits found it difficult to assess the outcome of his victory as his proposals seemed contradictory or lacked details  On the contrary  such pro economic policies helped technology and financial stocks rise sharply  helping Wall Street s major equity indicators showing the best rally in the past 81 years Defense stocks have  in fact  left the rest in the dust  The sector gained the most following tensions between Trump and North Korea  Trump s Afghanistan strategy has also lent such stocks a fillip  However  not everyone has partaken in this year long rally  Let us thus take a look at the potential gainers and losers of the  Trump trade  Trump Rally Fed Off Wall Street AnxietyIt s been a year since Trump s stunning performance on election night that had rattled the global equity market  The Dow futures tumbled nearly 900 points as investors remained concerned about Trump s questionable campaign promises on trade and immigration But  investors  apprehensions ebbed by morning and U S  stocks started moving north  In fact  the Dow s 1 year gain since Trump s win turned out to be the highest post Election Day rise since 1945  The blue chip gauge surged 28 5  since Nov 8  2016 The S P 500 also rallied 21  since the close of trading on Election Day 2016  This is the benchmark index s third best performance during a President s first election since World War II  lagging that of Presidents John F Kennedy  1960  29   and George H  W  Bush  1988  23    as per Sam Stovall of CFRA Research Though Trump had taken over a progressing economy with the stock market near an all time high  his pro growth and business friendly policies as well as bets on deregulation gave investors ample scope Technology and Financials Benefit From Trump PolicyPromises of pro business legislation by Trump have primarily supported the gains for the software industry and the manufacturers of the internal technologies   the semiconductor makers  The House s latest corporate tax plan will lower taxes from 35  to 20   As a result  tech companies  after tax earnings will improve and lead to repatriation of trillions of dollars held abroad by such companies  Tech companies can use this extra cash for research and developments  and mergers and acquisitions If the bill turns into a law  tech bigwigs including Apple Inc    NASDAQ AAPL   and Microsoft Corporation   NASDAQ MSFT   as well as semiconductor giant NVIDIA Corporation   NASDAQ NVDA    will largely benefit as they have billions of dollars stashed outside the United States  In fact  NVIDIA   Zacks Rank  2  Buy  stock   became the biggest gainer since the election  up a staggering 209   Looking at the big picture  the technology sector is up around 39   You can see  Financials  in the meantime  has benefitted from the possibility of deregulating the sector  At the same time  Trump appointed Jerome Powell as the next Federal Reserve chairman  someone who favors his regulatory changes Trump views the Dodd Frank regulatory overhaul as a harsh measure  especially  on smaller banks  Trump has called for repealing parts of the Dodd Frank Act  which has for a considerable period of time limited operational flexibility  Trump s administration also aims at increasing the minimum asset threshold for banking behemoths  which will lend more flexibility  boost valuations  strengthen consolidation and increase lending  The value of stock and options held by Jamie Dimon  the CEO of JPMorgan Chase   Co  NYSE JPM    turned out to be the highest since Trump s win  while the broader financial sector soared almost 35  in the said period Defense Stocks   By Far the Best TradeAerospace and the defense sector has been the best trade since Trump s election  While deal making activity boosted the sector  Trump s unrelenting war of words against Pyongyang provided enough impetus to the sector to climb further north Let us also not forget that Trump revealed a reversal of strategy in Afghanistan  promising to  fight to win  instead of withdrawing entirely  He vowed to ramp up U S  engagement in Afghanistan  the country s longest war to date  He added that moving troops away from Afghanistan would create a  vacuum   which terrorists would  instantly fill  Kratos Defense   Security Solutions  Inc    NASDAQ KTOS    AeroVironment  Inc    NASDAQ AVAV   and Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings  Inc    NYSE AJRD   have been the best performing components in the defense sector  with their stock value doubling since Trump s victory Aerospace company Boeing  NYSE BA  Co gained the maximum at 87  since the election  Trump s pledge to significantly increase federal spending related to national security was cheered by Republicans and helped defense and aerospace stocks scale higher  He had promised to seek a  54 billion hike in spending on tanks  ships and weapon systems  The defense budget will climb 10   according to the White House  while Trump recommended  30 billion in supplementary military spending for this year Which Sectors Are Not So Lucky Not everyone  though  has participated in the year long rally  The three worst performing sectors since Trump s election have been consumer staples  energy and telecommunication services  While staples and energy managed to eke out marginal gains  telecommunications tanked nearly 10  While volatility in oil prices during Trump s regime made investors cautious from investing in the energy sector  staples and telecommunications were affected due to higher interest rates  The Federal Reserve has lifted rates twice this year and is expected to raise it again next month Retailers too have been affected during Trump s regime  as they continue to adapt to changing consumer tastes and preferences as well as evolving shopping methods  Notably  Macy s Inc   NYSE M   was among the biggest losers since the election  down 52 3   Currently  the omnichannel retail company has a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest StrategiesIt s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But while the market gained  18 8  from

22836,244351,AVAV,Two Ways To Play The Highflying Drone Market,opinion,"Imagine a world where soldiers can take out the bad guys without putting their own lives on the line 
Or a world where farmers can plant their fields   without stepping foot outside  Or where catastrophic leaks from fuel storage tanks could be prevented long before it s too late 
Well  thanks to the work of aerial drones  all three of these scenarios   and many more   are possible right now 
In fact  drone technology has become so widespread and affordable that regular folks like you and me can simply pick one up in a store  And on Monday  the Federal Aviation Administration announced that over 770 000 drone registrations have been filed in just the last 15 months 
As senior analyst Jonathan Rodriguez details below  this market is exploding right now  And he ll show you two ways to play the incredible upside 
Unmanned aerial vehicles  or drones  might be the most important tech device on the market since the smartphone 
In fact  consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers estimates the global drone market will be worth  127 billion by 2020 
Unfortunately  when many people think of drones  controversial images of war come to mind 
That s not surprising  since drones are used prominently in the defense industry 
With good reason  Governments around the world have pushed in on them because they save the lives of countless soldiers around the world every day 
But drone technology has made its way into many other fields  too 
Drones are used in the entertainment industry for aerial filming  They re also being used in the freight industry  delivering packages to remote locations inaccessible by car  Drones are even being used to plant farmers  fields  shooting seeds right into the soil 
Heck  PwC believes the UAV market in agriculture alone could fetch  32 billion 
So how can you play the action 
The biggest share of the drone market is held by giant defense companies like Lockheed Martin Corp  NYSE LMT   and Boeing  NYSE BA  
But the small cap players in the space will offer the most compelling growth opportunities 
Here s how you can play the best of both worlds 
Play  1  Going Small for the Biggest Gains
AeroVironment Inc  NASDAQ AVAV  is a leading small cap tech company that specializes in unmanned aerial vehicles 
With a market cap of just  641 million  AeroVironment represents one of the drone market s juiciest growth plays 
The company manufactures drones for both military applications and agricultural support 
Its agriculture drones can create 3 D maps of fields for farmers for efficient planting 
And using infrared cameras  AVAV s drones can help farmers identify sick crops quickly   so they can be treated or removed 
The company booked  264 million in sales last year  and revenue has increased at a compound annual growth rate of 15  since 2004 
In 2016  the company posted earnings growth of more than 205   And on a forward basis  the company is expected to boost EPS by 141   That s nearly double the EPS growth rate of the aerospace industry  76 3   
Better still  the firm sits on  194 million in cash and carries zero debt 
The company s phenomenal bottom line growth and lean balance sheet also make it a prime takeover target 
Play  2  Trade a Mega Cap Defense Stock at a Bite Sized Price
Northrop Grumman Corp   NYSE NOC  is one of America s largest defense contractors 
The company makes several combat drones  including the MQ 8C unmanned helicopter and the popular RQ 4 Global Hawk 
Last year  Northrop Grumman was awarded a  108 million contract from the U S  Navy to deliver 10 MQ 8C units by August 2019  This will bring the Navy s total MQ 8C fleet up to 29 
And the company snagged a  204 million contract with the U S  Air Force to upgrade its existing fleet of Global Hawk drones 
The company s aerospace division  which includes UAVs  booked  10 billion in sales last year  The aerospace unit accounted for 44  of the firm s total revenue of  25 billion 
So Northrop Grumman s exposure to the red hot drone market is large 
Instead of buying the shares outright  which run about  239  I d recommend the January 2018  260 call options  which are trading for just  7 20 
This offers you leverage of about 33 1 to owning shares 
The options break even if the underlying shares hit  267 by expiration  and the calls double in value if shares reach  273 
Bottom line  With these two plays  you get the best of both worlds  a highflying small cap drone company  along with low risk  high reward exposure to one of the world s largest aerospace players ",2017-03-29,Wall Street Daily,https://www.investing.com/analysis/two-ways-to-play-the-highflying-drone-market-200180542,200180542

AVAV Technical Analysis



AVAV opened trading yesterday at  31 11 which was up from the previous day s trading close of  30 97  Shares closed trading yesterday at  32 49 and crashed down in the  to  30 30  equivalent to a 7  decrease from the closing price  Taking a look at the daily chart we can see the last time AVAV traded below these levels we have to go back to May 11th when it traded at  29 77 

Taking a closer look at the daily chart we can see that before the spike down AVAV had been in an overall upward  dating back to January 23rd when it traded at  25 00  AVAV has a  of 20 36 million shares and traded 4 86 times the normal daily trading volume on Tuesday 

For trading purposes  I would like to see AVAV open trading on Wednesday below  31 00 and if it does I would be looking to take a short position at the bell  My  would be  0 25 from my entry position fearing anything more than that and the stock would start to fill in the gap down

22863,244378,AVAV,4 Ways To Invest In The Drone Industry Right Now,opinion," 0     Andrew Chanin and IFLY ETF 2     What Is The Business Application For Drones  5     Amazon s Drone Usage 8     Who Are The Leaders In The Drone Market  12     Will The Drone Market Be Worth  127 Billion By 2020  14     Episode Roundup  Podcast Zacks comSince President Trump took office  he has promised massive increases in defense and military spending  Some of the biggest names in the aerospace and defense industries are certainly benefitting  but so are smaller corners of the market  specifically drones 
Drones and drone technology are quickly becoming a huge opportunity for both companies and investors  with the global drone market  127 billion by 2020  During a special edition of the Zacks Friday Finish Line  hosts Maddy Johnson and Ryan McQueeney were joined by Andrew Chanin  the CEO of PureFunds  in order to parse through the quickly evolving drone sector 
PureFunds is a New York City based research firm that serves as the sponsor of 8 different thematic ETFs  including funds that focus on big data  cybersecurity  and health and medical technology  In particular  Andrew discussed the PureFunds Drone Economy Strategy ETF   the first ETF focused on the emerging commercial drone market  and one that provides an instrument for investing in this omnipresent technology segment 
State of the Industry
Andrew gave insight into the differences between commercial drones and drones used for military purposes  as well as which industries are looking to benefit from drone technology  Technically speaking  drones are a type of unmanned aerial vehicle  UAV   meaning a drone is an aircraft that flies by itself with no pilot or passengers 
Drones have been used for years by the U S  military  but are just now starting to be utilized commercially for consumers  E commerce giant Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN   is testing drones to deliver packages  while fast casual restaurant chain Chipotle   NYSE CMG   wants to use drones to deliver its burritos  Even hobbyists can purchase their own personal GoPro   NASDAQ GPRO   Karma drone to achieve  Hollywood caliber footage   and that s just the tip of the iceberg 
Stocks to Watch
AeroVironment Inc    NASDAQ AVAV   is probably the purest play option for those looking to invest in drones  apart from rival DJI  which is still a privately held company  AeroVironment is a profitable  small cap company that has both military and civilian clients  and its Raven drone model is the most widely used small scale drone in the world 
Sitting at a  1  Strong Buy  on the Zacks Rank  shares of AeroVironment have been  over the past year  and returned 30 5  compared to the  industry gain of 20 2   While AVAV stock does have a volatile history  its earnings growth looks promising  For the current quarter  the drone maker expects year over year earnings growth of almost 34  and sales growth of 20 56  
Another way to invest in drones  even if it s indirectly  is through traditional aerospace companies  One of the biggest aerospace and defense giants today is Lockheed Martin   NYSE LMT    and the firm is already responsible for many of the drones used by the U S  military  It continues to put its drone business front and center  Lockheed is also looking to begin manufacturing armed drones  which could be a big boon to its bottom line  especially if the Department of Defense continues to support the sale and use of them internationally 
Lockheed Martin is a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   with a VGM score of  B   Its industry    rests in the top 45  of all industries ranked on the Zacks Industry Rank  and this could improve if President Trump s defense budget gets approved  Lockheed has posted an earnings beat for the past four consecutive quarters  and has an average surprise of 13 88   For the current year  the company expects year over year earnings growth of 1 16  
Northrop Grumman   NYSE NOC    another legacy aerospace company  has also long been a key drone player  Its Global Hawk unmanned aerial vehicles were used in U S  military operations shortly after 9 11  and became a regular part of procedures since then  Northrop s largest sales division is its Aerospace segment  which includes drones  and while drones aren t broken out  the technology remans a significant part of future growth for the company 
Northrop currently sits at a  2  Buy  on the Zacks Rank  For the current quarter  the company expects year over year earnings growth almost 9   with sales growth of about 3 5  in the same time frame  For the current year  earnings are expected to grow nearly 12   Northrop has beaten earnings expectations in the past four consecutive quarters  and has an average earnings surprise of 10 87  
Bottom Line
Like all new technologies  drones are continuously changing  and new investment opportunities will likely arise as the technology evolves  Don t be surprised if other tech giants like Alphabet   NASDAQ GOOGL   beef up their drone offerings  following in Amazon s footsteps  But if you re looking to add drone stocks to your portfolio today  the list above is a good place to start 
5 Trades Could Profit  Big League  from Trump Policies 
If the stocks above spark your interest  wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington s changing course Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals  tariffs  lower taxes  higher interest rates  and spending surges in defense and infrastructure ",2017-06-29,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/4-ways-to-invest-in-the-drone-industry-right-now-200198572,200198572
22864,244379,AVAV,Tech Trifecta  3 ETFs For The Top Trio Of Technology Trends,opinion,"If you are willing to overlook the current fear about over valuation in tech stocks  you can buy a cap weighted tech ETF and as the Big 5 go so goes your ETF  which is definitely not a bad thing  
Or  instead  you can buy a tech equal weighted ETF and get broader diversification  also not a bad thing   You can slice and dice between large cap and small cap  US and foreign and on and on 
For me  however  selecting ETFs that best represent what I see as the top tech trends beats any other approach 
Technology continues to change our lives   mostly for the better  Whether it is advances in medical care  like less invasive surgery  cheaper and better energy production via hydraulic fracturing  onshoring  more manufacturing via robotics  or improving the safety of our automobiles  aircraft and other modes of transportation  technology is everywhere around us and everywhere having an impact 
Many of the companies investing the most in technology are not considered  tech companies  per se because they are on the leading edge of technology uses well beyond Silicon Valley  Innovation is where you find it  For me  limiting my interest to  Internet based  tech such as browsers and big data domination  or  social media  leadership  or  e retailing  hegemony misses the whole point of how technology can be a force for powering the economy and energizing industry 
If you disagree and want only those companies in quotation marks above  almost any passive cap weighted ETF will do  PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1  NASDAQ QQQ  and Fidelity NASDAQ Composite  NASDAQ ONEQ   while not really  tech  funds  but because they are cap weighted   have portfolios dominated by tech companies  For purer play ETFs like iShares Global Tech  NYSE IXN   Technology Select Sector SPDR  NYSE XLK   Vanguard Information Technology  NYSE VGT   Fidelity MSCI Information Technology  NYSE FTEC   iShares US Technology  NYSE IYW   and iShares North American Tech  NYSE IGM   the percentage of the portfolio in techs is even higher 
From a purely investment standpoint  the most successful way to have profited from tech stocks in the past couple years has been to buy the FAANGs   Facebook  NASDAQ FB   Apple  NASDAQ AAPL   Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   Netflix  NASDAQ NFLX  and the different iterations of Google  NASDAQ GOOGL    The next best was to buy ETFs like those above since the FAANGs are typically 20 40  or more of their portfolios  It is a given in many quarters that the question isn t if  it s when  everything we do will be either controlled by or of direct and immediate benefit and massive profit to these companies  so there was no concern for what price one paid 
The big discussion on tech message boards was more about whether Google would conquer all   or would it be Amazon  Such narratives are dangerous 
Thinking in a linear fashion   that what is will continue to be and can be meaningfully extrapolated into the distant future  or in a binary way  that if Outcome A doesn t happen that means that Outcome B must   is a sure path to a pauper s grave  Right now  critical thinking and a little review of history are of far greater value 
John D  Rockefeller s Standard Oil empire was to the industrial age and automobile transportation infancy what today s FAANGs are for many  an unstoppable force  Until the politicians stepped in  as they did with DuPont  NYSE DD   the New Haven Railroad and 40 others  a politician can destroy a hegemon in the blink of a regulation or the hint of a busted trust 
More recently  when Apple looked to be down for the count  Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT  was the company in every institutional portfolio  The future was computing and Microsoft controlled the operating system that allowed us to compute  Then Microsoft took a hard fall  It took a complete reassessment and a lot of innovation for Microsoft to regain some of its former glory   But FAMNAGs just doesn t roll off the tongue as smoothly  so MSFT is unlikely to bump through into the higher acronymic atmosphere  
Even if no rabble rousing politician or politicians change the course of success for these companies  some of us are reluctant to buy something so highly valued during what may prove to be so late in the cycle  I just can t bring myself to pay close to 200 times earnings and receive not a penny in dividends from the likes of Amazon or Netflix  brilliant companies with first mover advantage and moats they are reinforcing and expanding daily 
However  I try never to let my respect for a company  or its management  or its service  cloud my judgment as to the value of its shares at a given price  I can love Amazon  and do  without thinking their stock  has to  continue on its current linear route with nary a bump in the road 
That brings us to equal weighted tech ETFs  They make more sense  at least on paper  and in a  normal  market   whatever that is   they will provide better diversification and might also provide better total returns  But not lately 
The momentum has clearly been with the mega giants that comprise the FAANGs and a few of their closest friends  NVIDIA  NASDAQ NVDA   Microsoft  etc   To buy into the equal weighted philosophy is easy  but the reality has been that you have been left well behind the major tech moves if you did so   up until now anyway  Guggenheim Invest S P 500 Equal Weight Technology  NYSE RYT  is the best known of these funds  but Direxion NASDAQ 100 Equal Weighted Shares  NYSE QQQE  and First Trust NASDAQ 100 Equal Weighted  NASDAQ QQEW  are also reasonably sized players in this space 
Going global is not difficult  Many passive  cap weighted tech ETFs invest globally  not just in the US  The exception is if the index is a subset of the S P 500   S P banished foreign names from the S P 500 a while ago so if getting a piece of Tencent  HK 0700  OTC TCEHY  or Baidu  NASDAQ BIDU  or whatever foreign security you d like to own you probably don t want to buy XLK 
Then there is the way I am currently investing for my family accounts and clients  I don t always mind passive   as long as I control the sector   sub sector decision  whether it is domestic or global  and fundamentally or equally or cap weighted 
No matter how you slice it  any bet on tech involves a guess   forecast   prognostication about what our world will look like in coming years and how technological solutions will solve problems and form new industries  And as I alluded above  I think the technology that created the ability for horizontal fracturing with high speed drills and better seismic data will make North America the new Middle East of gas and oil  For the benefits to the economy  the work force and the national defense  this tech innovation is at least on a par with e tailing or social media 
I am not discounting the intellectual and culture changing significance of e tailing and social media or the encyclopedic value of having searched for information available at our fingertips  But if you didn t already jump on board  I think there are better valuations and similar growth to be found elsewhere  A move from 950 to 1250 is impressive  But no different  in terms of portfolio return  than a move from 95 to 125   or 9   to 12 1 2 
I see three sub sectors with the greatest combination of  1  world changing innovation and  2  valuations that are reasonable given their growth prospects 
The three areas I see the greatest future for are 

Cybersecurity 
Robotics  and
Artificial Intelligence  AI 

In the Intelligence Community we long ago treated hacking  spoofing  phishing and such as what it is  cyber warfare  The corporate  non defense and intelligence government agencies  and individual users as well  are now beginning to realize this is not only warfare  it is truly The Long War 
It doesn t matter how secure you believe you are  some sad little nonentity is working in his mom s basement to penetrate your defenses  steal your data  encrypt it  then ransom it back to you  if they feel like it after they ve gotten your money   Or maybe he ll only destroy all your most important files just because he s just a malicious little SOB 
Magnify this scenario 1000 times and put billions of dollars and tens of thousands of government hackers behind it and you have Russian  Chinese or other type of propaganda delivered by parties separated 15 or 150 times removed from the true source  plans by potential adversaries to knock out electric power  water and sewer  etc  in mid winter  asymmetrically knock out battlefield innovations like GPS and IFF  Identification Friend or Foe  and so on  All without firing a single shot 
Cybersecurity is an industry really in its infancy  We all need to do a better job of protecting everything from our personal files to our national infrastructure 
The way we protect ourselves from this is called  cybersecurity   Cybersecurity is the corpus of physical protection and various technologies and processes designed to protect networks  data  and computers from damage  attack or any kind of unauthorized access  It also involves a component not always considered when defining it but critical to success  end user education 
As well  cybersecurity is an industry really in its infancy  We all need to do a better job of protecting everything from our personal files to our national infrastructure 
I use the analogy of electronic warfare  EW  to place cybersecurity in context  The moment an adversary reaches a breakthrough in electronic warfare  we need to find a counter EW technology or process  Then the enemy creates a counter counter EQW platform or process  or Like EW  cybersecurity is constantly evolving   One of the Department of Defense s prime cybersecurity contractors is CA Technologies  One of its CTOs before CA acquired Layer 7 Technologies said it best a few years ago 

 The threat is advancing quicker than we can keep up with it  The threat changes faster than our idea of the risk  It s no longer possible to write a large white paper about the risk to a particular system  You would be rewriting the white paper constantly    

How big is the cybersecurity market  Big enough to accommodate every firm in every cybersecurity ETF  According to Forbes  the global cybersecurity market reached  75 billion for 2015 and is expected to hit  170 billion in 2020 
There are two fine ETFs in the cybersecurity industry  I like them both equally well and own roughly equivalent amounts of each  The first is the PureFunds ISE Cyber Security ETF  NYSE HACK   Its biggest holdings include Palo Alto Networks NYSE PANW   Akamai Technologies  NASDAQ AKAM   Barracuda Networks  NYSE CUDA   Gigamon  NYSE GIMO   and FireEye  NASDAQ FEYE   The First Trust NASDAQ Cybersecurity ETF  NASDAQ CIBR  shares its two top spots with those of HACK but then follows these with Cisco  NASDAQ CSCO   Juniper Networks  NYSE JNPR  and Symantec  NASDAQ SYMC  
Both have the exact same management expenses  0 6   though HACK is the older of the two  by a few months  and hence got the bigger share of total assets  HACK has  1 14 billion in assets and average volume of 318 000 shares a day traded  CIBR has  263 million in assets and trades just over 66 000 per day on average  HACK has more smaller firms which may be more nimble  CIBR has more large  better capitalized companies in its stable  Both are well worth your consideration 
If I were only to buy one  it would be CIBR  It is volume weighted rather than cap weighted so it attracts more liquid holdings  Personally I like bigger  maybe slower  firms with deeper pockets  We re talking a  170 billion dollar sized pie in just 3 years  I think those firms with the deepest pockets will spend the most on R D and acquire many of the younger firms  I also really respect First Trust s research methodology 
Moving on  many investors confuse robotics and artificial intelligence  Some robotic applications require the use of artificial intelligence but many do not  The bad thing about humans is that we can be whip smart intelligent but often the more intelligent we are the more easily we become bored  Computers  at least so far  don t get bored  Programmed with a repetitive task such as on an assembly line  those robotic assemblies designed  controlled and maintained by humans will do the same task in the same way at the exact same point hundreds of thousands of times 
Enter ROBO   the Robo Global Robotics and Automation ETF  ROBO is very much a global ETF  Clearly the US doesn t have a lock on great automation companies  Notably missing among ROBO s top 25 holdings are mainland China firms   for good reason   There is just one that makes the cut  at 1 65  of the portfolio   Nine Japanese companies are represented however  with Switzerland  Taiwan  Germany and Finland rounding out the roster along with 11 US firms  Of course  China s problems are less about efficient use of new technologies than about keeping a potentially restive population employed 
Among ROBO s top holdings are iRobot  NASDAQ IRBT   Aerovironment  NASDAQ AVAV   Japan s Daifuku  T 6383   no US symbol   Intuitive Surgical  NASDAQ ISRG   and Japan s Keyence  T 6861   again  no US symbol   Given this global perspective and the cost of doing business on other world exchanges  ROBO has expenses of 0 95   It has total assets of  750 million and average daily volume in excess of 130 000 shares traded 
 Source  ROBO Global Q2 2017 Presentation
What s to like or not like about ROBO  Depending on your perspective  both answers are the same  The parent ETF provider has just one offering   ROBO in the US and a clone fund for the EU  So they conceived of the index their ETF is following  That may seem a bit incestuous to some  Or they are simply passionate about their product and focused on its success  You decide  One way to do that is to visit their website  roboglobal com  I appreciate seeing the panoply of information available and recommend their website for your due diligence 
Finally  if you are looking for an ETF that features companies applying artificial intelligence in the real world  you might consider the ARK Industrial Innovation ETF  NYSE ARKQ   ARK Industrial Innovation is likely to be more volatile than the others so a smaller position may be warranted for those who don t care for volatility 
Why might it be more volatile  Well  it s top 5 holdings comprise 40  of the portfolio and they are all market darlings that have risen astronomically over the past few years  They are  Tesla  NASDAQ TSLA   of which I am not a particular fan  Israel s Stratasys  NASDAQ SSYS   NVIDIA  NASDAQ NVDA   Proto Labs  NYSE PRLB   and Amazon  AMZN   You want momentum stocks  This ETF s got big mo   which of course can up and bite you on the downside  ARKQ has an expense ratio of 0 75  and average daily trading volume of just 25 000  Enter limit orders 
This is an actively traded fund  not passive  with a manager defined roster of industries  primarily those in the robotics  3D printing and autonomous vehicle arena  Such narrow focus funds with large amounts in one or two or a half dozen companies live by the growth sword or die by the growth sword 
This is an exciting area and there is lots of good news yet to come as there are breakthroughs being made every day in this field  but I still consider this the riskiest of the three sub sectors covered here today  It is also a thematic ETF with a difficult to pin down theme   industrial innovation  which can take many forms and if portfolio manager Catherine Wood decides company XYZ is quite the innovator  in her opinion  they can add it  You  as the owner of this ETF  may decide that s not what you thought they meant 
Depending on your viewpoint  this may be the best   or worst    thing about ARKQ 

The ETF has a 94   active share  versus the S P  That doesn t mean it is uncorrelated to what happens in the stock markets but it does mean that if you want to diversify beyond the S P  here s a fund that has 94  of its portfolio in the stock of companies that are not in the S P 500 
Given ARKQ s momentum bias it isn t surprising that the company I believe will once more reinvent itself  this time as the leader in AI  isn t even in the top 25 holdings  I refer of course to IBM  NYSE IBM   Love it or hate it  never discount IBM s ability to rise from the ashes 
But that s a story for a whole  nuther article  Concluding this one  my trifecta of ETFs in the three tech areas I believe offer the greatest reward over the coming 5 10 years are  in order of my personal preference  CIBR  and or HACK   closely followed by ROBO  with ARKQ  a momentum favorite  receiving the smallest share of my portfolio 
Please remember  these ETFs invest in volatile industries  I suggest trailing stops  especially on ARKQ  In my case  this late in a wonderful bull  buying into these leading edge sub sectors  I m keeping stops very tight at 5  or so  Better to cut losses and buy again  hopefully at least another 5  below our selling price  That s short term  Long term  I think all three will reward me quite well

22865,244380,AVAV,Looking For A Top Momentum Stock  3 Reasons Why AeroVironment  AVAV  Is A Great Choice,opinion,Many investors like to look for momentum in stocks  but this can be very tough to define  There is great debate regarding which metrics are the best to focus on in this regard  and which are not really quality indicators of future performance  Fortunately  with our new  we have identified the key statistics to pay close attention to and thus which stocks might be the best for momentum investors in the near term This method discovered several great candidates for momentum oriented investors  but today let s focus in on AeroVironment  Inc    NASDAQ AVAV   as this stock is looking especially impressive right now  And while there are numerous ways in which this company could be a great choice  we have highlighted three of the most vital reasons for AVAV s status as a solid momentum stock below Longer Term Price Change for AeroVironmentWhile any stock can see a spike in price  it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market  That is why looking at longer term price metrics such as performance over the past three months or year   and comparing these to an industry at large can be very useful And in the case of AVAV  the results are quite impressive  The company has beaten out the industry at large over the past 12 weeks by a margin of 41 1  to 9 5  while it has also outperformed when looking at the past year  putting up a gain of 44 8   Clearly  AVAV is riding a bit of a hot streak and is worth a closer look by investors AeroVironment  Inc  Price   Fiscal Year EPS Estimate Change for AVAVIn addition to price performance  it is also important to take a look at earnings estimate changes for the full year  This can show if AVAV is poised to make a run based on fundamentals  or if the company is simply moving on speculation Over the past month  the full year earnings estimate for AVAV has risen by 11 3   On its own this is impressive  but consider that it also beats the industry average of 0  too  The trend is undeniably in AeroVironment s favor right now  and it suggests that the momentum might be long lasting for this stock Earnings Estimate Revisions Moving in the Right DirectionWhile the great momentum factors outlined in the preceding paragraphs might be enough for some investors  we should also take into account broad earnings estimate revision trends  A nice path here can really help to show us a promising stock  and we have actually been seeing that with AVAV as of late too Over the past two months  two earnings estimates have gone higher compared to none lower for the full year  while we are also seeing that one estimate has moved upwards with no downward revision for the next year time frame too  These revisions have helped to boost the consensus estimate as two months ago AVAV was expected to post earnings of 48 cents per share for the full year  though today it looks to have EPS of 53 cents for the full year  representing am increase which is something that should definitely be welcomed news to would be investors Bottom LineGiven these factors  investors shouldn t be surprised to note that we have AVAV as a security with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and a Momentum Score of  A   You can see  So if you are looking for a fresh pick that has potential to move in the right direction  definitely keep AVAV on your short list as this looks be a stock that is very well positioned to soar in the near term Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply  one company stands out as the  1 stock to buy according to Zacks research It s not the one you think ,2017-07-10,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/looking-for-a-top-momentum-stock-3-reasons-why-aerovironment-(avav)-is-a-great-choice-200200067,200200067

22868,244383,AVAV,FUNAC  This Robotics Wallflower Should Be On Your  Dance  Card,opinion,"Like Rodney Dangerfield  FUNAC Corp  don t get no respect

Yet FUNAC might be the considerably more interesting story  if only investors were willing to learn more about it 
FANUC  an acronym for Fuji Automatic Numerical Controls   Fujitsu spun it off decades ago  is not in the artificial intelligence business  No clever Watson thumping humans at Jeopardy here  And one of the ETFs I like for the broadest exposure to the field of robotics  Robo Stox Global Robotics and Automation  NASDAQ ROBO  has FANUC as only the 11th largest holding  well below UAV maker AeroVironment  NASDAQ AVAV  and Roomba vacuum cleaner marketer iRobot Corporation  NASDAQ IRBT  
 Of course  that s what Morningstar says as of 7 31  If you go to xtf com they say it is the  2 holding as of 7 31  Most likely  If you went to a third site  you d see something else  ROBO doesn t report daily so who knows  There s an object lesson here  just because the  data  is readily available on your favorite research sites don t expect the  data  to be correct at any given time  
Whether FANUC is second or 11th or somewhere in between  I d buy ROBO first for its overall exposure to the sector  But if you want a steady if boring market leader  you might want to conduct your due diligence on FANUC next  FANUC makes the mostly programmable machines that do the heavy lifting in industrial and manufacturing processes  No sexy robotic surgery here  Just the most profitable machines with the steadiest revenue stream 
FANUC is the Big Dog in industrial robots that many who don t know think is a wallflower  The company holds the most patents in the  Robotics  category of any company in the world  With offices in 46 countries  it is a constituent of both the Nikkei 225 and the TOPIX 100  In computerized numerical controls  FANUC s market share worldwide is 65   Their biggest clients are the Japanese and American automaker giants and global electronics manufacturers  For example  using FANAC robotics technology Panasonic  OTC PCRFY  turns out 2 million mostly high end LCD television screens per month   with just 25 workers 
You won t find FANUC sponsoring fancy road shows or begging to be interviewed on CNBC or Bloomberg  They let their results do the talking 
As for the press  FANUC brings new meaning to inscrutable  For most of its history  FANUC has not only eschewed the limelight  it has also turned down most requests for the time consuming and typically less profitable  custom  work that many companies in this category pursue  the sort of business where they send their engineers all over the globe to design and bid on a particular factory s needs with no guarantee of winning the contract 
Instead  FANUC has traditionally followed the three very basic guidelines below for all its R D 

Weniger Teile  German for  Fewer parts  
Reliability Up
Costs Down

What all this means is that FANUC will manufacture and sell the simplest to operate  fewest moving parts technology  consistent with fully satisfying the needs of the client  preferably using off the shelf parts that others in similar businesses have found to be successful  This means a machine that has been tested for long periods of time in different workplace environmental conditions on different continents and in different cultures and levels of workplace skill 
Reliability is the holy grail for a firm that makes 2 million LCD TV screens a month  One down day screws up the whole process 
Finally this kind of compulsive attention to small details  fewer parts  standardized parts and processes not only yields higher reliability  it also keeps costs down and profits up  The result is that FANUC s gross margins are often above 40   Their net margins are seldom less than 20   No one else in the robotics business even comes close 
The company s weighted average cost of capital is 6 3   their return on invested capital is 21 5   They carry no debt whatsoever  Their annual revenues are just under  8 billion for the trailing 12 months  the enterprise value is just over  33 billion and the market cap is 40 billion 
This is all very nice if you are only looking for a rock solid company with a small dividend  1 8   and steady growth  But where is the catalyst that will unlock its value and entice more people to invite it to The Dance 
FANUC has developed an integrated IoT  Internet of Things  system which will gain revenue from software developers using the platform to build applications for robots   Sort of like the way Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOGL  and Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  charge app providers using the Google Play and iOS app stores  
The following is from a November article in Manufacturing Automation Magazine  It is titled   How FUNAC s FIELD platform is poised to change automation  

 Analytics are found in most facets of our society today  and manufacturing is no exception  Analytics   colossal and powerful software programs able to automate or semi automate tasks and decisions   are becoming more prevalent  around the world  and for good reason 
 Simply put  the use of analytics in manufacturing provides improved machine reliability  product quality  process flexibility and assembly speed by enabling machines to intelligently coordinate and collaborate in a flexible manner in real time  One new analytics system expected to take manufacturing automation to a new level is the FUNAC Intelligent Edge Link and Drive  FIELD   created by Japan based global robotics specialist FUNAC  Partners in its development include Cisco  NASDAQ CSCO   digitization   Rockwell Automation  NYSE ROK   industrial automation  and Preferred Networks  artificial intelligence or AI  

 Author s Note  Excellent choice of partners  

 The FIELD platform combines AI and huge computational power to analyze data generated by robots and peripheral devices used in tasks such as bin picking  anomaly detection and failure prediction  In addition  it s also an open platform  so application developers  sensor and peripheral device makers  system integrators and others can use it as a launch pad to build solutions to help improve their equipment efficiency  manufacturing output and product quality  Some applications will be offered in a continuously growing portfolio to other robotics suppliers for download to their own robots  much like one downloads an app on a smartphone  says FUNAC 

 Author s Note  FANUC is shedding its reticence to engage with others   note this is now an open platform to ensure maximum input and speed of change  

 While it is one of several existing platforms for integrating the automation of industrial systems  some experts believe FIELD could become the standard for fully automating factories  and that it will allow much faster integration of robots and digital technologies compared to the existing pace of adoption  For its part  FUNAC says FIELD is nothing less than a system that will result  in sophisticated manufacturing practices not before possible    
  FIELD will take manufacturing automation to the next level by allowing devices to intelligently coordinate and collaborate in a flexible manner to achieve sophisticated manufacturing practices  Basically  it all comes down to the way FIELD connects parts of a factory to its central analytics  brain   so that incoming data from many sources can be analyzed on an ongoing basis by the analytics program  The analytics can therefore produce an updated  big picture  on which improved decisions can be made    With all the communications involved in FIELD  potentially among hundreds of devices  a key feature of the system is the way it strives to maintain secure communication  Working with Cisco  the FIELD system promises to provide network security that is essential to the manufacturing production operation  where the performance and integrity of the network must be maintained     the data on the FIELD system from various machines is used to do a variety of tasks  from setting up collaborations among equipment  optimizing individual asset performance  and to improve both tractability and quality control  In addition  having the system architecture in place on the manufacturing floor significantly increases the potential to incorporate new automation capabilities 
  Much of FIELD s power lies in its deep learning algorithms  developed by FUNAC in partnership with Preferred Networks  An example of deep learning implementation is robotic bin picking applications   selecting a single part at the right orientation from a pile of similar parts laying randomly in a bin   Bin picking has been considered a challenging application for robots  requiring skilled programmers   Tsai explains   By utilizing Preferred Network s deep learning technology  and having the FIELD system s edge heavy processing provide the computing power  FUNAC has been able to improve the bin pick success rate significantly with minimal teaching to the robot  The robots would learn by itself which part in the bin is positioned most optimal for picking through multiple trials   The deep learning includes  distributed learning capabilities   which means that robots on the FIELD network can share their knowledge  which significantly reduces bin picking learning time and provides other advantages   Rowan Trollope  senior vice president of Internet of Things  IoT  and Applications at Cisco  is unequivocal in his belief that FIELD is a true manufacturing game changer

22911,244426,AVAV,The Growing Link Between Tech And Agriculture,opinion,"If you think about it  farming and technology have always been joined at the hip 
In a bygone era  agriculture advanced on the back of inventions like the cotton gin  the reaper  and the thresher 
Today  farming involves the use of wireless technologies  GPS positioning  and lasers to be more efficient  However  tomorrow s farmers will be taking agriculture technology a bit further by using Big Data  robots  drones  and numerous other technological wonders 
Silicon Valley is moving into agricultural technology in a big way  In 2014  venture capital investment into agriculture and food startups soared to  976 million  according to Cleantech Group 
And the tech sector s involvement in the agriculture industry is only going to expand from here 
The Farmer Next Door  Google  NASDAQ GOOGL 
Silicon Valley s investments into agriculture roughly doubled between 2013 and 2014 
One prime example is the Farmers Business Network  This social network collects data on seeds and soil that farmers can use to review crop yields and seed performance  It has data from seven million acres of farmland in 17 U S  states   and is growing its membership by 30  per month 
The venture capital arm of Google just participated in a  15 million funding round for the Farmers Business Network  Other venture capital firms  like Kleiner Perkins and DBL Investors  have also jumped onboard 
There are a number of other startups in this field  too  including FarmLink  Agralogics  and Farmers Edge 
Publicly traded companies see the importance of Big Data in agriculture  as well 
Ag giant Monsanto  NYSE MON  acquired the weather data startup Climate Corp a few years ago for  1 billion  In December  after the takeover  Climate Corp purchased 640 Labs  a smaller farming data company 
And DuPont  NYSE DD  says it will generate  500 million in revenue from data related farming services over the next decade 
But there s more to this coming technological revolution than just data  There s also the practical matter of collecting the data 
That s where drones come in 
Drones Set to Invade American Farms
When it comes to the agriculture industry  this may be the year of the drone 
A number of other interesting startups  including Blue River Technology  Vine Rangers  and Precision Hark  are focused on using robotics and drones to increase farmers  productivity 
The increase in drone use is partially due to the Federal Aviation Administration s  FAA  section 333 exemption allowing commercial drones on a case by case basis 
That means  for the first time  drones can gather data on America s farmland over an entire growing season  Down the road  this type of data collection should help farmers with better crop rotation  water management  and use of pesticides 
A widely cited study by the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International forecasts that legalizing commercial drones will generate over  80 billion in economic impact over the next decade  with agricultural drones providing the most impetus 
The FAA s relaxed rules may also open the door for companies like AeroVironment  Inc   NASDAQ AVAV  and Trimble Navigation  NASDAQ TRMB  that already have agriculture drones  These firms have just been waiting for regulations to catch up with the technology 
It s lucky for us that these companies are able to hit the ground running  too  Because going forward  our farmers will need all the help they can get 
A Bountiful Future
By 2050  our planet will have nine billion people who will be consuming an ever increasing quantity of food 
Thus  agricultural technology looks like a solid place to invest   especially if you re an accredited investor 
Crowdfunding sites like AgFunder offer a plethora of investments into agricultural tech startups 
To be considered an accredited investor by the U S  Securities and Exchange Commission  one must invest  1 million in net worth  excluding residence  or make  200 000   300 000 if married  annually for the past two years 
Either way  the sector is certainly worth keeping an eye on ",2015-06-05,Wall Street Daily,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-growing-link-between-tech-and-agriculture-254053,254053
