How Do They Fit Into a Portfolio 
There is heightened tension in the markets of late  Rising rate concerns  tech sell off  oil entering bear territory  political and economic turbulence in Europe  and International Monetary Fund  IMF  cutting growth forecasts for this and the next year are causing panic globally thereby hurting investor sentiment  Trade war concerns have hit the global trade scene and seem to be worsening with time  read    
A prudent way to escape this chaos is to invest in the small cap segment of the broad U S  stock market  U S  economy topped estimates and expanded at an annual rate of 3 5  in the third quarter  being on track to achieve Trump s 3  GDP goal  Retail sales have increased 0 8  last month  showing promising signs for the upcoming holiday season  The labor market is also robust with unemployment rate at a 49 year low 
Additionally  this segment of the market is largely insulated from global upheavals as it derives most of its revenues from within the country  Moreover  the operations are less dependent on global logistics and supply chains  read

106972,328487,ARNA,Orexigen Struggles As Contrave Commercialization Costs Rise,opinion,"On Jan 3  we issued an updated research report on Orexigen Therapeutics  Inc    NASDAQ OREX    This biopharmaceutical company  based in La Jolla  CA  is focused on the development of obesity treatments 
In the last three months  Orexigen s share price has underperformed the  to which it belongs to  The stock has lost 40 4  compared with a decrease of 7  for the industry 

 
We remind investors that Orexigen had terminated its collaboration agreement with Takeda for commercializing Contrave in the United States in early 2016 and started selling the drug itself  Sales numbers improved in three quarters of 2017 as the company booked product sales in the United States instead of royalties paid by Takeda on Contrave sales in the United States in the year ago period  However  the increase in revenues was offset by costs associated with commercializing of the drug which resulted in losses in 2017 
The estimate revision trend for the fourth quarter of 2017 remains unfavorable with one estimate moving down and no revisions in the opposite direction in the past 60 days  Estimates declined 5 1  from a loss of  1 96 per share over this period to a loss of  2 06 per share  The trend reflects analyst apprehensions over the stock s performance in the fourth quarter 
Contrave is Orexigen s only approved and marketed drug  But Contrave is a late entrant in the obesity market already crowded with products like VIVUS  Inc  s   NASDAQ VVUS   Qsymia  Novo Nordisk s   NYSE NVO   Saxenda and Arena Pharmaceuticals  Inc  s   NASDAQ ARNA   Belviq 
However  the targeted sales efforts to drive Contrave sales are a positive as prescriptions and sales have risen sequentially in 2017  Moreover  low rates of penetration and awareness and the lack of safe and effective treatment options make the obesity market highly lucrative 
The company is also collaborating with regional partners in Europe for expansion 
Meanwhile  a ruling from the United States District Court for the District of Delaware has confirmed the exclusivity of Contrave through 2030 
But the absence of any late stage pipeline candidate is concerning  If Contrave disappoints  the company will have little to fall back on  Execution risks remain even though Orexigen continues to work on growing Contrave sales in the United States Orexigen Therapeutics  Inc  Price
 

   Orexigen has a Zacks Rank  4  Sell

106988,328503,ARNA,Can Jazz Pharma  JAZZ  Spring A Surprise In Q2 Earnings ,opinion,"Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc   NASDAQ JAZZ   is scheduled to report second quarter 2017 results on Aug 8  after the market closes Jazz s shares have significantly outperformed the  so far this year  The stock has surged 37 9  compared with the industry s 1 7  increase during the period 
Jazz has quite an encouraging earnings track record  The company beat estimates in three of the last four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 14 48   However  last quarter  the company missed expectations with a negative earnings surprise of 0 70  Jazz Pharmaceuticals PLC Price and EPS Surprise

   Let s see how things have shaped up for this quarter 
Factors at Play
At the second quarter conference call  investor focus will be on the performance of Jazz s lead product  Xyrem  for cataplexy and excessive daytime sleepiness  EDS   Investors will also be looking out for the company s pipeline progress  Defitelio s sales ramp up in the U S   while Xyrem face issues related to patent litigations  The company s business development plans are also expected to draw attention 
Xyrem should deliver a strong performance in the second quarter  The company is also striving to expand Xyrem s label and currently conducting a phase II III EXPRESS study on children and adolescents  suffering from cataplexy with narcolepsy  In Apr 2017  the company announced positive top line efficacy results from the study  It is also planning to submit an sNDA for Xyrem to include the pediatric phase III study results later in 2017 
Defitelio  veno occlusive disease  was launched in the U S  in early Apr 2016 and sales of the drug have picked up pace ever since  A phase III clinical trial on Defitelio for the potential prevention of veno occlusive disease  VOD  on high risk adults and pediatric patients is also currently underway 
However  Jazz has been facing challenges in building sufficient inventory levels for Erwinaze due to constrained manufacturing capacity  The company may further continue to experience supply disruptions in certain markets this quarter  including the U S  and beyond 
On the other hand  in Apr 2017  the company announced positive efficacy results from a global multicenter  phase III TONES 2 study  evaluating its lead pipeline candidate JZP 110 on adult patients with excessive sleepiness associated with narcolepsy  In the trial  JZP 110 demonstrated a highly statistically significant improvement in the co primary endpoints  The company plans to submit an NDA to the FDA for the given indication later this year 
In May  the FDA accepted an NDA for its second pipeline candidate  Vyxeos  on a priority review basis  We believe  Vyxeos has multi million dollar potential  We expect the company to update on Vyxeos at the second quarter conference call 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Jazz is likely to beat estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy    2  Buy  or  3  Hold  for this to happen  But that is not the case here as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is 0 00   This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at  1 85  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Zacks Rank  Although Jazz s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  increases the predictive power of ESP  its 0 00  Earnings ESP makes surprise prediction difficult 
We caution against all Sell rated stocks   4 or 5  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions

106993,328508,ARNA,Vitality Biopharma Stock  Targets Pediatric Crohn s Disease Treatment,opinion,"Vitality Biopharma Inc  OTC VBIO  is still one of the top three companies in the cannabis sector positioned to benefit tremendously from the continued passage of legislation legalizing marijuana based compounds for medical use  Despite a share price that is showing a clear disconnect from competitors like GW Pharmaceuticals PLC ADR  NASDAQ GWPH  and Arena Pharmaceuticals Inc  NASDAQ ARNA   Vitality Biopharma  VBIO  continues to position itself for substantial growth opportunity in the next several quarters  As VBIO s studies continue  the company is encouraged by both pre clinical and case study data which suggest that Vitality Biopharma is well on track to create meaningful THC prodrug treatments for Inflammatory Bowel Disease  IBD  and Narcotic Bowel Syndrome  NBS  
Since 2014  retail investors continue to concentrate on stocks within the cannabis sector that are hoping to create shareholder value through the cultivation and sale of marijuana based products  However  smart investors stay focused on more realistic value creation opportunities by focusing attention on stocks that are building an impressive intellectual property  IP  portfolio that will serve to protect their market position for the next two decades  Not only is VBIO creating value through the patent approval process  but they are also securing a dominant treatment position in treating severe inflammatory diseases that plague both pediatric and adult patients While two other companies  GW Pharma and Arena Pharmaceuticals are also well entrenched into delivering their unique cannabinoid compounds to treat various medical conditions  VBIO s concentration is more tightly focused on bringing to market specialized cannabinoid products that target inflammatory diseases  Specifically  VBIO s attention gets centered on treatments that demonstrate tangible and remission inducing responses in a market that is in need of curative treatment  instead of a symptom only therapeutic drug  Thus  in addressing IBD and NBS specifically  VBIO will benefit not only from the significant barriers to entry for new competitors but will further enjoy product and market exclusivity in treating these diseases for the foreseeable future 
The IBD And NBS Market Is Complicated
To date  current front line therapies of both IBD and NBS often fail to produce a meaningful or sustained effect for patients  Most treatments are only addressing symptoms  which often include excruciating abdominal pain  infection  bloody diarrhea  and joint pain  Patients with these ailments often receive opiate and steroid treatments  which are ineffective for many  cause severe long term side effects  and in the case of NBS  actually represent the root cause of the disease  where opioid treatment causes excruciating and persistent abdominal pain
To address these treatment deficiencies  VBIO is developing THC based prodrug treatments to combat both IBD and NBS effectively  targeting the estimated 81  of opiate users with functional bowel disorders  and the over 58  of patients who report chronic abdominal pain  Thus  while the patient population remains starved for a treatment that can induce disease remission  the current standard of care is simply failing for many people with either illness  But  don t expect big pharma to relinquish its stronghold on treating just the symptoms  The real pressure to create change must come from the patient population  sector advocates  and from companies like VBIO that are demonstrating the value in alternative cannabinoid treatment to curb both symptoms and disease progression 
A strong example of what VBIO may be able to offer patients may get exemplified through clinical study  Vitality Biopharma s VITA 100 and VITA 210 trials  expected to initiate in 2017  are targeting treatment applications for both IBD and NBS in its separate Phase 1a 1b trials  This first in man clinical study of proprietary cannabinoid glycosides  cannabosides  is intended to measure and evaluate the pharmacokinetics and tolerability of cannabosides  and to provide preliminary efficacy data in treating abdominal pain  cramping  and other symptoms associated with each condition  In addition to targeting IBD and NBS  the company s gut targeted cannabinoids will also be investigated for the treatment of neuropathic pain  opiate induced bowel dysfunction  colorectal cancer  and C  difficile indications 
Potential benefits of these low cost and relatively quick clinical studies  which historically cost less than  2 million and take less than six months to complete  will likely serve as a means to generate both safety data and also proof of concept data relevant to several large market gastrointestinal disease indications  Not only is VBIO positioned to advance these trials quickly and cost effectively  but the internally produced proprietary molecules and use of enzyme biosynthesis processes to create cannabinoid treatments also allow VBIO development independence and the ability to control the pace and conduct of the trial 
Case Study Benefits Pediatric Crohn s Disease PatientBeing self sufficient from pre clinical study to manufacturing processes  VBIO is well positioned to take quick advantage of research results and apply them toward additional medical applications  Within the subset of current IBD and NBS patients  for instance  VBIO published a case study for a pediatric Crohn s disease patient that produced encouraging results  Data from the study demonstrated success with cannabinoids when all front line treatments were ineffective  Although preliminary results are promising  VBIO does suggest that additional studies will be required to substantiate its proof of concept and therapeutic value in using cannabinoid compounds to treat the disease  But  keeping in mind that additive studies are both quick and inexpensive compared to the alternative drug approval process  the additional studies do not pose a serious drag on potential cannabinoid and THC modeled prodrug approvals 
The recent case study published by VBIO describes a 13 year old boy with Crohn s Disease who achieved clinical and biochemical remission after oral administration of cannabinoids  Elements of the case study showed that after years of disease  the patient suffered from a poor appetite  consistent weight loss  incurred stunted growth  and most important from a treatment perspective  failed to achieve remission with conventional therapies  including the markets most promising TNF alpha inhibitor infliximab According to VBIO s case study presentation  the 13 year old patient received a formal diagnosis as having Crohn s disease at the age of 9  whereby mild to moderate distal colitis and aphthous ileal ulcerations were acknowledged  During the next four years  the patient was hospitalized on numerous occasions and placed on a treatment that included the use of alpha inhibitors and a morphine drip  After being treated for roughly five years  in five week intervals  with the most advanced conventional therapies  the patient failed to enter any state of disease remission  Even after introducing additional medicines  including sulfasalazine  Lialda  CANASA  and azathioprine  the patient showed no significant response to treatment  The most aggressive attempt to control the patient s disease included the introduction of Methotrexate  but caused severe side effects that forced the treating physician to stop the treatment  The only shown benefit the patient experienced was for a brief period when infliximab was the predominant treating compound  However  that result quickly dissipated  and the calproctectin levels in the patient increased to more than 2000  g g during the next four months of treatment 
During the four years of disease progression  the patient was unresponsive to conventional therapies  and symptoms continued to worsen causing poor appetite  weight loss  anemia  and continued stunted growth  Additionally  the patient missed 25 days of school per year on average and was hospitalized on a regular basis for Crohn s symptoms that included intense stomach cramps  anemia  and bloody diarrhea frequency between 10 20 times per day  Inclusive to those debilitating effects  the boy also suffered from five consecutive infections with C  difficile which required hospitalization  Unfortunately  even the most prominent antibacterial medications  including vancomycin were ineffective  leading to the need for treatment with fecal transplants  which ultimately resolved the infection and achieved temporary remission of his IBD  But  the road to a short lived reprieve was intense and not without extreme cost and patient discomfort  Watching the deterioration and treatment setbacks  his parents decided to seek alternative treatment after learning of the success of Coltyn Turner  a pioneering cannabinoid patient who reported complete clinical remission of similar drug resistant Crohn s Disease after using cannabis based compounds  The results  produced by treatment after all conventional therapies were tried and failed at the Mayo Clinic  demonstrated the value in cannabinoid treatment of the disease for a drug resistant pediatric patient 
Following the lead from these encouraging results  the VBIO case study patient received approval for treatment with cannabis under the California Compassionate Use Act  and in mid February 2016  began cannabinoid therapy with three daily doses of chocolate bar edibles that were each infused with 3mg of THC and 3mg of cannabinoid  Within thirty days  the patient  who had never responded to conventional treatment  had achieved disease remission  and both his calproctectin scores and calproctectin serum levels decreased significantly  After sixty days of cannabinoid therapy  the calproctectin levels decreased to 0mg L  Of additional significance  the associated serum erythrocyte sedimentation rate declined by 88   from 25 mm hr to 3 mm hr 
Eliminating Infliximab InfusionsThe case study also produced additional benefits  including the reduction of infliximab infusions from every five weeks to nine weeks  Despite the objections made by the patient s attending gastroenterologist  the patient stopped all infliximab treatments during January of 2017  whereby the patient was diagnosed to be in complete remission  with no Crohn s disease symptoms Fast forward to the date of publication  and the patient remained in disease remission for more than one year since starting cannabinoid therapy  gained height and weight  had a healthy appetite  and had not missed a single day of school  Importantly  from a regulatory perspective  the cannabinoid treatment created no adverse reactions or side effects 
Particular to the case study  the results of the cannabinoid therapy prove to be of substantial importance to an illness that avails itself to mostly ineffective treatment options that also fail to deliver measurable long term results  The study findings are significant to VBIO  whose THC prodrug is specifically aiming to address the symptoms as well as the inflammatory aspects of the disease  Although this is the first documented report of cannabinoid therapy inducing clinical remission in a pediatric IBD patient  the results and outcome presented used objective measures of disease activity and scale rating  Certainly  patient response is more reflective of actual disease progression and symptom relief  but both retrospective and prospective studies of the analysis demonstrate that the use of cannabinoid provided a significant improvement in the quality of life for the patient  No doubt  the results produced serve to reinforce the promise of cannabinoid therapy to provide far more than symptomatic relief 
Vitality Biopharma s Unique ApplicationsVBIO s prodrug technology may alter the landscape of how both IBD and NBS gets treated and is building a platform based off of reliable data that is showing the benefit of cannabinoid treatment  Vitality s use of glycoside prodrugs  for instance  can selectively target different tissues  including the gut through oral delivery and the brain through intravenous administration  Utilization of the glycoside prodrugs with cannabinoid compounds has already demonstrated reliable targeting to the colon  and data indicates glycoside technology can also enable higher permeation of brain tissue upon intravenous delivery 
Specifically relevant to VBIO s cannabinoid platform  the glycosylation technology has reliably led to improvements in drug solubility and stability and has set the stage for a novel set of cannaboside compounds  For investors looking for comparison potential  GW Pharma s more than  2 75 billion market cap lay mostly in its IP portfolio  and the expectations from its IND and NDA drug applications  It s easy to point out  after all  that with only  3 1 million in most recent quarterly revenues  and a cash burn of almost  34 million  much of GWPH s market cap is built on the belief that investors have in the blue sky potential of the cannabinoid industry 
VBIO is setting itself up for similar appreciation  The trials that are scheduled to start later this year  coupled with the growing IP portfolio and over 20 submitted patent applications  likely positions the company for an uptick in shareholder value  Similar to GWPH  Vitality Biopharma may quickly take advantage of its clinical data to expedite its therapies and seek FDA approvals through IND  NDA and accelerated approval pathways through 505 b 1 and 505 b 2 filings 
The ultimate promise for VBIO lay in the fact that the company has indeed developed a novel class of cannabinoid compounds that  when used in prodrug form  may lead to potentially revolutionary developments in how inflammatory diseases get treated  By providing a site specific method of delivery  the VBIO prodrugs can effectually offer local therapeutic benefit  and at the same time eliminate systematic delivery of cannabinoid and THC based drugs into the bloodstream and brain  removing the psychoactive response in users  And  don t underestimate the value VBIO s method of delivery  because while competitors may eventually progress toward both pre clinical and clinical trials  they will be limited to the amount of cannabinoid and THC used due to the psychoactive effects of not using the prodrug technology  That limitation alone establishes significant disadvantages to any potential competitor and fortifies the market leading position that VBIO may enjoy in the IBD and NBS markets 
The Promise For VBIOFrom a market perspective  investors should embrace the substantial revenue opportunity at hand  with a current IBD treatment market alone expected to generate more than  9 6 billion in 2017  And  while this aggregate number represents a total treatment market that includes anti inflammatories  immune suppressants  and antibiotics  none of the current treatments have demonstrated the ability to cure the disease  VBIO  however  is banking on the compounding data that its treatments will indeed cause substantial and improved patient benefit  Thus  while large pharma and potential competitors may look to control and manage symptoms  VBIO is engaged to in methods intended to place the disease into a long term state of remission 
For investors  the VBIO prodrug technology offers dual benefit  First  it may provide almost immediate systematic relief in patient symptoms  Second  it may allow for patients to eliminate the need for opioid based drugs that often lead to misdiagnosis  drug addiction  and additional complications that contribute to the progression of disease symptoms  Now that two key trials are set to begin  VBIO investors are sitting on at least two potential catalyst events for the remainder of the year  Not only are those trials expected to commence soon  but VBIO may also leverage the recent Crohn s disease case study results to maximize FDA attention to offer expedited pathways for treatment approval  Although VBIO may sometimes get lumped into the micro cap world of marijuana stocks  the reality exists that VBIO is far from the typical cannabis stock  and is rightfully deserving of a higher market cap than is presently provided  Even with a cursory comparison between GWPH and VBIO  investors can see stark similarities  making the difference in market cap valuation confusing 
In some respects  VBIO s position in getting treatments to market is similar to GWPH  but at the same time  VBIO will not burn more than  120 million per year to advance its pipeline  What GWPH serves to show investors is that while the big money brokerage houses may make investment bubbles for companies that are yet to prove themselves worthy of multi billion dollar market caps  they continually ignore investment opportunities that have not relied on their investment roadshows or equity interest to drive exposure  With VBIO trading at less than  2 per share  and with trials set to begin that may elicit expedited FDA review  the better investment opportunity in the small set of cannabinoid developers may lean toward VBIO s favor  making the stock a worthy consideration for investors This article was originally featured on  ",2017-10-03,CNA Finance,https://www.investing.com/analysis/vitality-biopharma-vbio-stock-targets-pediatric-crohns-disease-treatment-wit-200216760,200216760

Year to date  Arena s shares have soared 96  compared with the  s 3 9  increase 

Arena s earnings performance is a mixed bag  While the company surpassed expectations in two of the last four quarters  it missed estimates in the other two  Overall  the company delivered an average positive surprise of 70 15  in the trailing four quarters Arena Pharmaceuticals  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise

   Last quarter  the company missed expectations with a negative earnings surprise of 13 24  
Let s see  how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors at Play
The only approved product in Arena s portfolio is obesity treatment drug  Belviq  which has delivered an unimpressive performance so far  We note that ramping up sales in the U S  anti obesity market is challenging due to several factors  including the tendency of health care providers to treat obesity symptoms instead of the disease itself  lesser focus on certain patient types for the treatment and historically  low third party insurance coverage  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Belviq is  1 9 million for the third quarter 
Arena has a few candidates in its pipeline on which  we expect an update in the third quarter conference call  In July  the company announced that a phase II study evaluating its key pipeline candidate  ralinepag  in pulmonary arterial hypertension   PAH    met its primary endpoint  This positive data from the trial paves way for an expedited initiation of a phase III program on the candidate 
Other candidates include etrasimod  phase II for ulcerative colitis with data expected in the fourth quarter of 2017  and APD371  phase II study for treatment of pain associated with Crohn s disease   Etrasimod has the potential to be developed for additional indications beyond inflammatory bowel disease 
What Our Model Indicates
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Arena will beat on earnings this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a solid Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  But this is not the case here  as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  Arena has an Earnings ESP of 0 00  because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at a loss of 69 cents You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Zacks Rank  Arena currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  which increases the predictive power of the ESP  However  an Earnings ESP of 0 00  makes surprise prediction difficult 
We caution against the Sell rated stocks   4 or 5  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
Stocks That Warrant a Look
Here are some health care stocks worth considering as per our model  these have the right combination of elements to beat estimates this quarter

107000,328515,ARNA,Arena Pharmaceuticals Just Set Itself Up For A Battle With JJ,opinion,"Arena Pharmaceuticals Inc  NASDAQ ARNA  has been a pretty tough stock to hold over the last five years  The company traded for more than  90 a share back in August 2012  By May 1 this year  it went for just  13 a piece   a total decline across the period of more than 85   This month  however  shareholders are getting something of a long awaited reprieve  On Monday  Arena gained more than 40  in after hours trading and  as the session opened on Tuesday  continued to gain strength  At time of writing  Arena trades for  27 55   a 50  premium on its weekly open and a more than 111  premium on the just mentioned May lows 
Here is a look at what is behind this dramatic move and a critical look at what is likely to happen next from a market capitalization perspective 
Many reading might already be familiar with this company  with said familiarity rooted in a weight loss product called Belviq  For those that aren t  and for those whose familiarity with Arena is rooted solely in the just mentioned product  chances are impressions of the company aren t particularly positive  The company basically limped along the development pathway with Belviq towards a questionable regulatory approval and  as the drug matured into commercialization phase  it never really managed to gain any traction  It missed sales targets pretty much across the board and this led Arena to renegotiate an agreement with partner Eisai Co Ltd  which acquired the rights to Belviq earlier this year 
In the wake of this failure  Arena shifted its attention to a drug called ralinepag 
The drug is a pulmonary arterial hypertension  PAH  candidate  which is a market currently dominated by big Pharma incumbent Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ   Specifically  Johnson   Johnson currently sells a drug called Selexipag  which is marketed under the brand name Uptravi  to this patient population  having picked the asset as part of its acquisition of Actelion last month 
During 2016  and subsequent to its approval  Selexipag generated more than  250 million in sales and analysts  that this could increase to more than  800 million at peak 
Needless to say  it s a big market  and this size is partly responsible for the action we are seeing in Arena right now 
So  what just happened 
The driver behind the company s recent appreciation is the release of data from a phase II investigation of ralinepag in the PAH population  The numbers were somewhat positive and the response we are seeing is an interpretation of these numbers being sufficient to advance the drug in question through a successful pivotal trial 
Specifically  the trial hit against its primary endpoint of an improvement in what is called pulmonary vascular resistance  PVR   logging a close to 30  improvement in PVR between the active arm of the study and a comparator  placebo arm  For those familiar with this indication and its industry standard measurement scale  median PVR in the ralinepag arm fell by 163 9 dyn s cm 5 from its starting point of 705 dyn s cm 5  The comparable figure for the placebo arm increased slightly  but the company noted that the placebo patients had a lower median heading into the trial  coming in at PVR of 480 dyn s cm 5  This latter fact isn t overly important  however 
The outcome is statistically significant and   when measured against this endpoint   it looks as though the drug worked well  These numbers also imply comparability to the above mentioned Selexipag as far as PVR improvement is concerned 
In addition to comparability  the drug has demonstrated a number of improvements over the current standard of care that could serve to set it apart from Selexipag  and in turn  help it attract market share from the latter  if it is able to replicate these results in a pivotal trial  Specifically  Selexipag has been shown to have a shorter half life and larger peak to trough fluctuations than ralinepag  Both of these factors could justify a preference from a physician s perspective when choosing between the two drugs at the point of administration 
That s the good news 
The bad news is that  as per a secondary endpoint of six minute walk test  a standard industry severity measurement in these sorts of cardio associated conditions   the trial didn t register a stat sig improvement as compared to placebo  In the active arm  patients added 36 meters to their six minute walk distance  In the control arm  this number was 29 4 meters 
So  while the active arm walked farther  so did the control arm  meaning the data can t be logged as stat sig 
While that s not ideal  it s not a big set back  In the trial that underpinned its approval  Selexipag only registered an improvement of 12 meters  Further  the Arena study was only small and   as a result   wasn t powered to achieve statistical significance against this endpoint 
So what s next 
Well  it s important to remember that this is a phase II trial and that the company is going to have to carry out a much larger phase III study if it s going to get this drug approved in the PAH indication  The study will have to replicate or beat these results to give ralinepag a great chance of a regulatory green light come PDUFA and   if it doesn t   we ll probably see Arena take a hit as markets realign to reflect their disappointment 
That said  however  things look about as good as they could at this stage of the development program and that s why this one is running as it is  Chances are we ll see the company continue to appreciate  leaving aside the potential for a near term correction on the latest run as shorter term operators pull profits off the table  ahead of phase III initiation 
Cash on hand at last count was  6 6 million  which won t be enough to fund through to NDA submission  As such  anyone thinking about picking up an early exposure to this one  ahead of phase IIII results  is likely going to have to shoulder a degree of dilution  on the back of an equity raise  between now and the drug hitting shelves ",2017-07-12,Samuel Rae,https://www.investing.com/analysis/arena-pharmaceuticals-just-set-itself-up-for-a-battle-with-j-j-200200579,200200579

107018,328533,ARNA,Arena Ends Study On Extended Release Formulation Of PAH Drug,opinion,"ARena Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ ARNA    announced that it has completed an early stage study comparing the once daily  extended release  XR  formulation of its experimental pulmonary arterial hypertension  PAH  candidate  ralinepag  with its twice daily immediate release  IR  formulation  It is to be noted that Ralinepag enjoys Orphan Drug status in the U S 
Arena s shares have outperformed the Zacks classified  industry so far this year  Its stock was up 13 8   while the industry registered an addition of 10 1  
Coming back to the release  the phase I bioavailability study evaluated the safety  tolerability and pharmacokinetic  PK  profile of ralinepag XR tablets  given as single daily doses  at three dose levels to 12 healthy adult subjects  They were also given single doses of ralinepag IR capsules In fact  the PK results showed that the once daily XR tablet helped in reducing the maximum plasma concentration  Cmax  of ralinepag compared with the IR capsule  while maintaining similar total plasma concentrations 
We note that the PAH market is highly attractive given the low diagnosis rate  the low penetration of existing therapies and the significant unmet medical need 
Recently  pharmaceutical giant Johnson   Johnson  Inc    NYSE JNJ   acquired Swiss biotech Actelion which helped it gain a foothold in the PAH market   Actelion s PAH franchise includes differentiated  innovative medicines like Opsumit  Uptravi and Tracleer   
United Therapeutics Corporation   NASDAQ UTHR   also holds a strong position in the PAH market with four approved products targeting this indication  The four products are Remoduli  Adcirca  Tyvaso and Orenitram   Pfizer s   NYSE PFE   Revatio is used for the same indication as well

107027,328542,ARNA,Arena Pharmaceuticals Stock  Gaining On Drug Approval,opinion,"Arena Pharmaceuticals Inc  NASDAQ ARNA 
Arena Pharmaceuticals is having a relatively strong day in the market today  and for good reason  Early this morning  the company announced that it had received news from the FDA with regard to a New Drug Application  That news was that the drug prospect had been approved  Today  we ll talk about the FDA approval  how the market reacted to the news  and what we can expect to see from ARNA moving forward 
ARNA Receives FDA Approval 
For some time now  Arena Pharmaceuticals has been working on a treatment known as BELVIX XR CIV  The treatment is designed to help consumers lose weight in a healthy way  The 20mg tablet was designed with the help of Tokyo based pharmaceutical company Eisai 
Today  it was announced that the hard work has paid off  The United States Food and Drug Administration has made the decision to approve the drug for the indication of weight loss  This is great news as not only does ARNA have a newly approved drug under its belt  it will be receiving a milestone payment from Eisai  According to a release  the company will be receiving a  10 million payment connected with the FDA approval milestone 
Following the announcement of the FDA approval  Amit Munshi  ARNA CEO had the following to say 

 We are pleased that once daily BELVIQ XR has been approved by the FDA and will provide patients another option for weight loss  The approval of this new formulation is another example of Arena s success in supporting our collaborators  

How The Market Reacted To The News
As investors  one of the first things that we learn is that it s important to watch the news surrounding publicly traded companies  That s because this news will cause movement in the market  When positive news is released  we tend to see gains in the value of the stock associated with the news  Adversely  when negative news is released  we can expect to see declines  In this particular case  the news was overwhelmingly positive  The FDA approval marks a key milestone for Arena Pharmaceuticals  As a result  we saw gains in the value of the stock today  By the end of the trading session  the stock had gained  0 02 per share or 1 18  to close the day off at  1 72 per share 
What We Can Expect To See Moving Forward
Moving forward  I have a relatively mixed opinion of what we can expect to see from ARNA  First and foremost  there s quite a bit of positive in today s news  As mentioned above  not only does the company have a newly approved treatment  it will be receiving a  10 million milestone payment  While that news is incredible  it s important to consider the risks as well  Historically  the stock has performed incredibly poorly with a horrible return on equity  On top of historical performance  there is quite a bit of risk associated with debt at the moment  Knowing this  we could definitely see further growth as a result of the approval  However  if you decide to act on that growth  make sure to move with caution ",2016-07-20,Modest Money,https://www.investing.com/analysis/arena-pharmaceuticals-(arna)-stock:-gaining-on-drug-approval-200142857,200142857

107036,328551,ARNA,Will Trius Be The Next Big Small Cap Biotech Mover ,opinion,Normally  I write about biotech companies with near term catalysts I feel offer traders good long based trade opportunities heading into these catalysts  Every so often  I find a small cap biotech where I feel a speculation investment is truly warranted  This year  a few small cap companies have realized strong and steady stock appreciation long after their respective catalysts events have come and gone  Trius Therapeutics  Inc   TSRX  is one such company I strongly believe is a great speculation investment which could see strong stock appreciation  after its positive catalyst has come and gone  Also  I feel it s likely the company will be acquired soon based on some factors I will mention in this article  notwithstanding the strong buzz I have been hearing in this regard  Company Treatment Platform Methicillin resistant Staphyloccus aureusStrong antibiotics have become of increasing importance as bacteria mutate to become resistant to current treatments  Even though an antibiotic can kill a majority of the bacteria and rid a patient of symptoms  stronger and more resilient bacteria survive  Over time  that bacterium replicates and becomes the majority of that population  To combat a new strain  scientists are continually developing newer and stronger antibiotics    MRSA  is one pathogen that has become a prevalent problem because it is responsible for several difficult to treat infections  MRSA is any strain of Staphylococcus aureas that has developed  through the process of natural selection  resistance to beta lactam antibiotics  which include penicillin  MRSA is especially troublesome in hospitals  prisons  and nursing homes  where patients with open wounds  invasive devices  and weakened immune systems are at greater risk of infection than the general public  MRSA is on the   with infections doubling in the just the last 5 years  Chicago scientists say the new estimate might even be low balling the disease s pervasiveness because the database they use tends to under report instances of MRSA if patients were hospitalized for some other ailment  When the researchers went back to correct for the statistical inaccuracy  they discovered that the insurance claims had missed between one third to one half of actual MRSA cases as recorded by the hospitals  own records  The continual need of a newer and stronger form of antibiotic has sparked several biotechnology companies to develop drugs to combat MRSA  and Trius might be on to one that could be a multi Billion dollar solution OxazolidonesTrius largely works with a class of compounds called oxazolidinones  which are mainly used as antimicrobials  Oxazolidinones can be used as an antibacterial by working as a protein synthesis inhibitor that can target an early step involving the binding of N formylmethionyl tRNA to the ribosome  Some of the most important oxazolidinones are the last generation of antibiotics used against gram positive pathogens  including super bugs such as MRSA  These antibiotics are considered as a choice of last resort where every other antibiotic therapy has failed  Examples of antibiotic oxazolidinones include Linezolid   Is available for intravenous administration and also has the advantage of having excellent oral bioavailability Posizolid   Appears to have excellent  targeted bactericidal activity against all common gram positive bacteria  regardless of resistance to other classes of antibiotics Tedizolid   Is in phase II clinical trials Radezolid  RX 1741    Has completed some phase II clinical trials Cycloserine   Is a second line drug against tuberculosis The market to treat MRSA with oxazolidones is a very large one  with some products bringing in billions of dollars in revenue  As strains mutate and science advances  several companies are in the market to capture a share of the profits  Trius is in development with its top product tedizolid  which has the potential to generate huge profits if eventually approved  Company Pipeline TedizolidTedizolid  TR 701   formerly Torezolid phosphate  is an IV and orally administered second generation oxazolidinone for the treatment of serious   including methicillin resistance Staphylococcus aureus  MRSA   As a second generation oxazolidinone  Tedizolid phosphate is chemically differentiated from the first generation of clinically developed oxazolidinones and is designed for improved potency  resistance  and spectrum of activity  There is only one approved first generation oxazolidinone  linezolid  which is currently the leading branded antibiotic for serious gram positive infections  Pfizer markets linezolid under the brand name Zyvox and reported worldwide sales of  1 35 billion in 2012  Currently  vancomycin  daptomycin  and linezolid  Zyvox  are the leading drugs used for the treatment of infections caused by gram positive bacteria  most of which are hospital acquired infections  Tedizolid has been studied and evaluated for the treatment of serious gram positive infections  including those caused by MRSA  Tedilozid is being developed to treat multiple clinical indications including ABSSSI  and other important indications involving infections of the lungs and blood  such as commonly acquired bacterial pneumonia  CABP   hospital and ventilator acquired pneumonia  HAP and VAP  Tedizolid vs  LinezolidZyvox  linezolid  treats the same indications as tedizolid and has found a niche treating Vancomycin resistant enterococci  VRE   Additionally  off label use of linezolid is becoming more popular also  Since it was approved in 2000  linezolid has proven to be extremely successful due to its safety profile and general bacterial resistance  However   from the ESTABLISH 2 Phase III clinical trial shows that tedizolid shows significant advantages over linezolid  The company provides a very accurate and thorough description of the Greater Potency   The potency of tedizolid is four to eight times greater than linezolid against linezolid susceptible strains and up to 16 times greater than linezolid against linezolid resistant strains  The greater potency of tedizolid phosphate should enable a shorter course of treatment as compared to linezolid  We believe that this enhanced potency may result in improved clinical outcomes  significant savings for hospitals and payor organizations  faster eradication of the pathogen and earlier discharge from the hospital Shorter Dosing Regimen and More Convenient  Once Daily Dosing   Tedizolid Phosphate is administered once daily for six days for the treatment of cSSSI  now termed ABSSSI   as compared to twice daily for 10 to 14 days for linezolid  We believe this shorter and once daily dosing regimen will contribute to improved patient compliance  decrease the risk of drug induced adverse events and limit the emergence of resistance Bactericidal Activity In Vivo   Tedizolid Phosphate  TR 701   unlike linezolid  concentrates to a high extent inside certain white blood cells  which engulf pathogenic bacteria and concentrate at the site of infection  This feature of Tedizolid phosphate  TR 701  contributes to its in vivo bactericidal activity  or killing of pathogenic bacteria in the body  which is thought to yield a higher degree of efficacy and faster eradication of the pathogenic bacteria than is achieved with bacteriostatic antibiotics  which are antibiotics that arrest the growth of bacteria Activity Against Key Gram Positive Drug Resistant Strains and Select Atypical and Gram Negative Bacteria   Tedizolid phosphate is active against all clinically relevant gram positive bacteria tested to date  including organisms resistant to linezolid and other antibiotics  Tedizolid phosphate is also active against strains of the gram negative bacterium Legionella and strains of the atypical bacterium Chlamydia  and thus may have utility in treating lower respiratory tract infections involving these bacteria Low Intrinsic Frequency of Resistance   The frequency at which MRSA evolves resistance to Tedizolid phosphate is 16 times lower than the frequency at which it evolves resistance against linezolid  We believe that this may enable wider use of Tedizolid phosphate and limit the emergence of resistance Favorable and Predictable Pharmacokinetics There is little patient to patient variability in the concentration of tedizolid phosphate in blood  as compared to linezolid  As a result  we expect that tedizolid phosphate will have more predictable drug exposure which may lead to a more uniform efficacy and safety profile across different patients when compared to linezolid Fewer Drug Drug Interactions  Unlike linezolid  tedizolid phosphate has not been shown to inhibit the monoamine oxidase system which mediates the metabolism of tyramine  SSRI s and vasoconstrictors Improved Safety Profile for Longer Term Dosing  The results of our comparative 21 day Phase 1 clinical trial show that a 200 mg daily dose of tedizolid phosphate had less impact on hematological parameters indicative of myelosuppression than the labeled dose of Zyvox  600 mg twice daily   Based upon the results of this clinical trial  we believe that Tedizolid phosphate may offer a safer alternative to linezolid for infections requiring longer term dosing  such as bacteremia With these advantages  doctors should be more inclined to prescribe tedizolid over linezolid  Since Zyfox  linezolid  brings in over  1 Billion in revenue each year  it is clear that developing a better drug would be extremely profitable  With evidence building that some strains of bacteria are becoming resistant to Zyvox  there is always room for a newer and more effective antibiotic  As a newly developed antibiotic  tedizolid may be a better pick by doctors over its competitor as bacterial resistance becomes even more prevalent  From an economic standpoint  tedizolid provides additional advantages over linezolid  Given that it costs about  115 per pill and a 10 day course consists of taking a 600mg pill taken twice daily  linezolid would cost about  2300  Contrastingly  tedizolid only has to be taken once a day for a 6 day course  This conservatively puts tedizolid at  700 for one course  The cost difference is a huge advantage over current treatments and given similar drug profiles  tedizolid seems to be the better choice  If eventually approved by the Federal Drug Administration  FDA   analysts have speculated that tedizolid could reach peak sales of up to  900 Million  With a current market cap of only  367 Million  Trius Therapeutics is grossly under speculated  With positive Phase III data in hand  I expect shares to increase in value as investors begin to realize the potential of this company  We have seen a few small cap biotechs with potential blockbuster treatments move a lot higher and attract heavy institutional support this year after their positive catalyst events have occurred  Sarepta Therapeutics  SRPT  traded under  3 a year ago as it worked through a Phase II trial for eteplirsen  indicated for the treatment of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy  DMD   Since the company  promising data late last year for its drug eteplirsen  its stock price has been on fire  In one trading session alone  the stock rallied from around   Sarepta now trades now at over  35 a share ahead of the company expecting to hear from the FDA on accelerated approval for eteplirsen soon  I believe the FDA will grant accelerated approval for many reasons  the greatest being strong political pressure from advocates of the drug like   mother of a child who suffers from DMD  Arena Pharma  ARNA   after Belviq received a positive FDA advisory committee recommendation last year  rallied to over  10 a share  before falling back to under  6  At that time  the company engaged in a public offering at  5 50 a share  and the stock rallied back to over  10 before receiving marketing approval from the FDA  Afterwards  the stock sold off a bit  but has rebounded to near  9  Belviq is intended for weight management  including weight loss and maintenance of weight loss  There are currently limited pharmaceutical treatment options to help patients lose weight  so the drug is seen as somewhat of an unmet need  Belviq became the first FDA drug approved to treat obesity in over a decade  Arena s public offering was a big success as the company attracted a lot of institutional interest then and in the last year  I believe Arena will be a full fledged successful pharma    in 5 years or so  Acadia  ACAD  began 2013   4 60 a share  Just in the last few months  the stock has nearly tripled on both  for its lead drug pimavanserin  indicated for the treatment of Parkinson s disease psychosis  PDP   and allowance of an  New Drug Application  NDA  filing from the FDA  PDP is an unmet need with a potentially huge market  and the company deserves its current speculation valuation  ACADIA is another company I strongly feel will likely be acquired in the next year or so  I feel once institutions like Baker Brothers LLC  who have a substantial stake in ACADIA  fully study Trius and its enormous speculation value  I am confident they  along with other institutions will take a substantial stake in the company  which should further drive Trius stock considerably higher  Buyout Speculation  With studies showing a better safety profile and patient compliance than current drugs on the market  Tedizolid is primed to not only get approved by the FDA  but also potentially grab a majority market share  However  Trius may never get to bring its drugs to market because there is a solid chance big pharmas are interested in acquiring its assets  Recently  investors have speculated that Trius will be bought out because the company just announced a notice of allowance of U S  patent application related to tedizolid phosphate combination with daptomycin  Daptomycin is marketed as Cubicin by Cubist Pharmaceuticals  CBST and should pull in near  1 Billion in 2013  Cubist has turned Cubicin into a blockbuster antibiotic and its continued revenue stream is integral to the company s success  The allowance of this patent makes Trius an even more prime target for a buyout for the several following reasons Reduce Resistant BacteriaAdaptation and evolution are two of the most troubling problems when it comes to developing antibiotics  For example  if scientists are able to develop a drug that kills 99  of bacteria  that 1  will survive and become the genetically most prevalent form  How long this takes depends on several factors including how rapidly the bacteria can adapt and replicate  In order to kill stronger or different strains of bacteria  scientists are always creating newer and more powerful drugs  The prevalence of these mutant strains has become an increasing problem for daptomycin  Although daptomycin has been a successful drug in treating patients in the gram positive bacteria market  it is slowly losing its effectiveness as the bacteria are becoming more resistant  Dr  Ralph Corey  Professor of Medicine and Infectious Diseases at Duke University    MRSA bacteremia is a potentially fatal disease with limited treatment options  As a clinician who treats bacteremia patients  I am concerned by the growing resistance to one of our last effective treatment options  daptomycin  and welcome this news that tedizolid phosphate may prevent daptomycin resistance when used in a combination therapy  Trius found that when a low dose of tedizolid phosphate is combined with daptomycin  the amount of bacteria resistant to daptomycin is significantly reduced  This is significant because it would increase the efficacy of daptomycin and extends its life as an antibiotic  In the same press release it stated  As detailed in the patent application  tedizolid phosphate  at concentrations substantially below its current therapeutic dose to treat skin infections  unexpectedly prevents the formation of daptomycin resistant mutants of Staphylococcus aureus  Tedizolid appears to be unique in this mutant prevention activity given that seven other medicines tested  including linezolid  the only other drug of the same class as tedizolid  failed to show the same mutant prevention activity  The allowance of this patent is of extreme importance to both Trius and Cubist  From a scientific standpoint  Cubist would be interested in the combination of tedizolid and daptomycin  since the combination of the two would solve the problem daptomycin has with resistant bacteria  This would extend the effectiveness of daptomycin and keep that revenue stream steady for Cubist  Also  as previously mentioned  analysts have speculated that tedizolid could reach peak sales of up to  900 Million    how much more in sales can be realized with the combo tedizolid phosphate daptomycin that was just issued a patent allowance  With a market cap of  360M  Trius is ridiculously undervalued and under speculated in my strongest opinion Extend ExclusivityThe allowance of this patent could also provide Cubist with an opportunity to extend the exclusivity period of Cubicin  Until 2018  no companies can create any generic forms of Cubicin and Cubist has been able to bring in large revenues because of that  After 2018  generic drug companies could create a cheaper alternative and grab some market share away from Cubicin  Obviously  it would be in the best interest of Cubist to extend the period of exclusivity for as long as they can do so  notwithstanding the potential for potentially significant additional revenue from tedizolid phosphate combination with daptomycin  The combination of tedizolid and daptomycin would be a way for Cubist to extend and realize revenue from a patent exclusivity period by an additional five years  With guidance this year of near  1 Billion in revenues for Cubicin  exclusivity from a more effective combo solution could easily realize  5 to  8 Billion in revenues before any generic potentially comes to market  Long term Cubist shareholders should encourage and support a buyout or partnership with Trius because it should provide a huge revenue stream for several additional years Broaden ProfileWith a buyout  Cubist would gain the rights to tedizolid  along with the newly patented combo drug  plus the other drugs in the Trius pipeline  As stated previously  Trius reported positive Phase III data for tedzolid  meeting all primary endpoints when compared to Pfizer s Zyvox  However  tedizolid also appeared to have a better safety profile and dosing schedule  Cubist also could complete Trius  scheduled Phase III program for the treatment of pneumonia in the second half of 2013  In the pipeline Trius also has an array of products ranging from preclinical to Phase III trials that would add additional value to Cubist  Additionally  in the latest 8k from Trius  we read the  Item 5 02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers  Election of Directors  Appointment of Certain Officers  Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers  On May 21  2013  our 2010 Equity Incentive Plan  the  2010 Plan   was amended to  among other things  increase the aggregate number of shares of common stock authorized for issuance under the 2010 Plan by 5 100 000 shares  I saw similar activity with Obagi Medical Products before it was  recently  When considering the fundamental reasons why Cubist might acquire Trius  it makes sense that management would want  extra shares  to be awarded themselves upon an acquisition  This is an indicator to me that a buy out may be in short order for the company  Much has been made lately about a few insider sells last month  I would point out that these sells were  automatic sales  under rule 10b5 1  which in the case of Trius insiders  they were on schedule to sell the shares regardless of the price action or any other factor  I m always a little surprised just how many traders and investors are unaware of what automatic sales are  Additional leverage from The Gain Act  Realizing the ever growing problem of treatment resistant infections like MRSA  in October 2012  Congress passed and President Obama signed into law   Generating Antibiotics Incentives Now Act   The legislation encourages companies like Trius to develop new antibiotics  allowing them to streamline certain regulatory processes for commercialization  Perhaps the most important aspect of the GAIN act for Trius is that it offers companies 5 years of market exclusively  which would give Trius additional leverage if it chooses to partner tedizolid   and even more leverage with its newly patented combo drug  and or sell the company  Financial and Share Structure Balance Sheet Total Cash  mrq   83 65M Total Cash Per Share  mrq

possible negative issues with a company  but too little short interest usually means it takes a ton of actual investors to significantly move a stock price upwards  Conclusion  Trius is a small cap biotech with a developing potentially huge story  with a transitional market cap of  360M  According to   Cubist reportedly made an unsolicited  1 billion bid for another company in the segment that was not accepted  With the timing of the patent grant along with Trius upping its authorized share count for the purpose of incentive rewards  it s likely in my opinion that the company will be acquired soon by Cubist for at least double its current price  As mentioned above  we have seen a few small cap biotechs lately move a lot higher and attract heavy institutional support after their positive catalyst events have occurred    ACADIA  Sarepta  Arena are but a few examples  I am confident Trius will do the same and move into the double digit stock price range very soon  At the very least  Cubist could partner with Trius  and any such deal would be a lucrative one for Trius  However  Cubist would be better served buying Trius straight out for the reasons I have mentioned here in this article  Additionally  there is has been a lot of news about multi drug resistant organisms  MDROs   such as MRSA  vancomycin resistant enterococci  VRE   and Carbapenem resistant enterobacteriaceae  CRC   NBC  in February this year which stated that there has been a sharp jump in the number of rare but potentially deadly types of super bug bacterias resistant to nearly all last resort antibiotics  As mentioned  Congress took action passing The Gain Act  to incentivize companies to develop new treatments to combat this problem  as new strains become more resistant to current treatments on the market  Considering all these factors  my one year price target opinion for Trius is  20 a share  which would roughly equate to a  1B market cap    or what was reportedly offered by Cubist for another company in the segment  As already stated  I believe the stock will cross over the  10 mark soon ,2013-06-04,Scott

107039,328554,ARNA,Global Approval Could Be On The Horizon For Orexigen s Weight Loss Drug,opinion,Orexigen  NASDAQ OREX  faces a U S  Food and Drug Administration  FDA  approval decision for NB32  Contrave  on September 11th  2014   Contrave is a combination of bupropion sustained release  SR  and Orexigen s wholly owned SR version of naltrexone   designed to help patients lose weight  The addition of Naltrexone said to improve patient tolerability for the treatment  The company is due to receive roughly  100 million with approval and launch of the product    Over the last few years  weight loss drugs have received an abundance of media attention and investor speculation    Arena s  NASDAQ ARNA  Belviq gained FDA approval in   Belviq is approved for use in adults with a body mass index of 30 or greater  or adults with a BMI of 27 or greater who have at least one weight related condition such as high blood pressure  type II diabetes  or high cholesterol   Belviq is thought to selectively activate serotonin 2C receptors in the brain  which may help a patients eat less and feel full after eating smaller amounts of food   Belviq has its limitations on how it can be prescribed  and cannot be prescribed if a patient is taking other products intended for weight loss  This means that a patient cannot  mix  Belviq with other weight loss drugs  This limitation could potentially affect overall weight loss for a patient  and could dissuade both patients and doctors from prescribing Belviq   Additionally  the effect of the drug on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality have not been established  which is a very important factor for both patients and their doctors who might be inclined to prescribe Belviq over other weight loss drugs    Orexigen s Contrave seems to have one advantage over Belviq  its  Light Study  data  The Light Study interim data met the SPA requirements on 8900 patients and showed Contrave did not increase the risk of MACE  Doctors could be more inclined to prescribe Contrave over Belviq because of this cardiovascular study   there is no such study with Arena s Belviq    Vivus s  NASDAQ VVUS  Qsymia was approved by the FDA in   However  Qsymia was approved with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy  REMS   which informs doctors and female patients of reproductive potential about an increased risk of orofacial clefts in infants exposed to Qsymia during the first trimester of pregnancy  Even with this warning  Qsymia has been seeing decent script numbers of late  Starting in 2013  Qsymia scripts saw 81k in quarter two of 2013  109k in Q3  2013  124k in Q4  2013  and 121k in Q1  2014  respectively  However  of all the Qsymia scripts  54  are discounted  of which 33  are sold at a discounted price along with 21  given away for free  We feel this is a bad way to do business with the safety issues that could arise from Qsymia for women  Both Arena  via Eisai  and Vivus are engaged in healthy promotion to get scripts up by giving away discounted and free scripts  There is no question that the demand is there from people who are clinically defined as being obese  The greater question is what is the longer term safety of both Belviq and Qsymia  In clinical trials of Contrave in excess of 4 500 people  53  of those taking Contrave and 21  of those taking placebo lost five percent or more of their body weight over the twelve month trial duration  with many patients seeing improvements in cholesterol levels and blood sugar control  For those who actually went on a proper diet and properly exercised  the results were predictably better   If Contrave is approved  it will be marketed by Takeda Pharma  OTC TKPHF   a large Japanese company worth in excess of  35B Cardiovascular issues seems to be the number one concern with these weight loss drugs  Belviq and Qsymia seem to be unknowns in this regard while Contrave so far has the interim positive safety data from its Light Study  The Light Study has  the SPA requirements on 8900 patients showing that Contrave did not increase the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events  MACE   Because of this study  doctors might be more inclined to prescribe Contrave over Belviq and Qsymia  which both lack the cardiovascular  CV  data Contrave enjoys   This factor seems to favor Contrave over Belviq and Qsymia  and could possibly tip the scales towards Contrave in the United States  Vivus and Arena failed to gain approval in Europe  Arena withdrew Belviq application  because both of these drugs simply did not have the data needed for European regulators to give it the green light  Contrave has a very good chance to gain both FDA and European approval  with the expected European approval decision to occur sometime in October of this year  The political pressure could be ramping up in Europe to approve a drug like Contrave  In Europe  it s estimated that new cases of diabetes will increase from 366M to over 550M by 2030    In 2012  France  Germany  Italy  Spain  and the U K  saw combined spending over 120B for diabetic treatments  and this number continues to rise  Obesity in Europe is now being considered a disability  With Belviq and Qsymia seemingly out of the game in Europe  if approved  Contrave could dominate that market region Orexigen will receive  100M upon approval and launch in the USA of Orexigen Bullish Call Option Chain August OptionsAs we can see above  there is heavy open interest in the August calls  so some traders believe there will be an an early approval  The put side looks more like a hedge  and not a very big one September OptionsThe September calls show an extremely bullish sentiment  which most investors and traders believe the stock will be near or over  7 by the time of the September expiry  Orexigen is taking the proper steps and engaging in proper communication with U S  and European regulators to ensure approval for Contrave here  To show constrast  recently AcelRx received a complete response letter  CRL  from the FDA for its pain medication dispensing machine  Zalviso  AcelRx did not ask for an approval extension and  gambled  that the FDA would review the application amendments    they lost that gamble and it has so far cost investors 30  equity loss  We can clearly see Orexigen is not willing to take that gamble which we think bodes well for investors ,2014-07-30,Scott

107041,328556,ARNA,Arena Stumbles On EMA Concerns Over Belviq Ahead Of Launch,opinion,We ve seen no shortage of recent volatility in shares of Arena Pharmaceuticals  ARNA   which moved down over 9 7  just yesterday based on commentary from the company regarding the prospects of its flagship product and weight loss drug Belviq  lorcaserin  in the European Union   The company s statements claim that an advisory committee for the EMA  European Medicines Agency  is trying to find out more about Belviq s safety profile   specifically regarding its supposed  heart valve issues  and  psychiatric side effects  on top of the tumors that were found during animal studies   In addition  the advisory panel also wants Arena to build their argument for approval for the drug  based on the potential efficacy that the drug offers in the obese population versus the potential side effects and other unforeseen consequences that may occur from prolonged use of Belviq lorcaserin   While the market s commentary seems to imply that people weren t expecting the Europeans to allow Arena  and Eisai  to march into the EU to sell a weight loss pills anyway  there seems to be a sense of disappointment that such a large  and growing  market for obese adults seems to be unassailable   at least for the time being   This same disappointment seems to be derailing the ARNA rally that started in December 2012 following the DEA scheduling of Belviq  Recall that the DEA scheduling was the only thing holding Arena back from a market launch of Belviq for the second half of 2012  and was a major source of frustration for anyone on the long side of ARNA during the time  since the stock traded very bearishly at certain points   Investors seemed quite satisfied once it was  guaranteed  that Belviq was going to initiate its launch in early 2013  although the excitement only got ARNA investors so far   ARNA clawed its way up to  10 share earlier this month  and made at attempt at  11 share before recent profit taking  and news from Europe  tanked the stock to  8 82 share   where it closed yesterday   Going forward  I think any investor who is serious about ARNA will have to prepare for what could be a very volatile launch for Belviq in the US market in the near future  This notion is based on what we saw from the launch of Qsymia  phentermine and topiramate  in September  2012 by Arena s biggest competitor  Vivus  VVUS   Although Belviq and Qsymia are not clones of each other  I believe that Vivus  launch provided some valuable insight for biopharma investors and Arena   specifically regarding big problems with prescription reimbursement and with sales volume in the obesity drug sector  Note that Vivus had to implement a  samples  strategy to reach the most recent prescription figures released   The exact launch date for Belviq is not known at this time  although I think that we are looking late February or early March  It s also unclear exactly how much the Belviq launch will resemble the Qsymia launch in 2012  although Arena investors should be prepare for the worst in the short run   In the long run  the bullish argument for Belviq and the rest of the prescription weight loss drug market holds relatively strong  Arena  the most expensive play in the subsector  is trading at a market capitalization of just under  2 billion  Even using conservative estimates  one can gauge that the size of the prescription obesity drug market would be quite monstrous   in the tens of billions within the United States alone  Arena is generally considered the safer drug over Qsymia  and seems to have a better indication and reputation amongst doctors which implies that it could take the lion s share of the market   The implication is that Arena simply doesn t need the European market to justify its valuation of   2 billion  The sheer amount of unmet demand in the United States should leave enough room for Vivus  too  The problem seems to be with the reimbursement policies of major healthcare companies  and the  growing pains  for the obesity drug market  I think it s also important to factor in the lack of competition from big pharma  which not only introduces some M A speculation over Arena  and Vivus   but also gives some hope for quick sales growth later on ,2013-01-24,Myriad Equity,https://www.investing.com/analysis/arena-stumbles-on-ema-concerns-over-belviq-ahead-of-launch-152223,152223
107042,328557,ARNA,7 Biopharma Catalyst Trades To Watch For This Week,opinion,Trading biophama stocks before a catalyst event  if done correctly  can be a very profitable proposition  Some traders and investors who enjoy bringing more risk into play often times will hold through the actual catalyst event  While this does bring more risk into play  the reward from engaging in this can be a massive one  Today  I list a few small cap companies and their respective catalyst events for traders to consider  EnteroMedics Inc   ETRM  Entero focuses on the design and development of devices that use neuroblocking technology to treat obesity  metabolic diseases  and other gastrointestinal disorders  Its proprietary neuroblocking technology is designed to intermittently block the vagal nerve using electrical impulses  The company is developing the Maestro System  which is used to limit the expansion of the stomach  control hunger sensations between meals  reduce the frequency and intensity of stomach contractions  and produce a feeling of early and prolonged fullness  According to     and my correspondence with investor relations  Phase III data from its Recharge study on its flagship product  The Maestro System  is due to be released around mid Q1  In 2009  traders bet the stock to near  30 a share on anticipation of the company s  EMPOWER  study succeeding  But  after it ultimately failed to meet both its primary and secondary endpoints  the stock tanked to below  10 a share  and became somewhat forgotten by the market  After the failure of the EMPOWER study  the company   Based on the analysis to date  the control arm of the trial  which was intended to be inactive  apparently provided a low intensity blocking signal that introduced VBLOC Therapy in human subjects  After the addressing the issues and meeting with the FDA  the company made some modifications to the system  and designed a new Phase III trial      requires the company show a 10  greater Excess Weight Loss  EWL  from randomization with the Maestro System after 12 months of VBLOC therapy compared to control by BMI method  and to observe clinically meaningful responder rates in the treatment arm of 20  and 25  EWL from implant at 12 months  not statistically based   In 2010  the company s Australian cohort  that easily surpasses the new trial s requirements  In the Australian cohort  a total of 83 subjects were enrolled at two centers  with 61 subjects implanted  Main outcome measures were morbidity  mortality  and excess weight loss at 12 months  Results include Mean 12 month EWL was 25  for the treatment group and 17  for the control group Weight loss was linearly related to hours of device use  subjects with greater than or equal to 9 hours day use achieved 37  and 21  mean EWL  treated versus control  p    02   andNo therapy related serious adverse events or deaths were reported across the entire study population As we can see from above  the numbers easily surpass the endpoints defined in the new ReCharge Study  The statistical difference from the cohort study is 32  and with and an even greater mean EWL  blowing away both Arena s  ARNA  and Vvus s  VVUS  anti obesity drug treatments Belviq and Qsymia  respectively  Considering all the factors here  I expect EnteroMedics to announce positive data sometime around the middle of February  The chart above indicates to me that the stock has found two bases  one at  2 30  another at  2 65  and has recently broke its mid term down trend line  With this consolidation above  2 72  I expect much more upside in the short term  with  3 30 as being the first level before making a second move to  4 40 or higher  Morbid obesity is an ever growing problem worldwide  and having the option of a device like the Maestro System as a choice over gastric bypass surgery and potentially dangerous pills could really make a difference in the lives of those who might need it  It could also mean big dollars for the company  which in turn would mean huge gains for the company s stock holders  Both traders and investors should keep a close eye out on this one as I feel it has strong potential to be a multi bagger this year  Auxilium Pharmaceuticals  AUXL  Auxilium engages in developing and marketing pharmaceutical products primarily in the United States  It markets Testim  a testosterone gel for the treatment of hypogonadism  and XIAFLEX  collagenase clostridium histolyticum   an injectable collagenase enzyme for the treatment of Dupuytren s contracture in adult patients with a palpable cord  In the third quarter of 2012  Auxilium completed enrollment in its frozen shoulder phase IIa  Top line data from the XIAFLEX study is expected in the first quarter of 2013  Frozen shoulder  which doctors call adhesive capsulitis  is frequently caused by injury that leads to lack of use due to pain  Rheumatic disease progression and recent shoulder surgery can also cause frozen shoulder  Frozen shoulder affects 10  to 20  of people with diabetes  and 10  of those with rotator cuff injuries  ages 40 60  There is a decent size market for frozen shoulder  so I expect anticipation of positive results here to add some upside catalyst trade value to the stock  The chart above shows that the stock has dropped significantly since its breakout  but now finding good torrent support  and consolidating in the mini channel  An inverse head and shoulders appears to be forming  indicating a possible break to the high side again  Perhaps another reason to trade Auxilium to the long side is the recently  pricing of  325 0M of 1 50  convertible senior notes which are in due 2018  The conversion rate is equal to an initial conversion price of about  24 17 per share  which is over 30  higher than the company s last closing price of  18 34  Considering the data catalyst  a strong cash position  and a much higher initial conversion price for the convertibles over the stock s current price  Auxilium might be poised to make a nice run higher in the near term  Keryx Biopharmaceuticals  KERX  Keryx focuses on the acquisition  development  and commercialization of pharmaceutical products for the treatment of renal disease in the United States  It is developing Zerenex  ferric citrate   an oral  ferric iron based compound that has the capacity to bind to phosphate in the gastrointestinal tract and form non absorbable complexes  To sum up  I list Keryx because the company is over a month late in reporting the top line data for its Phase III drug Zerenex  Another Seeking Alpha writer  Reasons for the Phase III data delay include  1  Trial complexity   many parameters to be measured per patient  such as TSAT  ferritin levels  hemoglobin  and IV iron and ESA  erythropoietin stimulating agent  requirements for patients in the trial  2  Year end issues  hurricane Sandy  vacations  etc    and most importantly  3  Query resolution  or the process of making sure all the data are entered and accounted for  prior to releasing results  Nevertheless  we believe that queries by the CRO conducting the study have wrapped up and that the company will release results imminently  perhaps later this week  Should Zerenex demonstrate that it can meaningfully help manage anemia in dialysis patients and ultimately in pre dialysis patients  those with Chronic Kidney Disease   the drug could have multi hundred million dollar potential  As we see it  the odds of Zerenex repeating prior clinical results are high  and the upside to KERX could be significant if it does  The above writer might be ultimately proven correct in his assessment  but investors and traders should consider alternative viewpoints as well  One such viewpoint for the Phase III data being late hinges on comments offered by Martin Shkreli in an  he wrote for The Street com covering another company back in December  2012  Shkereli remarks  Clinical trials taking longer than expected usually means someone made bad assumptions about the way control group patients would behave  When a company tells you results from a cancer drug trial are being pushed back  don t think   Hurray  the drug must be working   Instead  run away  scared  Last month  Amicus  FOLD  finally released its Phase III top line data for its 6 month study for its clinical drug Amigal  designed to treat Fabry disease  The 6 month trial failed to meet its primary endpoint  After six months  13 of 32  or 41   of Amigal treated patients demonstrated a kidney response compared to 9 of 32  or 28   of the placebo controlled patients  The results failed to show the required statistical advantage of Amigal over the placebo control arm  Also in December 2012  Oncothyreon  ONTY   Phase III data fail for its drug L BLP25  being developed for the treatment of unresectable stage III non small cell lung cancer  NSCLC   L BLP25 did not meet its primary endpoint to improve overall survival  OS  significantly  Shkereli s exact comment was offered towards cancer drugs  yet Amicus s Amigal is not designed to treat cancer  However  both of the above companies had one point in common  both data releases were delayed significantly   The chart shows that the stock rallied hard  breaking its up channel only to fill the gap and drop back down  The chart looks bearish to me  and may be poised to drop further on the failed breakout  While data from Zerenex s Phase III trial is overdue  this does not necessarily mean the data will be bad  However  success in the market in large part heavily relies on predicting future events by establishing a clear trend in past events  While Zerenex is not designed to treat cancer  again  neither is Amicus s Amigal  I consider Martin Shkreli to be a smart man  so it s my opinion that the best course of action concerning Keryx is to carefully weigh all factors  pros and cons  before either going long or shorting the stock  I personally take a bearish stance on the data release based on the factors I have mentioned above  Exact Sciences Corporation  EXAS  Exact focuses on developing a molecular diagnostic technology for the early detection and prevention of colorectal pre cancer and cancer  The company develops the Cologuard  a non invasive stool based DNA colorectal cancer screening test that is designed to detect each of the four stages of colorectal cancer  as well as pre cancerous lesions  Exas is running the pivotal trial for Cologuard  a multi marker molecular diagnostic screening test for the early detection of colorectal cancer  Full results of the trial are expected in the current quarter  If the results are positive  the company plans to file for Pre Marketing Authorization  PMA  in the same quarter   from its 900 patient study demonstrated 98  sensitivity for cancer  which is a high number for detecting the pre cancers  with 83  sensitivity for high grade dysplasia and 57  for pre cancer  All sensitivities were reported at a specificity of 90   A company with a strong diagnostic test to detect for colorectal cancer has considerable speculation value in my strong opinion    the earlier cancer is detected  the better the chances are of treating it into remission  Exas has been trading strongly to the upside since its 52 week low of  8 82 in November of 2012  and currently trades at  11 42  not far from its 52 week high of 12 30 set in October of 2012 The chart above looks to me to be setting up for a cup and handle breakout  Although I would like to see this formation take longer to occur  I still like the prospects here for a move to the upside  The stock should find support at  11 before a possible strong breakout above  12  With the anticipation of very good results from its total data release for its 900 patient study  I would expect Exas to challenge its 52 week high shortly  Celsion Corp   CLSN  Celsion engages in the development and commercialization of targeted chemotherapeutic

this does not mean the data will be bad  It means with all the volatility  that there is no clear indicator either way  On January 16th  the stock was  for trading after it plunged from  9 40 down to  6 17 on what appeared to be a  bear raid  after being  the same morning from a  buy  to a  sell  rating by Brean Capital  In my opinion  this is actually a good sign as many bear raids are designed to get short sellers out of a potential bad position  helping them to avoid a margin call situation when a stock price rises too far and fast  In Celsion s case  it is my opinion that this is what transpired  as the stock rebounded the very same day to close at  8 10  up sharply from its intraday low of  6 17  The stock has been in a strong up channel and appears to be overextended at these levels despite its pullback  The chart can break either way on data  but I lean towards the upside here  Short sellers possibly wanting out of their Celsion position on an apparent bear raid indicates

107043,328558,ARNA,Trius Therapeutics  New MSRA Treatment Could Bring Billions In Revenues,opinion,Lately  there is has been a lot of news about Multidrug resistant organisms  MDROs   such as methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus  MRSA   vancomycin resistant enterococci  VRE   and Carbapenem resistant enterobacteriaceae  CRC   NBC news did a story  about a sharp jump in the number of rare but potentially deadly types of a superbug resistant to nearly all last resort antibiotics  A doctor friend of mine has been put on alert by his hospital to take extra precautionary measures concerning this new superbug  In the article  the Center for Disease Control  CDC  remarked that  This increase highlights the need for U S  health care providers to act aggressively to prevent the emergence and spread of these unusual CRE organisms  MRSA is also on the   with infections doubling in the just the last 5 years  Chicago scientists say the new estimate might even be low balling the disease s pervasiveness because the database they use tends to under report instances of MRSA if patients were hospitalized for some other ailment  When the researchers went back to correct for the statistical inaccuracy  they discovered that the insurance claims had missed between one third to one half of actual MRSA cases as recorded by the hospitals  own records  Considering the above factors  I consider Trius Therapeutics  TSRX  to be a very strong speculative investment  The company is expecting topline data at the end of this quarter for Tedizolid phosphate  TR 701   an IV and orally administered second generation oxazolidinone for the treatment of serious gram positive infections  including MRSA  The company has designed TR 701 to be superior to first generation clinically developed oxazolidinones  Pfizer s  PFE  marketed drug linezolid is currently the only FDA approved oxazolidinone  which in 2010  had  1 2B in sales  TR 701 may offer several advantages over linezolid which include greater potency  once daily dosing  predictable drug exposure  a shorter course of therapy  in vivo bactericidal  i e   bacterial killing  activity  lower frequency of resistance  activity against linezolid resistant bacterial strains and an improved safety profile  The ESTABLISH 1 trial examined the efficacy and safety of a 200 mg tablet of tedizolid given once per day for six days versus a 600 mg tablet of linezolid given twice per day for 10 days in 667 patients in North America  Latin America and Europe  The trial was the first pivotal study conducted to prospectively measure the new FDA  early response  primary endpoint of cessation of lesion spread and absence of fever 48 72 hours after the first dose  The trial also measured as secondary endpoints this  early response  sustained to the end of therapy  EOT  day 11  as well as captured the EMA endpoint of clinical investigator s assessment at the post treatment evaluation visit  7 14 days after EOT   On February 12th  the company announced that the results from ESTABLISH 1  a Phase III study of tedizolid phosphate  TR 701  versus linezolid  Zyvox R   completed in 2011  were published in   JAMA   According to the release  As detailed in the JAMA article  tedizolid achieved the primary and all secondary endpoints in the ESTABLISH 1 trial  Approximately 42 percent of pathogens isolated at baseline in the study were methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus  MRSA   For both tedizolid and linezolid there was good concordance   80   between the early primary endpoint and late investigator assessed secondary endpoints suggesting that the early response is a good indicator of a sustained clinical response to therapy  In addition  the trial showed that tedizolid had a statistically lower impact on platelets and was associated with a statistically significant lower rate of gastrointestinal  GI  adverse events than linezolid  If ultimately approved by the FDA  and with the data looking good  Pfizer s linezolid could end up being a second fiddle to TR 701  Another strong factor Trius has going for it is that the October 2012   Generating Antibiotics Incentives Now Act  was passed to encourage companies like Trius to develop new antibiotics  allowing them to stream line certain regulatory processes for commercialization  Perhaps the most important aspect of the GAIN act for Trius is that it offers companies 5 years of market exclusively  which would give Trius a ton of leverage if they choose to partner TR 101 and or sell the company to a larger pharma  The GAIN act s 5 years of market exclusivety is similar to a company gaining New Chemical Entity  NCE  status  which is what Amarin  AMRN  has been trying for with its drug Vascepa  Many believe Amarin s stock price has suffered because the company has to date failed to gain NCE status  which would also provide the company with 5 years of market exclusivity    Trius engaged in a public offering at the market  ATM  price of  4 75 a share  Often times  when small cap biotechs  dilute  the share price heads down  This was not the case with Trius  as the stock rallied on the offering to near  5 in a couple of trading sessions  Many times  both investors and traders do not understand how offerings work  and automatically assume the stock price will go down  In   Arena Pharma  ARNA  did an ATM at  5 50  following FDA approval of its weight loss drug  Belviq  Many institutions and retail investors have been and are still bullish over Arena s long term prospects  So  they grabbed up the offering  Since that time  the stock has been as high as  11 a share before falling back a bit to the level where it trades today  in the lower  8 range  Belviq is one of two new weight loss drugs approved since 1999  the other being Vivus s  VVUS  Qsymia  Synta Pharmaceuticals  SNTA   offering at  8 80 a share back in December 2012  Since then  the stock hit a high of over  12 a share before falling back to where it trades today  around  8 80 a share  I wrote about Synta a few days before the offering when the stock price was around  7 80  giving an opinion that I believed the company made for a good catalyst trade at the time with four upcoming data releases  The above are two cases of small tech biopharmas engaging in direct ATM offerings that had very positive results  In just about every case of a direct ATM offering  the stock normally rises quite a bit  The kind of financing that can be negative on a stock is when a company engages in a private placement  with tons of warrants issued to  private investors   Often times these offerings tend to be toxic  so investors need to keep a close eye when and if companies they hold positions in engage in private placements An upwards continuation pattern is clearly showing up in the above chart with an up trending accumulation and RSI  It looks to me like  6 is coming very soon With the company having an abundant supply of cash on hand and with the current issues in health care regarding MRSA s  I feel Trius has a good chance to see a double digit stock price this year ,2013-03-06,Scott

107044,328559,ARNA,AVEO Poised To Move Higher Before Obama Care  Platform Potential,opinion,The advent of The Affordable Care act  Obama Care  on the horizon as the healthcare sector of the market continues its strong rally  With new Food and Drug Administration  FDA  regulatory easing  congressional bills  and The Obama Administration directive in 2011  2012 saw  by the FDA  the highest number since 1996 and 30  more than were approved the previous year  The biopharma segment is the place to be moving forward  and one such company is poised to take advantage of the rally AVEO Pharma  AVEO  engages in discovering  developing  and commercializing targeted cancer therapies using its  Compared to traditional methods  this advanced platform allows AVEO Pharma to more accurately replicate populations of tumors and cancerous mutations akin to those seen in human populations  Its principal product candidate is tivzanib  indicated for the treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma  RCC   The company is also engaged in a Phase II clinical trial for the first line therapy in patients with advanced metastatic colorectal cancer  and a Phase II clinical trial for the treatment of patients with locally recurrent or metastatic triple negative breast cancer Upcoming catalystAn FDA Advisory committee will convene on May 2nd to vote for or against recommending tivzanib for approval tivozanib is an oral  once daily  investigational tyrosine kinase inhibitor  AVEO has submitted a New Drug Application  NDA  that is  by the U S  Food and Drug Administration  FDA  seeking approval for tivozanib in patients with   RCC   otherwise known as Kidney Cancer  tivozanib is a selective and long half life inhibitor of all three vascular endothelial growth factor  VEGF  receptors that is designed to optimize  while minimizing off target toxicities In January of this year  the company reported positive  from a study of 517 patients with RCC  The study compared tivozanib to a current frontline treatment for RCC  sorafenib  Sorafenib is marketed by Onyx Pharmaceuticals  ONXX  under the trade name of Nexavar    global Nexavar net sales topped over  1 billion in 2011 Dose reductions of the drugs compared were 11 6  with tivozanib versus 42 8  with sorafenib  PTivozanib was especially useful in treatment naive patients  who comprised 70  of study population  In those patients  progression free survival was 12 7 months with tivzanib and 9 1 months with Nexavar  HR  0 756  P    037   This is the first phase 3 trial to show greater than 12 months progression free survival in treatment na ve patients  with advanced renal cell carcinoma    said Dr  Eisen  a tivozanib 1 investigator from the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom Shares of AVEO dropped when the final overall survival data  OS  was announced February 13th of this year  Investors were initially underwhelmed by tivozanib s OS of 28 8 months versus 29 3 months for Nexavar  However  the study had a  allowance  which permitted patients to switch therapies if the disease progressed or their symptoms worsened  So  why did tivozanib have a lower OS In the  where Nexavar was compared to Placebo  Nexavar showed a 6 months post crossover OS of 19 3 months  Data presented at 2006 ASCO   As mentioned above  in AVEO s Phase III study of tivzanib vs Nexavar  Nexavar showed an OS of 29 3 months  Why is there a 10 month improvement in Nexavar s OS between the two studies  Because AVEO s study allowed up to 67   by 26 months  of Nexavar s arm to cross over to receive tivozanib treatment  whereas patients in the tivozanib arm had minimal crossover  10   into the Nexavar treatment  there is strong reason to believe that the crossover to recetivozanib treatment contributed to the bulk of Sora s 10 additional months of OS benefit with dual treatment  Dr  Eisen first indicated that OS with tivzanib was not a measurement of efficacy  and probably could not be  since patients who progressed on Nexavarwere given the option of crossing over to tivzanib  which would compromise any overall survival figure for this arm of the study This same phenomenon in divergence between OS rates has occurred with other drug trials before  For example  when Dendreon s  DNDN  Provenge was prescribed first  then Zytiga afterwards  OS rates went up  but Zytiga on its own failed to show any improvement in OS  In other words  when doctors prescribed Zytiga first  they put their patients at risk of having the disease progress The rate of dose interruptions due to adverse events was 18  for tivzanib compared to 35  for Nexavar  p  Further data shows that 74  of the patients who switched to tivzanib had evidence of tumor regression and overall confirmed response rate was 13     a clear sign of strong efficacy Patients who started with Nexavar and switched to tivzanib after disease progression achieved a median progression free survival of 8 4 months and a median overall survival of 19 6 months  These numbers are among the best seen for patients treated in the second line setting and a strong reason why the FDA committee will recommend tivzanib for approval If tivzanib gains FDA approval   which I strongly believe it will  through its partnership with Astellas  AVEO has the potential to  in milestones for RCC alone    an extremely important value driver for the company and its shareholders While the upcoming catalyst is very important for the company  it s apparent to me that investors are too single focused on tivzanib treating RCC  and whether or not the drug will be a front line or second line treatment for the disease  What is more important here is the company s overall platform monetary potential  As mentioned above  tivzanib is being studied in triple negative breast cancer  which is a huge untapped market  tivzanib and the platform it s based on has shown better patient tolerability  which results in better patient compliance One of the goals of Obama Care is to help increase patient compliance and AVEO s platform approach provides just that  When compared to its peers  tivzanib s side effect profile is markedly superior Approval of tivzanib opens the door for AVEO to further advance studies for tivzanib and other pipelined drugs because they will receive up to  1 3B from Astellas  Also  another important benefit from tivzanib gaining approval for investors  is that the company should not have to engage in anymore finance deals  so share holder dilution should not be an issue moving forward    Astellas milestone payments should have this covered In part  this is the same bullish thesis I have been making for Arena Pharma  ARNA  since Belviq  last year    Belviq was the first anti Obesity drug approved by the FDA since the late 1990 s There has been great debate between the bulls and bears concerning the revenue potential of Belviq  Some believe the drug will bring in massive revenues  while others think differently  Even if Belviq falls short of bullish expectations  revenue from the drug should provide the company the needed capital to advance its other pipelined drugs without having to accept less than favorable royalty deals  The company should no longer have to dilute investors with market based capital raises  This should provide Arena with the needed leverage to grow the company substantially larger over the next few years  regardless of whether Belviq is a huge winner or not Another company with a similar situation is to AVEO is Ariad Pharma  ARIA  Merck  MRK  entered into a milestone payment  with Aria for ridaforolimus in July of 2007  Merck made a  75 million upfront payment to ARIAD and after that paid ARIAD  53 5 million in milestone payments for the initiation of Phase II and Phase III clinical trials of ridaforolimus  in addition to paying a 50 percent share of ridaforolimus development  manufacturing and commercialization costs Ridaforolimus is an investigational targeted and small molecule inhibitor designed to treat sarcomas  In June of 2012  the FDA rejected Ariad and Merck s New Drug Application  NDA  by issuing a complete response letter  CRL  regarding the drug However  because Ariad received a good amount of money from Merck for ridaforolimus  the company was able to use the capital to help develop Iclusig   ponatinib   which was approved by the FDA   Ponatinib is a BCR ABL inhibitor designed to treat adults with chronic myeloid leukemia  CML  and Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia  Ph  ALL   two rare blood and bone marrow diseases  As late as 2009  Ariad stock was selling under  0 80 a share  Based on the speculation surrounding ponatinib  the stock traded as high as  25 a share in late 2012 The most important point that I feel investors need to consider is the potential of AVEO s entire platform  rather than merely focusing on whether or not tivzanib will be approved as a first or second line RCC treatment  As previously mentioned  the company stands to receive  1 3B from Astellas in milestones upon FDA approval of tivzanib  Additionally  the  1 3B in milestones are only for the RCC approval segment  where potential sales could reach  400M  Why would Astellas be willing to pay so much for peak sales in RCC of  400M Part of the answer might be found in the fact that AVEO is currently engaged in its  Phase II trial  which is designed to evaluate tivzanib in patients with  Triple negative breast cancer is a lucrative market because there are currently no targeted therapies approved for this segment tivzanib s front line potential to treat such diseases as triple negative breast cancer and colorectal cancer is likely the reason Astellas is willing to pay AVEO over  1B in milestones AVEO s early clinical pipelined drug AV 203 would see a huge benefit if tivzanib gains FDA approval  AV 203 is a monoclonal antibody that selectively targets the receptor ERBB3  a new and promising strategy for treating various cancers In March 2009  AVEO announced an exclusive option and license agreement with Biogen Idec  Inc   BIIB  for the development and commercialization of ERBB3 targeted antibodies  Through the agreement  AVEO retains North American commercialization rights to AV 203 and all ERBB3 binding antibodies  and is responsible for leading global development of the ERBB3 program In May 2012  AVEO  the initiation of a Phase 1 study examining the safety and preliminary efficacy of AV 203 along with exploratory biomarkers in patients with advanced solid tumors  AV 203 was developed through AVEO s Human Response Platform   which evaluates drugs that can block the function of cancer causing target genes and identifies biomarkers that are indicators of drug response or resistance in patients Recent Insider BuysDirector Termeer seems rather bullish on AVEO  as evident from his 55 499 direct purchase Out of these share statistics  it is important to note the 4 64 million shares held short  With the FDA Adcomm quickly approaching  shorts covering their position should lead to stock price appreciation  I would not expect the shorts to risk substantial losses  as there is a very high chance we see a positive result from the Adcomm  click to enlarge The stock price has been consolidating nicely here between  7 25 and  7 70  The MACD histogram looks like it wants to cross over positive  and it also appears shorts have been churning out of their positions The chart looks set up going into the May 2nd Adcomm for a run to over  8 50 Conclusion AVEO has a market cap of  318 23M  which in my opinion  is about  180M too low when considering the greater potential of tivzanib as a front line drug to treat diseases such as triple negative breast cancer among others  AV 203 has begun a Phase II study that could lead to a pivotal Phase III study  and we have an FDA Adcomm quickly approaching  I predict the Adcomm will be positive  and that tivzanib will win FDA approval for RCC  As mentioned prior  it is not of utmost importance whether tivzanib will be a first line or second line treatment  What is more important is the money AVEO will receive from Astellas to further advance tivzanib as a first line treatment for diseases that have much higher monetary potential Short term price target opinion heading into Adcomm is  8 50    9 Price target opinion for a positive Adcomm is  11    11 50 FDA approval and long term target if tivzanib is ultimately approved for other indications is  25  ,2013-04-15,Scott

107052,328567,ARNA,Pharmaceutical Stocks Continue To Outperform,opinion,Investors have certainly had an easy time with the stock market of late  It seems like good news comes out every day causing another surge in share prices  The S P Depository receipts  SPY  has returned just under 9  over the past 3 months as the chart below shows And while a 9  return over a 3 month period is probably satisfactory for almost all  the pharmaceutical industry has performed even better  The iShares Dow Jones U S  Pharmaceuticals Index Fund  IHE  is a popular ETF that measures the overall performance of this space  As the chart below shows  the space has appreciated by more than 9 5  Pharmaceuticals stocks have been boosted by strong earnings  strong dividends  an aging population  and new medical developments  Consider the following The U S  currently has an aging population with a large increase in health problems such as obesity and cancer  The IMS Institute for Healthcare estimates that worldwide drug spending will increase by more than 20  by 2016 Drug makers have been developing new drugs and treatments at a frequent rate  Johnson   Johnson  JNJ  recently developed a product called   which will be used to treat prostate cancer  Celgene  CELG  recently developed a product called   which will be used to treat pancreatic cancer  And obesity  one of the leading causes of health problems globally  is currently being treated by several companies including Vivus  VVUS  and Arena Pharmaceuticals  ARNA  On average  pharmaceutical companies generate profit margins of between 20  and 30  In light of the above  it certainly is worth looking at this industry  But which stocks should investors consider Companies Worth Considering Celgene Corporation  CELG  has been on an absolute tear over the past year  As the chart below shows  Celgene has appreciated by roughly 83  during the past 52 weeks The stock has appreciated because of new drug developments and strong earnings reports  As mentioned above  one of Celgene s most anticipated drugs is Abraxane  used in   On Thursday  the U S  FDA granted  for Abraxane in combination with gemcitabine for the first line treatment of patients with advanced pancreatic cancer  Should Celgene receive approval  this will provide a big lift to the company Additionally  Celgene reported  on April 24  2013  The results were very encouraging  They also provide a roadmap to how the company can continue to outperform well into the future  For the first quarter 2013  Celgene s revenue totaled  1 46 billion  a 15  increase over the same period in 2012  Some highlights include the following REVLIMID sales for the first quarter increased by roughly 16  to  1 billion and were driven by overall market share gains and increased duration of therapy VIDAZA first quarter sales increased by roughly 10  to  204 million  Sales were driven by increased demand in the U S   Europe and Latin America In addition to strong earnings  the company also provided future guidance  Total net product sales are expected to increase by approximately 11  year over year to  6 billion  REVLIMID net product sales are expected to increase by approximately 10  year over year to  4 2 billion  Adjusted EPS guidance was raised to a range of  5 55 to  5 65 from a range of  5 50 to  5 60 Clearly Celgene has performed well and expects to perform well going into the future  Another pharmaceutical company that has caught my attention is Assured Pharmacy  APHY   Assured Pharmacy  Inc   is a growing chain of specialty pharmacies that provide advanced prescription services to a diverse array of medical professionals and their patients  Assured Pharmacy is committed to providing these physicians and patients with a better prescription process  This enhanced process is achieved by blending advanced prescribing technologies with focused pharmacology  Much like Celgene  Assured Pharmacy has experienced strong earnings and significant share price appreciation  As the chart below shows  shares have increased by approximately 53  over the past 90 days  This strong move coincides with Assured Pharmacy s recent announcement that it plans to pursue a   including opening two additional stores in Denver and Boston  Following the model of Assured s successful store opening in Kansas last year  the Denver and Boston stores will open with the support of physician groups  With a total cost under  300 000  the Kansas store was EBITDA positive in its sixth full month of operations and has a current annualized revenue run rate of  4 million  Assured also plans to open additional stores in the future given that it can do so with a minimal increase in corporate cost structure In addition to the above  the company has  on the radar The company has a backlog of patients waiting to begin using Assured that can double the patient base of existing stores  The company is actively raising capital to complete this The company is creating strategic relationships with manufacturers to assist them with the distribution of their new products  This should result in significant revenue increases The company expects to uplist to the Nasdaq or AMEXClearly Assured is on the right path  The stock price has appreciated significantly and the future catalysts are setting the stage for future appreciation as well  Conclusion Pharmaceutical stocks have had a strong run thus far in 2013 and over the past year  With an aging population that needs medication  companies that are willing to spend money in R D to develop products for new treatments  and a healthcare plan that will soon be nationalized  investors should strongly considering participating in this industry ,2013-06-03,Jim

107058,328573,ARNA,IBIO Stock Analysis,opinion,iBio    is a company I recently found while looking around for a possible long term multi bagger based on the emergence of new technology  Granted  selling for a price of  1 38 and a market cap of  65 44m  as of this writing  does indicate it is a risky investment  no question  However  with high risk does come high reward    In 2004 I bought a stock for around  0 50 and ended up selling it 3 years later for  5 50  Unfortunately  I was not able to buy as many shares as I would have liked  but still made 6 figures on the investment before the company turned investor unfriendly  My big small cap long term investment  Antares Pharma    has done very well for me  with a profit near 100k to date  and no plans to sell a single share anytime soon    If I had the money freed up at this time from AIS  I would make a long term speculative investment here  I did buy a small amount of shares for a short term catalyst trade  however  In this article  I will get into the reasons I believe iBio should make a nice short term gainer along with a possible long term multi bag gainer    The first thing that caught my eye while researching iBio is the backing it receives from the Bill   Melinda Gates Foundation along with the US Govt s   DARPA     iBio also has a partnership with The Fraunhofer USA Center for Molecular Biotechnology  FCMB  for the development and refinement of iBioLaunch  The Bill   Melinda Gates foundation and DARPA have provided over  70 million in non dilutive funding to FCMB  and iBio owns all the IP that comes out of FCMB  DARPA has been responsible for funding the development of many technologies which have had a major effect on the world  including computer networking and    Key technology platform  iBioLaunch    The iBioLaunch platform uses transient gene expression in plants for superior efficiency in protein production  Advantages include significantly lower capital  more than a 90  reduction  and process costs  more than a 90  reduction   and the technology is designed for infectious disease applications or proteins where speed  scalability  and surge capacity are important    To get a better idea from the company about iBioLaunch  let s take a look at the following statement from iBio s    In order to attract appropriate licensees and increase the value of our share of such intended contractual arrangements  we engaged the Center for Molecular Biotechnology of Fraunhofer USA  Inc   or FhCMB  in 2003 to perform research and development activities to develop the platform and to create our first product candidate  We selected a plant based influenza vaccine for human use as the product candidate to exemplify the value of the platform  Based on research conducted by FhCMB  our proprietary technology is applicable to the production of vaccines for any strain of influenza of H1N1 swine like influenza  A Phase 1 clinical trial of a vaccine candidate for H1N1 influenza  based on iBio s technology  was initiated in September 2010  We announced positive interim results in June 2011  The vaccine candidate demonstrated strong induction of dose correlated immune responses  with or without adjuvant  as assessed by virus microneutralization antibody assays and hemagglutination inhibition   HAI   responses  The vaccine was safe and well tolerated at all doses when administered with and without adjuvant    In layman s terms  iBioLaunch in part is designed to make influenza vaccines better by eliminating conventional animal cell production techniques  Current Swine flu  H1N1  vaccine shots are made up of all kinds of animal pathogens  Many people become ill just from receiving animal pathogen based vaccines  as it is common place for these conventional vaccines to actually cause their own illnesses  iBio s process would greatly reduce  or eliminate these side effects all together    The iBioLaunch platform also offers significant advantages over earlier plant based methods that rely on transgenic plants or plant cell cultures  These include the speed at which different proteins can be expressed and produced at commercial scale  which presents a significant commercial advantage  as well as public safety benefits when vaccines for pandemic diseases are required  Other advantages include scalability  no risks of contamination by animal pathogens  and the ability to express complex proteins at which other systems have failed    iBioLaunch also bolsters the claim its vaccines can be created in under 5 weeks  Conventional techniques can take up to 16 months and can cost upwards of  1 billion to construct a conventional facility to produce conventional proteins  iBio production facility cost is under  100 million  This is a major factor why DARPA pays for all the clinical research for iBiolaunch  Epidemics and pandemics need faster responses  or the possibility remains for a serious outbreak to occur  which could be a threat to The United States National Security    The iBioLaunch technology platform addresses several multi billion dollar markets  Its applicability to a broad range of product classes enables iBio to target global commercial collaborations in high growth markets such as orphan biologics   54 6 billion in 2009   biosimilars bio betters    80 billion worth of biologics sales will be susceptible to biosimilar competition  by 2013  and new proprietary biologics  The speed and superior economic scalability of the iBioLaunch technology make it the ideal platform for new personalized therapeutics as well as for vaccines   32 billion in 2013     In my opinion  iBio represents the future of preventive vaccines  and also new drugs that will utilize biobetter and biosimilar platform technologies    One of the main reasons I am heavily vested in Antares Pharma is based on  and  technologies  Companies that are engaging in biobetter and biosimilar technologies are where aggressive speculation biotech investors need to be focusing on in my opinion  Some traditional large pharmas are seriously behind the ball in this aspect  In my strongest opinon  these large pharmas along with some analysts are failing to fully grasp the changes that are under way in this segment  In a way  these views are about as short sighted as when the music industry ignored the emergence of mp3 technology in the late 90s    Even after the emergence of this technology  instead of capitalizing on it  they engaged the RIAA to try to stop it  These large companies lost out on billions of dollars in revenue because of their collective short sightness  Embracing change is smart  resisting change shows a history of lost opportunity  Only recently have these companies decided to embrace and offer mp3 downloads some 7 to 12 years later and after again  billions lost in unrealized revenue    Sales of biosimilars are expected to reach between  1 9 billion and  2 6 billion by 2015  up from  378 million for the year to the first half of 2011  according to IMS Health  With a new abbreviated FDA approval pathway for biologics in the United States  and increasing adoption of biosimilars globally  large pharmas need to get up to speed in this segment    Biogen Idec    and Samsung    to invest  300 million to establish a joint venture to develop  manufacture and market biosimilars  Samsung will take a leading role in the joint venture  with Biogen Idec contributing its expertise in protein engineering and biologics manufacturing  Samsung will contribute  255 million of the  300 million for an 85 percent stake and Biogen Idec will contribute  45 million for a 15 percent stake in the joint venture    In December 2011  Amgen    and Watson Pharma     that they will be working together to develop and sell biosimilar versions of several biotech cancer drugs  Amgen will assume primary responsibility for developing  manufacturing and initially commercializing the biosimilar cancer drugs  the companies said  Watson will contribute up to  400 million in co development costs and take advantage of its expertise in the sale and marketing of specialty and generic drugs  Watson will initially receive royalties and sales milestones from product revenue    All of these factors do not guarantee that iBio will be successful  but a speculation that the company should be successful and make billions in the future from its patented technologies which include biosimilar and biobetter technologies    For these reasons  it is my opinion that iBio is about as strong as it gets in the category of speculative long term investments  Being a developmental company at this time  it is not making money and is in fact burning cash  but at a reasonable rate of around    Short term catalyst event    Protalix   is currently awaiting approval of its lead drug candidate  taliglucerase alfa  with a PDUFA date of 5 1 2012  Protalix is producing proteins using plant cells but in isolation  PLX uses poly bio reactors and derivative of carrot cells in isolation  IBIO uses no bio reactors as the plant is the reactor  IBIO has much less CAPEX and quicker growth from start to finish with higher yields due to the patented vectors delivering DNA to plants to grow the proteins    The only other company with a similar type of technology to iBio  is Protalix  Its catalyst event is tied into iBio for this obvious reason    A perfect example of a cataylst tie in to another company s catalyst is when Vivus s   weight loss drug Qnexa s received a favorable recommendation from the FDA advisory committee   This event has had to date  a huge impact on Arena Pharma s   stock price because Arena has its own weight loss drug candidate  Locaresin being considered for approval  After hitting an intra day low of  1 54 on Jan 26  2012  Arena s stock price has more than doubled  hitting an intra day high of  3 47 on Mar 27  2012  I remarked in a prior article that Arena had the potential this year to see a triple in its stock price  and so far  we have seen more than a double in the pps    During the three months ended December 31  2011  iBio  1 000 000 options warrants to purchase shares of common stock at  1 96 per share  During this time frame  the stock price did in fact reach the  1 96 level  making the warrants exercisable  Like most developmental companies  iBio exercised these shares  selling most of them to raise money strictly for salary compensation  iBio receives the rest of its money from the sources I mentioned earlier in this article    Because iBio has been under the radar so to speak  the volume during the time when the shares from warrants options were being sold was very light  and this is the main reason for the stock price decline to under  1 in my opinion  As of the late  the volume and stock price have been picking up  and I foresee both the volume and share price to increase as we draw near to Protalix s PDUFA date    I can find no more warrant issuances at this time  and with my plan to cover and follow this company now and in the future  I do not see any reason for the stock price not to appreciate strongly from its current price level  at least until the PDUFA date for Protalix    Both iBio and PLX are great platforms and the first breakthroughs in manufacturing and production in regards to flu vaccines for over 40 years    iBio can produce almost all protein therapeutics where PLX can t and PLX can t produce vaccines currently  iBio s IP advantage is being able to circumvent patents held by competitors on the use of cells in isolation to produce recombinant proteins  because the iBio approach relies on transient expression of proteins in whole plants  and does not involve cultivation of cells in isolation  notwithstanding its desire to engage in biosimilar and biobetter products    iBio will benefit greatly from any PLX success in my opinion  as it will bring awareness to iBio  If Protalix receives an approval  then both stocks should be off to the races so to speak  with iBio likely seeing a triple in stock price by year s end  However  a rejection for Protalix would mean iBio s stock would lose its run up appreciation and return back to the  1 30 range  at least on a temporary basis  It is my opinion Protalix will gain approval for its platform drug    Catalyst run up trading in the bio pharma sector can be very profitable if traded correctly  iBio is relatively unknown at this time but again  with proper coverage  High risk high reward bio investors along with short term catalyst traders will really like this company in my strong opinion The chart above shows a reversal pattern with an inverted head and shoulders  short term cup and handle  and a continuing triangle in a tight wedge  The MACD and signal have been strong for about a month  showing accumulation in my strong opinion  The longer term trend seems to be setting up an inverted head and shoulders from November 2011  The shorter term trend seems bullish to me  and I would not be surprised to see a move to near  2 a share within a month to 6 weeks Also in November 2011  we can see where the company was selling the exercised warrants options  and where it stopped in January of this year  As I remarked prior  the volume was light during this period  which indicates to me the price decline was caused by exercised warrant options selling  Again  I do not see any more warrants options available to be sold to market  so the stock appears poised to have nice run up ahead for it  Decent insider ownership is coming in at a little over 30   but institutions only hold 1 70   I would like to see a much higher institutional ownership number here for stronger long term appreciation  and I believe the institutions will start to take notice of iBio soon as many of them are looking for speculative type growth companies  especially in the bio pharma sector  Many of their clients are philantropist type investors as  in a prior article I wrote not too long ago    In my opinion  iBio has strong short and long term upside potential  The long term prospects here will be dependent on the company remaining modest with its warrant issuances and stronger average daily volume over the longer term period  It is my opinion both these fundamentals will emerge in a positive manner    My final opinions on iBio  Strong short term buy  strong long term speculation buy  Short term pps target  2 days to 2 months   1 70   2 20  Mid term target  6 months to a year  Uncertain  depends on Protalix approval or rejection  Long term speculative pps target  2 to 5 years   10   50  Disclosure  I am long    ,2012-04-09,Scott Matusow,https://www.investing.com/analysis/ibio-stock-analysis-119492,119492
