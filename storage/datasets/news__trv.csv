But  the company s significant dependence on capital markets revenues makes us apprehensive  given the several geopolitical concerns  Also  the bank is likely to face challenges in expanding mortgage operations  Thus  these matters are expected to hamper fee revenue growth 
 You can  
Shares of Altria Group have lost 7 6  in the past six months against the Zacks Tobacco industry s decline of 3 2   The Zacks analyst believes that the company s shares have declined primarily due to headwinds surrounding the cigarette unit 
Management expects volumes at the domestic cigarette industry to decline 5 6  in 2019  In this context  tight regulations surrounding sales and marketing of cigarettes along with consumers  rising health awareness are deterrents 
Nonetheless  prudent pricing strategies have been aiding Altria to boost revenues in its smokeable and smokeless units as witnessed during the third quarter of 2019  During the quarter  earnings and revenues improved year on year

available in the Investors section on our website  And now I d like to turn the call over to Alan Schnitzer  Alan Schnitzer    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thank you  Abbe  Good morning  everyone  and thank you for joining us today  This morning  we reported record quarterly core income per diluted share of  3 32  Core return on equity was 14 8   As you ve heard us say before  the primary measure we use to manage our business is core return on equity over time  and any strategy to deliver industry leading returns requires a strategy to grow  also over time  For the full year 2019  we are very pleased that the continued successful execution of our strategy to grow the top line at attractive returns resulted in record net written premiums of more than  29 billion  Looking back over the last three years  our cumulative top line growth and its impact on our results are significant  Earned premiums were more than  3 5 billion higher in 2019 compared to 2016  representing a compound annual growth rate of nearly 5   That volume has made a meaningful contribution to underwriting income  We have a very high quality book of business  and we re pleased that retentions have remained high across the board in recent years  Premium growth in 2019 and over the past three years have been driven by higher pricing with both pure rate and exposure growth contributing  The new business we ve added has been in products  industries and geographies that we know well  So we re growing with confidence  Improvements in productivity and efficiency complement the benefit of volume  This quarter  our expense ratio improved to 29 1   bringing our full year expense ratio to 29 6   That marks a steady and substantial improvement over the past three years from an expense ratio  which prior to that had averaged around 32   This was driven by our efforts to leverage technology investments and workflow enhancements  Importantly  at the same time  we also continue to make strategic investments in our business  grow our investment portfolio and return substantial excess capital to our shareholders  Achieving further productivity and efficiency gains continues to be a strategic priority for us  As you ve heard us say  improved operating leverage gives us the flexibility to invest further in our strategic priorities  let the benefit fall to the bottom line and or be more competitive on pricing without compromising our return objectives  Over the course of this past year  our results were also impacted by headwinds from a challenging tort environment  Greg will comment on the impact in the current quarter  but I ll note that we continue to believe that social inflation is an environmental issue  driven primarily by a more aggressive plaintiffs  bar  For the full year  core income exceeded  2 5 billion  generating core return on equity of 10 9   Considering the challenging tort environment and persistent low interest rates  that level of profit and returns speaks to the strength and resilience of our diversified business and our investment expertise  Our results  together with our strong balance sheet  enabled us to grow adjusted book value per share by 6  during the year to  92 76  after returning  2 4 billion of excess capital to shareholders consistent with our long standing capital management strategy  Turning to production  our marketplace execution was excellent  and fourth quarter net written premiums increased by 6  to  7 1 billion  marking the 12th consecutive quarter in which we generated premium growth in all three business segments  Net written premiums in business insurance increased 5   Domestic renewal premium change was 7 8   including renewal rate change of 5 1   in both cases the highest level since 2013  while retention remained very strong  In bond and specialty insurance  net written premiums increased by 9   with strong growth in both our management liability and surety businesses  Renewal premium change in our domestic management liability business was 6 6   up about 2 points over the prior year quarter and the highest it has been since 2014  while retention remained historically high at 89   In personal insurance  net written premiums increased by 6   reflecting growth in both Agency Auto and Agency Homeowners  In our Agency Homeowners business  renewal premium change increased to 7 4   its highest level since 2014  You ll hear more shortly from Greg  Tom and Michael about our segment results  To sum it up  our performance transformed  called to action  served us well this past year  In a challenging environment  we generated a nearly 11  core return on equity  We also made important investments broadly across our value chain  advancing our ambitious innovation agenda  We digitized sales and service capabilities  improved workflows to increase speed and responsiveness  rolled out new products  implemented new analytic capabilities and put claims related digital tools in the hands of our customers and claim professionals  just to name a few  All of these and other important initiatives are part of our coordinated efforts to deliver on three priorities  aimed at positioning Travelers for continued success well into the future  namely extending our lead in risk expertise  providing great experiences to our customers  agents  brokers and employees  and optimizing productivity and efficiency  With our relentless focus on execution  deep and talented team  sophisticated analytical approach to underwriting and high degree of respect for our shareholders  capital  we are well positioned to continue to deliver meaningful shareholder value over time  And with that  I ll turn the call over to Dan Dan Frey    Chief Financial Officer Thank you  Alan  Core income for the fourth quarter was  867 million  up from  571 million in the prior year quarter  and core ROE was 14 8   up from 10   The improvement in both measures from last year s fourth quarter resulted primarily from a lower level of catastrophe losses  Our fourth quarter results include  85 million of pre tax cat losses  which consists of  186 million of cat events  partially offset by  101 million of cat recoveries under the new treaty  Recall that under that treaty  we were reinsured for 86  of losses above a  1 3 billion retention  And that through the third quarter  we had accumulated  1 2 billion toward that retention  PYD in the current quarter  for which I ll provide more detail shortly  was net favorable  60 million pre tax  The underlying combined ratio of 92 1   which excludes the impacts of cats and PYD  increased by 1 point from the prior year quarter  Our pre tax underlying underwriting gain of  538 million was down modestly from  578 million in the prior year quarter  reflecting the higher loss level associated with ongoing challenges related to the more aggressive tort environment  partially offset by the volume benefit from higher levels of premium  The fourth quarter expense ratio of 29 1  brings the full year expense ratio to 29 6   These results reflect the progress we ve made in our strategic focus on productivity and efficiency in recent years  and this is our lowest full year expense ratio since 2005  After tax net investment income decreased slightly from the prior year quarter to  525 million as increases in fixed income were more than offset by lower returns in our nonfixed income portfolio  In 2020  we expect that fixed income NII will decrease by approximately  5 million to  10 million after tax per quarter compared to the corresponding periods of 2019 as we projected the benefit of higher average levels of invested assets will be more than offset by a lower average yield on the portfolio  given the lower interest rate environment  All three segments reported modest net favorable prior year reserve development in the fourth quarter  In personal insurance  both auto and property performed better than expected for multiple accident years  In bond and specialty  we experienced better than expected loss development in the fidelity and surety line  In business insurance  net favorable PYD included about  140 million of better than expected loss experience in workers  comp and unfavorable development in the general liability and commercial multi peril lines  When our combined 2019 Schedule P is filed early in the second quarter  we expect the results to be consistent with our commentary throughout the year  with strengthening in the commercial liability lines and favorability in workers  comp  fidelity and surety and the personal lines coverages  Page 22 of the earnings presentation provides information about our January 1 cat treaty renewals  Our long standing corporate cat XoL treaty renewed on terms in line with the expiring treaty and continues to provide coverage for both single cat events and the aggregation of losses from multiple cat events  As you know  for 2019  we added a new property aggregate catastrophe XoL treaty  First  let me take a moment to summarize the impact of that treaty on our 2019 results  For the full year  as expected  the treaty increased our underlying combined ratio by about 0 5 point  The treaty had essentially no impact on the full year s total combined ratio as the impact on the underlying combined ratio was virtually offset by the benefit of cat recoveries under the treaty  also very much in line with our assumptions  Because we did not surpass our retention level until the fourth quarter  that s when we began to recognize recoveries under the treaty  So the impact on the fourth quarter specifically was a benefit to the total combined ratio of more than 1 point and there was virtually no impact on the underlying combined ratio  As renewed for 2020  this treaty will continue to address from one  qualifying PCS designated events in North America for which we incur losses of  5 million or more  providing aggregate coverage of  280 million part of  500 million of losses above an aggregate retention of  1 55 billion  The aggregate retention for 2020 increased from last year s  1 3 billion  largely reflecting recent years and anticipated growth in our property book  Hurricane and earthquake events  once again  have a  250 million per occurrence cap  Since we placed a lower percentage of the treaty than last year  the cost of the treaty will be proportionately lower in 2020  So incorporating our assumptions about cat and non cat weather for 2020  we would expect the full year impact on our underlying combined ratio to be slightly less than the roughly 0 5 point we experienced in 2019  and we would once again anticipate only a minimal impact on the total combined ratio  Turning to capital management  Operating cash flows for the quarter of  1 4 billion were again very strong  All our capital ratios were at or better than target levels  and we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately  1 4 billion  For the full year  operating cash flow exceeded  5 billion  our highest level since 2007  which was an unusually light cat year loss  Interest rates increased modestly during the fourth quarter  And accordingly  our net unrealized investment gain decreased from  2 4 billion after tax as of September 30 to  2 2 billion after tax at year end  Adjusted book value per share  which excludes unrealized investment gains and losses was  92 76 at year end  6  higher than at the beginning of the year  We returned  588 million of capital to our shareholders this quarter comprising share repurchases of  376 million and dividends of  212 million  For the year  we returned  2 4 billion of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases  Finally  on a financial modeling note  let me turn your attention to Slide 23 of the earnings presentation  As we enter 2020  we thought it would be helpful to point out the seasonality of our cat losses over the prior decade  As you can see  the second quarter has regularly and noticeably been our largest cat quarter  Cat losses in the second quarter have been about twice as much as any other quarter on average  and the second quarter has been our largest cat quarter in six of the past 10 years  And now  I ll turn the microphone over to Greg for discussion of business insurance Greg Toczydlowski    Executive Vice President and President  Business Insurance Thanks  Dan  For the fourth quarter  business insurance produced  448 million of segment income  a 15  increase over the fourth quarter of 2018  That brings the full year total for segment income to almost  1 4 billion  Earnings for both the quarter and the year benefited from strong profitability in workers  compensation  our largest product line  as well as higher overall business volumes and a lower expense ratio as we continue to execute on our strategy of growing the top line at attractive returns and improving our operating leverage  The underlying combined ratio for the quarter was 96 4   1 point higher than the fourth quarter of 2018  We ve included information on Slide 9 of the earnings presentation  the details of the components of the change  As you can see on the slide  there is about 0 33 point of net unfavorable impact from items that roll forward from prior quarters  There is also about 1 point of net unfavorable impact from items that are new in the fourth quarter  including about 0 5 point associated with additional changes in our general liability and commercial auto loss estimates  And along with that  the current quarter includes about 1 5 points related to the reestimation of the first three quarters of the year  For the full year  the underlying combined ratio of 96 2  was 0 5 point higher than the full year 2018  Slide 10 of the earnings presentation provides a detailed view of the various items impacting the year over year results  Before turning to the top line in production  I ll provide a little more context on the tort environment and our international loss activity  Regarding the tort environment  to get our best view of the escalating loss costs  we ve leveraged our leading data and analytics  And importantly  the tight feedback loop among our business leaders  underwriters  claims professionals and actuaries  We have a carefully underwritten book of business with largely a main street orientation  which we have targeted  grown and optimized for years  More than 90  of our domestic policies have limits of  2 million or less  excluding workers  compensation where limits don t apply  While we will continue to pursue claims strategies and underwriting actions to mitigate the impacts from the worsening tort environment  our primary action will be to seek more rate  During the quarter  we were once again successful in achieving meaningful improvement in renewal rate change  while maintaining very high levels of retention  which is evidence that we re not alone in driving rate  All of that is consistent with our view that what we re experiencing is environmental  As for international  we ve been experiencing elevated losses in the property lines  We re pursuing and achieving significant renewal rate increases to address these trends  as you can see within the international production statistics on Page 20 of the earnings presentation  In addition to that  we re executing a variety of profit improvement initiatives  including tightening terms and conditions  and paring back exposures in certain lines and accounts  While more work needs to be done  we re making good progress with all of these efforts  Turning to the top line  Net written premiums were up 5  in the quarter and 4  for the full year  driven by strong production results  While renewal premium change continues to be the largest contributor  we also grew our customer base for the year through strong retention and new business  We re pleased with the continued progress we re making on our strategic initiatives and remain encouraged by the feedback from our agent and broker partners  In terms of domestic production  we achieved strong renewal premium change of 7 8   with renewal rate change of 5 1   while retention remained high at 84   a reflection of the quality of our book  The renewal rate change of 5 1  was the highest result since the fourth quarter of 2013 and was up 0 7 point from the third quarter and more than 3 5 points from the fourth quarter of last year  This demonstrates our continued momentum  notwithstanding the downward pressure in workers  compensation pricing  We are achieving higher rate levels broadly across our book with about three fourths of our middle market accounts getting positive rate increases this quarter  which is up from about two thirds in the fourth quarter of last year  A further illustration of the broad nature of our progress is on Slide 14 of the earnings presentation  For our core commercial accounts business  the slide reflects the percentage of renewed accounts in three rate bands for the fourth quarters of 2017  2018 and 2019  As you can see from the graph  the percentage of accounts renewing flat or with the rate decrease has declined  while the percentage of accounts renewing with the rate increase is up with the level of rate increase skewed higher  In other words  a higher proportion of our accounts are getting a rate increase and a higher proportion of our accounts are getting a more significant rate increase  And this progress has been achieved while retention has remained at historically high levels  From a line of business perspective  outside of workers  compensation  we achieved higher rate increases in all lines as compared to both the third quarter of this year and the fourth quarter of last year  For the segment  new business of  488 million was strong and consistent with the prior year quarter  As for the individual businesses  in Select  renewal premium change of 7 2  and renewal rate change of 1 9  were both up from the third quarter and from the fourth quarter of last year  while retention remained strong at 83   New business of  105 million was consistent with the strong prior year quarter  We continue to advance our investments related to product development and ease of doing business and are encouraged with the progress and results to date  In middle market  renewal premium change was 7 1   with renewal rate change of 5   up more than 1 point from the third quarter and more than 3 5 points from the fourth quarter of last year  while retention remained high at 86   New business of  284 million was up slightly from the prior year quarter  bringing the full year total to just over  1 2 billion  reflecting higher new business pricing  as well as benefits from our ongoing strategic initiatives  To sum up  the fourth quarter wrapped up the year in which a lot of things went well  and we face some challenges  most notably  the continued pressure from the tort environment  We re confident that we have the insights and capabilities to a changing environment that will position us well in the market in 2020 and beyond  We couldn t be more pleased with our local execution  and we ll continue to see great and use all other available levers to meet our return objectives  Before I turn the call over to Tom to talk about bond and specialty results  I want to comment on our outlook for renewal premium change in underlying    underwriting results  since we will not be filing our 10 K for a few weeks  For business insurance  we expect RPC in 2020 will be higher than 2019  We expect the underlying combined ratio for the full year 2020 will be lower than in 2019  This assumes the anticipated impacts of earned pricing in excess of loss cost trends and improved results in our international business  Underneath that full year outlook  we expect the improvements in the underlying combined ratio to come in the second through fourth quarters of the year  as the first quarter of 2020 will include the roll forward impacts of the actions we took in the second  third and fourth quarters of 2019 for the general liability and commercial auto product lines  With that  I ll turn the call over to Tom Tom Kunkel    Executive Vice President and President  Bond and Specialty Insurance Thanks  Greg  Bond and specialty delivered another quarter of strong returns and growth  Segment income was  167 million  a decrease of  53 million from the prior year quarter  primarily due to a lower level of net favorable prior year reserve development  The combined and underlying combined ratios remained strong at 78 6  and 81 3   respectively  The underlying combined ratio increased 3 2 points from the prior year quarter  largely reflecting the impact of the roll forward of higher loss estimates for management liability coverages that we discussed with you last quarter  The underlying underwriting gain was slightly lower than the prior year quarter as the earned impact of higher business volumes largely offset the higher underlying combined ratio  Turning to top line  Net written premiums were up 9  for the quarter  reflecting growth across all our businesses  In our domestic management liability business  we are pleased that the retention remained at a very strong 89   with renewal premium change higher at 6 6   These production results are consistent with our strategy to maintain strong retention of our high quality portfolio while executing targeted pricing actions  We will continue to pursue price increases where warranted  Domestic management liability new business for the quarter increased 17  to  62 million and domestic surety and our international business both posted solid growth in the quarter  We remain pleased with our strong field execution and our strategic long term investments in market leading products and services  together with our commitment to thoughtful and disciplined underwriting and risk selection so bond and specialty results remain strong  and we feel terrific about our ability to continue to deliver top line growth with strong returns over time  In terms of our 2020 outlook  we expect RPC for our domestic management liability business will be higher and the underlying combined ratio will be slightly higher in each case as compared to 2019  Additionally  for 2020  we expect that the underlying underwriting margin will be broadly consistent with 2019  as the impact of higher business volumes will offset the slightly higher underwriting    underlying combined ratio  And now I ll turn it over to Michael to discuss personal insurance Michael Klein    Executive Vice President and President  Personal Insurance Thanks  Tom  and good morning  everyone  In personal insurance  we re very pleased with our fourth quarter and full year results  For the fourth quarter  segment income was  327 million  and our combined ratio was 88 5   For the full year  segment income was  824 million  an improvement of  527 million from the prior year  and the combined ratio was 94 2   The results for both periods reflect solid improvements from the prior year  driven by significantly lower catastrophes  Underwriting income also benefited from higher levels of earned premium  Net written premium growth for the fourth quarter and full year was 6  and 5   respectively  with continued strong retention  renewal premium change and new business  Agency automobile delivered solid results in the quarter  with a combined ratio of 99 2  in what is typically our highest combined ratio quarter for the line  The 3 9 point increase relative to the prior period is largely reflective of the unusually low level of losses in the fourth quarter of 2018  The full year combined ratio was an outstanding 94   which was comparable to the prior year  The underlying combined ratio of 94 6  improved 0 7 points  benefiting from earned pricing that exceeded loss trends in the first half of the year  as well as favorable frequency throughout 2019  In agency homeowners and other  the fourth quarter combined ratio of 75 8  improved by 34 points in comparison to the prior year quarter  which was significantly impacted by catastrophes  specifically the California wildfires and Hurricane Michael  On an underlying basis  the combined ratio was 73 6  or 1 1 points higher than the prior year quarter  driven by higher non weather loss activity  The full year 2019 combined ratio was an excellent 92 5   as lower catastrophe losses drove a 13 1 point improvement from the prior year  The underlying combined ratio was up 4 points to 85 6  for the year  due primarily to higher noncatastrophe weather related losses and the impact of the new catastrophe reinsurance treaty  As we ve discussed with you previously  we continue to take pricing and underwriting actions to address higher levels of underlying loss activity  Shifting to quarterly production  Agency automobile net written premiums grew 2  with modest growth in new business and policies in force  while retention remained strong at 84  and renewal premium change was 2 9   We continue to make progress in our efforts to grow this profitable line  Agency homeowners and other delivered another strong quarter with net written premium growth of 13   driven by higher new business levels  retention at 86   and renewal premium change rising to 7 4   double the level from the prior year quarter  We remain pleased with the rollout of our Quantum Home 2 0 product  which is now available in 34 states and the district of Columbia  Quantum Home 2 0 s granular pricing segmentation  customizable coverages and ease of quoting combined to form a solution that is both sophisticated and simple and our increased quote volume and higher average premiums suggested hitting the mark with both agents and customers  Turning to our outlook  We expect that for 2020 compared to 2019  agency homeowners and other renewal premium changes will be higher  while agency automobile renewal premium changes will remain positive  but be lower  The underlying combined ratios for both agency homeowners and other  and for the personal and segment    personal insurance segment as a whole will be lower  This improvement is expected in the second through fourth quarters of the year  assuming lower levels of noncatastrophe weather related losses  For agency automobile  the outlook is for the underlying combined ratio to be broadly consistent  All in  it was a very good year for personal insurance  with a second consecutive year of strong profitability in auto and strong and significantly improved homeowners  profitability  In addition  we achieved record levels of domestic net written premium  new business and policies in force  We have strong momentum going into 2020 and are well positioned to deliver profitable growth while investing in capabilities that will continue to enhance the value of our franchise  With that  I ll turn the call back over to Abbe Abbe Goldstein    Senior Vice President of Investor Relations Thanks  Michael  and we re ready to take your questions now  Questions   Answers  Operator Operator instructions  Your first question is from Michael Phillips with Morgan Stanley Michael Phillips    Morgan Stanley    Analyst My first question  I m thinking about Slide 9  and specifically the bottom of Slide 9  I know you guys talk about kind of longer term trends of 4  to 4 5   that gives a 4 5  last time  I know you focused on long term trends  But you ve moved that up a bit in the last couple of quarters more on kind of the catch up  which you again referred to here on Slide 9  So I m wondering if you still think that 4 5  is something you re comfortable with  Or how you think about that going forward now Dan Frey    Chief Financial Officer Michael  it s Dan Frey  So I ll draw the distinction between sort of the long term trend assumption and what s going to roll through any particular quarter or any year  So in that slide  we re reconciling for you  the difference between last year s combined ratio and this year s combined ratio  And clearly  for the year as a whole  when we look at the change in the loss environment overall  it was more than 4 5   We did  remember  raise our view of the long term trend  I think we talked about that back in the second quarter  But we haven t changed it since then  So these are more reactions to data that we re seeing in the current environment  raising the level of losses  but not the trajectory from this point forward Michael Phillips    Morgan Stanley    Analyst OK  I mean  I guess  obviously  what I m getting to is a tug of war between pricing and loss trends and kind of who wins in tug of war right now  And obviously  this quarter  the tug of war went to loss trends because margins were down  but a lot of your commentary talks about the outlook being better for the underlying  certainly  I think  you said starting in the second quarter  So you re still thinking that pricing    earned pricing will get better than loss trends as we get into the back half of this year  it sounds like  is that what you re saying Dan Frey    Chief Financial Officer Yes  that s full year  So remember  the outlook is really a 12 month broad view of what we think the environment is going to be as opposed to a quarter by quarter reconciliation  The comment Greg made is that when we compare Q1  in particular  of  20 to Q1 of  19  the strengthening that we ve done for 2019 came in Q2  Q3 and Q4 primarily  So that comparison in and of itself is going to be a little different than the year more broadly Alan Schnitzer    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Michael  it s Alan  I would also just encourage you to make sure you re looking at Slide 10  too  because there s a lot of moving pieces in Slide 9 that when you look at it on a full year basis  it s just    it s a little bit of an easier view to take in Michael Phillips    Morgan Stanley    Analyst OK  No  thank you  A second question  I guess  I appreciate the color you guys gave on the business insurance PYD  the  140 million you talked about for comp and that was helpful  I guess on the CMP piece  I assume the adverse there was on the liability side of CMP  I guess  wanted to confirm that  And then if so  I guess  what s driving that  Are you seeing kind of    is that more of kind of a tort environment leaking down from GL into the smaller accounts of CMP liability  Or kind of what s driving that piece Dan Frey    Chief Financial Officer Yes  Michael  it s Dan again  So I d say broadly  yes  And I d remind you  if you go back and look at the results we ve disclosed throughout the year  even going back to Q1 of this year  we did talk about CMP as being an unfavorable contributor to prior year reserve development and BI  even going back to Q1  And clearly  as you re alluding to  CMP has got both a property and a liability component  It is the liability component  But as we ve made comments over the second  third and now fourth quarters of this year  when we talk about the liability environment in business insurance  that for us is meant to include the liability component of CMP as opposed to this being something new and different Michael Phillips    Morgan Stanley    Analyst OK  Awesome  Thank you very much OperatorYour next question is from Larry Greenberg with Janney Montgomery Larry Greenberg    Janney  Montgomery  Scott    Analyst Good morning  and thank you  I guess  I m just asking a qualitative question  Where you sit today or feel today versus where things stood coming out of the third quarter  Obviously  you re pushing    this is all about business insurance  Obviously  you re pushing price and to some extent  you re shooting at a moving target with loss trend and all the issues surrounding that  Is there    you ve got    you ve now got another quarter  just looking back to from the third  is there any way to say that you re more comfortable with where you sit today and what you re seeing and how the relationship with pricing and loss trend is moving  Just looking for some qualitative thoughts on that Alan Schnitzer    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes  Larry  it s Alan  Let me take a stab at that  So first  I would say  we are definitely pleased with the trajectory of rate versus loss trend  that continues to be a good story  And importantly  you got to look at retention in that regard  That s hanging in there  which suggests we think this is an environmental thing  and we would say that the pricing actions have room to go here  In terms of our overall sense of the balance sheet  we are closer to the end of this than we were a year ago  that s for sure  And what we re very confident in is  we re confident in the talent we ve got looking at this  we re confident in our processes  we re confident in our data and analytics  and we re confident that we understand the environment out there  So very confident in our best estimate  Can we tell you this is the end of it  Of course  not  We couldn t and nobody could  But that    I don t need to imply any lack of confidence in  again  the data analytics people process here  This is an environmental issue  and we think we re on top of it Larry Greenberg    Janney  Montgomery  Scott    Analyst And then just as a follow up  you talked about the other levers that you might have in addition to pricing  are you willing to share any of those other levers to go at this environmental issue Alan Schnitzer    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Well  certainly  because it is environmental  just the playbooks as you go to rate  That s just the way you solve those issues  Now anytime you have a circumstance like this  and frankly  any time  in any book of business  we re always looking to optimize  We re always pulling books of business apart and understanding where there are opportunities to improve  And that s true in our best performing businesses and our worst performing businesses  So you go through that process  and there are always things that we can do better and we will do those things  Look  when we look at this environment  in particular  relative to our overall book of business  there are  around the edges  accounts or segments of the business that we think in the current environment don t make sense  and we ll either get the right rate or we ll get off them  And then probably to the question you re really asking is what we re doing from a claim perspective  And clearly  the plaintiffs  bar is getting more sophisticated  more clever  more aggressive  And I guess  in response to that  I would say  so are we  I m not anxious to detail our tactics or strategies  I think that would probably be unwise for us to do that  But we ve got a very large and very sophisticated claim operation  lawyers litigation strategy  And so we will employ all those levers as well Larry Greenberg    Janney  Montgomery  Scott    Analyst Thank you OperatorThank you  Your next question is from Jimmy Bhullar with JP Morgan Jimmy Bhullar    J P  Morgan    Analyst Hi  Good morning  I had a couple of questions  First  just on the tort environment overall  you ve been more vocal than most other companies  Just trying to understand  is the environment stabilizing or has it gotten worse as you went through 2019  And    then the other question I just had is on your expense ratio  which was very good for the year and for the quarter  to what extent is it sustainable versus sort of being an aberration Alan Schnitzer    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes  Thanks for the question  I ll start with the tort environment  then I ll ask Dan to talk about the expense ratio  Clearly  I think  if you look at our results throughout the year  we would say  I don t know if the environment has gotten worse  but clearly  the losses have come in worse than our expectations  And one thing you got to remember is we are setting reserves for years in very long tail lines of business where there is a very high percentage of IBNR  So the paid in case is a relatively small percentage of this  And so we re squaring triangles  We re looking at the data as it comes in every quarter  comparing it to our expectations  and that s what has gotten worse  And I will say  quarter in  quarter out  we have not responded gingerly  We have responded assertively to this and yet it s continued to come in a little bit worse than our expectations  But as I said before  we are five quarters closer to the end of this than we were a year ago  And again  we think we understand the market dynamics  We think we understand what s causing this  and we feel very good about our analytics and our process  Dan  do you want to talk about the expense ratio Dan Frey    Chief Financial Officer Sure  So I ll focus you on the full year because there s going to be a little bit of variability from quarter to quarter  So at 29 6  for the full year  that s a range we re comfortable with now  Certainly  noticeably better than it was several years ago and steady progress over the last three years  I think everything comes back to the way we talk about the business consistently  which is we re trying to optimize returns over time  There s not really a specific targeted expense ratio  although in the current environment  the level that we re at now is a level that plus or minus we re pretty comfortable with in this environment  We ve been able to get productivity and efficiency gains  And at the same time  we ve been able to make the investments in the business that we think to make    we needed to make for our success going forward  And we ll always balance those things  The fact that it s come out at 29 6  for the year feels good  And this is a level that we re pretty comfortable with in this environment Jimmy Bhullar    J P  Morgan    Analyst OK  And if I could ask one more  Just on personal auto  I think  you mentioned  you expect margins to be stable in 2020  But if we look over the past couple of years  the pace of price hikes has actually steadily slowed and it seems like for the industry  that s worse than this loss cost inflation  So what gives you the confidence that margins in personal auto won t get worse in 2020 Michael Klein    Executive Vice President and President  Personal Insurance Sure  Jimmy  This is Michael Klein  I would say a couple of things  One  most of the rhetoric in the industry about loss trend deterioration focuses on severity  which is a piece of the puzzle  and we certainly are observing some of the same dynamics in terms of collision and physical damage severity that you re seeing folks talk about as well as bodily injury severity  On the good news front has been frequency  And as I mentioned  we continued to see favorable frequency  better than our expectations sort of throughout 2019  And we put those frequency and severity results together with a longer term view of loss trend  and view loss trend as actually in aggregate relatively consistent going into 2020  And then the lower renewal premium change outlook is  again  on the margin  And again  lower  but continued positive  And so that s where we land on broadly consistent  And again  I think much like Greg s commentary in personal insurance  rate versus loss trend is one dynamic that drives you to your outlook for a combined ratio  but the other levers that you use to manage the business  including underwriting terms  conditions  claim process  claim efficiencies come into that view of the outlook as well  So it s not just a linear roll forward of rate versus loss trend getting it to that answer Jimmy Bhullar    J P  Morgan    Analyst OK  Thank you OperatorYour next question is from Mike Zaremski with Credit Suisse Mike Zaremski    Credit Suisse    Analyst Good morning  Sticking with the tort environment first  Is it more pronounced  any geographies or maybe by employer size and probably  the number one question I get is  could this    could we still be in the early innings of this upwards trend  I don t know if there s a way to frame historically how high year over year tort inflation has gotten in the past Alan Schnitzer    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes  Thanks for the question  Mike  So you could look at any one quarter and there may be a pocket of heat in terms of geography or business or line  but I think the right way to answer that question is to take a step back and look at the last year  And when we take a step back and look at the last year  we would say it s been broadly across our casualty coverages  geographically  line of business  and so on and so forth  I would point out that a    the vast majority of the business we write has 500 or fewer employees  And as Greg mentioned  more than 90  of our policies have a limit of  2 million or less  So I would say this is a relatively broad based phenomenon is the way to think about it  Now you asked about relative to history  I m    we ve had other liability environment  I ll say  over the last decade or two  but    and there are some people out there that try to compare them  I don t know that you really can compare them  Just the facts and circumstances are different  You ve got    companies have different books of business  We ve got    all of us have different data and analytics available to us  But I think most importantly  if you look at prior liability environments  I ll call them  those have largely been driven by medical inflation  This one is driven by social inflation  And I m not aware in recent history of another environment where distributed social inflation has been the driver Mike Zaremski    Credit Suisse    Analyst OK  got it  That s helpful  And my last question is regarding Slide 23 of the deck on the historical catastrophe losses  Would you say that over the last decade or so  hurricane losses in the U S  have been less than expected  I m basically trying to get at  should the 3Q and maybe 4Q cat load look a little differently  were we thinking about this on a forward basis Dan Frey    Chief Financial Officer Mike  it s Dan  I m not quite sure how to answer that question  What you re seeing here is our numbers  And for sure  the point I think we re trying to make here is our experience  and this includes as a result of underwriting actions taken over the previous 10 to 15 years to really sort of move the mix of our book so that it s less coastal than it was a decade or more than that to go  So there s been a lot of industry commentary around hurricane  I don t know that anybody feels that there s any less exposure to hurricanes broadly now than there was two years ago  five years ago or 10 years ago  I think as a percentage of where our risks are  we ve probably  on a relative basis  mitigated our hurricane risk compared to the other risks and I think that s really the point we re trying to make in this slide is that second quarter for us has been the issue  which is not aligned with the traditional hurricane  Not because  I think  on a macro basis  the hurricane environment is more benign  I don t really have an opinion on that  We re just telling you  in our book  based on where we write and the exposures we have  this is what our result looks like over the past 10 years Mike Zaremski    Credit Suisse    Analyst OK  Yes  I guess  I ll follow up because it still feels like on a forward basis that since we re not going to where there have been    there s been less hurricane activity  I think the street definitely has 3Q being a little more pronounced  and it sounds like you re saying maybe we should weight it a little differently  but I ll follow up Alan Schnitzer    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Mike  I ll just add  that s definitely why we provided the slide  We look at models and we scratch our heads a little bit  And obviously  we don t know what 2020 is going to look like or 2021 or any other year  right  We have no idea where the volatility could come from  But certainly  when we think about how    what our assumptions are and what our plans are  our starting point is the last 10 years  and we think it s relevant for thinking about this year and future years OperatorYour next question is from Meyer Shields with KBW Meyer Shields    KBW    Analyst Great  Thanks  Good morning  I think this is a question for Greg  Within the BI segment  middle market  the delta between renewal premium and renewal rate change was the smallest it s been in some time  Is there something going on with exposure units there that is worth noting  Or is that just a quarterly fluctuation Greg Toczydlowski    Executive Vice President and President  Business Insurance Meyer  this is Greg  Yes  that s just quarterly fluctuation  You can see the exposure is down a little bit over the last two quarters  and we do a lot of unpacking on that  try to understand is that individual accounts or broad economic activity  and we think it s more of the latter  If you compare the economic activity in the back half of this year to 2018  it s linear with what we re seeing on the exposure change Meyer Shields    KBW    Analyst OK  fantastic  And then for Michael  really quickly  you talked about the combined ratio  I want to say  for personal lines  improving  assuming or reflecting a return to normalized noncat weather  Is that just a regression to the mean  Or is that a reflection of claims actions or underwriting changes Michael Klein    Executive Vice President and President  Personal Insurance Sure  Meyer  I appreciate the question  I would say two things  One  we do say that it reflects lower and more normalized expectation for a noncat weather that doesn t mean a reversion to the mean  It means a lower expectation than we saw in 2018  And as we ve been talking about  2018 was    I m sorry  2019    what we ve been talking about is noncat weather has been elevated in 2019  We have an expectation in 2020  that s lower than the 2019 level  But importantly  continues to reflect updated estimates and an updated view of noncat weather loss activity  which has been rising  So I wouldn t want you to assume that the assumption in that outlook is the same assumption we had two or three or four years ago  It  in fact  includes more loss content than it would have two or three or four years ago  And so we see margins in this segment and margins in agency homeowners and other  improving despite the fact that we have a higher view of the noncat weather loss content in that outlook than we would have had a year ago or two years ago Meyer Shields    KBW    Analyst OK  That s very helpful OperatorNext question is from Brian Meredith with UBS Brian Meredith    UBS    Analyst Yes  a couple of questions here for you  First one  curious  any update with respect to kind of reviver statutes  given we ve seen some other states expand or open the statute limitations Dan Frey    Chief Financial Officer Brian  it s Dan  Yes  so in the quarter  again  a modest amount of reserve activity in our PYD number related to revivers  not big enough to have been called out  but we saw California enact reviver this quarter  I think North Carolina as well  California is one that gets a lot of attention  It s a bit    obviously a big state and a very active legal environment  But remember  in case you don t remember  California had once before  open to reviver  And so that goes into our consideration there  So there has been activity pretty steadily throughout the year  First quarter was the most notable for us  and we talked about it then  But there s been modest activity following that  And that did occur again in the fourth quarter Meyer Shields    KBW    Analyst Great  And then second question  just quickly on workers  comp  I mean  you ve noted and others have noted  the really favorable loss cost environment there that is obviously offsetting some of the rate reductions that we re seeing  Would you expect that to continue going into 2020  Is that kind of your expectations given the low unemployment environment  I guess  although we ve seen a pickup in medical cost inflation Alan Schnitzer    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Is your question whether we expect PYD to continue in workers  comp Meyer Shields    KBW    Analyst No  no  no  Just the loss trend environment with respect to workers  compensation  not so much the PYD  but just the very favorable trends we re seeing kind of frequency trends in comp  as well as severity  which is  I guess  kind of average Alan Schnitzer    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer The trends have been favorable  we generally assume a reversion to a longer term mean there  So we don t assume that all the favorability will continue  I mean there has been a very long term improvement in overall workers  comp frequency  So we certainly take that into account  but the results have been even better than that  and we don t necessarily assume that s going to continue  Medical inflation  the severity side has been pretty benign as well  And similarly  we tend to think that these things revert Meyer Shields    KBW    Analyst Great  Thank you OperatorThe next question is from Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research Ryan Tunis    Autonomous Research    Analyst Thanks  Good morning  I guess  this one is just for Alan  and going back to the commentary on thinking we re closer to the end than the beginning  So we ve had a few charges in the past few quarters  This one is bigger than what we saw 3Q  Just trying to get  maybe  some sense of when you took this charge or these tweaks that you made  how does that give you more comfort  Is there more IBNR in these than there have been in the past  Like  where are we at now relative to the third quarter that gives you confidence in saying that Alan Schnitzer    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Well  it s another quarter  It s another data point  It s    every time you get a little bit more data  you get a little bit better view on where the environment is  And so from that perspective  we feel better  I can t look at it and tell you where the first  second and third quarters of next year are coming in  So from that perspective  there continues to be some uncertainty  but we re another quarter into it  And frankly  we re five quarters into it  And so the view we ve developed over five quarters  our view of the environment  Every quarter  we dig into our book a little bit more and test our hypotheses and all that gives us a little bit more confidence  I don t    I m not    I can t comment about what s going to happen in the first quarter  We just don t know yet  right Ryan Tunis    Autonomous Research    Analyst So when you think about your    I guess  your outlook for 2020 in terms of hopefully improving business insurance margins  do you still think it s    if you were to achieve that  do you still think that would be a result of the tort environment  Or do you think you would have more to do with pricing or execution or something on other fronts Alan Schnitzer    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer I mean  obviously  any of those things could be a contributor  Certainly  social inflation continues to be a risk factor and some uncertainty for us  But any of those things could be a contributor  We feel  as I said  we ve got confidence in our processes  We    our objective is always to get this number right  We price and reserve based on one view of loss costs  And so  it s important to us to try to get it right  And so we think we ve done that Ryan Tunis    Autonomous Research    Analyst Thank you OperatorYour next question is from Paul Newsome with Piper Sandler Paul Newsome    Piper Sandler    Analyst Good morning  Thanks for the call  I want to ask about commission rate  We ve seen at least anecdotal data that there s some pretty high commissions being paid for workers  comp  Allstate is changing  it s personal lines    it s private passenger auto and personal lines commissions  Is Travelers doing anything broadly to    as others are changing commission rates Alan Schnitzer    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes  I would say  broadly  our commission rates are reasonably stable  So no Paul Newsome    Piper Sandler    Analyst And then on the  indiscernible   do you have the ability or is it really feasible to lower limits  And would that  in your view  really  on an industrywide basis  be one of the possible fixes for this outside of rate because that    there s more issues on the higher the limit  the more the legal involvement Alan Schnitzer    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes  I mean  let me just go back and highlight a comment Greg made in his prepared remarks  and I just referenced  90  or so of our policies in liability lines  ex workers  comp  have policy limits of  2 million or less  So I don t think it s    there s been a lot of industry observers that have commented on this relationship between the loss environment and limits profile  We just don t think that s true  There s plenty of activity on the smaller accounts  We haven t and we haven t seen the industry necessarily move to changing the limits profile  We think our customers are out there  and they need a certain level of protection to manage their businesses  and we intend to help them manage their risk in their businesses  We just got to charge the right price for it  And so solving this through broadly changing limits profiles is probably not the answer Paul Newsome    Piper Sandler    Analyst Appreciate the help  Thank you very much OperatorYour next question is from Amit Kumar with Buckingham Research Amit Kumar    Buckingham Research    Analyst Thanks  and good morning  Two follow up questions  The first question goes back to Brian s question on CVA  Does your business insurance outlook contemplate any potential action from CVA down the road because by the time we get to the back half of 2020  some of those reviver windows will start closing Dan Frey    Chief Financial Officer So Amit  it s Dan  We re aware of the revivers that have been enacted and are open and the periods through which they ll close  What we ve tried to do in 2019 is book our best estimate of the ultimate loss costs related to that activity  regardless of the period of time for which the reviver is open  Obviously  when the windows close  we ll have a more crystallized view of the volume and types of claims that have actually come in  To this point  we haven t seen anything in the activity that s coming that makes us change our view of the reserves related to CVA  Regarding the 2020 outlook  in general  our view  one  our commentary relates to underlying combined ratio  But I d make the comment that generally speaking  and we ve said this consistently  we don t anticipate prior year reserve development either favorable or unfavorable on a go forward basis  We think all the information we have regarding the claim environment as it exists today is reflected in our reserves today Amit Kumar    Buckingham Research    Analyst Got it  But    the only other question I have is  and I want to go back to the initial question on the CMP  the CMP product is toward the small to mid sized accounts  The GL product is toward the larger customer account  I m curious  just going back to the broader discussion on tort environment  would it be fair to say that the adjustments have sort of started from the national accounts  permeated to middle market and then moved on to Select  Or how should we think about that Alan Schnitzer    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer No  definitely not  It started in commercial auto  and I m looking around the room here  right  I think 99  of our commercial auto policies have policy limits of  2 million or less  I think Dan Frey    Chief Financial Officer It s  1 million  actually Alan Schnitzer    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer So     1 million  So this isn t something that started large and moved down  This is something that s started on the small end and spread on the small end Amit Kumar    Buckingham Research    Analyst Got it  OK  I was just trying to understand the directionality of the tort climate because we ve consistently heard that the attorney involvement has continued to move down and down and down into the smallest claims versus the larger claims  That s where I was heading with that question Alan Schnitzer    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes  And again  that s why we gave you our limits profile and talked about the fact that the vast majority of our commercial lines policies have customers of    employees of 500 or fewer  I mean it s a    we are a main street writer  We ve got a middle market and small commercial business  and we are feeling the heat in those policies that have limits of  2 million or less  Now  we did observe a year ago that  to a large degree  they started in commercial auto and that made perfect sense to us because there was a lot of homogeneity to those claims  Those are very easy claims for the times hard to bring  but it did spread to GL  And again  largely on    not on the national accounts  large in limit size  Those larger accounts with big limits  those have always had aggressive attorneys on them  What we re seeing now is the attorney participation spreading into    across these small accounts Amit Kumar    Buckingham Research    Analyst That s very helpful  stuff  Thanks for the answers  and good luck with the future OperatorYour final question comes from David Motemaden with Evercore ISI David Motemaden    Evercore ISI    Analyst Hi  Good morning  Just a question for Alan on the tort environment and the losses in BI  I guess  I m just trying to get a sense for how far above expectations did the loss experience come in this quarter compared to last quarter  Was it a smaller amount of deviation versus expectations compared to last quarter  Has that narrowed over the past five quarters  Just trying to get a sense for how    where we are in terms of seeing more charges here going forward Alan Schnitzer    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer I think    I m taking a step back and trying to think about the year  which I think is sort of the right way to think about it  Probably  the right way to think about it is Slide 10 on a full year basis  I don t really know that the quarter by quarter view really gives you any insight  but maybe the answer to your question is somewhat consistent  Dan  what would you say Dan Frey    Chief Financial Officer Yes  I think that in broad magnitude  we saw bad news in the second quarter  We saw bad news in the third quarter  We saw bad news in the fourth quarter  They weren t noticeably different in terms of the way they felt in terms of magnitude  And if you step back and looked at the full year overall related to the tort environment or social inflation  things being worse than they had been  We d say in the underlying combined ratio on a full year basis compared to a year ago  it s probably about a full point higher than it was  And when you think about the fact that there has also been an impact in PYD  we think about that same thing over the full year basis  It s hard to attribute exactly what drove loss changes  But to the best that we can characterize it and you should not take this to be  there s a very specific science  But based on the data and analytics we have  we d attribute it s probably to the place worth about 2 points of bad news within this year s full year prior year reserve development David Motemaden    Evercore ISI    Analyst Got it  OK  And Alan  you had mentioned just higher attorney involvement just on the smaller cases or smaller case sizes  I guess I m just wondering    I guess  just how much has that increased  Like  are you seeing it now on like 30  versus 20   Just trying to get a sense for where that is  And are you assuming that that continues to increase in your loss picks Alan Schnitzer    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes  So I don t    I m not sure we re going to share the absolute number  but I will share with you that the percentage of claims on which we re seeing lawyers has increased by about 10 points over seven years    over six years  with about half of that increase coming in 2019 and 2018  So that sort of gives you a sense of the quantum of the increase over recent years and how much of that has come really in just  19 and  18  half of the increase  One of the reasons why we think it s been such a recent and significant shift Abbe Goldstein    Senior Vice President of Investor Relations Commercial auto comment Alan Schnitzer    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer And just to    yes

131913,353428,TRV,Travel restrictions could cost U S   10 3 billion in Chinese visitor spending,news,"By Heather Timmons
WASHINGTON  Reuters    Travel restrictions related to the novel coronavirus from China could impact city and state economies across the United States  which have benefited from a huge jump in tourism from China in recent years  analysts say 
Riverside  California  known for its citrus groves  mountain scenery and art galleries  and Buffalo  New York  the closest big town to the vast Niagara Falls  would be among the hardest hit in a list of places from big cities to tourist towns particularly popular with Chinese visitors 
Major U S  airlines have suspended flights from China  and the Trump administration is barring foreign visitors who have been to mainland China over the past 14 days

131947,353462,TRV,Disease that killed millions of China s pigs poses global threat,news,"By Tom Polansek CHICAGO  Reuters    Bettie the beagle  a detector dog for U S  Customs and Border Protection  picked up the scent of pork on a woman arriving from China at Chicago s O Hare International Airport   Soon the dog s handler discovered and confiscated a ham sandwich in the purse of a passenger who had flown on a China Eastern Airlines flight from Shanghai  The danger  That the food might be contaminated with African swine fever and spread the disease to the United States  China has lost millions of pigs in outbreaks of the disease  pushing its pork prices to record highs  forcing purchases of costly imports and roiling global meat markets   It s very likely it may come here if we aren t more vigilant   said Jessica Anderson  the handler for the pork sniffing dog and an agricultural specialist for the border protection agency  Bettie is among an expanded team of specially trained beagles at U S  airports  part of a larger effort to protect the nation s  23 billion pork industry from a disease that has decimated China s hog herd  the world s largest  Governments worldwide are scrambling to shore up their defenses as the disease spills over China s borders  according to Reuters reporting from nine countries  The efforts underscore the grave threat to global agriculture  African swine fever has spread to Southeast Asia and eastern Europe  with cases found in Vietnam  Cambodia  Laos  Korea  Myanmar  the Philippines  Poland  Belgium and Bulgaria  Around the globe  those countries and others that have so far sidestepped the epidemic are cracking down on travelers  increasing cargo screenings and banning meat imports  GRAPHIC  China s pig industry crisis    Pork producing countries stand to lose billions of dollars if the disease infects their industries because outbreaks devastate farms and shut export markets  African swine fever does not threaten humans but there s no vaccine or cure for infected pigs  If the disease enters the United States  the top pork exporting nation with 77 3 million hogs  the government would struggle to protect the industry  participants in a four day drill in September told Reuters   If this gets in  it will destroy our industry as we know it   said Dave Pyburn  the National Pork Board s senior vice president of science and technology  The U S  Department of Agriculture  USDA  simulated an outbreak in Mississippi that spread to the nation s top pig producing states  including North Carolina  Iowa and Minnesota  Veterinarians  farmers and government officials gathered at command centers where they tested their capacity to swiftly detect  control and clean up after an outbreak   The experience showed the U S  needs to increase its capacity to quickly test pigs for the disease and to dispose of the animals without spreading it  said Pyburn  who participated in the drill  In China  the top global pork consumer  the disease has been devastating  The exact number of hog deaths is not known  Rabobank estimated the country lost up to 55  of its pig herd last year  But the Chinese government has reported smaller losses in the country s  1 trillion hog sector since the first case in August 2018  GLOBAL RESPONSE  The U S  government is fielding dogs at airports and seaports  conducting outbreak response drills and adding capacity to test pigs  France and Germany are killing hundreds of thousands of wild boar that might carry the disease  France also erected 132 kilometers  82 miles  of fencing to keep out wild boar and is planning stricter sanitary rules for pig farming  including requirements to disinfect trucks that transport swine  Thailand culled pigs in a province close to Myanmar  where the disease has been found  South Korea ordered soldiers on its border with North Korea to capture wild boar  while Vietnam used troops to ensure infected pigs were culled  Australia expelled travelers from Vietnam for smuggling pork and banned imports of pork products  Australia also deployed advisors to Pacific islands in an attempt to protect its closest neighbors from African swine fever  If such efforts fail  it could cost the country more than 2 billion Australian dollars   1 4 billion  over five years  according to Australian Pork Limited  an industry group   It is certainly the biggest threat to commercial raising that we have ever seen  and arguably the biggest threat to any commercial livestock species we ve seen   said Mark Schipp  Australia s chief veterinary officer  U S  officials plan to suspend domestic shipments of pigs among farms and to slaughterhouses if African swine fever is detected  The USDA and states could issue orders halting the movement of livestock in certain areas as a way to contain the disease  The USDA said in a statement to Reuters that the September drill highlighted shortcomings in its guidance to states detailing when and how to limit the movement of pigs  The government is also increasing the number of laboratories it uses to test for African swine fever   We have identified some gaps   said Amanda Luitjens  who took part in the drill and is animal welfare auditor for Minnesota based pork producer Christensen Farms   The thought of it making it to the United States is scary   BANS ON GARBAGE FEEDING Travelers  NYSE TRV  transporting meat represent the biggest risk for African swine fever to spread to the United States because the disease can live for weeks in pork products  Pyburn said  Contaminated food can be fed to feral pigs or livestock in a practice known as garbage feeding  which the USDA says has caused outbreaks of swine diseases around the world  U S  farmers are supposed to obtain a license to feed pigs with food waste that contains meat and cook it to kill disease organisms  African swine fever can also spread from pig to pig  from bites by infectious ticks and through objects such as trucks  clothing and shoes that have come into contact with the virus  China banned the transportation of live pigs from infected provinces and neighboring regions in an unsuccessful bid to contain its outbreaks  It also culled pigs and outlawed the use of kitchen waste for swine feed      The disease has been detected in food products seized at airports in South Korea  Japan  Australia  the Philippines and northern Ireland  African swine fever is thought to have arrived in the Philippines through contaminated pork smuggled from China  The Philippines is now conducting mandatory checks on carry on luggage of passengers from countries with outbreaks  The government of the province of Cebu in central Philippines banned imported products and those from the main Philippine island of Luzon to avoid swine fever  More than 60 000 pigs have died or been culled in Luzon because of the disease  The Philippines Department of Agriculture also banned garbage feeding that included leftover food from airports  airlines and seaports  In the United States  low inspection rates at ports of entry increase the likelihood for illegal pork to enter the country undetected  the USDA said in a report assessing the risk from African swine fever  The agency works with Customs and Border Protection to alert all U S  ports each time a new country is confirmed to have the disease  requesting increased scrutiny on travelers and shipments  But Customs and Border Protection estimates it needs 3 148 people to specialize in agricultural inspections at entry points like airports and only has about 2 500   The U S  Senate last year authorized the annual hiring of 240 agricultural specialists a year until the workforce shortage is filled  and the training and assignment of 20 new canine teams a year  The government approved 60 new beagle teams to work at airports and seaports last year  for a total of 179 teams  according to USDA  Those teams face a daunting challenge  said Senator Gary Peters  a Michigan Democrat who introduced the legislation with other lawmakers

131977,353492,TRV, Absolutely gutted   demise of Thomas Cook wrecks travelers  plans,news,"By Alistair Smout
CORFU  Greece  Reuters    Holidaymakers hit by the collapse of Thomas Cook  L TCG   the world s oldest tourist firm  desperately scrambled for information on Monday on how to get home  as Britain mounted its largest repatriation effort since World War Two 
From job losses to canceled honeymoons  the demise of the package tour pioneer has brought a heavy human cost and left an estimated 600 000 people stranded worldwide 
Travelers  NYSE TRV  scoured mobile phones or quizzed officials for travel updates as they waited in long queues beneath flight boards showing flights delayed or canceled 
 From Thomas Cook we didn t get anything  I feel sorry for the reps because I don t think they knew anything either  It was the hotel which kept us up to date   said Ricky Houston  who said his flight to the northern English city of Newcastle from the Greek island of Corfu had been delayed by nine hours 
 Everyone in the hotel here is shocked  and everyone in this hotel has come with Thomas Cook     But  for us  it s an inconvenience  for them  the reps  it s their livelihoods   added Houston  who is from Dunfermline in Scotland 
David Midson  from Kent in southeast England  was trying to find information at the front desk of his hotel in Roda  Corfu 
 There s a sign saying that Thomas Cook customers should get in touch with their agency  but you don t get through to anybody because it doesn t exist   he said 
 I wish I had brought a driving license  because I can t get a taxi  to the airport   
The British government has pledged to get an estimated 150 000 stranded British holidaymakers home in the biggest such repatriation operation since World War Two  but that is no consolation for many others whose holiday plans lie in ruins 
 We re absolutely gutted  we ve looked forward to this for a long time  had the wedding in July so it s been another couple of months waiting for this   said Simon  who had been due to go on honeymoon with his wife Polly from London s Gatwick Airport 
He said he felt very sorry for the staff at his local Thomas Cook travel agency who he said had been helpful 
 Must be awful for them as well  coming up to Christmas as well    I wish the government had maybe stepped in    It could have been done I think  but there s nothing we can do now  Just have to go home and make the most of it  
 NIGHTMARE  NIGHTMARE 
Steve Tarrant  who had planned to fly to the Mexican resort of Cancun from Manchester  said he had given up trying to get information about rescheduled flights 
 So we just took it upon ourselves to book another flight   he said  at an extra cost of 1 200 pounds   1 490  
In Palma airport on the Spanish island of Mallorca  the mood was similarly grim 
 Nightmare  nightmare  stressed   said British holidaymaker Nick  who had two young children   an 18 month old and 12 year old   in tow 
 Not what we wanted really before going home  But what can you do  Other people have lost their jobs  so we re not as bad  off  as some other people  
Scottish tourists hoping to fly back to Glasgow from Mallorca said they now expected to head to the central English city of Birmingham  400 km  250 miles  away  and then perhaps to be ferried home by coach 
 I m very anxious because I have sore legs so I don t know how    I m going to get to Glasgow if they take us to Birmingham or somewhere else  So it s going to be very difficult and a long day and I m very tired   said one woman in a wheelchair ",2019-09-23,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/absolutely-gutted-demise-of-thomas-cook-wrecks-travelers-plans-1983939,1983939
131978,353493,TRV,If China U S  Ties Degrade  Everybody Loses,news," Bloomberg     Things are getting worse  That s a conclusion one might have reasonably reached after reading this week s U S  China headlines 
First  there was Hong Kong  a matter Beijing has warned Washington to stay clear of  Protesters last weekend battled police  vandalized shops and paralyzed swaths of the Asia financial center  Then President Donald Trump tied outcomes in Hong Kong to trade 
Next  as China s top trade negotiator prepared to travel to Washington for a new round of talks  the U S  blacklisted eight prominent Chinese tech firms  In explaining the action  the U S  cited the companies  involvement in China s westernmost Xinjiang province  where up to a million predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities have been allegedly detained 
A day later  the U S  imposed travel bans on Chinese officials linked to Xinjiang  And it emerged that the Trump administration was moving ahead with discussing possible limits on portfolio flows into China 
These are not events that instill confidence in the state of what is increasingly the world s most important bilateral relationship  But there s also another way to see it 
The Global Times  a state run Chinese newspaper known for its more hawkish tone  brushed off the blacklisting as a gambit for leverage ahead of this week s trade negotiations  These American attempts to add  bargaining chips  won t sway China s approach to the talks  it added 
Could the week s events have been more about positioning than a reflection of growing conflict  The latest round of talks may give us a better idea  Or they won t  But if what the past week has illustrated is a deterioration in U S  China ties  that ll be bad for everyone 
NBA Furor 
Then there was basketball  In a sign that tensions across the Pacific may indeed be metastasizing  Beijing threw down the gauntlet against the National Basketball Association for comments by the general manager of the Houston Rockets supporting Hong Kong s protesters  That tweet  since deleted  initially prompted Chinese sponsors to dump the Rockets  But when NBA Commissioner Adam Silver then defended the right of individuals to personal expression  that rancor soon spread to the entire league  In the U S   China s response has been lambasted by American lawmakers and lampooned by the comedy show  South Park  
Xi and Modi
While Chinese negotiators are in Washington  President Xi Jinping is in India meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday and Saturday in the city of Chennai  This will be the second consecutive year in which the leaders of the world s most populous countries have held a face to face summit  after doing so in 2018 in the Chinese city of Wuhan  They ll have much to discuss  There s Pakistan and the question of Kashmir  Both are talking trade with America  Slowing economic growth  fraught financial systems and pervasive pollution are some of the other headaches they share  If U S  China is the world s most important bilateral relationship  then Beijing New Delhi is moving quickly up the ranks 
Holiday Travel
Tourism is one industry where China s slowdown is become more apparent  Data for the week long National Day holiday  which ended this past Monday  showed that 15  fewer residents traveled abroad than last year during the first six days of the holiday  A sustained drop off in outbound Chinese tourism would have broad implications  Travelers  NYSE TRV  from the mainland are already spurning Hong Kong because of the ongoing protests  contributing to what could be a technical recession  Macau  which saw its growth rate of visitors slow during the holiday  is similarly vulnerable to tighter Chinese purse strings  Australia  Thailand and Indonesia are among others 
Pork Supplies
The trade war and slowing economic growth are suppressing Chinese consumption  and so are pork prices  The cost of China s staple meat has surged this year after millions of hogs were either killed by African swine fever or culled to prevent the disease s spread  Even now  it is hard to get a precise figure on how many pigs have died  The repercussions have been clearer  In addition to higher prices  the shortfall in Chinese supply is also beginning to affect other countries  The U S  for example  could see tighter supplies of bacon and ham next year  according to Smithfield Foods  Higher prices have also led some Chinese farmers to breed very large hogs  some as heavy as a polar bear 
What We re Reading
And finally  a few other things that caught our eye 
 President Trump has been tweeting  less about China  How an investment slowdown is hitting  China s tech sector  Hong Kong s protests  aren t crimping the city s art market  How the city of Prague  started a quarrel with China  Why the Europe should copy China s Belt and Road plan To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story  John Liu in Beijing at jliu42 bloomberg net

132014,353529,TRV,Thousands of travelers delayed at U S  airports by computer outage,news,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON  Reuters    Thousands of travelers at U S  airports faced delays late on Friday because of an nationwide outage of U S  Customs and Border Protection s  CBP  processing systems  officials said 
CBP said in a statement the outage was temporary and  officers continue to process international travelers using alternative procedures until systems are back online  Travelers  NYSE TRV  at some ports of entry are experiencing longer than usual wait times  
A Customs spokeswoman could not offer an estimate on when the system would be back up and running 
The computer issue is not impacting departures 
JFK Airport in New York said on Twitter that  the Customs computer system is down nationwide  The agents are processing people manually  
People at various U S  airports posted videos on social media sites of lengthy lines at processing checkpoints and several airports warned of extensive delays 
On an average day  CBP processes around 358 000 air passengers and crew 
American Airlines  NASDAQ AAL  spokesman Ross Feinstein said the airline was  aware of the outage and are in contact with U S  Customs and Border Protection  
The Federal Aviation Administration  FAA  said the outage had not caused any changes in flights 
This is not the first time the system has faced problems  The system was down for four hours on Jan  2  2017 as many travelers were returning from holiday trips 
A Homeland Security inspector general s office report issued in November 2017 found  inadequate CBP software capacity testing  leaving the potential for recurrence of processing errors  
The report also warned of  inadequate business continuity and disaster recovery capabilities to minimize the impact of system failures on the traveling public  Until such deficiencies are addressed  CBP lacks a means to minimize the possibility and impact of similar system outages in the future  
CBP told the inspector general in 2017 that as  CBP moves to a cloud computing environment  improved performance and lead testing to emulate a production environment will be included in the requirements  ",2019-08-16,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/thousands-of-travelers-delayed-at-us-airports-by-computer-outage-1957511,1957511
132042,353557,TRV,Golf  Dream start drives Diaz to John Deere lead,news," Reuters    Mexico s Roberto Diaz holed a 100 yard wedge shot for eagle at his first hole and never looked back as he fired a flawless nine under par 62 and grabbed a two stroke lead after the first round at the John Deere Classic in Illinois on Thursday 
Americans Russell Henley and Adam Long were in second on 64  while Britain s Martin Laird  who is missing his home Scottish Open this week  was among a group of six players on 65 at TPC Deere Run in Silvis 
The best finisher on Sunday not already exempt for the British Open will earn the final seat on the overnight charter flight to Royal Portrush for next week s major championship in Northern Ireland 
Neither Diaz  Henley nor Long are currently in the Open 
Diaz  in his second year on tour  posted a career best tie for eighth at the Travelers  NYSE TRV  Championship three weeks ago  and the 32 year old stepped up his game even further on Thursday 
 Everything clicked today   he told reporters of his round that included seven birdies 
 I ve been playing pretty solid throughout the year  The driver has been awesome and I ve been hitting a lot of fairways 
 It s awesome to get it going  and once you get it going  you just feel that you have to put the pedal to the metal and keep going because     tomorrow it might be somebody else shooting 62 or 61  
Henley  meanwhile  lamented a bogey at his final hole  where his drive found a nasty lie in punishing rough  but he otherwise saw some promising signs 
 This has been a weird year for me   said the tour s 164th ranked player 
 I just haven t felt myself playing golf   I ve been  a little lost but I ve been putting in a lot of work on my game  and I felt confident going into today 
 I don t think I ve ever lost the belief that I can have a nice tournament or a nice round  It s just a matter of a few bumps in the road here and there  
Long was a surprise winner at the Desert Classic in California in January  but has done precious little since 
He said there was a lot less stress thanks to the two year exemption he received  but the game was the same challenge 
 It s still golf  it still drives you crazy  and I still have a bit of a perfectionist in me that I don t like to settle for mediocre   he said

132043,353558,TRV,Looks Like Brazilians Won t Be Scootering to Work,news," Bloomberg Opinion     Latin America is a motorist s nightmare  The region is home to seven of the 25 worst cities for driving  including three Brazilian behemoths Sao Paulo  Rio de Janeiro and Belo Horizonte 
Fortunately it s also a region where technological innovation can spread even faster than padded public works contracts  Brazilians are some of the most enthusiastic users of smart phones and the chattering WhatsApp  President Jair Bolsonaro won t get off Facebook  NASDAQ FB   The country is Uber s second largest market  So it s no surprise that electronic scooter giants Bird  Grow  the newly merged Grin and Yellow   and now Lime are vying for riders 
Environmentalists and urban wonks rightly cheer the arrival of the e scooter  What better than a small  quiet  clean running two wheel vehicle to lighten Latin America s deepening carbon footprint and ease world class gridlock  YPF Ventures  a venture capital fund founded by the eponymous Argentine oil company  recently invested in Bird  becoming the first oil and gas major to bet on micro mobility   Yet in Brazil  thanks to backward gazing policymakers and academics  and state regulatory agencies captured by lobbies and political incontinence  nifty additions to the urban planning oeuvre are instead mostly a pricey plaything for the well heeled 
That s a shame  Travelers  NYSE TRV  in big cities like Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo spend 75  more time than necessary commuting  according to Marta Gonzalez of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology s department of environmental engineering  In her comparison of five major world cities  Boston  San Francisco  Rio  Lisbon and Porto   Rio clocked the slowest travel time 
Those who rely on mass transit fare the worst  While Latin American metro systems are relatively fast and efficient  they carry just 10  of the region s 200 million public transportation passengers  That leaves the heavy lifting of public transit to the ignoble bus  big cans  in Brazilian street argot and the burden grows more onerous by the year 
Metropolitan Sao Paulo saw its bus fleet swell by nearly 28  in the decade since 2006  accounting for 12 million daily trips  Although the bus fleet pales before the city s 7 million private vehicles  these diesel guzzling clunkers kicked in almost half of metropolitan Sao Paulo s nitrogen oxide emissions  
Researchers concluded that by swapping the outdated diesel fleet for more fuel efficient vehicles or electric buses  metropolitan authorities could slash noxious black carbon and other tailpipe emissions  Yet by 2018  only 2  of Sao Paulo buses were electric 
Brazilians have taken note  In 2012  congress passed the National Urban Mobility Policy  mandating local governments to  draw up urban transit strategies  Yet by 2018  only 10  of big cities had complied  So it s little wonder that only around a quarter of greater Sao Paulo s nearly 20 million residents are effectively served by rapid public transportation 
That s a failure of vision at the top  In Rio  where bus companies have faced few regulatory fetters  researchers found that 80  of buses run on redundant routes  Another reason is a blackout in investment  A study by the National Association of Urban Transportation Companies showed that the vast majority of mass transit investments in the last decade were gobbled up by expanding two metro lines and creating express bus lanes   This is more organizing traffic than building new infrastructure   said Pablo Cerdeira  director of the Center for Technology and Society at the Getulio Vargas Foundation 
Analysts say a competitive private sector could help reset public transit  Brazil should be so lucky  Consider Operation Last Stop  a spin off of the sprawling Carwash corruption probe  In 2017  it discovered how a handful of bus company moguls in league with shady contractors bribed authorities in exchange for tax breaks  privileges and transit concessions 
Scooters won t rescue Rio or its gridlocked neighbors from pirates and failed planning  But they could help  According to figures from Grow  which operates Rio s scooters  the number of scooters and users has risen tenfold so far this year  More than the latest leisure fetish  cheap two wheeled alternatives could ferry commuters along that crucial  last mile  on the journey from the final bus or metro stop and the workplace or home  And scooters fetch a fraction of the price of electric bikes  the upscale ride for Brazil s green commuters 
Rio had micro mobility  in mind earlier this decade when it launched a network of municipal bike paths  However  city administrators and the sponsoring bank settled on a solution for leisure and sports  not getting people to and from work  and so shepherded cyclists to beaches  parks and plazas  Now policymakers apparently want to confine scooters to the same routes  leaving would be business commuters to stray into the city at their own peril 
Brazilian cities could do better by easing regulations for scooters and other traffic optimizing technologies  Using Waze to better distribute buses  for example  could reduce traffic in cities like Rio and Sao Paulo by 15 to 30   Gonzalez s team found  Getting the powerful bus lobby on board with tools that reduce demand for their services is another matter 
 Our regulatory laws and policy making are conservative and biased toward cars and buses   said Cerdeira   We need innovation and disruption but have a bureaucratic tradition weighted to the current players  not newcomers  
Under served passengers may have the last word  Though the motives for Brazilian discontent run deep  recall that a modest rise in bus fares sparked mass demonstrations in 2013 and fueled the revolt that eventually toppled an elected president  The ride since then has been anything but smooth ",2019-07-15,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/looks-like-brazilians-wont-be-scootering-to-work-1923836,1923836

132293,353808,TRV,Day Ahead  Top 3 Things to Watch,news,"Investing com   Here s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow 
1  Will Trump React to Fed Minutes 
The market failed to find direction at the end of trading today as the Federal Reserve s conviction that the economy can withstand quite a few more rate hikes  as evidenced by the minutes  spooked buyers 
While not a rebuttal to President Donald Trump calling the Fed and its rate hikes his biggest  threat     these minutes are from a meeting last month  after all   it s clear that policymakers and the chief executive are at loggerheads 
Another tweet or comment from the president against the FOMC could further dent market confidence tomorrow 
The longer term concern for investors is that if the Fed changes course it will now be seen as bowing to pressure  leading to more uncertainty about future moves and who is really calling the shots 
And if the Fed pauses for a few more meetings  it runs the risk of having to slam on the brakes hard if overheating starts 
2  Travelers Headlines Before the Bell Earnings
In earnings ahead of trading tomorrow  Dow component Travelers  NYSE TRV  is one of the bigger names reporting 
On average  analysts expect that the insurance company earned  2 26 per share on revenue of  7 billion 
As with all insurers  growth of premiums will be key to results  But with interest rates climbing and bond yields rising  it will be important to see if the company s investment revenue comes in strong 
Philip Morris International  NYSE PM  also reports its latest quarterly numbers and investors will be looking for any sign that the company is moving closer into investing in the hot cannabis section 
Legalization of cannabis in Canada began today 
Meanwhile  more financial companies weigh in after the bell  with PayPal  NASDAQ PYPL  and  American Express   NYSE AXP  on tap

132350,353865,TRV,Day Ahead  Top 3 Things to Watch,news,"Investing com   Here s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow 
1  Smaller Banks Weigh in With Earnings
Financial stocks had a strong performance Wednesday and earnings in the sector will again dominate trading talk ahead of the bell Thursday 
The big name banks have largely topped expectations and now investors will get a chance to drill down into the numbers for the smaller institutions 
Bank of New York Mellon  NYSE BK  stock climbed 2 9  Wednesday ahead of its report  Analysts predict the company will report a profit of  1 02 per share on revenue of a little more than  4 1 billion  Fifth Third Bancorp  NASDAQ FITB  stock gained around 2 4   It s expected to earn 57 cents per share on revenue of about  1 6 billion 
Blackstone  NYSE BX   KeyCorp  NYSE KEY   BB T  NYSE BBT  and  Capital One  Financial  NYSE COF  will also issue numbers 
Insurer and Dow component Travelers  NYSE TRV  is also on the earnings calendar ahead of Thursday trading 
The company is expected to report earnings of  2 43 per share and revenue of  6 92 billion  A lot of the attention will be on the rise in premiums for the quarter  according to Zacks 
2  Jobless Claims  Philly Fed Expected Slightly Higher
The most important economic numbers are scheduled before the open on Thursday  with data on the labor market and manufacturing on tap 
Initial jobless claims are expected to rise slightly to 220 000 for the week ended July 13 from 214 000 the previous week  The jobs market has shown continued strength without much of a jump in wages to exacerbate inflation concerns 
 With a strong job market  inflation close to our objective  and the risks to the outlook roughly balanced  the FOMC believes that    for now    the best way forward is to keep gradually raising the federal funds rate   Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell said in remarks to the Senate Tuesday  He reiterated that position Wednesday before the House 
Also on the calendar  the Philadelphia Fed releases its estimate of July manufacturing activity  Economists expect that the index rose to 21 6 from 19 9 in June 
3  Oil Prices Show Resilience Despite Rising Stockpiles
Investors should keep an eye on oil prices  with the energy sector having a strong influence on overall market direction lately 
Oil prices took a surprising path on Wednesday  settling higher despite the Energy Information Administration reporting an unexpected rise in U S  crude inventories 
On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for July delivery rose 1  to settle at  68 76 a barrel  Inventories of U S  crude rose by 5 836 million barrels for the week ended July 13  confounding expectations for a draw 
The higher settlement in U S  oil prices comes as oil observers continued to expect that major oil producers would have little room to address a potential global supply shortage 
OPEC countries have limited room to address any shortage and in the next 12 18 months the market will realize the U S  can t support the entire market with spare capacity  RBC said earlier this week ",2018-07-18,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/day-ahead-top-3-things-to-watch-1535474,1535474

132387,353902,TRV,Is Travelers Companies  TRV  A Good Value Investor Pick ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put The Travelers Companies  Inc    NYSE TRV   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  The Travelers Companies has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 16 08  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 19 54  If we focus on the long term PE trend  The Travelers Companies  current PE level puts it above its midpoint of 11 67 over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months  However  the current level stands below the highs for the stock  suggesting that it can be a solid entry point  Moreover  the stock s PE also compares unfavorably with the Zacks Finance Market sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 14 58  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively overvalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that Sun Life Financial has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 14 44  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for The Travelers Companies  stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  The Travelers Companies has a P S ratio of about 1 13  This is much lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 38 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years  Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  The Travelers Companies currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes The Travelers Companies a solid choice for value investors For example  the PEG ratio for The Travelers Companies is just 1 56  a level that is lower than the industry average of 1 88  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Additionally  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 4 76  which is better than the industry average of 14 21  Clearly  TRV is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though  The Travelers Companies might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of D and Momentum Score of F  This gives TRV a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of C   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been disappointing  The current year has seen one upward revision in the past sixty days compared to seven downward revisions  while the full year 2020 estimate has also seen one upward revision compared to seven downward revisions in the same time period The current year consensus estimate declined 10 4  in the past two months  whereas the full year 2020 estimate fell 5 8   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below The Travelers Companies  Inc  Price and Consensus   Owing to such bearish estimate trends  the stock has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   which is why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineThe Travelers Companies is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  bottom 42  out of more than 250 industries  and aZacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the broader industry has underperformed the market at large  as you can see below  So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick 7 Best Stocks

132440,353955,TRV,Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Thursday,news,"Investing com   Here are the top five things you need to know in financial markets on Thursday  October 19 
1  Trump and Yellen to sit down over Fed chair future
U S  President Donald Trump is scheduled to have an interview later on Thursday with current Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen in what will likely be his last interview before making a decision over who will continue at the helm of the U S  central bank when Yellen s term expires in February 2018 
Yellen herself could be reappointed as Trump has included her in the list of five possible candidates 
The other four prospects are Stanford University economist John Taylor  current Fed governor Jerome Powell  National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn and former Fed governor Kevin Warsh 
Speculation has run rampant over which of the candidates has the best chance with odds for Taylor gaining ground after reports that he made a favorable impression on the President 
In a recent Reuters  survey of economists  Powell received a narrow majority as experts pointed to him as the best bet for continuity at the Fed 
White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said Wednesday that Trump would make his decision in the  coming days  and the President is widely expected to formalize the announcement before heading to Asia on November 3 
2  Spain to strip Catalonia of autonomous status
Political turmoil in Europe continued on Thursday with the focus on the latest developments in Spain as the country s government announced it would move ahead in the process to strip Catalonia of its autonomy and return to direct rule of the region 
Catalan President Carles Puigdemont faced an early morning deadline to clarify to the Spanish government whether he had declared the region s independence after the results of a recent referendum in the country 
Puigdemont appeared to avoid the official request earlier on Thursday  threatening to call a vote in the Catalan Parliament over an official declaration of independence if Madrid didn t agree to formal talks

In other earnings after Wednesday s close  eBay  NASDAQ EBAY  saw shares sink around 6  after its profit forecast disappointed

132498,354013,TRV,Why The Earnings Surprise Streak Could Continue For Travelers  TRV ,opinion,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well positioned to maintain its earnings beat streak in its upcoming report  It is worth considering Travelers  TRV   which belongs to the Zacks Insurance   Property and Casualty industry 
This insurer has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 5 06  
For the last reported quarter  Travelers came out with earnings of  2 83 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 76 per share  representing a surprise of 2 54   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  1 98 per share and it actually produced earnings of  2 13 per share  delivering a surprise of 7 58  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for Travelers  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Travelers currently has an Earnings ESP of  6 61   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on July 23  2019 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-07-03,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-the-earnings-surprise-streak-could-continue-for-travelers-trv-200437079,200437079
132499,354014,TRV,Travelers  TRV  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"Travelers  TRV  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 23  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This insurer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 32 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  28 2  
Revenues are expected to be  7 75 billion  up 4 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 74  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Travelers 
For Travelers  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  2 21  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Travelers will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Travelers would post earnings of  2 76 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 83  delivering a surprise of  2 54  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Travelers doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/travelers-trv-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200440147,200440147

Travelers shares have added about 25  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 19 1  
What s Next for Travelers 
While Travelers has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Travelers was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

132530,354045,TRV,Should Value Investors Consider Travelers  TRV  Stock Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put The Travelers Companies Inc    NYSE TRV   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  The Travelers Companies also known as Travelers has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 16 03  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 17 89  If we focus on the long term PE trend Travelers  current PE level puts it above its midpoint over the past five years  However  the stock s PE compares unfavorably with the Zacks   Finance sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 14 05  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively overvalued right now  compared to its peers  Nonetheless  Travelers has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 13 44  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for the stock in the near term P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Travelers has a P S ratio of about 1 29  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 24x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years  If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Travelers currently has a Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes the stock a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  its P CF ratio comes in at 5 19  which is better than the industry average of 14 32  Clearly  the stock is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though TRV might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of C and a Momentum Score of C  This gives TRV a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current year has seen five upward revisions with two downward movements in the past sixty days  For the next year  the estimate has seen three upward revisions in the same time period with two movement in the opposite direction This has had an impact on the consensus estimate as the current year consensus estimate has increased 0 27  in the past two months  while the next year estimate decreased 0 25   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below The Travelers Companies  Inc  Price and Consensus   This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineTravelers is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Further  a strong industry rank  among Top 17  of more than 250 industries  and Zacks Rank  3  instills our confidence However  over the past two years  the Zacks Insurance   Property and Casualty industry has clearly underperformed the market at large  as you can see below  So  value investors might want to wait for industry performance  estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of AllLast year  it generated  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  47 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce  the world s first trillionaires   but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early ,2019-06-11,Zacks

132531,354046,TRV,Are You Looking For A High Growth Dividend Stock  Travelers  TRV  Could Be A Great Choice,opinion,"All investors love getting big returns from their portfolio  whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  But for income investors  generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus 
While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments  income investors hone in on dividends  A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  and investors often view it by its dividend yield  a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long term returns  with dividend contributions exceeding one third of total returns in many cases 
Travelers in Focus
Travelers  TRV  is headquartered in New York  and is in the Finance sector  The stock has seen a price change of 26 95  since the start of the year  The insurer is currently shelling out a dividend of  0 82 per share  with a dividend yield of 2 16   This compares to the Insurance   Property and Casualty industry s yield of 1 32  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 93  
Looking at dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  3 28 is up 8 3  from last year  Over the last 5 years  Travelers has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 8 41   Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Travelers s current payout ratio is 33   This means it paid out 33  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Earnings growth looks solid for TRV for this fiscal year  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  11 20 per share  which represents a year over year growth rate of 25 28  
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for many reasons  they greatly improve stock investing profits  decrease overall portfolio risk  and carry tax advantages  among others  But  not every company offers a quarterly payout 
High growth firms or tech start ups  for example  rarely provide their shareholders a dividend  while larger  more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  During periods of rising interest rates  income investors must be mindful that high yielding stocks tend to struggle  With that in mind  TRV is a compelling investment opportunity  Not only is it a strong dividend play  but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3  Hold  ",2019-06-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/are-you-looking-for-a-highgrowth-dividend-stock-travelers-trv-could-be-a-great-choice-200434518,200434518
132567,354082,TRV,Hail  pummeled cars loom over U S  insurance results,news,"By Suzanne Barlyn
 Reuters    A hailstorm that pounded down on a Subaru dealership in Plano  Texas  barely lasted 30 minutes  but left behind a trail of smashed windows  dented hoods and millions of dollars  worth of claims for an insurer to cough up 
Damage to thousands of cars in dealership lots across Texas  Nebraska  Oklahoma and other states are just some of the weather related losses that have been hitting U S  property insurers particularly hard in the first half of this year 
 It got everything on the car   roofs  sides  mirrors and back glasses   said Ronnie Cohen  new car director of Subaru of Plano  describing the trail of destruction by golf ball sized hail that inflicted at least  4 million in damage to 311 cars plus  500 000 to the dealership building in March 
Weather related losses loom over the insurance industry  which writes policies for everything from individual homes and cars to large commercial real estate complexes  The profit damage is becoming evident in second quarter results 
On Thursday  insurer The Travelers Companies Inc  NYSE TRV  reported a 10 4 percent drop in second quarter profit  hurt by higher catastrophe losses 
Those losses  net of reinsurance  rose to  403 million in the second quarter  from  333 million a year earlier  mainly due to wind and hail storms across the United States  Travelers said  Higher investment returns helped offset some of the pain 
Analysts expect similar losses to weigh on American International Group Inc  NYSE AIG   Allstate Corp  NYSE ALL   Hartford Financial Services Group  NYSE HIG  Inc and Arch Capital Group Ltd when they announce results in the coming weeks 
All told  U S  insurers paid out  15 5 billion to cover claims related to severe storms that produced conditions such as hail and fierce winds during the first half of 2017  the second costliest on record for such damage  according to Aon PLC s reinsurance broker  Aon Benfield 
STEADY STREAM OF STORMS
The bad weather shows no signs of abating 
A steady stream of storm systems that trigger hail and fierce winds has traveled out of the Rocky Mountains and into parts of the central and eastern United States  said Steve Bowen  an Aon Benfield meteorologist  A warmer than usual Gulf of Mexico has also helped fuel storms 
 We ve seen this type of pattern many times before  but the frequency has been higher this year   Bowen said   Plus  these events have impacted densely populated areas   which drives the financial loss  
Above average sea surface temperatures are among factors that could set off a hyper active Atlantic hurricane season later this year  meteorologists said  They do not predict whether any will make landfall in the United States 
Weather related losses and risks are  for the most part  already priced into insurers  stocks  said Sandler O Neill analyst Paul Newsome  Weather does not typically prompt insurers to hike premiums  except for unusual situations  such as after Hurricane Andrew in 1992 or Hurricane Katrina in 2005  he said 
Some insurers have turned to reinsurers to protect profits 
For instance  Ally Financial Inc  a bank that caters to the auto industry  put reinsurance in place midway through the first quarter after strong hail storms ravaged dealerships it insures 
Nonetheless  Ally sustained  42 million in weather related losses during the first quarter  Weather problems have continued into the second quarter  Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Brown told Reuters 
 It s nasty   Brown said  but  I sleep a lot better at night knowing that we have reinsurance in place  
For their part  car dealers in hail battered states are trying to unload dented inventory at so called  hail sales  
Prestige Imports in Lakewood  Colorado  which sells high end brands like Porsche and Audi  was battered by hail on May 8  It is offering deals on a  huge inventory  of damaged vehicles  according to its website 
At the Plano Subaru  mechanics repaired many hail damaged cars  which have passed safety inspections and now sell at least  8 000 to  10 000 below the sticker price  Cohen said 
The dealership was glad to have secured bad weather insurance before the storms  he said  It still has to pay a  240 000 deductible  but much less than the full  4 million tab ",2017-07-24,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/hail,-pummeled-cars-loom-over-u.s.-insurance-results-508859",508859

132605,354120,TRV,Dow closes in record territory as fed hikes rates,news,"Investing com   U S  stocks closed mixed on Wednesday  after the Federal Reserve increased interest rates and maintained its outlook of three rate hikes for 2017  despite recent economic data suggesting a slowdown in the U S  economy 
The Federal Reserve increased its key interest rate by 0 25  to a 1 1 25  range on Wednesday  and surprised investors as it maintained its outlook of three total rate hikes for 2017 
The Federal Reserve said that gradual increases in interest rates remained appropriate as it expects economic growth to raise moderately 
The central bank said measures to trim its balance sheet would come into take effect this year provided that economic growth continues to expand as expected 
 The committee currently expects to begin implementing a balance sheet normalisation program this year  provided that the economy evolves broadly as anticipated   the Fed said in its statement 
The Federal Reserve s policy decision came a few hours after the release of a pair of economic reports showed a slowdown in both inflation and retail sales 
U S  consumer prices  a measure of inflation  fell 0 1  in May  as a fall in energy prices  airline fares and apparel weighed on the pace of inflation  the labor department said  The measure of inflation missed forecasts of a 0 2  rise 
Meanwhile  core retail sales sustained their biggest drop in 16 months to 0 3   according to the commerce department 
Fed chair Janet Yellen said in a press conference that the recent slowdown in inflation was transitory  resulting from a  one off reduction  in certain categories of prices  adding that the committee expects inflation to move and stabilise around 2  over the next couple of years

132669,354184,TRV,Can Travelers  TRV  Keep The Earnings Surprise Streak Alive ,opinion,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well positioned to maintain its earnings beat streak in its upcoming report  It is worth considering Travelers  TRV   which belongs to the Zacks Insurance   Property and Casualty industry 
This insurer has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 11  
For the most recent quarter  Travelers was expected to post earnings of  1 98 per share  but it reported  2 13 per share instead  representing a surprise of 7 58   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  2 22 per share  while it actually produced  2 54 per share  a surprise of 14 41  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for Travelers  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Travelers has an Earnings ESP of  2 09  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on April 18  2019 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-04-14,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-travelers-trv-keep-the-earnings-surprise-streak-alive-200406851,200406851

Travelers shares have added about 13 5  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 15 7  
What s Next for Travelers 
While Travelers has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately

132671,354186,TRV,Market Perks Up After Better Than Forecast US Economic Data,opinion," Thursday Market Open  On the last trading day of the week  investors were greeted with some mixed economic data as earnings season is turning out to be better than expected 
U S  retail sales for March came in stronger than forecast  notching a 1 6  gain when a Briefing com consensus showed expectations of a 0 9  rise  Anything pointing to the health of the American consumer can be particularly important given the huge percentage of gross domestic product that is driven by consumer spending 
In other economic data  initial U S  jobless claims hit their lowest level since 1969  coming in at 192 000 compared to a Briefing com consensus forecast of 208 000 
The data add to a picture of a U S  economy that  while not going gangbusters  is still showing signs of health  But in a globally connected economy  health in one place can end up being tamped down by weakness in other jurisdictions 
IHS Markit data showed manufacturing activity in Germany and France  Europe s two largest economies  continued to contract  This may be feeding continued worries about the health of the global economy  which had eased a bit earlier in the week on a better than expected showing for Chinese gross domestic product  The euro has weakened versus the dollar  which is usually a good sign for commodities such as oil 
Morning Roundup  Earnings And IPOs
The data come as earnings season rolls on and investors have seen generally better than expected results  Of the S P 500  SPX  companies that have reported  FactSet data show more than 78  have beaten analyst expectations  CNBC reported Thursday morning 
In the latest round of earnings reports Honeywell  NYSE HON  beat analysts expectations on its top and bottom lines and raised its full year forecast while American Express  NYSE AXP  and Travelers  NYSE TRV  reported better than forecast profit while revenue fell short of expectations 
In another sign that the IPO market may be heating up this quarter after a slower first quarter  three IPOs are on tap today  Social media site Pinterest  NYSE PINS  will start trading under the ticker PINS  at  19 per share  valuing it at  12 7 billion  Video conferencing company Zoom  NASDAQ ZM   which has priced at  36 per share  valuing it at  9 2 billion  will trade under the ticker ZM as one of the first largest tech IPOs of the year  Greenlane Holdings  NASDAQ GNLN   a company that makes vaping devices and targets the cannabis market  is set to trade under the ticker symbol GNLN  priced at  17 per share 
It will be interesting to see how they trade  especially PINS  which seems to have enthusiasm behind it  compared with LYFT  NASDAQ LYFT   which rallied on its first day of trade March 30  but then slumped in the wake of Uber s planned IPO  with shares yet to recover 
Healthcare Weighs
Stocks ended Wednesday in the red amid a marked decline in healthcare shares  With a 2 89  loss  that was by far the worst performing sector of the S P 500 on a day when other sectors  percent changes were more muted  See figure 1 below 
The pressure comes as investor and trader worries grow about potential legislative changes that could affect the industry  The concerns ratcheted up after UnitedHealth s  NYSE UNH  CEO spoke against  Medicare for All  in the UNH earnings conference call and said healthcare price inflation has been slowing 
Still it s far from certain what  if any changes to healthcare legislation might get passed by Congress  Over the past year  the sector is up more than 7 9   as of Wednesday  Although that isn t the best performing sector  it s not the worst either 
Earnings Season Continues
The pressure from the healthcare industry outweighed some positives for Wall Street as earnings season continues 
Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS  shares rose 2 6  after its results outpaced third party consensus estimates for both earnings and revenue 
The banking sector has been struggling lately because of low interest rates and expectations for them to remain low for some time as the Fed has adopted a dovish stance  While the yield curve is back into a position where it could be more favorable to bank profits  the potential for the Fed to stand pat on yields throughout the year is could be a headwind for banks trying to grow their profit margins 
Meanwhile  PepsiCo  NASDAQ PEP  also gained sharply  rising more than 3 7   after beating earnings and revenue forecasts  with the company citing strong operating performance from its international divisions and Frito Lay North America 
Eyes On U S   China Economies
The strong corporate earnings added to some positive sentiment from overseas economic news  as China s gross domestic product outdid expectations in Q1  rising 6 4   Analysts had expected 6 3   according to Trading Economics 
Wednesday s data form a counterpoint to concerns about slowing economic growth in the world s second largest economy as a trade war between it and the United States drags on 
Closer to home  the Fed released its Beige Book  which painted a picture of a U S economy that  while not going gangbusters still is showing signs of growth   See more below  
The markets are closed Friday for the Good Friday holiday  so investors might want to consider being on the lookout for possible volatility ahead of the long weekend

Economy Still Growing  The release of the Fed s Beige Book  which compiles an anecdotal picture of the U S  economy  provided some interesting reading Wednesday  Beige was perhaps the right color for this report as it showed the economy wasn t red hot or cold blue  Against a backdrop of increasing worry about slowing economic growth in the United States and abroad  the report showed that overall sentiment remains on the slightly positive side  Economic activity expanded at a slight to moderate pace in March and early this month  and the Fed s contacts in reporting districts expect slight to modest growth in coming months  the Fed said  With employment continuing to rise nationwide and labor markets remaining tight  wages generally were on the rise at around the same pace as previously in the year  according to the central bank  The Fed s contacts often cited rising wages  as well as freight costs and tariffs  as key factors driving a trend of modest to moderate increases in input costs 
Rate Cuts Seen Unlikely  Even though prices rose modestly on balance since the previous Beige Book  it seems the Fed isn t too worried about inflation  There s been a marked difference between the tail end of last year and the first months of this year when it comes to interest rate expectations  Last year  the market was under pressure as investors thought the Fed might raise rates too much  Now  there is talk of the possibility of the central bank actually cutting rates  But investment research firm CFRA doesn t think that s likely   Investors remain encouraged about the appreciation potential for equities during the rest of the year   CFRA said   Yet reasons for this optimism should not include the start a new rate easing cycle by the Fed  since the difference between rates and inflation remains too narrow  
Gold Losing Luster  The most actively traded gold futures contract in New York settled at  1 276 80 an ounce Wednesday  its lowest close since December  The weakness appears to be helped by increasing risk appetite  whetted on Wednesday by the stronger than expected Chinese GDP figures  Overall  investors and traders seem to have more appetite for riskier stocks this year amid a dovish Fed and expectations for a resolution to the U S  China trade war  Gains in the dollar this year also appear to be weighing on gold  As the greenback rises  that makes dollar denominated gold more expensive for those holding other currencies

At this time  Travelers has an average Growth Score of C  however its Momentum Score is doing a bit better with a B  Following the exact same course  the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side  putting it in the top 40  for this investment strategy 
Overall  the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B  If you aren t focused on one strategy  this score is the one you should be interested in 
Outlook
Estimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock  and the magnitude of this revision indicates a downward shift  It s no surprise Travelers has a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   We expect a below average return from the stock in the next few months ",2019-02-20,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/travelers-trv-up-55-since-last-earnings-report-can-it-continue-200390745,200390745
132701,354216,TRV,TRV Or WRB  Which Is The Better Value Stock Right Now ,opinion,"Investors interested in stocks from the Insurance   Property and Casualty sector have probably already heard of Travelers  TRV  and W R  Berkley  WRB   But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors  We ll need to take a closer look to find out 
There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks  but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns  The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits 
Currently  Travelers has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while W R  Berkley has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold   The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates  so investors should rest assured that TRV has an improving earnings outlook  But this is only part of the picture for value investors 
Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics  including the popular P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors 
TRV currently has a forward P E ratio of 12 07  while WRB has a forward P E of 22 09  We also note that TRV has a PEG ratio of 0 95  This figure is similar to the commonly used P E ratio  with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company s expected earnings growth rate  WRB currently has a PEG ratio of 2 45 
Another notable valuation metric for TRV is its P B ratio of 1 56  The P B is a method of comparing a stock s market value to its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  WRB has a P B of 1 87 
These are just a few of the metrics contributing to TRV s Value grade of B and WRB s Value grade of C 
TRV stands above WRB thanks to its solid earnings outlook  and based on these valuation figures  we also feel that TRV is the superior value option right now ",2019-03-25,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/trv-or-wrb-which-is-the-better-value-stock-right-now-200401038,200401038
132702,354217,TRV,Travelers  TRV  Is A Top Dividend Stock Right Now  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Getting big returns from financial portfolios  whether through stocks  bonds  ETFs  other securities  or a combination of all  is an investor s dream  But when you re an income investor  your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments 
Cash flow can come from bond interest  interest from other types of investments  and of course  dividends  A dividend is the distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  it s often viewed by its dividend yield  a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long term returns  with dividend contributions exceeding one third of total returns in many cases 
Travelers in Focus
Headquartered in New York  Travelers  TRV  is a Finance stock that has seen a price change of 14 25  so far this year  The insurer is currently shelling out a dividend of  0 77 per share  with a dividend yield of 2 25   This compares to the Insurance   Property and Casualty industry s yield of 1 62  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 94  
Looking at dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  3 08 is up 1 7  from last year  In the past five year period  Travelers has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 8 41   Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Travelers s current payout ratio is 34   This means it paid out 34  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Looking at this fiscal year  TRV expects solid earnings growth  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  11 12 per share  which represents a year over year growth rate of 24 38  
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for many reasons  they greatly improve stock investing profits  decrease overall portfolio risk  and carry tax advantages  among others  But  not every company offers a quarterly payout 
Big  established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  but it s fairly uncommon to see high growth businesses or tech start ups offer their stockholders a dividend  Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  That said  they can take comfort from the fact that TRV is not only an attractive dividend play  but is also a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  ",2019-04-02,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/travelers-trv-is-a-top-dividend-stock-right-now-should-you-buy-200403532,200403532
132703,354218,TRV,Travelers  TRV  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"The market expects Travelers  TRV  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 18  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This insurer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 78 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  13  
Revenues are expected to be  7 64 billion  up 4 7  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 3  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Travelers 
For Travelers  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 13  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Travelers will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Travelers would post earnings of  1 98 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 13  delivering a surprise of  7 58  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss

What s driving markets 
After the country posted the slowest annual pace of annual growth   6 6    since 1990  President Xi Jinping reportedly convened a meeting of high level Communist Party officials  urging them to be alert over  black swan  and  gray rhino  financial events in face of an economic slowdown  Trade tensions are partly to blame for the weak data 
Citing that weak data  President Donald Trump tweeted late Monday that China needs to  finally do a Real Deal and stop playing around   when it comes to trade  But the two countries reportedly remain far apart on key issues such as theft of intellectual property  which the U S  says China has engaged in for decades 
On Saturday  Trump said stock rallying reports last week that the U S  would ease tariffs on China were not correct  even as he said talks were  going very well  
Potentially adding to trade tensions was a report that the U S  plans to formally request from Canada the extradition of Huawei s  SZ 002502  chief financial officer  Meng Wanzhou  over allegations she lied about the company s dealings with Iran 
Meanwhile  on Monday  the International Monetary Fund cut its global growth forecast to 3 5  for 2019  from 3 7  in 2018 and from the 3 7  it predicted for 2019 back in October  Unveiling its forecasts at the World Economic Forum in Davos  Switzerland  the fund left its prediction for U S  growth this year unchanged at 2 5  
A partial government shutdown stretched into its 31st day on Tuesday  and there was little sign of the deadlock breaking  Democrats rejected Trump s latest proposal to temporarily extend protections for some young immigrants brought to the country illegally as children  in exchange for  5 7 billion for his border wall 
The shutdown has caused a backlog of economic data  with only a smattering of reports due this week  including existing home sales  jobless claims and Markit manufacturing and services purchasing managers index data

132799,354314,TRV,Will Travelers  TRV  Beat Estimates Again In Its Next Earnings Report ,opinion,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well positioned to maintain its earnings beat streak in its upcoming report  It is worth considering Travelers  TRV   which belongs to the Zacks Insurance   Property and Casualty industry 
When looking at the last two reports  this insurer has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates  The company has topped estimates by  5 55   on average  in the last two quarters 
For the most recent quarter  Travelers was expected to post earnings of  2 22 per share  but it reported  2 54 per share instead  representing a surprise of 14 41   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  2 43 per share  while it actually produced  1 81 per share  a surprise of 25 51  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for Travelers  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Travelers has an Earnings ESP of  0 39  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  4  Sell   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on January 22  2019 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2018-12-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-travelers-trv-beat-estimates-again-in-its-next-earnings-report-200370717,200370717

132801,354316,TRV,Travelers  TRV  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"The market expects Travelers  NYSE TRV  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 22  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This insurer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 30 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  0 9  
Revenues are expected to be  7 70 billion  up 4 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 06  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Travelers 
For Travelers  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  8 31  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Travelers will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Travelers would post earnings of  2 22 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 54  delivering a surprise of  14 41  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Travelers doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-14,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/travelers-trv-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200375721,200375721

NYSE MCS   Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations    Here are highlights from Wednesday s Analyst Blog Thanksgiving Travel the Busiest in 13 Years  Top 5 GainersCourtesy of an uptick in personal income and wages  traveling by car  train or plane is expected to be high this Thanksgiving  More Americans will hit the roads or take to the skies  a number that would surpass the levels of the past 13 years Given this near term surge in travel demand  investing in travel and leisure companies will be judicious  As bulk of the travel is expected to be via road  rental car giants are surely poised to be among the biggest gainers  An uptick in travel during the holiday period will certainly boost airlines  while pre tax profits of all major airlines are already on the rise  Another investment option is hotel and resort companies  More travel will lead to increase in hotel occupancy rate and in turn revenue per available room will scale higher Thanksgiving Travel to Hit 13 Year HighAccording to the American Automobile Association  AAA   about 54 3 million travelers are likely to travel 50 miles or more  This would be the highest since 2005  Thanksgiving Day weekend travel is anticipated to increase 4 8  from last year About 89 4  or 48 5 million travelers are expected to travel by car  indicating an increase of nearly 5  over last Thanksgiving  Modes of transport including cruises  trains and buses are expected to make up 2 8  of all travel this Thanksgiving  serving around 1 48 million However  the largest growth in holiday travel is by air  About 4 27 million travelers are expected to opt for flights  which is 5 4  higher than the year ago level  Flights are expected to account for 7 8  of all travel this Thanksgiving Airports to Be Busy  Pre Tax Profits UpAirlines for America  A4A   the trade group representing the interests of U S  airlines  in fact  projected that 30 6 million passengers are expected to fly in the upcoming weekend  which is up from about 29 million passengers in the same period last year  The trade organization expects Nov 25 to see 3 06 million commuters on U S  carriers  The next busiest day is expected to be the Wednesday before Thanksgiving   Nov 21 Collectively  all major airlines including Alaska  Allegiant  American  Delta  Hawaiian  JetBlue  Southwest  Spirit and United have already posted a healthy pre tax profit of around  10 8 billion for the first nine months of this year  These publicly traded U S  passenger carriers have recovered 68 cents in revenue for every dollar rise in operating cost during the said period Will Travel Get Costlier Gasoline prices during Thanksgiving are expected to reach  2 79 a gallon  Even though such gas prices are highest in four years  AAA gas price expert Jeanette Casselano said that  motorists have become accustomed to this year s more expensive gas prices and won t let higher fuel costs deter them from taking Thanksgiving road trips  At the same time  the average daily car rental rates are expected at  63  down 10  from last year  according to AAA s Leisure Travel Index  This possibly explains the reason why so many Americans are willing to travel by road Travelers  NYSE TRV   by the way  don t necessarily expect sky high airfares this holiday season due to a continuous drop in oil prices  Meanwhile  the average stay in a Three Diamond hotel is expected to decline 6  to  166 per night  while a Two Diamond Hotel will cost 6  higher this year at  124  The rise in prices  however  shouldn t be a deterrent for travelers  thanks to an increase in wages and personal income What s Boosting Travel This Thanksgiving Average hourly earnings increased to 3 1  in October from the same period last year  according to the U S  Department of Labor  Thus  the increase in pay touched 3  for the first time since the end of the Great Recession in mid 2009 Personal income increased 0 2  in September  Disposable personal income that measures the total amount of money available for use after payment of taxes also rose by 0 2   according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis  5 Stocks to Ride on Thanksgiving RushWith the rise in income levels  people are willing to spend more on travel this holiday period  As travel volumes are expected to shoot up  investing in travel and leisure companies seems profitable  Increase in travel will surely lead to an uptick in demand for car rents  air tickets and hotel rooms  We have  thus  selected five such stocks that boast a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  Hertz Global Holdings  Inc  operates car

132836,354351,TRV,Travelers Impresses With Revenue Growth  Cat Loss A Woe,opinion,The Travelers Companies  Inc    NYSE TRV   has made a name for itself  offering a wide range of property and casualty  P C  insurance plus surety products and services  Its reputation rides high on the successful catering to its clients  diverse needs  Historically  the clients have largely benefitted from the company s bouquet of diverse insurance products and services and by retaining this optimism  the Zacks Rank  3  Hold  P C insurer continues to evolve stronger over time and looks set to repeat its winning streak in the near future Growth DriversAs a leading provider of property casualty insurance for auto  home and business  Travelers has been able to sustain its strong market position and benefit from it  reaping economies of scale  The company remains focused on implementing pricing and other actions to continue increasing returns and more importantly  improving profitability The P C insurer s commercial business has been delivering a solid performance  driven by consistent stability in the markets where it is operational as well as renders wise strategic execution Investment income  an important component of insurers  top line  has been improving over the past several quarters  backed by higher private equity returns  The P C insurer anticipates witnessing better investment results in the near term owing to a slow but steady improving pace of interest rates  For 2018  Travelers Companies projects about  25  30 million of higher after tax net investment income on a quarterly basis compared with the same in 2017 On the back of improving investment income and premium growth  the company has been witnessing an upward trend in relation to its top line  We expect the company to continue displaying this positive trend in the near term  which in turn is likely to accelerate the company s overall growth Underlying underwriting margin is a measure to assess the performance of a company or its segments  On the back of inherent strengths  Travelers estimates higher underlying underwriting margins for the remainder of 2018 across its Business Insurance  Bond   Specialty Insurance and Personal Insurance than the recorded tally in 2017 A strong capital position aids the company to return value to its shareholders via dividend hikes and buybacks  The company has made 14 straight dividend raises  witnessing a 14 year CAGR of 10   Also  its dividend yield of 2 37  is better than the industry yield of 2 36   It has  4 2 billion left under its existing share repurchase authorization Shares of Travelers have gained 8 4  in a year s time  underperforming the  s 17 6  rally  However  we expect the company s aforementioned strengths to turn the stock around in the near term  Growth Projections  The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current year earnings per share being pegged at  10 44 on revenues of  29 46 billion  While the top line reflects a year over year rise of 2 9   the bottom line represents an increase of 43 4   For 2019  the consensus mark for the metric stands at  11 30 on  30 64 billion revenues  While revenues represent a 4  improvement  earnings reflect 8 3  growth Positive Earnings Surprise History  Travelers displays an encouraging earnings surprise history  having outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 43 50  Near Term HeadwindsBeing a P C insurer  the company has been suffering catastrophe loss for a considerable period of time  thus rendering volatility to its earnings  Such a massive loss has already hurt the company s underwriting profitability with the combined ratio deteriorating in the last few years Nonetheless  underlying combined ratio is likely to trend lower for Business Insurance and Personal Insurance segments for the remainder of 2018 compared with the recorded figure in 2017  With respect to Bond   Specialty Insurance  the metric is expected to remain consistent for the next two quarters with the levels reported in the same period of 2017  For the last quarter of 2018  the company predicted the combined ratio to be lower year over year  attributable to a charge for a single international surety loss in fourth quarter 2017 Stocks to ConsiderSome better ranked stocks from the insurance industry are Alleghany

At the close of U S  trading  the Dow 30 rose 0 12   the S P 500 index rose 0 07   while the NASDAQ Composite index fell 0 02  
The Volatility S P 500 index  which measures the outlook for market volatility  was down 2 42  at 10 88 
Payroll processor ADP reported earlier in its nonfarm payrolls report that the U S private sector added 281 000 jobs last month  beating expectations for an increase of 200 000 and the highest since November 2012 
The upbeat data eased concerns that headwinds may be slowing U S  recovery and gave stocks room to rise 
Still  concerns began to brew that as the economy and the jobs market improve  labor costs will rise  which could show up in earnings reports down the road  which capped gains on Wall Street as investors priced in such scenarios 
A separate report showed that U S  factory orders fell by a larger than forecast 0 5  in May 
Elsewhere  Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said earlier that the appetite for risk appears to be on the rise  though the country s top economist sees no need to immediately alter today s accommodative monetary policy 
Corporate bond spreads have been falling as have volatility indicators such as the VIX  which may indicate investors are taking on risks despite the possibility of facing losses for which they might not be fully prepared  Yellen said in a speech at the International Monetary Fund 
Still  policy will remain accommodative  as Fed policies aren t a panacea to deal with financial risks

132909,354424,TRV,AIG Q4 Earnings Preview  Profit To Jump On Easy Comparisons,news,"By    Insurance giant American International Group Inc   NYSE AIG  is likely to deliver strong earnings growth in the fourth quarter of 2013 as the company benefited from an easy comparison with a year earlier period weighed down by Superstorm Sandy losses  Lower catastrophe losses in the last three months of 2013 and a stronger equity market also contributed to the bottom line 
AIG is to release earnings results on Thursday after markets close and will host a conference call the following morning at 8 a m  EST 
The New York based insurer is expected to report a profit of  1 01 a share on revenue of  8 56 billion in the fourth quarter of last year  according to the consensus estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters  In the same period a year earlier  AIG reported a loss of  2 68 a share on revenue of  8 61 billion  Excluding one time items  AIG is projected to report EPS of 96 cents  compared with 20 cents per share in the fourth quarter of 2012 
A man walks through a revolving door at an American International Group  AIG  building in New York s financial district September 16  2008  REUTERS Lucas Jackson
For the full year 2013  AIG probably earned  5 77 a share on revenue of  33 95 billion  In 2012  the company reported earnings of  2 04 a share on revenue of  34 87 billion 
AIG is one of the world s largest insurers with a strong presence in global property casualty insurance and U S  life insurance and retirement savings  Over the past few years  AIG  which nearly collapsed in 2008  made significant progress in de risking the company and was able to orchestrate a complete exit in 2012 from U S  government ownership 
AIG President and CEO Robert Benmosche said on a conference call with analysts on Nov  1 that he would stop providing specifics on progress toward the company s so called aspirational goals presented to the market during 2011 s re IPO  While he was concerned about the Street s misinterpreting the goals as guidance  he also doesn t think that reaching all of the goals by 2015 was likely 
Increasing per share earnings  in the mid teens  each year was among the objectives  The insurer also said it planned to generate  25 billion to  30 billion of capital for buybacks  dividends  acquisitions and organic growth  and cut general and administrative costs by  1 billion by the end of 2015 
 As we get closer to 2015  we feel that comments going forward are more like guidance rather than a direction that we re all working towards   Benmosche said on the conference call with analysts   You can t run this business with that degree of accuracy  and you all know that  
Favorable Weather And Lack Of Catastrophes
Heading into the 2013 hurricane season  which runs from June 1 through Nov  30  predictions appeared to indicate an extremely active level  For example  the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration forecast that seven to 11 hurricanes would form 
According to Deutsche Bank analyst Joshua Shanker  in an average year  there would have been eight tropical storms and four hurricanes  one of which would be  major     category 3 or higher   But in fact there were 10 tropical storms  two tropical depressions and two hurricanes  neither of them  major   
 Overall  our reaction to fourth quarter catastrophe activity and favorable weather is anticipating a tailwind for primary insurers  and even more so for reinsurers   Shanker said in a research note   We believe that the weather tailwind will help to drive the underlying margin expansion reported through the first nine months of last year  
Shanker has revised the property and casualty catastrophe load assumptions down from  250 million to  205 million 
Investment Returns
The market fared less favorably for investment performance in the fourth quarter of 2013 as compared with the July September period  with a general market run driven by anticipation of Federal Reserve tapering and an expansion of the risk on mentality 
The S P 500  INDEXSP  INX  decreased 1 6 percent from the open of the quarter through Oct  8  before running up 9 4 percent into the Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Dec  18  Ultimately  the S P 500 closed the quarter up 9 9 percent 
 From a mark to market basis  the incremental equity market gain follows a strong first nine months and will continue to be a tailwind   Shanker said   Additionally  alternative investments should have several periods of improving results given that their correlation to equity markets and being reported on a delay  which should benefit AIG  
Stock Performance
AIG resumed share repurchases in the third quarter of last year with  192 million of buybacks  Barclays insurance analyst Jay Gelb expects an additional  250 million of buybacks in the fourth quarter 
Following the government bailout in 2008  AIG has been trimming operations by divesting non core operations  After more than four years attempting to cement some sort of deal  AIG finally announced in December that it is selling International Lease Finance Corp  to Dutch aircraft leasing company AerCap Holdings N V   NYSE AER  
As part of the deal  AIG is to receive  3 billion in cash and 97 56 million new AerCap shares  The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter and marks the last major disposition of AIG s noncore assets 
AIG s net cash proceeds for this deal are  2 4 billion  and Gelb expects nearly all of this cash to be deployed for accretive share repurchases 
 AIG will also likely sell down its stake in AerCap over time  although there is a nine to 15 month lock up on shares  which should free up additional cash for buybacks   Gelb said in a research note  Based on this structure  Gelb expects AIG share buybacks of  3 billion in 2014 and  7 billion 2015 
As a point of reference  each  1 billion of share buybacks equals approximately an addition of 8 cents per share annually 
However   with expectations very high that 100 percent of ILFC proceeds will be used for buybacks  there seems room for disappointment if management takes a more cautious approach   John Nadel  an analyst at Sterne Agee   Leach Inc  noted 
One of AIG s main competitors in the insurance industry is the Travelers Companies Inc  NYSE TRV   Other competitors in the sector include Hartford Financial Services Group Inc  NYSE HIG   HCC Insurance Holdings  Inc   NYSE HCC  and American Financial Group  NYSE AFG

Zacks Consensus Estimate by a whopping 39   However  the bottom line deteriorated 28 8  year over year The Travelers Companies  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    This year over year decline in earnings can be attributed to higher catastrophe loss due to California wildfires and a benefit in the prior year quarter of  126 million pre tax   82 million after tax  from the settlement of a reinsurance dispute  However  higher net favorable prior year reserve development in the reported quarter partially offset this downside  Also  the bottom line was boosted by share buybacks Full Year

 Net investment income fell 4 1  year over year to  601 million on higher private equity returns  Lower private equity returns and a decrease in fixed income returns due to lower reinvestment rates available in the market  led to this downside Travelers reported an underwriting gain of  266 million  down 54 9  from the year ago quarter  Combined ratio contracted 550 basis points  bps  year over year to 95 5  due to higher underlying combined ratio and wider catastrophe loss  partially offset by higher net favorable prior year reserve development At the end of the fourth quarter  statutory

continued strong retention  an improved renewal premium change and an increase in new business led to this upside  Combined ratio came in at 88 6   remaining flat year over year  Segment income of

133007,354522,TRV,How Will Traders Respond To Dip In U S  Stocks  ,opinion,"Buy the Dip Mentality Put to the Test on Thursday
US futures are coming under a little pressure on Thursday  a day after the Dow closed above 23 000 for the first time ever  in what appears to be some profit taking following an impressive run for stocks 
While there were no major triggers for this morning s decline  the finger is being pointed at the softer Chinese economic data and unrest in Spain  where the government announced its intention to trigger article 155 and suspend Catalonia s autonomy  While neither of these are reason for traders to be bearish stocks right now  it has been pounced upon as reason to take some money off the table and await further opportunities 
The situation in Spain is having a greater impact on the wider European markets  particularly in the IBEX 35 which is down around 1  as investors prepare for more unrest in Catalonia  The euro has been very unresponsive to the developments in Spain so far and the same is true again today  with the single currency trading higher against the dollar  pound and yen  This is clearly seen as being a risk unique to Spain  rather than a problem that could develop elsewhere  although the Italian FTSE MIB has shown some vulnerability to it throughout the process 
It will be interesting to see how US traders respond to the dip at the open  Sentiment has been extremely positive recently  despite the significant amount of political and geopolitical risk lingering beneath the surface  The global growth story is giving people great confidence that the rally has legs to it and earnings for the third quarter of likely to support that 
Softer Chinese Data Partially Blamed For Profit Taking
The Chinese economic data released overnight was broadly in line with expectations but did highlight the fact that the economy is slowing a little in the second half of the year  This was widely expected though as the government has reined in spending and focused more on cooling the housing market and reforms  We can expect more of the same in the fourth quarter although as we saw in the third  the improved global economic environment is likely to support the Chinese economy through this transition 
Chinese data is widely viewed as a barometer of global economic activity with the country being the world s largest trading nation  Trade data has been very strong this year  both exports and imports   particularly the latter   which is a very encouraging sign for the global outlook  As long as this continues  the economy will be less reliant on investment driven growth  enabling the country to focus on a more sustainable model 
UK Retail Sales Miss Should Be Warning to BoE
In the UK  retail sales wrapped up a week of important economic releases and left us with a bitter taste  Perhaps expectations were too high and a larger decline should have been expected following the strong showing in August but instead the data fell well short of forecasts  The numbers further highlighted what we already know  the UK consumer is feeling the strain of negative real wage growth and this will take its toll on spending  While the inflation and jobs data may be seen as justifying a rate hike from the Bank of England  today s data should be a warning to policy makers that the economy is not in a good position to take it 

While the focus today is likely to be how US markets respond to early weakness  we will also get some manufacturing and jobless claims data from the world s largest economy  We ll also get third quarter earnings reports from 20 S P 500 companies including Verizon Communications Inc  NYSE VZ   PayPal Holdings Inc  NASDAQ PYPL  and The Travelers Companies Inc  NYSE TRV   Esther George of the Federal Reserve is also scheduled to appear while Chair Janet Yellen is also believed to be meeting with President Donald Trump  who is understood to be making a decision on her successor in the coming days 
Oil Slips Near Highs
In a similar manner to equity markets  oil is seeing some reprieve on Thursday  likely driven by some profit taking as it nears recent highs  A number of bullish factors have fed the rally in recent weeks including an improved global demand outlook  supply disruptions in northern Iraq and on reports that the market is gradually returning to balance even as producers discuss extended production cuts 

The inventory data from EIA on Wednesday did weigh on Brent on WTI near their highs  despite reporting an expectations beating draw down for the previous week  something one would typically associate as being bullish  However  with API having reported a larger draw down the day before  it s likely that expectations were raised meaning this actually fell a little short ",2017-10-19,Craig Erlam,https://www.investing.com/analysis/how-will-traders-respond-to-dip-in-us-stocks-200219787,200219787

133029,354544,TRV,AXIS Capital  AXS  Provides Third Quarter Cat Loss Estimates,opinion,"AXIS Capital Holdings Ltd    NYSE AXS   has recently announced its preliminary catastrophe loss estimate of  578 million  net of tax and estimated recoveries from reinsurance and retrocessional covers including the impact of estimated reinstatement premiums for third quarter 2017  These losses stemmed from Hurricanes Harvey  Irma  Maria and the Mexican tremors 
While the insurer expects its insurance segment to incur cat losses of  315 million  the reinsurance segment is anticipated to incur  302 million in losses 
These estimates are inclusive of the loss expectations from Novae Group plc  acquired by the company on Oct 2  2017  Axis Capital has announced Novae s expected catastrophe loss estimates of  60 million  net of estimated recoveries from reinsurance and are inclusive of the impact of estimated reinstatement premiums 
Being a property and casualty insurer  AXIS Capital is highly exposed to losses resulting from natural disasters  man made catastrophes and other catastrophic events  Underwriting results have thus been affected for years now  For the first half of 2017  AXIS Capital incurred  76 million in catastrophe loss  narrower than the year ago loss of  63 million  Underwriting income deteriorated 33  with 260 basis points contracting in its combined ratio 
Exposure to catastrophe events has always been a concern for the company because of the uncertainty of their occurrences as well as the magnitude of their impact   The company maintains comprehensive catastrophe reinsurance coverage for its insurance segment  comprising facultative reinsurance  property per risk treaty reinsurance and property catastrophe treaty reinsurance  However  irrespective of the techniques deployed by the company to ease off catastrophes  exposure to weather related calamities makes its earnings volatile 
Other insurers too have come up with their loss estimates  The Navigators Group  Inc    NASDAQ NAVG   estimates to incur catastrophe loss of  50  70 million pre tax   33  45 million after tax  in the third quarter  XL Group Ltd    NYSE XL   estimates catastrophe losses of  1 48 billion pre tax or  1 35 billion post tax  The Travelers Companies  Inc    NYSE TRV   predicts pre tax catastrophe loss from Harvey between  375 million and  750 million or  245 million and  490 million after tax

133181,354696,TRV,Is Travelers Companies A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process Let s put The Travelers Companies  Inc    NYSE TRV   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Travelers Companies has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 12 70  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 20 63  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Travelers Companies current PE ratio above its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified Insurance   Property and Casualty sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 21 48  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Travelers Companies has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 13 90  which is tad higher than the current level  So it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near term P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Travelers Companies has a P S ratio of about 1 28  This is significantly lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 20 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Travelers Companies currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  A   putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Travelers Companies a solid choice for value investorsWhat About the Stock Overall Though Travelers Companies might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  C  and a Momentum score of  F   This gives TRV a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  B    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been unimpressive  The current quarter has seen six estimates go lower in the past sixty days compared  while the full year estimate has seen one up and seven down in the same time period This has had a significant impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate has decreased by 2 8  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched lower by 1   The stock has a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below The Travelers Companies  Inc  Price and Consensus    Bottom LineTravelers Companies is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  among Bottom

133237,354752,TRV,Is Travelers A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put The Travelers Companies  Inc    NYSE TRV   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Travelers has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 12 18  you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 19 99  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Traveler s current PE ratio above its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified Insurance   Property and Casualty sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 20 45  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Traveler has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 13 29  which is tad higher than the current level  So it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near future P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Traveler has a P S ratio of about 1 23  This is significantly lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 20 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years As we can see  the stock is trading at its median value for the time period from a P S metric  This does not provide us with a conclusive direction as to the relative valuation of the stock in comparison to its historical trend Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Traveler currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  A   putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Traveler a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 7 48  which is much lower than the industry average of 9 40  Clearly  TRV is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Traveler might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  C  and a Momentum score of  D   This gives TRV a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  B    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been unfavorable  The current quarter has seen five estimates go lower in the past sixty days  while the full year estimate has seen nine down in the same time period This has had a significant impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate decreased 0 9  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has declined 3 7   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below The Travelers Companies  Inc  Price and Consensus

133331,354846,TRV,Book Review  The Snowball Effect,opinion,"In The Snowball Effect Timothy J  McIntosh  the founder and CIO of SIPCO Investment Management Company  makes the case for investing in dividend paying stocks  His argument is that  time is the best ally of the long term  buy and hold income investor  The initial results are slow to come about and not that impressive  but in due time  compounding dividends and interest end up snowballing into mindboggling returns  even during periods of market stagnation  
McIntosh points to four long term secular bear markets in the Dow between 1906 and 2015  1906 1924  1929 1954  1966 1982  and 2000 2011  During these four periods  almost 70  of the 110 year range  stock prices barely budged  They saw annualized price returns of  0 24   0 11   0 21   and 0 32   With dividends reinvested  however  the annualized returns during these four periods were 6 19   5 53   4 82   and 2 78    The conclusion  The only reliable way to make positive returns during secular bear market periods is to invest in dividend paying stocks like those in the Dow  
McIntosh also investigates small cap stocks  bonds  and covered calls as income producing investments  But the primary focus of the book is large cap dividend companies  Although the author recommends some corporate bond ETFs and micro cap dividend stocks  the bulk of the book is taken up with a detailed description of  the top 100  dividend paying companies  IBM  NYSE IBM  leads the pack  Rounding out the top ten are Wal Mart  NYSE WMT   McDonald s  NYSE MCD   Nestle  SIX NESN   Lockheed Martin  NYSE LMT   Chevron  NYSE CVX   Verizon  NYSE VZ   Cisco  NASDAQ CSCO   Occidental Petroleum  NYSE OXY  and Travelers  NYSE TRV   In each case the author provides values and rankings for dividend yield  dividend growth  trailing P E  S P financial rating  and beta and has a table for the past 11 years showing the company s yearly dividend  dividend growth  and average dividend yield 
Will investments that generate income continue to be the key to earning consistent returns  as they were for the last 110 years  The problem is that the income component from both stocks and bonds is currently near cycle lows  Between 1906 and 1990 Dow stocks provided an average dividend yield of over 4   No longer  McIntosh expects the dividend contribution to total return over the next decade to be closer to 2    This is a direct result of companies giving preference to stock buybacks and reinvesting their profits in capital expenditures  
Hence the sample portfolio of 100 especially attractive dividend paying stocks  McIntosh put together a  100 000 portfolio and projected the dividends and interest it would return for each year between 2016 and 2020  In 2016 the total income would be about  3650  in 2020  about  6475  Continuing this projection further into the future  McIntosh anticipates a total income of  14 350 by 2025  The upshot is that  although the prices of all the stocks and the DVY ETF held in the portfolio stagnated from 2016 through 2025  the portfolio s value continued to grow the original investment   100 001 20  to  163 498 85 by the end of 2025 a 4 99 percent annual total return   That s some decent snowballing ",2016-10-03,Brenda Jubin,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/mcintosh,-the-snowball-effect-200156667",200156667

133428,354943,TRV,5 Stocks Backed By Dividend Growth For Solid Returns,opinion,"When the markets are choppy with rampant global growth concerns  investors generally look for both income and growth in their portfolios  This can easily be achieved by honing in on stocks that not only pay dividends but also consistently increase their payout  
Dividend Growth  A Better Strategy
Dividend growth stocks form a healthy portfolio with more scope for capital appreciation as opposed to those that pays high yields  This is because stocks that have a history of enhancing shareholder returns through consistent dividend hikes immunize an investor s portfolio from large swings in stock prices during turbulent times 
Simultaneously  these offer outsized payouts or sizable yields on a regular basis irrespective of the market direction  These stocks are often backed by a sustainable business model  a long track of profitability  rising cash flows  good liquidity  a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics  All these superior fundamentals make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term 
However  the long history of outperformance by dividend growth stocks compared to the broad stock market or any other dividend paying stock does not necessarily mean that they have the highest yields 
Here are the screening parameters that could result in a winning dividend growth portfolio 
5 Year Historical Dividend Growth greater than zero  This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history 
Most Recent Payout Ratio less than M Industry  This is the measure of dividend payments as a percentage of earnings  A relatively low payout ratio indicates the company s ability to increase dividend in the future even in tough times  
5 Year Historical Sales Growth greater than zero  This represents stocks with a strong record of growing revenue 
5 Year Historical EPS Growth greater than zero  This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history 
Next 3 5 Year EPS Growth Rate greater than zero  This represents the rate at which a company s earnings are expected to grow  Improving earnings should help companies sustain dividend payments 
Price Cash Flow less than M Industry  A ratio less than M industry indicates that the stock is undervalued in that industry and that an investor needs to pay less for a better cash flow generated by the company 
52 Week Price Change greater than S P 500  Median   This ensures that the stock appreciated more than the S P 500 over the past one year 
Zacks Rank Less than 3  Stocks having a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  and 3  Hold  generally perform better than their peers in all types of market environment 
VGM Style Score of B or better This is simply a weighted combination of Value  Growth and Momentum  This when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or  2 offers the best upside potential 
Market Capitalization greater than  2 billion  We have eliminated small caps stocks to ensure better flexibility and tradability 
Here are five of the eight stocks that fit the bill 
Tyson Foods Inc  NYSE TSN     
The Travelers Companies Inc  NYSE TRV     
Southwest Gas Corporation   
Lexington Realty Trust   
Unum Group  NYSE UNM

133451,354966,TRV,Rounding Top Candlestick Pattern,opinion,"How to Identify Support Levels
The rounding top candlestick Pattern used to be a rare topping pattern  however in the last few years this type of top is the most commonly missed topping formation It goes unnoticed until there is a sudden downside run  often on High Frequency Trader HFT volume surge with a gap down or huge point run down 

The reason most technical traders miss the Rounding Top Candlestick Pattern  is because it starts out as an apparent sideways pattern which slowly bends over into a rounding shape that is harder to recognize early on  At times this candlestick pattern will appear to be valid runs luring the unaware Swing trader into the range  only to whipsaw the trade  Many times the highs of the Trading Range as it rounds will have one higher high that is perceived by technical traders as a breakout pattern  but it fails to sustain and the stock then quickly succumbs to downside pressure 
At this time many stocks in the Dow 30 and S P500 have started a Rounding Top Candlestick Pattern developing a bending trend  or the top is completed and the stock is trending down 
Support levels for determining where a stock will bounce up during selling short after the rounding top is often a challenge for technical traders as the sideways pattern is not clearly defined due to the bending shape of the rounding top 
It is imperative to identify all bounce levels for selling short as these areas are where the uninformed  buy on the dip  investors enter  and many professionals anticipate the buy on the dippers and actually initiate the bounce with buy to covers 
The chart example below of The Travelers The Travelers Companies  NYSE TRV  developed a Rounding Top Candlestick Patternas Dark Pools quiet rotation started  after a vertical Angle of Ascent  that was unsustainable 

The stock briefly shifted sideways then each time smaller lot buyers moved in  the rotation selling by the Dark Pools began the bending of the trend  Rather than clearly higher peaks and valleys  the stock was unable to make definitive higher highs and higher lows 
 Buy on the dip  investors often are buying at lows of prior retracements and or at minor support levels  This is the snag for most technical traders who assume the weaker support is not a bounce risk factor 
The bounce areas on a rounding top are often weak support levels as the  buy on the dip  strategies are based on fundamental support rather than technical support for the stock 
Rounding shapes also will appear on large lot versus smaller lot indicators  which at times are easier to see 
Rounding Top Candlestick Patterntops are far more common nowadays than in prior decades  The recent changes to the order types  Alternative Trading System ATS venues  algorithms for Dark Pool buying  and selling off the exchanges are the primary causes of this change to common topping patterns

133452,354967,TRV,Stocks To Hold Through A Bear Market,opinion,"We ve previously shown that companies with consistently high returns on invested capital  ROIC  are stocks that are able to withstand market downturns  especially bear markets like the market crash of 2008  With 2016 providing many investors angst and concern that a bear market or market crash may be just beyond the corner  it s important to focus on companies with strong fundamentals 
It s time to look beyond technical price movements  earnings estimates  or analyst opinions  The reconciliation between cash flows and valuations has arrived  The market is beginning to distinguish between those companies that earn a quality ROIC and those that do not  Figure 1 identifies four companies with strong ROICs that we believe investors can turn to in a turbulent market 
Add in an impressive dividend yield and these stocks could be the difference between a portfolio that outperforms and one that doesn t 

Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings
 Oracle  N ORCL   ORCL   35 share   Very Attractive rating 
Our appreciation for Oracle as a business dates back to April 2013  when we first highlighted its merits as a value investment  While investors have become increasingly short term focused  on all things cloud and in general   they fail to recognize the quality business Oracle has built 
Over the past 17 years  Oracle has grown after tax profit  NOPAT  by an impressive 18  compounded annually  Throughout this time  the lowest return on invested capital  ROIC  Oracle earned came in 2009  but was still 22   Oracle currently earns a top quintile ROIC of 23   Oracle s lead in database software allowed it to build a cash generating business  one that has generated nearly  41 billion in free cash flow over the past five years  Such large cash resources allow Oracle to take its time transitioning to cloud services and ensure the company  gets it right   which is a luxury smaller competitors don t possess 
Best of all  at its current price of  35 share  Oracle has a price to economic book value  PEBV  ratio of 0 9  This ratio means that the market expects Oracle s profits to decline by 10  over the life of the corporation  As it stands  the current no growth value  or economic book value of ORCL is  38 share  If Oracle can grow NOPAT by just 5  compounded annually for the next decade  well below its historical NOPAT growth rate  the stock is worth  57 share today   a 63  upside  Add in the nearly 2  dividend yield paid by Oracle  and our bull case only becomes more compelling  An undervalued stock  quality cash generation and return on cash  and a positive dividend yield make ORCL a stock to buy and hold during all market environments 
American Express  N AXP   AXP    53 share   Very Attractive rating 
We made American Express our stock pick of the week in January 2015 and still believe AXP has great investment prospects moving forward  While investors will tout concerns about American Express losing its Costco  O COST  deal  these concerns are shortsighted and ignore the long track record of American Express 
Since 1998  American Express has grown NOPAT by 6  compounded annually  In this time  the company has earned a double digit ROIC in all but two years  2001 and 2010  still 6  and 8  respectively   American Express currently earns a top quintile ROIC of 22   Just like the other stocks on this list  American Express has generated over  14 9 billion in free cash flow over the past five years and currently earns a 6  free cash flow yield 
Despite the strong fundamentals at AXP  the stock is down 40  over the past two years  Such a drastic price decline has created an excellent buying opportunity  At its current price of  53 share  American Express has a PEBV ratio of 0 8  This ratio means the market expects American Express  NOPAT to permanently decline by 20   However  if American Express can continue to grow NOPAT by 6  compounded annually over the next decade  the stock is worth  91 share   a 72  upside  American Express  2 2  dividend yield  which was paid throughout the last market crash  is just an added bonus to an already great company and stock 
 The Travelers Companies  N TRV  TRV    108 share   Very Attractive Rating 
We first highlighted Traveler s Companies in November 2010 and then again in November 2014  Since that initial report  TRV is up 94  while the S P 500 is up only 58   This outperformance doesn t mean TRV is out of room to run  In fact  the stock is the most undervalued in Figure 1 
Since 2004  Traveler s Companies has grown NOPAT by 12  compounded annually  Traveler s has consistently earned a double digit ROIC  which currently stands at 12   Similar to Oracle  Traveler s has built an extremely profitable business and has generated  14 9 billion in free cash flow over the last five years  Better yet  Traveler s earns a 13  free cash flow yield  Despite the excellent fundamentals and the broad reach of offerings  TRV is significantly undervalued 
At its current price of  108 share  Traveler s has a PEBV ratio of 0 6  This ratio means that the market expects Traveler s profits to permanently decline by an astounding 40   This expectation seems beyond pessimistic given Traveler s profitable history  even in light of the current market environment  If Traveler s can grow NOPAT by just 3  compounded annually for the next decade  the stock is worth  195 share today   an 81  upside  Add in Traveler s 2 3  dividend yield  which continued to be paid during 2008   and its clear that TRV is worth a look 
 Wal Mart  N WMT   WMT    66 share   Attractive rating 
We first recommended investors buy Wal Mart s stock as far back as 2011  Our stance on the stock has not changed  However  Wal Mart has become a company that market pundits and talking heads love to bash  When you look through this noise  you find that Wal Mart is an extremely well run company that continues to exploit its strengths across the entire retail industry 
Since 1998  Wal Mart has grown NOPAT by 9  compounded annually  Over this time  the company has earned a double digit ROIC in each year and currently earns an 11  ROIC  Best of all  Wal Mart business has become a cash machine  generating  57 billion in free cash flow over the past five years alone 
Despite the impressive fundamentals  at its current price of  66 share  Wal Mart has a PEBV ratio of 0 8  This ratio means that the market expects WMT s profits to permanently decline by 20   This expectation seems out of tune with reality given Wal Mart s nearly two decades of profit growth 
If WMT can grow NOPAT by just 2  compounded annually for the next decade  the stock is worth  104 share today   a 58  upside  Add in Wal Mart s 2 9  dividend yield and it s easy to see why WMT is a stock worth holding

133470,354985,TRV,Stock Buybacks Vs  Dividends Vs  Reinvestment,opinion,This should be short  Let me start with some facts  1  Buybacks are preferred on a taxation basis to dividends  2  But buybacks are especially good when the stock is trading below its franchise value  and especially bad the further above franchise value the stock is trading  3  Using slack capital to improve operations  or do little tuck in acquisitions is probably best of all  Organic growth is usually the best growth  and small acquisitions can facilitate that  Small acquisitions are usually not expensive  Be wary of acquisitions to increase scale  they don t work so well  4  Paying a dividend makes management teams more cognizant of the cost of equity capital  which makes them more effective  5  In the reinsurance business in Bermuda  companies with slack capital tend to buy back shares below 1 3x book value  and issue special dividends if they are above that level Franchise value is management s best estimate of the value per share of the company s equity  If a management team does not have a firm handle on the value of the company  it has no business buying back stock  Stock should never be bought back over franchise value  If you want to reward shareholders  then issue a special dividend I am reminded of how in 2000 the CFO of The St  Paul cleverly bought back shares in the 20s  wisely bought back shares in the 30s  stupidly bought back shares in the 40s  and foolishly bought back shares in the 50s  He was a Johnny One Note  except that he impaired the balance sheet so badly that he became the one of the main causes of why The St  Paul sold out to The Travelers  TRV   Price matters with buybacks The reinsurance industry is a good example  because well run reinsurers are simple companies  The book of business is worth book value  The reserves are conservative  which is worth  0 1x book value or so  Future underwriting profits are worth  0 2x book value of so So the reinsurers have their standard   the companies are worth around 1 3x book value  That gives them a discipline for capital   buying back at under 1 3x book  and issuing special dividends above that It is my opinion that most buybacks are a waste  even with the tax advantages  given that the buybacks occur at prices over franchise value  sometimes significantly over  It s also my opinion that a 2  dividend makes management teams think harder about their shareholders  which is a good thing If you get to talk to a management team doing buybacks  ask them if they have a model for what their stock should be worth  If they don t have one  tell them they should not be doing buybacks  unless they are buying back the stock cheaply  Above franchise value  buybacks are a value destroyer ,2013-03-28,David Merkel,https://www.investing.com/analysis/stock-buybacks-vs.-dividends-vs.-reinvestment-160831,160831
