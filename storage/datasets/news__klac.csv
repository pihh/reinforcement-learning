1325,222840,KLAC,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  QUALCOMM  Ichor  Applied Materials  KLA Tencor And MACOM,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL  January 2  2019   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  QUALCOMM Inc    NASDAQ QCOM    Ichor Holdings Ltd    NASDAQ ICHR    Applied Materials Inc    NASDAQ AMAT    KLA Tencor Corp    NASDAQ KLAC   and MACOM Technology Solutions Holdings Inc    NASDAQ MTSI   Here are highlights from Tuesday s Analyst Blog 5 Stocks to Tap Likely Phase One Trade Deal in JanuaryOne of the main reasons for a terrific Wall Street turnaround from the 2018 mayhem is continued flow of positive news on the trade conflict between the United States and China  Trade related issues were mainly behind the stock market rout in the fourth quarter of 2018  The lingering trade tussle is finally likely to be heading for an interim solution in January The possibility of the signing of the phase one trade deal between the United States and China in early January significantly boosted investors  sentiment in December  This is a major step toward resolving a nearly two year long trade dispute between the two largest trading countries of the world  This trade dispute and subsequent tariff war not only affected the economies of the United States and China but also slowed global economic growth Possible Phase One Deal in Early JanuaryOn Dec 13  the United States and China declared that they have reached a phase one trade deal likely to be signed by the two presidents in the first half of January U S  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said the deal will address intellectual property disputes along with strong enforcement provisions and financial services and currency issues in addition to tariff rollback and higher agricultural purchase  Notably  China has reportedly agreed to substantially raise its agricultural imports from the United States to  40 billion On Dec 23  The Wall Street Journal reported that China s cabinet has agreed to lower tariffs for all trading partners on more than 859 types of products including pharmaceuticals  frozen pork and some high tech components to below the rates that the most favored nations enjoy National Security Concerns Dominate Trump s DecisionThe Trump administration is gravely concerned about China s drive to unseat the United States as the primary developer and supplier in the fields of high tech sophisticated products  The implementation of tariffs stems from the Trump administration s concern that China is leaving the intellectual property of the American companies vulnerable to theft Several news agencies reported that China has made unprecedented proposals on a range of issues including the protection of U S  intellectual properties to resolve the trade disputes  The Asian economic giant has acknowledged that the United States has legitimate and genuine concerns about IP theft  forced technology transfer and cyber hacking by Chinese companies Technology Sector to Benefit MostChina is the largest trading partner of the United States  A strong economy in China  the largest market for high tech products  will give U S  technology companies a solid boost  Moreover  China plays the role of a low cost supplier of intermediary products and other inputs to high tech U S  industries An end to the U S  China trade spat is likely to restore Chinese and global economic growth  which in turn will create demand for high tech U S  products  Likewise  the repeal of tariffs on Chinese intermediary goods should raise the profit margin of U S  tech giants  Moreover  clinching an agreement with China  which will strictly protect U S  intellectual properties  will be immensely beneficial for the home grown tech behemoths Out Top PicksAt this stage  it will be lucrative to invest in tech stocks to gain from a possible U S    China trade solution  We have been able to narrow down our search to five stocks  which have popped in 2019 and still hold potential

1330,222845,KLAC,5 Nasdaq Stocks That Helped The Index Score Big In 2019,opinion,Nasdaq hit a fresh record on Dec 17  buoyed by improved investor sentiment on the back of trade optimism and strong economic fundamentals in China  The tech laden index ended at a record 8 823 36 on the day  The phase one trade deal between the United States and China has been welcomed by the investor community after being on tenterhooks for 18 odd months It is also important to mention that while stock markets wobbled for most part of the year due to Brexit and trade war woes  the tech heavy Nasdaq carved out brilliant performances  An outstanding U S  tech sector has been pivotal in shaping up the Nasdaq s rally so far this year Also supporting gains for the index were broad based factors such as strength in the U S  economy  the longest bull market in history and spectacular earnings from the Nasdaq listed companies  Let us therefore have a look at some of the companies that have boosted the index so far in 2019 2019   A Banner Year for NasdaqThe Nasdaq is up around 31  so far this year  Notably  the Nasdaq Composite is up around 60  from the end of 2016  Despite the recent market volatility  stocks have rallied in 2019  The Nasdaq Composite has been the top performer among the three major indices  The tech heavy Nasdaq index got a boost from tech giants  the likes of which include Apple   NASDAQ AAPL    Microsoft   NASDAQ MSFT   and Facebook   NASDAQ FB    each registering staggering gains in the year to date period Over the first three quarters of this year  the tech weighted index rallied more than 20   Historically  this has been viewed as a bullish indicator for the overall markets  Also  since 1990  the Nasdaq has surged over 20  in the first nine months of the year on seven different occasions Longest Bull Run in HistoryThe current phase of stock market rally  which began around March 2009  is the best in history  The Nasdaq alone has total returns of more than 500  from lows the market had hit in 2009 The bull market turned 10 this year in March and Wall Street pundits expect the rally to continue in 2020  on the back of an accommodative monetary policy adopted by the Federal Reserve as well as strong fundamentals of the U S  economy Notably  this is also the longest phase of economic expansion in U S  history  now in its 11th year  The current cycle of economic expansion which began around June 2009 has easily outdone the record 120 month expansion in the period between March 1991 and March 2001  per the National Bureau of Economic Research Economists have attributed this to President Trump s landmark tax cut of 2018 as well as supportive business regulations 5 Best PicksIn this context  we have selected five stocks that have

3806,225321,KLAC,5 Stocks To Tap Likely Phase One Trade Deal In January,opinion,One of the main reasons for a terrific Wall Street turnaround from the 2018 mayhem is continued flow of positive news on the trade conflict between the United States and China  Trade related issues were mainly behind the stock market rout in the fourth quarter of 2018  The lingering trade tussle is finally likely to be heading for an interim solution in January The possibility of the signing of the phase one trade deal between the United States and China in early January significantly boosted investors  sentiment in December  This is a major step toward resolving a nearly two year long trade dispute between the two largest trading countries of the world  This trade dispute and subsequent tariff war not only affected the economies of the United States and China but also slowed global economic growth Possible Phase One Deal in Early JanuaryOn Dec 13  the United States and China declared that they have reached a phase one trade deal likely to be signed by the two presidents in the first half of January U S  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said the deal will address intellectual property disputes along with strong enforcement provisions and financial services and currency issues in addition to tariff rollback and higher agricultural purchase  Notably  China has reportedly agreed to substantially raise its agricultural imports from the United States to  40 billion On Dec 23  The Wall Street Journal reported that China s cabinet has agreed to lower tariffs for all trading partners on more than 859 types of products including pharmaceuticals  frozen pork and some high tech components to below the rates that the most favored nations enjoy National Security Concerns Dominate Trump s DecisionThe Trump administration is gravely concerned about China s drive to unseat the United States as the primary developer and supplier in the fields of high tech sophisticated products  The implementation of tariffs stems from the Trump administration s concern that China is leaving the intellectual property of the American companies vulnerable to theft Several news agencies reported that China has made unprecedented proposals on a range of issues including the protection of U S  intellectual properties to resolve the trade disputes  The Asian economic giant has acknowledged that the United States has legitimate and genuine concerns about IP theft  forced technology transfer and cyber hacking by Chinese companies Technology Sector to Benefit MostChina is the largest trading partner of the United States  A strong economy in China  the largest market for high tech products  will give U S  technology companies a solid boost  Moreover  China plays the role of a low cost supplier of intermediary products and other inputs to high tech U S  industries An end to the U S  China trade spat is likely to restore Chinese and global economic growth  which in turn will create demand for high tech U S  products  Likewise  the repeal of tariffs on Chinese intermediary goods should raise the profit margin of U S  tech giants  Moreover  clinching an agreement with China  which will strictly protect U S  intellectual properties  will be immensely beneficial for the home grown tech behemoths Out Top PicksAt this stage  it will be lucrative to invest in tech stocks to gain from a possible U S    China trade solution  We have been able to narrow down our search to five stocks  which have popped in 2019 and still hold potential to provide further upside  All five stocks

Officer  Rick Wallace  Rick Rick Wallace    Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Kevin  and thank you all for joining us today  I m going to begin with a high level of strategic overview  aimed at what drives KLA s long term business success and differentiation before I cover the near term December quarter of business highlights  Please turn to slide four  KLA continues to benefit from multiple secular growth drivers we discussed in depth at our September 2019 Investor Day  Our performance this quarter and our strategies for diversified growth  technology leadership and operational excellence are playing out according to our plans  By numerous measures  the December 2019 quarter was strong for KLA  Revenue in both GAAP and non GAAP EPS finished at the upper end of the range of guidance  a result of strong demand and exceptional execution  This performance was particularly satisfying  given it was set against the backdrop of still lackluster memory demand As the global leader in process control and supplier of critical process enabling solutions for the data era  KLA remains at the forefront of the most important industry trends and technology inflections in the electronics industry  Our deep collaborative customer relationships  broad IP portfolio and differentiated solutions that address our customers  most complex challenges are the essential ingredients and the recipe that sustains our market leadership  Our business also continues to benefit from increasing complexity in advanced semiconductor device design and manufacturing processes as well as mega trends driving demand across multiple product generations and in numerous key industries  Please turn to slide five  Underpinning our success and consistent outperformance is the KLA operating model  Many of you are becoming more familiar with this model  given that we spent a fair amount of time at our Investor Day discussing it  And while it s not new to KLA  we understand talking about it may be  which is why we decided to codify it the way that we did Expect to continue to hear us refer to it as it does the best job of simplifying how we run the company  It also helps reinforce the critical core componencies that we believe can enhance the long term performance and profitability of acquired businesses such as Orbotech  Most importantly  the KLA operating model is critical to align the company on a consistent strategy and execution  heightened accountability and facilitate continuous improvement  while ensuring we always operate with strong financial discipline and rigor  Please turn to slide six  Strategically  we have four objectives that serve as our guide and drive our sustainable high performance culture  I find it s always worth reinforcing objectives when speaking with investors and analysts as they provide a helpful window into our strategy going forward  These four objectives are  market leadership  product differentiation  operational excellence and attracting and developing talent  We run all our businesses and integrate newly acquired companies with a focus on these four key objectives  Today s results point to our alignment and achievement of all four of these  Please turn to slide seven for the December quarter business highlights  Before I cover the business highlights for the quarter  I d like to provide some high level perspective on the current industry environment I ll begin by addressing the coronavirus situation  First and foremost  our primary concern is with the health and well being of all affected by the situation  We are taking the recommended precautions and have implemented appropriate measures within our global business operations  including widening the range of guidance for the March 2020 quarter to reflect the uncertainty we see in the marketplace  Bren will provide further color on this  We are closely monitoring the situation and will update investors as material new developments arise  Nonwithstanding this  hopefully  short term issue  the long term growth opportunity for the semiconductor market remains very compelling  driven by the proliferation of electronics across more diversified end markets  the introduction of new advanced technologies supporting the development and rollout of 5G  growing semiconductor investment in China and continued device and performance innovation to develop superior performance and return on investment  KLA s strong results are primarily driven by our industry leading positions across various markets and the demand momentum that has continued for both technology development and capacity growth in advanced logic nodes The demand to support advanced logic nodes is expected to remain healthy through 2020 and in 2021  driven by accelerating investment in EUV  competitive dynamics and new capacity additions  2020 is setting up to be our fifth consecutive year of year over year growth for KLA with top line growth currently expected to be in the high single to low double digit range  tracking ahead of our long term revenue growth of 7  to 9  that underpins our 2023 target model  In terms of our outlook for the WFE wafer demand environment in 2020  given the recent news of increased capex investment from leading foundry and logic customers and the improving business conditions in memory  we are aligned with the consensus expectations for 2020 to be a growth year for WFE  coming off a stronger than anticipated finish to 2019  Now let me cover some of the product highlights from the quarter  KLA s market leadership is the product of successful execution of our portfolio strategy focused on differentiation to address our customers  most critical challenges We are confident in our product positioning and the validation from strong customer acceptance across our portfolio  We continue to see accelerated growth of our flagship Gen5 optical inspection platform  deployed for both technology development and production monitoring at the advanced nodes  Our customers are now using the Gen5 platform to identify and solve yield limiting issues at the 7 nanometer node and beyond  We re also encouraged by the growing adoption of patterned wafer print check applications to qualify reticles for EUV  Gen5 offers the best solution to make sure EUV mask are defect free and optimized to achieve process window requirements  Boosted in part by this expanded use case  Gen5 shipments nearly tripled in 2019  and adoption is expected to grow in 2020  Also  at our recent Investor Day  we announced our first new e beam inspection platform in multiple years  and we continue to receive very positive feedback from initial customer evaluations  and we re starting to receive purchase orders  KLA s e beam inspection platform works seamlessly with our Gen5 optical inspection platform through built in connectivity  offering customers the best inspection performance combination at the lowest overall cost of ownership  This combination is a unique differentiator in the marketplace today  and we can identify and detect critical yield limiting defects at the most advanced nodes After proving the value of the technology and initial customer evaluations  we delivered the industry s first production ready version of the X ray metrology platform to customers in the December quarter  Introduced initially at our September Investor Day  the AXION platform is a small angle X ray scattering technology for in line metrology applications to monitor the high aspect ratio features in advanced 3D and DRAM device architectures  This platform provides a lower cost of ownership and improve cycle times when compared with existing destructive metrology techniques  We re now focused on establishing new use cases with all leading memory customers  Last  but certainly not least  KLA s service business continues to deliver excellent revenue growth performance  while simultaneously generating strong free cash flow  Semi process control service revenue reached  1 1 billion in 2019 with 70  of this revenue generated from subscription like service contracts  This performance continues to give us high levels of confidence that KLA services can deliver long term revenue growth rates in the range of 9  to 11   Several factors drive growth in our services business  Including increased complexity of our systems  expansion of the installed base and expanded demand at the trailing edge nodes with high fabulization and foundry and logic and signs of improvement in memory  our customers are also looking for opportunities to enhance productivity and extend the life of their installed base As a result  we see robust service contract penetration  and our service business is providing a steady recurring revenue stream for all our businesses  Please turn to slide eight  In summary  the KLA operating model drives our investment thesis  This is accomplished by driving sustained technology leadership with a strong competitive moat  supported by a track record of strong free cash flow generation and capital returns  As we begin the new year with the expectation that the industry will see a resumption of growth in 2020  we are energized by the prospects that lie ahead  KLA continues to execute exceptionally well and deliver healthy relative revenue and earnings growth  Our focus on driving innovation and providing a steady stream of differentiated products and solutions  position KLA to achieve the long term growth targets we established at our 2019 Investor Day  Despite industry headwinds  2019 was a historic year for KLA  showcasing the enduring value created by the successful execution of our strategic objectives As we look ahead  we are confident that we re investing in our future and are well positioned for growth and market leadership building on the momentum we have established in our process control markets and capitalizing on the market expansion opportunities from the Orbotech acquisition  Our Orbotech integration and product synergy programs are firmly on track and progressing well I d like to now turn the call over to Bren for his commentary on the December quarter financial results and our March quarter outlook  Bren Bren Higgins    Chief Financial OfficerThank you  Rick  Please turn to slide 10 for December quarter 2019 financial highlights  This was a strong quarter for KLA with revenue and EPS each coming in at the high end of our guidance ranges  Total revenue for the December quarter was  1 509 billion  which was at the upper end of the range of guidance of  1 435 billion to  1 515 billion  Gross margin for the quarter was 60 8  in the upper end of the guided range for the quarter of 60  to 61   driven by incremental revenue growth and product mix  Operating margins was 34 8   GAAP EPS was  2 40 and non GAAP EPS was  2 66  both of which were also at the upper end of the range of guidance of  2 13 to  2 43 and  2 39 to  2 69  respectively  Cash from operations and free cash flow were both strong and above our internal targets coming in at  388 million and  353 million  respectively  Our financial results this quarter were exceptionally strong all around  and we remain laser focused on our overall execution as well as our integration and synergy plans for Orbotech  During the quarter  we remained consistent and effective in our capital return framework by returning 119  of quarterly free cash flow to investors  Our capital return was accomplished by repurchasing  285 million of common stock and also distributing  135 million in quarterly dividends  We currently have  1 3 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization and plan to continue to execute our repurchases consistently going forward A key pillar of our investment thesis is KLA s long standing commitment to returning cash to shareholders  For calendar  19  KLA returned approximately  1 5 billion or 127  of our free cash flow to shareholders through our dividend and share repurchase programs  Our capital return included more than  1 billion in stock buybacks  Please turn to slide 11 for revenue breakdown by reportable segments and end markets  Revenue for the semi process control segment  which includes the associated service business was healthy at  1 248 billion in the quarter  up 7  sequentially on the back of continued strength in foundry and logic  As Rick mentioned  our initial view of the WFE demand environment for 2020 is for solid growth off of a better than expected finish to 2019  driven by continued strong investment for multiple foundry and logic customers  investment in EUV and expanded memory investment in the year  In addition  continued high levels of demand from native China is expected to contribute to overall industry growth in 2020 As I mentioned  foundry was very strong in Q4 at approximately 52  of semi process control revenue  up from 44  last quarter  Memory was 40  in December  down from 43  last quarter  Logic was 8   versus 13  last quarter and in line with our expectations  I ll turn now to the specialty semiconductor Process segment  As a reminder  SPTS was formerly part of Orbotech and is a leader in PVD and edge process solutions in fast growing specialty semiconductor applications like MEMS  sensors  power and RF devices as well as in advanced packaging markets  Revenue for SPTS was  75 million  up 9  sequentially  While SPTS revenue for 2019 was impacted by global trade issues  we expect 2020 to be a strong year of    to be a year of strong growth  driven by expanding RF demand to support 5G investment and a potential recovery in the automotive electronics market in the second half of the calendar year  On a very encouraging note  SPTS ended the December  19 quarter with record backlog and quarterly bookings  Revenue for the PCB display in component inspection segment was  186 million  up 4  sequentially and in line with expectations This segment includes the former PCB and display businesses of Orbotech and KLA s component inspection business  After a cyclical low  we expect 2020 to be a modest year of growth for PCB  driven by the transition to 5G smartphones  Please turn to slide 12 for a breakdown of revenue by major products and region  The distribution of revenue by major product category in the December quarter was as follows  wafer inspection was 40   Patterning  which includes reticle inspection was 19   Wafer inspection and patterning are part of our semiconductor process control segment  Specialty semiconductor process was 4   PCB  display and component inspection revenue was 9   Service was 24  of revenue in the quarter  Other was 4   In terms of regional split  Taiwan was 30   China was 25   Japan was 13   Korea was 12   the U S  was 11   Europe was 6   and the rest of Asia was 3   Please turn to slide 13 for other income statement highlights  Total operating expenses were  391 million in the quarter  including  220 million of R D expense  Operating expenses were slightly higher than expected in the quarter due to non headcount related engineering and development expenses and modest variable compensation adjustments Operating margin was 60 basis points higher than modeled at 34 8   Other income and expense in the December quarter was  38 million  the effective tax rate was 13 5  in line with our long term tax planning rate of 14   Going forward  based on our expectations for the geographic distribution of profit  you should now use 13  as the long term tax planning rate  Net income was  422 million  and we had just under 159 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding  Please turn to slide 14 for a look at our balance sheet highlights and debt maturities profile  We ended the quarter with  1 7 billion in cash  total debt of  3 4 billion and a flexible and attractive debt maturity profile supported by investment grade ratings from all three agencies  In October  we retired our  250 million  3 375  senior notes due November 2019  We intend to refinance our  500 million senior notes due November 2021 during the March quarter Please turn to slide 15 for a review of free cash flow  KLA has a history of consistent free cash flow generation and high free cash flow conversion  Over the past five years  we have averaged 99  free cash flow conversion and in calendar 2019  it was nearly 90   Our innovation and differentiation in the marketplace are what drives our industry leading gross and operating margins and ultimately  our free cash flow conversion  Please turn to slide 16 for a review of our capital return to investors  KLA continues to execute on its commitment to return capital to shareholders in the form of both dividends and share repurchases  The dividend payout has increased at a CAGR of 15  since inception 13 years ago  Share repurchases have also increased over the years  with the average price paid for repurchase shares being slightly under  70 and with approximately  3 8 billion deployed for repurchases since 2010  The only exception to the company s systematic repurchasing activity was during the periods when it was blacked out due to acquisition proceedings  Please turn to slide 17 for March quarter 2020 guidance  The fluid situation accompanying the coronavirus response is adding complexity to our forecasting process As seen with others  we are operating with key assumptions regarding the resumption of business activities in China  both in Hubei province  in addition to the rest of the country  To date  we do not expect a protracted disruption of our business for calendar year 2020  Policy changes regarding the response could affect our ability to ship and support shipments into China as well as to access key components from our China based supply chain necessary to meet system shipment commitments to our worldwide customer base  In short  this is a situation with limited visibility that could impact our near term results  and we will be prudent in providing you with the best information we have as we proceed through the quarter  As Rick mentioned  the range of guidance has been widened to reflect this quarter s uncertainty in our current estimate of potential disruption  We expect total revenue to be in the range of  1 325 billion to  1 525 billion in the March quarter  This revenue guidance would have approximately been 3  to 5  higher at the midpoint without the adjustments for the coronavirus impact  Foundry is forecasted to be about 60  of semi process control system revenue in the March quarter  depicting the strength we continue to see among our foundry customer base We expect memory to be approximately 28  of system revenue  reflecting continued headwinds we see in the memory market  Logic is expected to be about 12  of semi process control system revenue next quarter  Based on product mix expectations for the March quarter  we forecast gross margin to be in the range of 59 5  to 61 5   Operating expenses will be in the range of  380 million to  385 million  down sequentially from December as prototype material expenses normalized to run rate  Given expected revenue levels for 2020  new product development investments of multiple product technologies to support the industry s transition to high volume production of EUV lithography and initiatives to reduce our long term structural cost position  we expect quarterly operating expenses to remain in this range for the remainder of the calendar year  For 2020 operating margin  we are running the company and to perform in line with the  5 5 billion to  6 billion revenue interval of our business model presented at Investor Day back in September We expect other interest expense to be approximately  39 million in the quarter and the effective tax rate to be 13   For earnings  we expect GAAP diluted EPS of  1 79 to  2 57 per share  and non GAAP diluted EPS of  2 04 to  2 82 per share  Our EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 158 million shares  In conclusion  the December quarter results demonstrated strong performance and relative strength for KLA across many areas of our business  With our diversified end markets  continued technology leadership across a broadening product portfolio and operational discipline  KLA is delivering on our mission  strategy and objectives  As we begin the new year  calendar 2020 is shaping up for another year of growth in line with or slightly better than our long term revenue growth rate target of 7  to 9   earnings per share growth of 1 5x the revenue growth rate and demonstrating progress toward our 2023 revenue and non GAAP EPS targets of  7 billion to  7 5 billion and  14 50 to  15 50 per share With that  I ll now turn the call back over to Kevin to begin with the Q A Kevin M  Kessel    Vice President of Investor RelationsThank you  Bren   Operator Instructions  With that  Charlie  we are ready for the first question Questions and Answers Operator Operator Instructions  Your first question comes from the line of C J  Muse from Evercore  Your line is now open C J  Muse    Evercore    AnalystGood afternoon  Thank you for taking the question  I guess  first question  you talked about 2020 year over year growth of high single to low double digit and based on the other segments  it looks like that implies your semi business growing roughly 9   11   So curious  is that the right math  And then as part of that  what are the puts and takes in terms of process control intensity in 2020  presumably  a year with more memory  which is an obvious negative  However  you have your new x ray tool and growing share at demand as well as Gen5 and exposure to EUV  So can you kind of walk us through the puts and takes around your exposures to WFE  both good and bad in 2020 Bren Higgins    Chief Financial OfficerYes  Sure  CJ  it s Bren  and I ll go first here  just in terms of just context on the numbers  I mean  certainly  2019 finished much more    much stronger than what we expected  Which was good to see  And as we look at 2020  if you go back to last earnings versus where we are today  given what we ve seen in the foundry logic base  we d expect to see more growth in the space this year than what we thought before  And I don t think that our views on the memory environment have changed all that much  that we ll see flash memory recover  we would expect to see that through the year And we re not relying much on DRAM in our overall forecast in terms of incremental WFE investment  So when you take all those puts and takes and then say  OK  where is the growth coming from  So certainly  our logic foundry process control intensity is good  Some of the growth coming from memory is lower process control intensity  but to your point  we do have new product introductions that we believe will help drive some of that  So our assumption is that we think from a process control intensity perspective  it stays relatively flat year over year  And with new product introduction  we would expect to see some modest share improvement as well  So that s pretty much how we see things at this point C J  Muse    Evercore    AnalystVery helpful  And as my follow up  how should we think about seasonal trends for your PCB business  I imagine that  that s much more of a second half apple weighted kind of ramp  So is there any sort of    kind of range  first half  second half kind of mix there Bren Higgins    Chief Financial OfficerI would expect PCB to be stronger in the second half  It tends to be more mobile centric  So to your point  we would expect to see stronger revenue profile in the second half for PCB  Would expect this year to be  as Rick had indicated  a year of modest growth in the space and keep in mind  in that part of the business  we also have    big chunk of it is also service  where it s over 90  of its contract base  So there s a high service utilization on those tools and stickiness to the investment as well C J  Muse    Evercore    AnalystThank you very much Bren Higgins    Chief Financial OfficerThanks  C J OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JP Morgan  Your line is now open Harlan Sur    JP Morgan    AnalystGood afternoon guys  Good job on the quarterly execution and strong start to 2020  Great services showing on process control in calendar year  19  According to my calculations  your services business was up about 11  in the upper end of your long term target of 9  to 11   On your full year view of 10  revenue growth for the business here in calendar  20  based on your installed base growth in 2019  how do you see your process control services business growing in calendar  20 Bren Higgins    Chief Financial OfficerSo I think when you look at the comparison to the year  I mean  certainly  we ve got some incremental growth from the inclusion of the Orbotech business in  19 that drove the growth rate to the to the upper end of the range  So on the process control side  given the weakness in memory  particularly in the first half of the year  it did push us down toward slightly below the 9  to 11  range in terms of year over year growth for the process control part of the business  As we look at  20  though  is we ve seen utilizations tighten pretty significantly both in memory  but also in the logic space over the course of the year We would expect the service business to perform in line with its long term growth rate expectation  which is  yes  the 9  to 11   So we feel pretty good about what s going on there  Certainly  the contract penetration is high  as Rick had indicated  I think with rising utilization  with new products  given demand for customer    from customers as they ramp new facilities  we tend to see strong service performance there  And I would expect to see that play out in 2020  So I d expect more growth next year or in 2020 versus  19 Harlan Sur    JP Morgan    AnalystYes  I appreciate the insights there  And a big part of the growth for the team has been that the team has been driving is really due to new product cycles  right  Your Gen5  Teron for EUV as an example  to that end  can you guys just give us an update on some of your next generation programs  like X ray for stack profiling  e beam  both for wafer and medical  maybe some rough guidelines on product launch timing and contribution to revenues Rick Wallace    Chief Executive OfficerYes  I ll take part of that  and then Bren can talk about contribution  As we talked about it at the Analyst Day and also in our last earnings call  we have seen progress in some of the new products  We introduced the AXION  and I mentioned that in the prepared remarks  we re seeing POs now for some of the e beam inspection tools that before were under evaluation  So we re pretty much on target in terms of the growth potential that we envisioned when we laid out the 2023 plan  And that starts to become more material in the second half of this calendar year We re very excited about what we ve seen with the CD product because we re    the x ray product we re seeing more use cases we re getting customers to give us really positive feedback  and we see a continued acceleration  Then I d also say that the e beam inspection  combined with the optical tool has been performing as we expected  and we re seeing momentum grow there  So we re on target  We continue to be on the strategic objectives that we laid out for those products to get us to where we believe we need to be to support our 2023 plan  And in terms of impact for this year  it s more second half loaded  And so Bren can talk as to a little bit of sizing it Bren Higgins    Chief Financial OfficerYes  To Rick s point  I mean  it is an important part of our strategy here to seed the market with these products and to start to develop use case and to drive value with these offerings with customers  And so initial results are pretty promising  And it s one of the    really one of the factors  as we look at those products  whether it s incremental Gen5 print check applications  which is how customers will qualify reticles in the fab  in EUV  or whether it s e beam  to Rick s point  or x ray metrology  we re really excited about the contributions from those products as we move forward here  So the contribution in  20 will be less than what I would consider sort of a steady state expectation for those business because we re starting to see the market with those products  but we will see revenue  And I would think that it s one of those factors that I believe keeps process control intensity of flat despite the memory growth that we would expect to see in  20 Rick Wallace    Chief Executive OfficerThe one other area you didn t ask about  Harlan  but I ll    just for more perspective  the Gen5 adoption has accelerated throughout the 2019  And now in 2020  we re seeing additional growth  and we re seeing it really being a major product for multiple customers on both advanced but some nodes that we would have thought maybe it was late for insertion  but we re finding some applications  And where it s really gaining some traction is with EUV qualification  And I mentioned that in the prepared remarks  but I think it s really important as EUV fans out  we think is a great opportunity for Gen5 to exceed even some of the potential that we had originally envisioned because it s really the best way to verify the quality of the EUV masks and especially as customers are ramping the number of devices running on EUV  we re seeing a lot of support and interest from our customers for that  So we feel really good about where Gen5 is right now Harlan Sur    JP Morgan    AnalystGreat  Great job on the execution  Thank you Rick Wallace    Chief Executive OfficerThank you Bren Higgins    Chief Financial OfficerThank you OperatorYour next question comes from the line of David Wong from Instinet  Your line is now open David Wong    Instinet    AnalystThanks very much  Can you give us some idea as to what percent of your semi equipment sales are to domestic Chinese makers Bren Higgins    Chief Financial OfficerI would say it s probably between 25  and 30  generally  So to think about the systems piece in 2019  it was about  665 million on our    what was about  3 2 billion of semiconductor shipments or semiconductor revenue David Wong    Instinet    AnalystOkay  great  And the other question I had is when we try to calculate year over year for the March quarter  it s  of course  confused by the closing of Orbotech a year ago  So can you give us some idea of what the midpoint of your guidance implies in terms of organic year over year growth for traditional KLA excluding Orbotech Rick Wallace    Chief Executive OfficerYes  So we would expect    and again  with some range to this  but the midpoint on the semiconductor side would be approximately 1 2    about  1 215 million to  let s say   1 230 million   1 235 million in that ballpark David Wong    Instinet    AnalystOkay  great  Thanks OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS  Your line is now open Timothy Arcuri    UBS    AnalystThanks a lot  So Bren  I m just looking at the second half of 2019  I m just looking at your process control system shipments  And you did 831 in September and you just did 875  and last September  you did 830 and then you did 850 last calendar Q4  So that s up like small single digits year over year  But if I add together Intel and TSMC capex  it s up like more than 30   So it seems like the number ought to be a little higher  I m just wondering if maybe there s some timing effect there  Or how you sort of reconcile those numbers Bren Higgins    Chief Financial OfficerSo Tim  I think when I look at the data on the semiconductor process control part of the business  it looks like revenue was up about 24  half over half in the second half versus the first half of  19 Timothy Arcuri    UBS    AnalystYes  Bren  I guess  I was talking second half of  19 versus second half of  18 Bren Higgins    Chief Financial OfficerSecond half of  19 versus second half of  18 Timothy Arcuri    UBS    AnalystYes  Basically  barely up Bren Higgins    Chief Financial OfficerYes  it looks like it s up a few hundred million Timothy Arcuri    UBS    AnalystAnd I guess the question is  you guys are pretty well exposed to foundry and logic  so why would it be up so little when those guys  capex is up massively  I mean  it s up 30 plus percent Rick Wallace    Chief Executive OfficerWell  Tim  you got to remember that even the activities that we saw at the end of the calendar year  that s revenue that didn t come in at the end of the calendar  And the other part of that was the change in memory during that same time period Timothy Arcuri    UBS    AnalystGot it  Rick  Okay  Okay  So it s a timing issue  Okay Bren Higgins    Chief Financial OfficerYes  Tim  I think it s timing  I mean  look  we    it s not a way I really thought about it  So we can follow up on it  I need to think about those dynamics  I mean  you get different customers  different customer mix  You had the China dynamic  So there are a number of moving parts here that influence the numbers  I mean  if you look at our year over year performance  in a down year for the industry is down  what looks like about 10   we re going to be up modestly  maybe    I think it looks like we were up about 1  or so  So the second half strength driven by strong investment really from the foundry leader  I would say logic  if you look back at the detailed logic was not all that strong for us over the    really over the course of most of  19  So I think that the relative performance is pretty good in  19 versus  18 Rick Wallace    Chief Executive OfficerYes  And one last point  Tim  is there was a change in bare wafer  And we talked about that  that  19 was softer than  18  And so some of the business you would have seen in  18 would have been the wafer  So it was both a mix and timing issue Timothy Arcuri    UBS    AnalystGot it Rick Wallace    Chief Executive OfficerYes  their wafer was down    their wafer was down about 10  year to year  So that was another factor as well Timothy Arcuri    UBS    AnalystOkay  Okay  awesome  Got it  And then  Rick  I think you said in the prepared remarks that obviously  you ve widened the range  but I think you also said something about potential policy changes  What did you    were you referring to export control that could come about  Or were you referring specifically to just the virus and something that might happen around that Rick Wallace    Chief Executive OfficerNo  just nothing about anything other than we re complying with all the    and as you know  rather fluid changes in policy of support for overall China but also Wuhan  in particular  And following that and monitoring that very closely as everyone is right now Timothy Arcuri    UBS    AnalystGot it  Okay  Thanks so much Bren Higgins    Chief Financial OfficerThank you OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar with Cowen and Company  Your line is now open Krish Sankar    Cowen and Company    AnalystYes  hi  thanks for taking my question  Two ones  First one for either Rick or Bren  If I look at your March quarter guidance  it looks like sequentially  foundry is up while memory is down  I m kind of curious how    why is memory down so much if NAND is going to come back  And secondly  in an environment where people think foundry logic capex is front half loaded  should we assume that how your revenues have to trend  Or is it tough to say at this point  Then I have a follow up Bren Higgins    Chief Financial OfficerWell  Krish  on the memory recovery  it s more of a second half driven dynamic  I mean  the activity out there is pretty limited right now to one customer  So not a lot of investment  And so I wouldn t expect to see foundry recovery    or I m sorry  memory until we move into the second half of the year Krish Sankar    Cowen and Company    AnalystGot it  Got it  And then just as a follow up  If the memory recovery is going to be back half loaded and foundry logic is front half loaded  how does it impact your gross margin profile Bren Higgins    Chief Financial OfficerThere s no changes in gross margin  Our gross margin across all our customer segments is generally the same  Now it varies across different product types  But customer segments don t drive  influence our gross margin unless the product mix dramatically changes  But product to product is the same margin generally across all segments Krish Sankar    Cowen and Company    AnalystOkay  Thanks  Bren  Thanks  Rick OperatorYour next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse  Your line is now open John Pitzer    Credit Suisse    AnalystYeah  Good afternoon guys  Thanks for letting me ask the question  Bren in your prepared comments  you said that the midpoint of the March quarter rev guidance would have been 3  to 5  higher if not for the cushion you guys are baking in for the uncertainty around the coronavirus  I m just kind of curious  is that true of the EPS as well  Or are you not curtailing spending to sort of that lower number  And so EPS would actually be up more  kind of  at a higher revenue midpoint Bren Higgins    Chief Financial OfficerYes  the assumption is really about revenue  It s not about spending  Our spending plans are based on product development requirements and infrastructure requirements across the company over a broader view of the future  So in any given quarter in a situation like this  we would continue to spend according to our plan  I also said the expectations that I don t think it effects our overall planned for 2020  So I would think that  that business just shifts into the first part of    or later on in the next quarter or two as we progress through the year  Obviously  this is a fluid situation and things can change  but based on how we see it today  that s how we re thinking about it So the 3  to 5  is  basically  just comes off the top of same expectations for spending  And of course  there s a gross margin impact to that  which is reflected in the guidance  So we widened the range because there s some fluidity around not just what happens in who they province  but even broader China and how that restarts  not just with customers  but suppliers  So we tried to bake in the broader range to accommodate that potential risk  but that s how we re thinking about it right now John Pitzer    Credit Suisse    AnalystThat s helpful  And then as my follow on  Rick  it s always helpful when you give kind of your perspective at the industry  I m going to put you on the spot a little bit  Your peer last week was a little bit more explicit on a WFE forecast for calendar year  20  Wondering if you endorse that forecast  And if you don t want to get too specific with numbers  I m just kind of curious how you think about the profile of WFE  There s a lot of concern that maybe it s front half weighted versus second half weighted  How do you kind of see the half on half both for WFE in your business this year Rick Wallace    Chief Executive OfficerYes  Thanks a lot  John  I think that    what I can say is the end of calendar year  there was more momentum maybe than we would have anticipated from a lot of the activity with our logic and foundry  In fact  as you know  there s very strong and very encouraging  The number of design starts and so the foundry really shapes up to be quite strong  and it s more than just one customer in advanced nodes  So we feel really good about foundry logic  and we re getting the right signals from our customers about the strength there  Memory did strengthen in terms of our view  And as Bren just indicated  it s earlier for us to size what second half And as you know  we don t give annual guidance  But I would say there is certainly momentum for the memory investment  And even if you look at the way  19 ended and you ve talked about this in the past  if this is a downturn  it s a pretty good downturn because  19 ended pretty strong and the momentum feels pretty good  So if you take out any exogenous factors  like some of the things we re dealing with in terms of the coronavirus things look pretty good for 2020  and we re pretty excited  It s really hard for us to size it  And for us  we definitely feel momentum  and we re building our capacity to be able to support the increased demand  and we have some product areas where we re out of supply for what customers want  So we re having to add capability to support that  So I don t want to give a number  but we definitely feel more positive about  20 than we did probably four or five months ago  especially in light of how strong  19 ended Bren Higgins    Chief Financial OfficerYes  John  And the only other thing I ll add to that is  to Rick s point  I mean  look  strength and timing of memory recovery is probably the biggest wildcard  And so certainly  people have different views on that  And depending on which markets that you tend to do better in  you may have a different view of that  So I think that s one of the wildcards  The second one is  how much growth do we see in China  how robust is the growth  We do expect China to grow year over year in terms of WFE investment  I think the question right now or maybe one of the wild cards  if you will  is how much of that is memory in terms of the next phase of investment on the memory side So certainly  there are a number of projects on the foundry logic side  they re investing  And overall  but it s more foundry logic heavy  So I think the memory  sort of question in China is probably another factor that influences that forecast  But I do think that where we line up is probably in this high single  low double digit kind of range  plus or minus  and we ll see how it plays through as we move through the year  given the flexibility we believe we have in the factory  if it turns out that it s stronger than that  we should be able to support that demand  So we ll be    we are well positioned for that  if that materializes that way John Pitzer    Credit Suisse    AnalystPerfect  Very helpful  Thanks guys OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities  Your line is now open Vivek Arya    Bank of America Securities    AnalystThanks for taking my questions  I get that you re taking the conservative view to Q1  When I look at your peers and others in the semiconductor industry  they have chosen not to adopt that conservatism or assume that even if there is a pause in China  that there is sufficient time to recover from it  So let s assume Q1 plays out for you the way you are guiding right now  Do you think there is an above seasonal catch up in the following quarter  Or it s too early to make that determination  Like is there a demand destruction here  Or do you think that there is a chance for a catch up here Bren Higgins    Chief Financial OfficerYes  Vivek  So when I look at it  I think that business just shifts  Part of it is process control  part of it is    it s really across our broader business  There s an impact to the specialty semiconductor business in Wuhan  in Hubei province there  an impact to the flat panel business and to process control  So what we re assuming is that area  given it s the epicenter of the coronavirus so far  that it takes a little bit longer for that to recover  and so we re adjusting our outlook to accommodate that Perhaps  we re a little bit later than the others  and so we re adopting a slightly more conservative view  And    but my view is that the 2020 outlook is no different  And so I would expect that business to    as we start to be able to engage there and be able to support those customers that we ll shift that capability in the June quarter and in that time frame Rick Wallace    Chief Executive OfficerYes  And if you want perspective  you just look back at other disruptions in supply in our industry s history just recently and what comes flying to me are floods that we had in Southeast Asia  We had the tsunami and the effect of that  And we ve had fires and fabs  And in every case  it bounced back  So I don t think there    I think if it s a temporary disruption  it comes back  And that s what we re    as we re viewing it right now Vivek Arya    Bank of America Securities    AnalystGot it  Very helpful  And for my follow up  do you see higher process control intensity in memory in this cycle than it has been in the past  And within that  is there a difference between NAND and DRAM process control intensity Rick Wallace    Chief Executive OfficerThere is higher    I think what s interesting is this is a case of having the capability as opposed to the desire  Our customers in    especially in NAND  had a huge desire for more process control capability  we just didn t necessarily have the solution  So that was why the intensity was lower  There was plenty of desire  We have now our products that we ve been working on for years  targeting and supporting some of the challenges in the advanced NAND technology nodes  and we re seeing adoption as a result of those new products  So that s driving our process control intensity  DRAM is benefiting from the fact they re still shrinking  And so you re seeing some use for some of the advanced wafer inspection capabilities to be able to deal with the increased defectivity requirements  So both of those are cases where we re seeing higher intensity and it s brought on mainly by solutions  not so much by need Vivek Arya    Bank of America Securities    AnalystAll right  Thank you OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs  Your line is now open Toshiya Hari    Goldman Sachs    AnalystHi guys  Thanks for taking the question and congrats on a strong year  Just a quick follow up on the coronavirus impact  Have you already identified disruptions to the supply chain  Or have you received changes to    in terms of demand signals from customers  Or is this you guys being proactive and prudent and conservative Rick Wallace    Chief Executive OfficerYes  we re not seeing any change in the customer needs  And in fact  if anything  we re having more conversations with customers to ensure that we can continue to support them  We are modeling supply chain questions  And I think that  that is something that we continue to model  and that s what accounts for the range that we provided and the size of the range  So it s much more about sorting it out  and there s new information every day  I d say in the last couple of days  it s actually been slightly more positive in terms of the ability to navigate  And so we re still working through a lot of those details Bren Higgins    Chief Financial OfficerBut we do have suppliers that haven t been able to get back in  in other parts of China whether it s in Shanghai or in Sojo  that to deliver capability that gets integrated into systems  And it s supply chain that could be dual sourced  but not in a short run  it would take a couple of months to qualify a second supplier  So right now  when those suppliers are able to come back online their people can actually get back into the factory  we would expect to have very little  if any  disruption based on the current plan  Now if it extends out and people can t get back in and these facilities stay closed  then it would have a broader impact  And again  another reason for the wider range Rick Wallace    Chief Executive OfficerAnd maybe the last point  you all know this is the extension of the Chinese New Year means that there s still    we re still sorting through what that means because people have been off  And so as they go back  we re trying to determine exactly how that plays out Toshiya Hari    Goldman Sachs    AnalystGot it  That s very helpful  And then a quick follow up on SPTS  Bren  you talked about exiting the year with record backlog  it looks like you guys are expecting a pretty strong year this year  In addition to RF  I think you talked about a recovery in auto in the second half  But if you can kind of speak to the relative contributions from those two dynamics in the year  that would be helpful Bren Higgins    Chief Financial OfficerYes  I mean  certainly  5G and the increase in RF requirements are going to be a big driver for SPTS both in the infrastructure for 5G  but also in the movability cycle as that starts to play through  Automotive is there s increasing semiconductor content in automotive and automotive had a difficult year in  19  So even some of the stronger customers for SPTS bought very little in  19  So we re comfortable and optimistic about seeing that part of business recover  And I would expect SPTS  if you add the two together  both in terms of what 5G is driving in automotive  you end up with a 10  to 15  kind of growth year for that business  So we re excited about those opportunities  Packaging might provide another tailwind  And I think they re very well positioned in those markets Toshiya Hari    Goldman Sachs    AnalystThanks so much OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo  Your line is now open Joe Quatrochi    Wells Fargo    AnalystYeah  Thanks for taking the question  In the past  you talked about the memory adoption on Gen5 being stronger than expected  So I was hoping maybe you could talk about just your confidence going into what looks to be a memory cycle and the potential incremental growth drivers there versus prior cycles  And then are those net new opportunities  Or are they competitive to put displacements Rick Wallace    Chief Executive OfficerJoe  this is Rick  I ll take the first part and let Bren finish with the hard stuff  So my view is the    we are seeing the adoption  We talked about earlier  over process control adoption  so you just back up and say  the process control intensity in  20 being nominally flat to  19  That s really a function of memory adoption being higher than it s been historically  And that s a function of the new products that we have as well as increased adoption and wafer inspection  We have seen new use cases in terms of what we re seeing  for example  for Gen5 as we expand that capability out  One thing we don t know is when or if EUV is really going to be implemented in any big way in memory  but that creates some upside  But the other thing is the metrology opportunities that we see based on the new products that we ve introduced  drive that intensity up  So there is some displacement in terms of our new tools  displace our prior generation  but the net of it all is process control intensity  improving as we see it in the memory  specifically in the NAND Bren Higgins    Chief Financial OfficerYes  I think to Rick s point  I mean  one of the big things that we saw change in NAND intensity as we went to 3D  was a driver of our unpatterned inspection business to keep tools cleaner because of defectivity challenges as they start to process the stacks  You have increasing flatness requirements  And so if the stacks are rising  flatness becomes more and more important  wafer stress is more important  And so we re    we have capabilities for that  And then certainly  the metrology requirements as you ve gotten into 3D structures have intensified in a meaningful way for us  Then you add in new products  and we feel pretty good about that both with new products for metrology  but also in terms of some of the e beam capability that we re bringing to market To Rick s point  DRAM  with the introduction of EUV into DRAM  even at a single layer or 2  that should drive scaling again and ultimately will enable smaller defects  which tends to drive our inspection business and with the broader portfolio  we feel like we re very well positioned there  So we think there s opportunities for    we have to execute  but we think there s opportunities for us to continue to drive some improvement in process control intensity and memory  It will never look like foundry logic  but at the same time  I think there s incremental opportunity there if we can execute Joe Quatrochi    Wells Fargo    AnalystThat s helpful  And then just as a quick follow up  your expectations for domestic China revenue for 2020  I apologize I ve missed it  is that still flat year over year Rick Wallace    Chief Executive OfficerNo  it s one of the drivers that s changed since last earnings as I would expect to see some growth there  It s more logic foundry heavy  I think the amount of memory investment in China next year is probably one of these wildcards that will influence the WFE level overall for next year  But I would expect to see it grow  and I think it s double digit growth year to year Joe Quatrochi    Wells Fargo    AnalystThank you Bren Higgins    Chief Financial OfficerThank you OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Sidney Ho from Deutsche Bank  You line is now open Sidney Ho    Deutsche Bank    AnalystThanks for taking my question  Just following up to previous questions on the implied memory revenue guide for the March quarter  I understand memory capex recovery is more second half  but it does imply a sharp decline quarter over quarter after three straight quarters of revenue being at a high level  So what was driving that dynamic in the previous three quarters that will be absent until the second half of this year Rick Wallace    Chief Executive OfficerWell  you have multiple customers investing  And right now  when you look at the March quarter  there just isn t a lot of activity on the memory front  You still see customers investing in technology progression  but very little new capacity  particularly in the flash space right now in the March quarter for us  Now we shipped into that business more in the December quarter  So it could be a timing issue between when we see it versus where capacity centric flare might see it  But memory in the March quarter is kind of weak  and I would expect to see it strengthen as we move through the year Sidney Ho    Deutsche Bank    AnalystOkay  That s helpful  Maybe a follow up is    sorry  if this has been asked earlier  but last quarter  you had expected revenue to come down like 5  half over half in the first half of calendar  20  And given calendar Q4 was much stronger  does that change the slope of that and assuming that the coronavirus impact kind of offset itself in the first half of the year  And how should we think about first half versus second half for this year Rick Wallace    Chief Executive OfficerI think it s a relatively flat outlook half to half in the first half of  20  given the assumptions that we have on the coronavirus  and we start to see this work itself and clear itself as we move into the June quarter  So relatively flat for the overall business Sidney Ho    Deutsche Bank    AnalystOkay  great  Thanks OperatorWe have no further questions at this time  I will now turn the

124130,345645,KLAC,What Makes KLA  KLAC  A Strong Momentum Stock  Buy Now ,opinion,"Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock s recent trend  which can be in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   And for investors following this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic  it can be tough to define  Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy  but the Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at KLA  KLAC   which currently has a Momentum Style Score of A  We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score  like price change and earnings estimate revisions 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  KLA currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
Let s discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for KLAC that show why this maker of equipment for manufacturing semiconductors shows promise as a solid momentum pick 
A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short term price activity  as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand  It is also useful to compare a security to its industry  as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area 
For KLAC  shares are up 1 04  over the past week while the Zacks Electronics   Miscellaneous Products industry is flat over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 7 3  compares favorably with the industry s 1 22  performance as well 
Considering longer term price metrics  like performance over the last three months or year  can be advantageous as well  Over the past quarter  shares of KLA have risen 24 26   and are up 86 71  in the last year  On the other hand  the S P 500 has only moved 7 72  and 15 54   respectively 
Investors should also pay attention to KLAC s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  KLAC is currently averaging 1 380 245 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions  in addition to price changes  Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well  A nice path here can help show promise  and we have recently been seeing that with KLAC 
Over the past two months  5 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost KLAC s consensus estimate  increasing from  9 50 to  9 88 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  3 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Given these factors  it shouldn t be surprising that KLAC is a  2  Buy  stock and boasts a Momentum Score of A  If you re looking for a fresh pick that s set to soar in the near term  make sure to keep KLA on your short list ",2019-11-12,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/what-makes-kla-klac-a-strong-momentum-stock-buy-now-200484952,200484952

Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near term stock prices  Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank  This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple  actionable rating system

124156,345671,KLAC,Analysts Estimate KLA  KLAC  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when KLA  KLAC  reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on October 30  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This maker of equipment for manufacturing semiconductors is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 20 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  10 6  
Revenues are expected to be  1 35 billion  up 23 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for KLA 
For KLA  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that KLA will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that KLA would post earnings of  1 71 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 78  delivering a surprise of  4 09  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
KLA doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-10-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analysts-estimate-kla-klac-to-report-a-decline-in-earnings-what-to-look-out-for-200476877,200476877

Valuation Metrics
Ametek may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself

KLAC s contributions to integrated circuits  wafers and flat panel displays are probably at work right now in your computer  monitor  phone and television  yet all of those products bear the name of a different company 
Formed by the merger of KLA Instruments and Tencor Instruments in 1997  KLAC has relentlessly pursued advances in its own technology as well as acquiring 27 additional companies   They now boast a global footprint in manufacturing  R D and support services that spans the US  Europe  the Middle East and Asia 
Despite the lack of consumer level recognition  KLAC s focus on innovation makes it a trusted source within the industry  as well as providing a diverse revenue stream that largely insulates the company from the boom and bust cycles that plague many high tech suppliers 
KLAC s core product line performs critical functions within the chip and electronics manufacturing process and its Service business provides technical support  knowledge management and an extensive worldwide network of parts and supplies  Customers rarely make a single purchase  but rather continue to rely on continued support throughout the product lifecycle  Roughly 75  of Service revenue is contract based  further smoothing out revenue trends 
The market for talent in Silicon Valley is fiercely competitive  but KLAC has made attracting and retaining key employees part of it s culture   Nearly 40  of its workforce holds an advanced degree  yet employee turnover of less than 5  year is about half of the industry average 
A disciplined Capital Allocation model stokes the fires of growth while also ensuring the return of value to shareholders  KLAC lists its primary capitol allocation priorities as R D  Working Capital and Strategic Acquisitions  Secondary allocation priorities are dividends  share repurchases and debt service 
Over the past 10 years  KLAC has increased its annual shareholder dividend from  0 60 share to  2 84 share   a yield of just under 2  at the current share price 
The total return to shareholders over that same period has been a whopping 674    more than double the return of the S P 500 
KLAC s long term revenue model seeks to maintain and improve that outstanding shareholder returns  with growth in Services  gains in market share and an increase in industry wide sales 
Despite delivering steady revenue and sales growth that s the envy of the tech sector  KLAC currently trades at a lower P E Ratio of just 16 7X   lower than the S P 500 and much lower than most of the industry 
Tech investments often conjure up images of big risk and potentially big returns  Despite their focus on cutting edge products and services  KLAC s financial discipline means investors don t have to endure the risk to get the rewards  Management s focus on shareholder value has rewarded faithful investors with market beating returns and below average volatility

Price and EPS Surprise

For KLA Tencor  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
KLA Tencor currently has an Earnings ESP of  0 23   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate

124208,345723,KLAC,Earnings Preview  KLA Tencor  KLAC  Q4 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"KLA Tencor  KLAC  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on August 5  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This maker of equipment for manufacturing semiconductors is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 71 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  23  
Revenues are expected to be  1 25 billion  up 16 7  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for KLA Tencor 
For KLA Tencor  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that KLA Tencor will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that KLA Tencor would post earnings of  1 63 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 80  delivering a surprise of  10 43  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
KLA Tencor doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-28,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-klatencor-klac-q4-earnings-expected-to-decline-200446510,200446510

growing club of countries with entire yield curves drowning in sub zero territory The evaporation of global yield is pushing investors further out the maturity spectrum  Austria s 100 year bond is up

such cheap borrowing rates to support the reflation policies of their central banks  A report this week that Germany might issue new debt to finance climate protection caused a brief spike higher in

the Chinese Currency What seemed like a minor lurch in China s currency has become a big deal for financial markets  Many fear it may be the beginning of a Chinese competitive devaluation in response to U S  tariff threats  which in turn could trigger a currency war that may force other regional central banks to slash interest rates  The move also sparked fresh doubts a deal in the U S  Sino trade war will ever get done That 2 plus something percent slide in the heavily managed yuan has pushed it to 2008 lows and to the weaker side of 7 per dollar  Beijing is saying it s merely letting market forces drive the yuan  not weaponizing the currency  and has done its best through open market operations to contain the move  Chinese trade data showed that  with falling imports and exports  Beijing needs a weaker currency to support its economy Markets are watching the back and forth between Washington and Beijing  accusations of currency manipulation  plus the mounting pressure on the Fed to

124235,345750,KLAC,Why KLA Tencor  KLAC  Could Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well positioned to maintain its earnings beat streak in its upcoming report  It is worth considering KLA Tencor  KLAC   which belongs to the Zacks Semiconductor Equipment   Wafer Fabrication industry 
This maker of equipment for manufacturing semiconductors has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 10 67  
For the most recent quarter  KLA Tencor was expected to post earnings of  1 63 per share  but it reported  1 80 per share instead  representing a surprise of 10 43   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  2 20 per share  while it actually produced  2 44 per share  a surprise of 10 91  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for KLA Tencor lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
KLA Tencor currently has an Earnings ESP of  1 34   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-07-03,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-klatencor-klac-could-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200437077,200437077

124265,345780,KLAC,Earnings Preview  KLA Tencor  KLAC  Q3 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"KLA Tencor  KLAC  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on May 6  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This maker of equipment for manufacturing semiconductors is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 63 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  19 3  
Revenues are expected to be  1 07 billion  up 5 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for KLA Tencor 
For KLA Tencor  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that KLA Tencor will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that KLA Tencor would post earnings of  2 20 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 44  delivering a surprise of  10 91  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments  income investors hone in on dividends  A dividend is the distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  it s often viewed by its dividend yield  a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long term returns  and in many cases  dividend contributions surpass one third of total returns 
KLA Tencor in Focus
KLA Tencor  KLAC  is headquartered in Milpitas  and is in the Computer and Technology sector  The stock has seen a price change of 31 97  since the start of the year  Currently paying a dividend of  0 75 per share  the company has a dividend yield of 2 54   In comparison  the Semiconductor Equipment   Wafer Fabrication industry s yield is 2 01   while the S P 500 s yield is 1 98  
Looking at dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  3 is up 19  from last year  Over the last 5 years  KLA Tencor has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 9 61   Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Right now  KLA Tencor s payout ratio is 33   which means it paid out 33  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
KLAC is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  8 44 per share  representing a year over year earnings growth rate of 5 50  
Bottom Line
From greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages  investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  But  not every company offers a quarterly payout

What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on January 29  2019  KLA Tencor reported EPS of  2 44 versus consensus estimate of  2 2 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 4 49  
For the current fiscal year  KLA Tencor is expected to post earnings of  8 43 per share on  4 52 billion in revenues  This represents a 5 38  change in EPS on a 11 86  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  9 39 per share on  5 27 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 11 33  and 16 68   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
KLA Tencor may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
KLA Tencor has a Value Score of B  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are C and C  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of B 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 14 7X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 14 6X versus its peer group s average of 11 4X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 1 32  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  KLA Tencor currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if KLA Tencor meets the list of requirements  Thus  it seems as though KLA Tencor shares could still be poised for more gains ahead ",2019-04-04,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/klatencor-klac-hits-fresh-high-is-there-still-room-to-run-200404267,200404267

124292,345807,KLAC,Should Value Investors Pick KLA Tencor  KLAC  Stock Now  ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put KLA Tencor Corporation   NASDAQ KLAC   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  KLA Tencor has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 13 54  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 18 23  If we focus on the long term PE trend  KLA Tencor s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Computer and Technology sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 20 39  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that KLA Tencor has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 14 74  which is tad higher than the current level  So it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near term P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings  Right now  KLA Tencor has a P S ratio of about 4 39  This is higher than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 32 right now   Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is above the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years   If anything  KLAC is near the higher end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of overvalued trading at least compared to historical norms  Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  KLA Tencor currently has a Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes KLA Tencor a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too   For example  the PEG ratio for KLA Tencor is just 1 32  a level that is lower than the industry average of 1 46  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Clearly  KLA Tencor is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles  What About the Stock Overall Though KLA Tencor might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of C and a Momentum Score of C  This gives KLAC a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores   Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current quarter has seen five estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to no movement in the opposite direction  while the current year estimate has seen five upward revision compared to one downward in the same time period This has had a positive impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has increased by 5 2  in the past two months  while the current year estimate has risen by 1 1   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below KLA Tencor Corporation Price and Consensus    This bullish trend is why the stock boasts a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and why we are expecting outperformance from the company in the near term Bottom LineKLA Tencor is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible line up of statistics on this front  A solid Zacks Rank  2 further instils our confidence  In fact  over the past two years  the Zacks Semiconductor Equipment   Wafer Fabrication industry has clearly outperformed the market at large  as you can see below  However  a sluggish industry rank  among bottom 24  of more than 250 industries  makes it hard to get too excited about this company overall So  value investors might want to wait for the broader factors to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Zacks  Top 10 Stocks for 2019In addition to

Another tailwind for the company is the recent International Monetary Fund raising global growth expectations for both 2017 and 2018  2017 is expected to grow at  3 6   and 2018 at  3 7

5 Momentum Stocks to Scoop Up Gains Using Driehaus Strategy 

	Risk taking investors always look for strategies that lead to attractive returns from momentum stocks  Here  we have used Driehaus strategy based on the  buy high and sell higher  principle that helped the genius earn a place in Barron s All Century Team 

	Portfolios such as that of The American Association of Individual Investors  AAII  proved that the strategy has the potential to offer high returns  AAII s portfolio  which was developed following the strategy  returned 13 5  and 18 1  in the five  and 10  year timeframe  respectively  compared with  1 1  and 4 2  gains for the S P 500  Thus  investors with a high risk appetite may opt for this strategy 

A Look at Driehaus  Strategy

	After a detailed study of Driehaus  strategy  AAII concluded that it mainly focuses on strong earnings growth rates and impressive prospects to pick potential outperformers  While this strategy was made to provide better returns over the longer haul  companies with a strong history of beating estimates were also given importance 

	 I would much rather invest in a stock that s increasing in price and take the risk that it may begin to decline than invest in a stock that s already in a decline and try to guess when it will turn around   Driehaus had said in an interview 

Screening Parameters

	The percentage 50 day moving average is one of the key criteria in this strategy  A positive percentage 50 day moving average indicates that the stock is trading at a price higher than its 50 day moving average level  indicating an uptrend  It is calculated by dividing the numerator  month end price minus 50 day moving average of month end price  by the 50 day moving average of the month end price  Another momentum indicator   positive relative strength   has also been included in this strategy 

	In order to make the strategy more profitable  we have only considered those stocks that have a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  as well as a momentum score of  A  or  B   Our research shows that stocks with a  of  A  or  B  when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 offer the best upside potential 

  Zacks Rank equal to  1

	 Only Strong Buy rated stocks can get through  You can see    

	  Last 5 year average EPS growth rates above 2 

	 Strong EPS growth history ensures improving business  

	   Trailing 12 month EPS growth higher than 0 and industry median 

	 Higher EPS growth compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks  

	  Last four quarter average EPS surprise greater than 5 

	 Positive EPS surprise indicates potential  

	   Positive   50 day moving average and relative strength over 4 weeks 

	 High   50 day moving average and relative strength signal uptrend  

	  Momentum Score equal to or less than B

	 Favorable momentum score indicates that it is ideal to take advantage of the momentum with the highest probability of success  

	These few parameters narrowed down the universe of over 7 887 stocks to only 20 

	Here are five of the 20 stocks 

Gray Television  Inc    NYSE       is a television broadcast company  The company has a Momentum Score of  B  and an average four quarter positive earnings surprise of 22

124551,346066,KLAC,3 Strong Buy Growth Stocks,opinion,"It s perhaps the only downside to an eight year bull market that s still hitting new highs with no end in sight  How do you find growth in an environment like this  You could wait for one of those healthy pullbacks  but this market is so strong that they are usually pretty tame and short lived  like our recent  tech wreck   
Another possibility is to use a screen that finds the growth regardless of what the market does  Fortunately  that s exactly what the  screen is all about  It finds stocks that have a minimum historical growth rate of at least 20  and  more importantly  a projected growth rate of 20   On top of all that  it only picks Strong Buys 
Below are three stocks that passed this screen s criteria 
Momo   
Momo  MOMO  may be one of the youngest stocks on this screen with less than two years of reported quarters  but its gaining a lot of attention from the market  That s what happens when you announce triple digit gains on the top and bottom lines in a quarterly report  The company also has a daily average volume of around 10M shares  As the leading mobile social networking platform in China  a lot of people consider MOMO to be that country s Facebook  NASDAQ FB   Given that China has the highest population in the whole world  approximately 1 3 billion   it s easy to see why this stock has such growth potential 
Late last month  MOMO reported first quarter earnings of 40 cents per share  or 43  better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate at 28 cents  The result also blew past last year s 3 cents  It s four quarter average surprise is now up to 27 7  after three straight positive surprises and a match  Revenues soared 421  from last year to  265 2 million  which was ahead of the company s outlook between  238 million and  243 million  The live video service continued its momentum with revenues of  212 6 million  For the second quarter  MOMO sees net revenues between  283 million and  288 million  which would account for year over year growth of 186  to 191  
MOMO still doesn t have many covering analysts  but the ones it does have are raising their expectations  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this year has climbed 15 7  in just the past month to  1 40 per share  Earnings are expected to soar another 47  next year to  2 06 per share  which has gained 18 4  in the past 30 days 
 Momo Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Lam Research Corp    
Over the past several years  Lam Research Corp   LRCX  has been significantly expanding its market share in the wafer fabrication equipment market  which is smart since that space is in the top 1  of the Zacks Industry Rank  Semiconductor Equipment   Wafer Fabrication has the third spot out of 256 industries  which puts LRCX on some of the most fertile ground in the market  The company s fiscal third quarter report from April and its Price  Consensus and EPS graph  below  both show how this company has been growing for years now  but it s the earnings estimate revisions for next fiscal year that really explain why LRCX deserves a spot on the Zacks  1 Rank Growth Stocks list 
As Kevin Cook put it in a  article on LRCX last week  the company delivered the  earnings trifecta  in its fiscal third quarter  which means it beat on both the top and bottom lines while increasing its guidance  It earned  2 80 per share in the quarter  which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 10 2  and soared year over year by nearly 131   But the graph below shows the really impressive datapoint for LRCX  as it hasn t missed estimates in 19 quarters  So if it beats when reporting again on July 26  it will mark five straight years of overperformance  Revenues of  2 15 billion also got past our expectations while jumping nearly 64  from last year  Results were driven by strong successes in device architecture  process flow and advanced packaging technology inflections  Shares are up nearly 22  since the report 
Earnings estimates have been on the rise thanks to an encouraging outlook  This fiscal year ends this month  and analysts are expecting  9 88 per share  Over the past two months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate has improved 7 2  as eight of ten analysts revised higher  But this screen is really interested in where a company is going  and earnings estimates for next fiscal year suggest it s going UP  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal year ending June 2018 is expected to climb nearly 9  from this year to  10 76  Analysts have boosted that number by approximately 26 7  over the past 60 days  so LRCX doesn t seem to be slowing down anytime soon 
 Lam Research Corporation  NASDAQ LRCX  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   KLA Tencor Corp    
Let s stick with this highly ranked industry for one more stock summary  KLA Tencor Corp   KLAC  doesn t have as many covering analysts as LRCX  but the overall trajectory of earnings estimates and share price is the same  KLAC is one of the leading suppliers of inspection and metrology products and services  and it too has an impressive history of beating quarterly earnings expectations  The company has eclipsed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 11 straight quarters  Going further back  it has beaten in 17 of the last 18 quarters  so the wind is at its back heading into the next report on July 27 
The company s new products have been met with strong customer acceptance  leading to a positive surprise of 5 2  in its fiscal third quarter report  The result of  1 62 per share not only beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 54  but also improved by nearly 44  from the previous year  Over the past four quarters  KLAC has an average beat of nearly 11 6   Revenues jumped 28 4  from last year to  913 8 million  Its comprehensive product line  cost reduction initiatives and strong balance sheet will continue to generate growth  especially in a space that s in the top 1  of the Zacks Industry Rank 
Strong results and a solid guidance has given earnings estimates for KLAC a boost over the past two months  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal year that ends this month is  5 88 per share  or 3  better than 60 days ago as all five estimates moved higher  But this screen is most interested in next fiscal year s earnings  which are expected to jump 12 6  to  6 62 per share  Over the past two months  that consensus has improved 5 2  as four of five analysts boosted their expectations

124552,346067,KLAC,5 Momentum Stocks To Scoop Up Gains Using Driehaus Strategy ,opinion,Risk taking investors always look for strategies that lead to attractive returns from momentum stocks  Here  we have used Driehaus strategy based on the  buy high and sell higher  principle that helped the genius earn a place in Barron s All Century Team Portfolios such as that of The American Association of Individual Investors  AAII  proved that the strategy has the potential to offer high returns  AAII s portfolio  which was developed following the strategy  returned 13 5  and 18 1  in the five  and 10  year timeframe  respectively  compared with  1 1  and 4 2  gains for the S P 500  Thus  investors with a high risk appetite may opt for this strategy A Look at Driehaus  StrategyAfter a detailed study of Driehaus  strategy  AAII concluded that it mainly focuses on strong earnings growth rates and impressive prospects to pick potential outperformers  While this strategy was made to provide better returns over the longer haul  companies with a strong history of beating estimates were also given importance  I would much rather invest in a stock that s increasing in price and take the risk that it may begin to decline than invest in a stock that s already in a decline and try to guess when it will turn around   Driehaus had said in an interview Screening ParametersThe percentage 50 day moving average is one of the key criteria in this strategy  A positive percentage 50 day moving average indicates that the stock is trading at a price higher than its 50 day moving average level  indicating an uptrend  It is calculated by dividing the numerator  month end price minus 50 day moving average of month end price  by the 50 day moving average of the month end price  Another momentum indicator   positive relative strength   has also been included in this strategy  In order to make the strategy more profitable  we have only considered those stocks that have a Zacks Rank  1  Strong

124604,346119,KLAC,Good Time To Buy Semiconductor Equipment Stocks ,opinion,"Leading edge semiconductor production is dependent on the existence and availability of leading edge facilities and equipment  So any manufacturing advancement actually happens first on the equipment side  which thereby facilitates the change on the chip side  Companies may either build out new fabrication facilities for manufacturing or retool existing facilities  both of which lead to equipment purchases 
Another reason semiconductor companies buy equipment is the need to enhance replace existing equipment because of normal wear and tear 
China s focus on building its internal capabilities to cater to the constantly rising demand for and therefore  import of semiconductors is a more recent phenomenon and one that should benefit leading equipment makers 
Cyclical Business
Since semiconductor equipment and facilities are very capital intensive  decisions to invest in them don t take place overnight  The manufacturer has to carefully consider the current and future demand to optimally manage idle capacity and determine the possible payback period  As far as the market is concerned  even one major new facility can lead to demand supply imbalance  thus impacting prices for all peers  This made the business highly cyclical  with periods of high investment followed by periods of lower investment 
But this cyclicality may now be no more because of factors that can lead to more sustained demand  i e  semiconductor design innovations  shrinking chip geometries  the growing popularity of cloud computing  the advent of the Internet of Things  self driving cars  solar power and other technological advancements  Chinese equipment purchases will only add to this

What Happened in the Second Quarter 
The company s earnings per share  EPS  and revenues exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Revenues and earnings grew 23 5  and 46 2  year over year  respectively driven by strong demand in wafer fab equipment market and customer acceptance for the company s new products 
At the call  management was found upbeat on KLA s technology leadership position and the pace of execution of a product strategy focused on innovation and differentiation 
KLA Tencor Corporation Price and EPS Surprise
   Expectations for the Third Quarter 
We expect strong demand for more efficient manufacturing processes and the preference for mobile to work in favor of the company  The technical complexity of manufacturing semiconductors and increasingly challenging yield issues remain revenue drivers for this leading manufacturer of process control equipment 
Note that since each system is high valued  customer concentration is obviated  which results in significant fluctuations in revenue orders in times of uncertain demand 
For the third quarter  KLA expects shipments of  850  930 million  up 0 34  sequentially at the mid point  Quarterly revenues are expected between  860 million and  920 million  reflecting an increase of 1 5  sequentially at the mid point  Non GAAP EPS is expected in a range of  1 42 to  1 62 
Bottom Line
KLA s comprehensive product line  cost reduction initiatives and strong balance sheet remain positives that will generate growth whenever cyclical pressure permits  Though competition and a concentrated customer base increase execution risk  accelerated process control spending across foundry  memory and logic players through 2017 and beyond will enable KLA to deliver stronger results  This therefore holds true for the soon to be reported quarter

	The semiconductor industry is known as one of the most volatile sectors in the stock market  2016 was proof of exactly that  after wild trading led to huge moves in the iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF  Nasdaq            

	After a 15  move lower in January  the ETF is now up over 50  from its 2016 lows and up over 25  for the year

124630,346145,KLAC,PEG Ratio Vs  The P E Ratio,opinion,"Which valuation metric is better  the PEG ratio or the P E ratio  


Before we answer that question  let s first start with some basics  
Definitions 


The P E ratio is simply  Price   Earnings 


Essentially  this tells you how much an investor is willing to pay for each unit  year  of earnings  If a stock is trading at a P E ratio of 30  it is said to be trading at 30x times its annual earnings  


In general  the lower the P E ratio the better  A common threshold for many investors is a P E of 20 or less   For the record  at the time of this writing  the S P 500 Index was trading at a P E  using F1 Estimates  of 15 33   


A PEG ratio is the  P E Ratio divided by the Growth Rate 


Conventional wisdom says a value of 1 or less is considered good  at par or undervalued to its growth rate   while a value of greater than 1  in general  is not as good  overvalued to its growth rate   


Many believe the PEG ratio tells a more complete story than just the P E ratio   The S P at the time of this writing had a PEG ratio of 1 93   
Comparison 


Let s take a look at both of these in action  


For example  a company with a P E Ratio of 25 and a Growth Rate of 20  would have a PEG ratio of 1 25  25   20  1 25   


While a company with a P E Ratio of 40 and a Growth Rate of 50  would have a PEG Ratio of 0 80  40   50  0 80   


Traditionally  investors would look at the stock with the lower P E ratio and deem it a bargain  undervalued   But looking at it closer  you can see it doesn t have the growth rate to justify its P E  


The stock with the P E of 40  however  is actually the better bargain since its PEG ratio is lower  0 80  and is trading at a discount to its growth rate  


In other words  the lower the PEG ratio  the better the value  That s because the investor would be paying less for each unit of earnings growth  


So which one is better  


They both have their usefulness  I do like how the PEG positions the P E ratio in relation to its growth rate to put everything into perspective  


Quite frankly  I use both  so I m going to say it s a tie  Plus  you couldn t even create the PEG ratio without the P E  


But  you don t have to choose one or the other  You can use both  And that s how we re using it in this week s screen  
Screen Parameters 


Let s first start with  


  Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2
 Only stocks with a Zacks Rank  1 Strong Buy or  2 Buy can get thru   


  Projected One Year Growth Rate greater than S P 500
 Market outperformers are what we re looking for  The 1 year projected growth rate for the S P is currently 7 94   So only those above that will qualify   


  P E Ratio  using F1  less than or equal to 20 AND less than or equal to X Industry Median  
 Not only do we want our P Es to be below their classic valuation threshold  but we want them to be below the median for their industry as well   


  PEG Ratio less than or equal to 1 AND less than or equal to X Industry Median 
 P E divided by its  F1  projected growth rate  This one also has to be below its classic valuation marker and have a PEG ratio below the median for its industry  This ensures that they are considered undervalued on an absolute basis as well as undervalued relative to its group of peers   
 

  Price greater than or equal to  5 


  Avg  20 Day Volume greater than or equal to 100 000 
 

This screen will find stocks with market beating growth rates  yet still be considered undervalued on two of the most effective valuation markers  And of course  with the Zacks Rank added to it  each one of these picks will be experiencing upward earnings estimate revisions  which provides a timely catalyst for the stock to move

PEG Ratio vs  P E Ratio

	Which valuation metric is better  the PEG ratio or the P E ratio

124634,346149,KLAC,Investors Were Camping Out Too,opinion,"Investors may as well have been camping out on Black Friday too  waiting for the market to open just like countless shoppers at stores across the country  Despite the expected low volume  there was no let up to the post election rally on the day after Thanksgiving  The major indices all hit record highs again and completed a third straight week of gains 
On Friday  the S P was up 0 39  to 2213 4  marking a weekly advance of 1 4   The Dow increased 0 36  to 19 152 1 and the NASDAQ was up 0 34  to 5398 9  each of these indices added 1 5  for the week  The Russell 2000 kept the good times going as well  rising 0 38  to 1347 2  However  oil moved sharply lower in the session on new uncertainty of an output deal since Saudi Arabia does not plan to attend talks with non OPEC producers next week 
Understandably  the portfolios were quiet today  However  there was a buy in Income Investor that was set up on Wednesday  Learn about it in the highlights section below  along with some analysis Today s Portfolio Highlights 
  The acquisition of KLA Tencor  NASDAQ KLAC  by Lam Research  NASDAQ LRCX  was a no go but that s all right  Analysts feel pretty good about KLAC as a stand alone company  which was on full display in the recent quarterly report  It beat on both the top and bottom lines  while also increasing the quarterly dividend  KLAC supplies process control and yield management solutions to the semiconductor industry  which means it s part of a space in the top 5     of the Zacks Industry Rank  Neena made this Zacks Rank  2  Buy  stock the newest addition to Income Investor  Learn more about today s moves in the complete commentary    The post election rally continues  And it looks like there s a lot more to go  With analysts speculating that Trump s economic policies could send GDP expectations to 4  and even 5   the market could be getting ready to have one of its best year s next year of the last 7 1 2 year bull market  In other news  the PMI Services Flash report inched a bit lower to 54 7 vs  last month s pace of 54 8  But  holding steady after last month s sharp 3 point jump  which put it at a 12 month high  is pretty impressive  After a whole litany of solid reports this week  today s report just adds to the narrative of a strong economy  And that  of course  is bullish for the market   said Kevin in Options Trader    It s been a truly amazing run since the election and my 2240 targets are well within reach  We might start to see some euphoria soon  as the move over 2200 will bring in a lot of new money that s been sitting on the sidelines  I would much prefer a pullback  but for now it looks like we will continue with the low volume grind higher into Christmas  OPEC should spark some volatility in energy markets next week after their meeting on the 30th  Expect very large moves in oil stocks and of course crude oil 
 Crude was down almost 2  today as the Saudi s backed out of the Non OPEC meeting  These headlines are a mess  but when a final decision is made  we will see a violent oil move  The direction chosen will dictate the price of oil for the next three to six months  My feeling is that there will be an agreement  but these OPEC guys are a tricky bunch  All involved are sovereign nations and will decide what is best for their own nation s interest   said Jeremy in Zacks Counterstrike    Many are calling this massive rally a  Trump Rally  in part because most of it has occurred post election  There s no doubt the election has given us certainty as to the direction over the next several months  Wall Street hates uncertainty and it s now clear many traders and investors were on the sidelines waiting for the results  But something else is also going on  Frankly  the US economy has been heating up for weeks  So we get a double dose of optimism  with a growing economy and nearly full employment with a possible stimulus and tax cut program coming soon  That s the best of all worlds  When the pull back does come  many of the insiders may look at it as a buying opportunity  I m still bullish on stocks  especially the small caps  heading into the end of the year  This rally is for real  We re staying 100  invested to ride the momentum   said Tracey in Insider Trader 
Have a Great Weekend

124669,346184,KLAC,4 Surging Semiconductors For Your Portfolio	,opinion,"The semiconductor industry is known as one of the most volatile sectors in the stock market  2016 was proof of exactly that  after wild trading led to huge moves in the iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF  SOXX   
After a 15  move lower in January  the ETF is now up over 50  from its 2016 lows and up over 25  for the year 
The reason for the big moves stems from general market volatility seen in early 2016  Most of the semis where beating down over fear of a global slowdown that never came about  Additionally  the sector has witnessed impressive earnings from leaders in the industry  causing stock prices to rise across the board  This earnings growth has helped the sector as a whole and helped individual stocks surge to all time highs 

Below I examine four semiconductor stocks that are surging to 2016 highs  The sector is broken into smaller industries within the Zacks Industry Rank  but all stocks mentioned are ranked in the top 20 out of 265  Top 6   in the Zack Industry Rank

Earlier this month  the company reported Q3 earnings of  0 94 versus the  0 57 expected  with revenues coming in at  2 00 billion versus  1 68 billion  The company also raised its dividend 22  and issues  2 billion in stock buybacks   In addition to the 45  beat  the company guided higher  forcing analyst to raise estimates 
Analysts are in 100  agreement on which way estimates are going  higher  Estimates for fiscal year 2017 have jumped 33  in the last month  from  1 86 to  2 48  For 2018  there has been revisions higher of 43   from  1 93 to 2 77 
The stock has seen one of the better moves of 2016  so it is understandable if investors don t want to chase  However  any significant pullback should be bought due to the company s long term earnings prospects

124703,346218,KLAC,KLA Tencor  KLAC  Sees Hammer Chart Pattern  Time To Buy ,opinion,"KLA Tencor Corporation   NASDAQ KLAC   has been struggling lately  but the selling pressure may be coming to an end soon  That is because KLAC recently saw a Hammer Chart Pattern which can signal that the stock is nearing a bottom 
What is a Hammer Chart Pattern  
A hammer chart pattern is a popular technical indicator that is used in candlestick charting  The hammer appears when a stock tumbles during the day  but then finds strength at some point in the session to close near or above its opening price  This forms a candlestick that resembles a hammer  and it can suggest that the market has found a low point in the stock  and that better days are ahead 
Other Factors
Plus  earnings estimates have been rising for this company  even despite the sluggish trading lately  In just the past 60 days alone 4 estimates have gone higher  compared to none lower  while the consensus estimate has also moved in the right direction 
Estimates have actually risen so much that the stock now has a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  suggesting this relatively unloved stock could be due for a breakout soon  This will be especially true if KLAC stock can build momentum from here and find a way to continue higher of off this encouraging trading development ",2016-05-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/kla-tencor-(klac)-sees-hammer-chart-pattern:-time-to-buy-200130419,200130419
124704,346219,KLAC,How KLA Tencor  KLAC  Stock Stands Out In A Strong Industry ,opinion,One stock that might be an intriguing choice for investors right now is KLA Tencor Corporation   NASDAQ KLAC    This is because this security in the Semiconductor Equipment Manufacturing   Wafer Fabrication space is seeing solid earnings estimate revision activity  and is in great company from a Zacks Industry Rank perspective   This is important because  often times  a rising tide will lift all boats in an industry  as there can be broad trends taking place in a segment that are boosting securities across the board  This is arguably taking place in the Semiconductor Equipment Manufacturing   Wafer Fabrication space as it currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 11 out of more than 250 industries  suggesting it is well positioned from this perspective  especially when compared to other segments out there Meanwhile  KLA Tencor is actually looking pretty good on its own too  The firm has seen solid earnings estimate revision activity over the past month  suggesting analysts are becoming a bit more bullish on the firm s prospects in both the short and long term In fact  over the past month  current quarter estimates have risen from  1 42 per share to  1 43 per share  while current year estimates have risen from  4 24 per share to  4 33 per share  This has helped KLAC to earn a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   further underscoring the company s solid position So  if you are looking for a decent pick in a strong industry  consider KLA Tencor  Not only is its industry currently in the top third  but it is seeing solid estimate revisions as of late  suggesting it could be a very interesting choice for investors seeking a name in this great industry segment ,2016-06-01,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/how-kla-tencor-(klac)-stock-stands-out-in-a-strong-industry-200133404,200133404
124708,346223,KLAC,5 Tech Stocks To Buy And Hold For The Long Run,opinion,"Growth investments can really pay off if you know where to look   Technology is a popular sector for growth investors  and the field continues to accelerate faster than ever before   If you invest right  you stand to make a nice profit   Tech companies will continue to change and reshape our world as the years pass   You don t want to be left behind  so make sure you re investing in quality tech stocks that aren t overpriced     
A great way to find out if the price is right is by identifying companies with low price to earnings ratios relative to the growth expected of them over the next three to five years   There is a metric for this  known as the PEG ratio  
Many tech companies have inflated PE ratios  and this is because they have high earnings growth expectations   The PEG ratio helps to put growth stocks into perspective  and they help with assessing the value present in a company based on expected growth   A PEG under 1 may suggest that a stock is undervalued  so tech companies with a low PEG may stand to see superior returns over the long run   If you are a believer in the power of technology  you won t want to overlook these five buy ranked tech stocks

   Our Take
Lam Research delivered strong fiscal fourth quarter 2016 results with both earnings and revenues outperforming our estimates 
2016 has been pretty good for the company as it continues to see strong success in the areas of device architecture  process flow and advanced packaging technology inflections 
In the quarter just ended  Lam s shipments  revenues and non GAAP gross margins were above the mid points and non GAAP EPS were above the high end of the guidance range 
Lam Research has high hopes from KLA Tencor Corp    NASDAQ KLAC   the merger with which close shortly  Management expects that the combined company will contribute significantly toward sustainable growth  generating cash and creating value 
The company has been improving on WFE market share significantly since 2013 and expects to continue making gains  going forward 
Lam Research continues to see increased adoption rates of 3D NAND technology  FinFETs and multi patterning  The company has initiated cost reduction and density scaling for 3D NAND and new memory technologies 
It is likely to continue as the market leader in dielectric etches as VECTOR Strata and ALTUS deposition and Flex and Kiyo etch products have been extremely successful products thus far  The company anticipates strong demand for leading edge silicon in the enterprise market to continue  driven by the long term move to the cloud  storage and networking applications 
The company is also making good progress with its customer support business and anti trust agency reviews 
However  concerns persist in the form of volatility and lower growth expectations globally  with slow but steady improvement in some developed markets balancing the weakness in certain emerging economies  The Brexit impact cannot be ignored either 
Lam Research currently has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  
Investors may also consider stocks like Mistras Group  Inc    NYSE MG    VOXX International Corp    NASDAQ VOXX   and Texas Instruments Inc    NASDAQ TXN    each carrying a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  ",2016-07-28,Zacks Investment Research,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/lam-research-(lrcx)-tops-q4-earnings,-revenue-estimates-200144801",200144801
