14829,236344,CPLP,Is Capital Product Partners  CPLP  A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Capital Product Partners L P    NASDAQ CPLP   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Capital Product Partners has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 11 53  This level compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE ratio for the S P 500 comes in at about 20 05 If we focus on the long term trend of the stock the current level puts Capital Product Partners  current PE near its lows  with the number having been on a general downtrend  Hence  we could infer that the stock is undervalued in this respect  especially in light of its historical trend  Thus  the present level seems to be a suitable entry point for the stock from a PE perspective Further  the stock s PE compares favorably with its industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 113 21  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers PS RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Capital Product Partners has a P S ratio of about 1 74  This is higher than the industry average  which comes in at 1 37x right now If anything  CPLP is towards the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  which suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Capital Product Partners currently has a Value Score of  A   putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Capital Product Partners a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  its P B ratio  used to compare a stock s market value to its book value  stands at 0 47  slightly lower than the industry average of 0 53  Furthermore  the EV EBITDA for CPLP is just 4 83  a level that is far lower than the industry average of 6 88  The EV EBITDA multiple  Enterprise Value  Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization  is capital structure neutral  as it takes into account the level of debt on a company s balance sheet  not just its equity Clearly  CPLP is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Capital Product Partners might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  F  and a Momentum score of  D   This gives CPLP a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  C    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s earnings estimates have been trending downward lately  The current quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past thirty days compared to two lower  while the full year estimate has seen one upward revision and two downward revisions in the same time period This has had a meaningful impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate has decreased 16 7  over the past month  while the full year estimate has moved down 7 1   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Capital Product Partners L P  Price and Consensus   This negative trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  despite strong value metrics and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineCapital Product Partners is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  among the Bottom 35  out of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the respective industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of AllLast year  it generated  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  47 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce  the world s first trillionaires   but that should still leave plenty of

14832,236347,CPLP,Use Relative Price Strength To Land Up On 6 Winning Stocks,opinion,Earnings growth and valuation multiples are indeed important for investors to determine a stock s ability to offer considerable returns  But these are also essential in determining whether a stock s price performance is better than its peers or the industry average If a stock s performance is lacking that of the broader groups despite impressive earnings growth or valuation multiples  then something must be wrong It s always advisable to stay away from these stocks and bet on those that are outperforming their respective industries or benchmarks  This is because betting on a winner always increases the odds of winning Then again  it is imperative that you determine whether or not an investment has relevant upside potential when considering stocks with significant relative price strength  Stocks delivering better than the S P 500 over a period of 1 to 3 months at the least and having solid fundamentals indicate room for growth and are the best ways to go about this strategy Finally  it is important to find out whether analysts are optimistic about the upcoming earnings results of these companies  In order to do this  we have added positive estimate revisions for the current quarter s  Q1  earnings to our screen  When a stock undergoes an upward revision  it leads to additional price
