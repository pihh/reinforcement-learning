will now turn the call over to Ken  Kenneth Jacobs    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thank you  Allie  Good morning  Today  we reported record fourth quarter operating revenue  reflecting solid performance across our businesses  The quarter was driven by increased M A revenue and higher management and performance fees in Asset Management  We entered 2020 in a strong position with a global platform that incorporates diverse revenue streams and significant scale  innovative client solutions  and growth opportunities in which we continue to invest  In Financial Advisory  full year operating revenue reflected increasing momentum in the second half  Our volume of announced European M A transactions has risen sharply in the last 6 months  Our M A activity has been especially strong in the  1 billion to  10 billion range  In 2019  our number of announced transactions increased by 10  over the prior year  even as the market decreased  We continue to be a leader in global restructuring and debt advisory assignments  with significant pockets of opportunity globally  We ve been especially active in the retail and energy sectors  All of our Financial Advisory practices remained active in 2019  Our investments in Shareholder Advisory and data analytics are having a significant impact on our business by helping us identify opportunities faster and provide innovative advice for clients  Our sovereign capital and private capital advisory businesses continue to advise governments  corporations  and partnerships on financing strategy and capital raising around the world  We continue to see growth opportunities across our advisory businesses and have been aligning our professional base accordingly  In 2019  we made leadership transitions  including global    new global heads of Financial Advisory and M A as well as new country heads in France  U K  and Brazil  We also recruited a new venture and growth banking team based in London  Our Asset Management business had a strong fourth quarter with higher management and incentive fees  reflecting AUM growth and the performance of our strategies  We achieved modest net inflows during the quarter  Our assets under management increased by  17 billion  or 7   during the quarter  We entered 2020 with AUM of  248 billion  up 15  from the start of 2019  Overall  our investment performance was strong across most of our platforms in 2019  Our investments in new strategies and product extensions continue to provide new avenues of growth  Our quantitative business achieved net inflows for both the fourth quarter and full year as did our local equity and our global and multiregional fixed income platforms  We continue to invest in growth of asset management through investments in people  technology  and distribution as well as the development of new funds and the scaling up of existing platforms  In 2019  we reinforced our ESG expertise with the hiring of a new Global co head in New York and London and expanded our quantitative investment platform with the addition of two investment teams in San Francisco  We continue to add to our European and Asian distribution and are gaining new clients across these regions  And we have launched new funds in international and global equities as well as fixed income  Evan will now provide color on our results  then I will comment on our outlook Evan Russo    Chief Financial Officer Thank you  Ken  Lazard s full year operating revenue for 2019 was  2 55 billion  8  lower than the record level achieved in 2018  This reflected higher revenue in the second half of the year versus the first half  as we anticipated  Our record fourth quarter revenue of  708 million was 3  higher than the prior year s period  In Financial Advisory  we completed the year with  1 36 billion in revenue  In the fourth quarter  our advisory revenue was in line with the prior year quarter  reflecting a substantial increase in revenue from Europe and Asia Pacific  In Asset Management  we generated  1 16 billion in revenue for the year  In the fourth quarter  operating revenue increased by 7  over the prior year s quarter  reflecting higher management fees and incentive fees  Fourth quarter management and other fees increased 2  sequentially from the third quarter  reflecting higher average AUM  For full year 2019  our average fee was 49 basis points  down from 51 basis points in 2018  This reflected a shift in our mix of assets  We had net inflows for the year in our quantitative and fixed income strategies while  at the same time  we experienced net outflows in our emerging markets platform  Incentive fees for the year were  21 million  the same amount as in 2018  Fourth quarter incentive fees were  14 million  reflecting strong relative and absolute performance across a mix of our equity and fixed income strategies  Key strategies generating incentive fees included quantitative and global equities and convertibles and emerging markets debt  Average AUM for the fourth quarter was  238 billion  up 6  from last year s period and up 2  sequentially in the third quarter of 2019  The sequential increase was driven by market appreciation of  13 billion  foreign exchange appreciation of  4 billion  and net inflows of approximately  500 million  For the full year  we experienced net outflows of  9 billion  driven primarily by outflows in emerging markets equity and debt as well as multiregional equity  Other platforms had strong net inflows for the year  including quantitative and local equities and our global and multiregional fixed income platforms  We finished 2019 with AUM of  248 billion  And as of January 28  AUM was approximately  247 billion  The decrease reflected foreign exchange depreciation of  2 4 billion and net outflows of  1 1 billion  offset by market appreciation of  2 3 billion  Market volatility has been increasing in January  and we anticipate additional near term outflows of approximately  500 million for the month  Looking ahead across our franchise  Asset Management is off to a good start with AUM well above the average level for 2019  In Financial Advisory  we have momentum entering the first half of the year  Our current level of activity is higher than at this time last year  and we are encouraged by the increase in European M A where we have a deeply established presence and growing opportunities driven in part by shareholder activism  We re seeing strong demand across our advisory practices globally  including restructuring engagements  Turning to expenses  We continue to demonstrate our cost discipline and ability to manage the firm through cycles  Our compensation ratio for 2019 on an adjusted basis was 57 5   up from a record low of 55 1  in 2018  On an awarded basis  our annual comp ratio was 57 7  compared to 55 8  for 2018  Our comp ratio was well within our targeted range  Adjusted noncompensation expense for the year rose 3  to  499 million  reflecting our increased investments in the business  primarily in our technology infrastructure  which we have highlighted throughout the year  For the full year 2019  our noncomp expense ratio of 9    19 6  remains within our targeted range  Our effective tax rate for 2019 was 24 1   compared to 22 7  a year ago  This was in line with our expectations of an annual effective tax rate in the mid 20s  For the coming year 2020  we continue to expect an effective tax rate in the mid 20  range  Turning now to capital allocation  We continue to generate strong cash flow and return capital to our shareholders  In 2019  we returned  850 million  primarily through a combination of share repurchases and dividends  During the year  we repurchased 13 7 million shares  which included 1 7 million in the fourth quarter  As a result  our fourth quarter diluted weighted average share count declined by 9  from the prior year to 115 5 million shares  In 2020  we expect to continue our share repurchase program at a minimum to offset potential dilution from our year end equity grants  Our total outstanding repurchase authorization is now 370     379 million  Ken will now conclude our remarks Kenneth Jacobs    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thank you  Evan  The year is off to a strong start  Overall  the global macroeconomic environment remains constructive  Fundamentals for global equity markets are steady  and credit conditions remain favorable  We re seeing momentum in global M A  including Europe  as business confidence grows  And despite global trade tensions  we ve seen an increase in cross border transactions around the world  The forces driving global strategic activity remain in place  Technology driven disruption continues to be a catalyst for M A across industries  Shareholder activism has become a global phenomenon  Last year  almost half of all activist campaigns had an M A thesis  In addition  climate risk is becoming increasingly relevant to company valuations and is an emerging catalyst for strategic activity  Our ESG expertise is well entrenched in our Asset Management business  and we are building out this expertise as a firm  In Financial Advisory  we are well positioned  We have the most sophisticated strategic and Shareholder Advisory capabilities  deep relationships in local markets around the world  and the expertise of global sector and specialty teams  In Asset Management  institutional investors are increasingly dividing the portfolios between low cost passive strategies and high value added active strategies  We have a world class investing franchise in markets that reward deep fundamental research  and our quantitative strategies are competing effectively in the market for low cost products  We see opportunities for growth across our businesses  and we are allocating our resources accordingly  We remain focused on serving all of our clients well while we manage the firm for profitable growth and shareholder value over the long term Now let s open the call to questions  Questions   Answers  OperatorThank you   Operator instructions  We can take our first question from Brennan Hawken of UBS  Please go ahead  Your line is open Brennan Hawken    UBS    Analyst Hi  Good morning  Thanks for taking the question  Just wanted to ask on expenses  Noncomp really looked quite good versus at least what I had been expecting  Was there some onetime    any onetime noise in there that we should adjust or think about when we re considering a baseline on which to build here into 2020 Kenneth Jacobs    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Evan Evan Russo    Chief Financial Officer Yeah  Hey  Brennan  Good morning  Look  as we said  the noncomp came in about  130 million in Q4  We continue to focus on maintaining the cost discipline as we talked about throughout the year  This year  noncomp increases reflected a couple of things  One is the continued rolling in of our technology investments as well as some additional marketing and business development as we started ramping up more marketing in the middle of this year  And it was offset  as you mentioned  by a couple of other items  most notably  lower pension costs in this year versus last year  Last year Q4  we had some higher pension costs that got accrued in that quarter  and this year  we had less pension costs that accrued  So I guess that s the one component  But I d say it s a combination of the cost discipline that we ve been working through throughout the year  But for the year  on an ongoing basis  I think we expect to remain at elevated levels for the next few quarters  as we ve mentioned  as we continue to roll in our technology projects  we expand hiring and continue to grow our real estate    our footprint    grow our real estate footprint to ready expansion as we invest for the future  I think    look  Brennan  it s always important to remember  our spending in our noncomp  The way we think about it is it s very much strategic spending  We re creating a stronger platform  a strong and more vibrant platform to accelerate growth  So I think this quarter was a good quarter  We got a couple of components in there that were helpful  but I think it s sort of in line with the way we ve been managing costs throughout the year Brennan Hawken    UBS    Analyst Great  That s really helpful  Appreciate the time OperatorThank you  We can now take our next question from Chris Walsh of Wolfe Research  Please go ahead  Your line is open Chris Walsh Hey  guys  Good morning Evan Russo    Chief Financial Officer Morning Chris Walsh Just wanted to ask one quick one on the share count  recognizing that amortization of historical stock accruals generally higher in the first half of each year and that 2019 may have seen elevated net buybacks  After the net debt issuance and with a lower stock price  how should we think about appetite for buyback and kind of the cadence of buyback over the course of 2020 Evan Russo    Chief Financial Officer Sure  Hey  Chris  I ll take that one  I mean  look  we continue to focus on    as we ve been saying  focus on returning the excess cash to our shareholders  As you mentioned  we had accelerated a lot of buybacks earlier in this year  As we mentioned  we bought back 13 7 million shares over the course of the year  Frankly  almost 20 million shares over the last 15 months  So I mean  at a minimum  as we always say  we re going to offset the dilution we get  This quarter  we bought back enough shares to offset the amortization of shares  effectively keeping the weighted average share count flat  I think if you think out into 2020  we re going to continue to use the excess cash flow to buy back shares  The first couple of quarters  we focus on buying back the dilution  And then as we get later into the year  we see what kind of excess cash we have  we ll be putting it to work to work to reduce the share count as best we can Chris Walsh Got it  Thanks  And then just one more on flows in the Asset Management business  You saw a much better flow in December  And I don t want to read it too much into one data point  and I heard your color around expectations for negative flows in January  So just kind of wanted to see if anything has changed in your outlook there at all  Can you speak to the uptake of some of your newer launches and comment on any allocation trends you re seeing across your client base Evan Russo    Chief Financial Officer Sure  So look  I think when you think about our flows  as you said  we had positive net flows in Q4  and we ve had some outflows    net outflows at the beginning of this year as well  Look  you have to remember  as we always say  we are in a lot of    most of our assets  85  of our assets  are in institutional side  It s pretty lumpy  So you re going to get some movement from time to time  Plus  important to remember  I mean  we had over  13 billion of gross inflows just in Q4  So inflows and outflows  there s always material movements in every given quarter  So I think our outlook remains the same as it s been  We ve seen some outflows  as we called out  in the EM platform in the quarter and the full year  And then specifically  as we ve said in the past  specifically in the value part of our platform  we ve talked about value underperforming growth and quality  Value has been under pressure out of favor  as you well know  The growth part of our platform is performing really well  We re having great performance there  And indeed  performance is pretty strong across most of the AUM that we have  Over 70  of our funds are outperforming on a one year basis  And so I think our trends will continue  I think we expect to see some muted outflows  some additional outflows  as we said  in some of the emerging markets products in this quarter  And I think    but I think our outlook for the business continues to remain the same  We re focusing on performance  and we expect the flows will follow Chris Walsh Great  Thanks for answering my questions OperatorThank you  We can now take our next question from Devin Ryan of JMP Securities  Please go ahead Devin Ryan    JMP Securities    Analyst Great  Good morning  guys  How are you Evan Russo    Chief Financial Officer Good morning Devin Ryan    JMP Securities    Analyst First one here  just on operating leverage in the model and just expectations in how we should think about incremental margins  just given some of the moving parts with some of the headcount changes late last year  But then I also hear your commentary around investment into the business continuing  and then hopefully  there s some revenue growth in 2020 as well  So just trying to put that all together and get an update on any moving parts that we should be thinking about for incremental margins Kenneth Jacobs    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Sure  So I ll take the first part of it  And then if there s a follow up  with Evan  on some of the specifics  What I d say is  look  it s pretty straightforward  When there s revenue growth  we tend to get pretty good operating leverage in the business and revenue declines  It s more difficult to get that kind of operating leverage  And I think we do a pretty good job in the revenue decline to manage the real cost of compensation  which were reflected in the awarded comp on both sides of the business  So what I d say is this year feels better than last year at the start  We ve got strong momentum going into 2020  It feels a lot better to me than it did at the same time last year  So we would get revenue growth this year  You should expect to see improved operating leverage in the business Devin Ryan    JMP Securities    Analyst Got it  Terrific  OK  And then just one on the advisory backdrop  And great to see the improved momentum relative to a year ago  And when I talk to investors  one thing that continues to come up is just how the U S  elections could start to affect the markets  if at all  and I think there s some concern that as we get closer  it could start to create a little bit of paralysis  And so I m curious if you re hearing about that at all from clients  if you have a view of whether it feels like that s going to be a big factor or the trends that are driving conversations today  both in the U S  and outside the U S   kind of stronger than potential disruption from that Kenneth Jacobs    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Well  I think right now the drivers of the market are related to the macroenvironment  the economy as a whole  which is    remains pretty robust in the U S  and has stabilized and probably improving in parts of Europe  And if you look at the traditional factors that drive activity  credit valuation  confidence levels  credit remains widely available  Rates are at historic lows  Spreads are reasonable  Financing  again  widely available  Valuations  probably a little rich in parts of the market  a little more reasonable in other parts of the market  I think in terms of confidence levels  trade tensions have been reduced with the Phase 1 of the China trade agreement and then the Mexico and Canada agreement is now signed  I think that helps  And the election itself  as we get closer  perhaps there s volatility around that  But again  I think one of the lessons of the last 12 years is  oftentimes  less gets done after election than people expect because of the nature of majorities and supermajorities in Congress and the inability to get that much through  So I think  in some ways  there obviously could be concerns around election  but there are also issues that kind of moderate that  And I think as we get closer to the election  we ll see  But for the moment  we don t see much commentary around the elections affecting deal activities Devin Ryan    JMP Securities    Analyst Great  That s helpful color  Thanks  Ken OperatorThank you  We can now take our next question from Richard Ramsden of Goldman Sachs  Please go ahead Richard Ramsden    Goldman Sachs    Analyst OK  Good morning  guys  I was hoping that you could expand a bit on some of the momentum that you re seeing in the European business  And I guess  specifically  the question is  now there s a clearer path for Brexit  do you think activity is going to accelerate from here  Or do you think that would be more of the drivers to the strength that you ve seen over the last 6 months  Thanks Kenneth Jacobs    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Sure  So I think we saw us a pickup in activity in Europe in the first half of  19 that reflect    that was reflected in closings in the   in our completions in the fourth quarter for us  and things feel a little more robust right now than they did a year ago  even in Europe  and obviously  for us as a whole full firm right now  In terms of Brexit  clearly  having more certainty around Brexit is helping the investment client and the decision making climate in the U K   in particular  And I would expect that we expect that there will be a pickup activity in the U K  I think we ve already seen some of it starting  and dialogues are increasing  And I think with credit conditions  the way they are and such  I think we will see a pickup there Evan Russo    Chief Financial Officer Well  I think with the amount of capital that s going into private equity  activity levels in private equity are going to remain high  Credit conditions are robust  as I said before  And the need to invest and also the need to find realizations on portfolios keep that to be a very robust market  And strategic market remains active  So I think  overall  both markets are healthy Richard Ramsden    Goldman Sachs    Analyst OK  Thanks a lot OperatorThank you  We will now take our next question from Michael Brown of KBW Michael Brown    KBW    Analyst Hi  Good morning  Ken and Evan Kenneth Jacobs    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Morning Michael Brown    KBW    Analyst So I appreciate the color on the activity levels and any additional color on Europe  You had mentioned that cross border has kind of improved as well  I was looking to get a little more color as to kind of which regions you re kind of seeing that  And I would also appreciate some additional color on what you re seeing in some of the other regions outside of kind of Europe  But what are you seeing in Latin America  Canada  other parts of Asia as well Kenneth Jacobs    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer OK  I think   yeah  there s been  for us  at least  some pickup in cross border activities in Europe  Cross border into the U S   we had a couple of nice transactions announced in the second half of the year  And some activity on the part of some of the large Chinese companies into Latin America  I think activity in Asia has been more muted  And activity from Asia into the U S   obviously  much more muted  particularly in China into the U S   much more muted  And China into Europe  still some transactions  I think we ll see a little bit of a pickup into the U K  perhaps over the course of the year but not at the level they were a few years back  But overall  it s OK Michael Brown    KBW    Analyst OK  Thanks  And if I could just follow up on the capital return question  I appreciate that you probably kind of reevaluate as you get to the second half of the year  But I guess  as we think about kind of your current valuation  at what level would you look to maybe do less buybacks and shift back to more of a special dividend to return any excess cash to investors Evan Russo    Chief Financial Officer Sure  So I think we ve been pretty clear all year about the way we ve been thinking about it  shifting our focus a little bit more toward the share repurchases after some discussions with shareholders  and obviously looking at the value that we ve been trading at  And I don t think we have a hard value that we would say   hey  we trigger one to the other   I think we were in this mode where we see significant value in the shares  and we re going to continue to use our excess cash flow for share repurchases over that period  and I think that served us well  I think what we re going to continue to do as we ve always done  Have a balanced approach to our capital management strategy  which starts  obviously  with our common dividend  And we ve been gradually increasing it over the years  And I think we would expect to continue to gradually increase it to match the growth rate of the business  of course  to offset any compensation dilution  And after that  after we figure out whatever cash we need in the business  the rest will be returned to shareholders  And we make those decisions as we go throughout the year  But right now  we re very    we feel good about the business  As Ken said  we feel good about the outlook as we go into this coming year  And I think that ll    our goals will be to continue on our current plan of repurchasing shares  Look  I would say our capital management strategy as a whole  our goal is very clear  you know  to be prudent  but as well as opportunistic in capital structure and capital management  And I think we ve been doing that Michael Brown    KBW    Analyst Great  Thanks  guys OperatorThank you  We ll now take our next question from Jeff Harte of Piper Sandler Jeffery Harte    Piper Sandler    Analyst Good morning  guys  A couple for me  Looking at noncomp expense  I mean  really only being up 3  year over year in 2018 despite all the investments  is  I think  pretty good  Should we be thinking about a similar growth rate in 2020  given that you re still investing Evan Russo    Chief Financial Officer Yeah  So look  as we ve said  that we expect the noncomp to come out even a little higher than it did  I think we focused  as we ve gone through the beginning of this year  with revenues falling  to really tighten up a little bit  I think some of the benefits came from pushing out some of the expenses into next year  And so I think we re expecting to see additional growth in noncomp  We expect it to remain at elevated levels over the coming quarters as more of the technology projects that we ve really started over the last 18 months start to roll in into the noncomp line and we start amortizing those expenses  So I think we would expect to see it continue to grow or probably at or above that level and going back to sort of where the averages have been for most of this year Jeffery Harte    Piper Sandler    Analyst OK  And something I don t tend to ask much about  but the corporate segment  Revenues were pretty strong there relative to at least what we were expecting  Are there items to highlight there  And is there also kind of a starting point as far as the run rate that we should think about for that line Evan Russo    Chief Financial Officer Sure  So look  we had higher corporate revenues this year  As you know  there s lots of components that go into the corporate line for us  It s everything that doesn t really go into the businesses  And there s just a lot of components  Everything from the cash and returns that we get on cash  as you know that that s been changing as rates have gone up around the world and our cash position starts to earn some benefits  FX revaluations  any insurance proceeds  But most importantly  it s related to other investments  So legacy private equity that we have on the balance sheet as well as all of our seed portfolio that we have for our Asset Management business  Any of the hedged and unhedged components  any gains or losses go through the corporate revenue line  So    and as you know  it can be a little bit of volatility from quarter to quarter  This quarter  I think a lot of those things kind of moved in our direction  and so we have about  12 million of corporate revenue  I d say  for the year   29 million  certainly at the higher end of where we ve been historically  I think from a framework of when we start at the beginning of the year  we kind of think  on average  if you go back over the last two or three years   3 million to  5 million is probably the right area  But again  there s going to be a lot of volatility because there s a lot of components there that move  and they re just not controllable in many cases Jeffery Harte    Piper Sandler    Analyst OK  And on kind of little kind of deeper thought  I guess  You mentioned earlier  and you have been mentioning about systems and kind of data and investments there and the ability to identify opportunities early  I get that in Asset Management  Can you talk a little bit about how that s may be helping the advisory business  which had kind of historically I thought of as more pure relational Kenneth Jacobs    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah  So I think    let me step back  The advisory business  you re right  relationships matter enormously  But if you sort of think about what we re effectively doing in the advisory business  on one hand  we re helping guide boards  senior managements in making big strategic decisions and then helping execute those decisions  And in many respects  we re trying to predict the outcomes before they happen  And one of the key outcomes we re trying to predict is stock price performance around specific events  and those events can be anything from a sale  a spin off  an acquisition of an asset or of a company  a repurchase program  change in allocation of capital  among other things  And a big part of that is prediction and event prediction  what s going to happen around this event  And part of that is predicting shareholder behavior  And so a lot of our efforts are going into seeing if we can develop tools that better predict what is going to happen around these events  And if you think of many of the advances in data science and machine learning and AI  it s really to improve your capacity to predict better  And that s where we re focusing our entry    energy Jeffery Harte    Piper Sandler    Analyst OK  Thank you OperatorThank you  We ll now take our next question from Jim Mitchell of Buckingham Research Jim Mitchell    Buckingham Research    Analyst Hey  good morning  Ken  maybe just a bigger picture question on   You seem  obviously  a little bit better about the environment going into the year  I guess given all the different pockets of revenue  whether it s Capital Advisory  Sovereign Advisory  M A  what are you  I guess  most excited about in terms of the growth prospects from here over the next 12 to 24 months  Where do you see the greatest opportunity  And where are you investing the most Kenneth Jacobs    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Good question  So one of the great things about our franchise in the advisory side is we have enormous white space  so there s a plethora of places where there s opportunity to invest  And so part of our challenge is just drilling down on the places where we think there is the most opportunity and the best chance for success  I think a few areas that sort of jump out or following the trends of where capital is going  and one of the things that s happening is  obviously  an enormous amount of capital is going toward alternative investments  private equity  private investments  And one of the things which we are really focused on is making sure that we re well positioned to capitalize on that trend  On the advisory side  that means making sure that we are really well positioned with what we describe as the crosscut market  what we think of as private owners of assets  That could be the sponsored universe  but increasingly  it s families  and many of the large pension funds and positioning ourselves  And net flow of capital is very important  that also helps drive our PCA business  So that s another area which is very important  and of course  making sure that we re really focused on the things that drive our business as a whole  which are relationships with big important companies doing the most important things they do  And then also making sure that we re sort of on the cutting edge in terms of capabilities around advice  which we ve demonstrated  I think  in making sure that our shareholder activism practice is on the cutting edge  both in the United States and now especially in Europe  where I think we re easily the market leader there Jim Mitchell    Buckingham Research    Analyst OK  That s helpful  And is there any long term opportunity for    in China as they open up their markets  Is that something that you think you need to start positioning for or feel well positioned for if that happens Kenneth Jacobs    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Well  I think  on the advisory side  we re very well positioned for that  We have an outstanding team in China that I think is probably easily one of the handful of best advisory practices in China  with a full team built out based in a mix of Beijing and Hong Kong  And then on the asset management side of the business  I think some of the changes in the regulatory environment in China opened up some significant opportunities for all asset managers in terms of distribution  and that s something we are keeping our eye on Jim Mitchell    Buckingham Research    Analyst Great  great  Thanks OperatorThank you  We ll now take our next question from Manan Gosalia of Morgan Stanley  Please go ahead  Your line is open Manan Gosalia    Morgan Stanley    Analyst Hi  Good morning Kenneth Jacobs    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Morning Manan Gosalia    Morgan Stanley    Analyst I was wondering if you could just give us an update on the business realignment that you had took last quarter  So on the Asset Management side  I think you previously mentioned that there would be a  300 million to  400 million drag on AUM growth associated with the strategies that you were closing down  So is that already in the run rate now  And maybe separately  you can also talk about how you re thinking about reinvesting some of the dry powder that you created from that realignment Evan Russo    Chief Financial Officer Sure  So as you mentioned  we announced in Q3 business realignment  We expected it to go through Q3 and Q4  We completed our program in Q4  As we said  it impacted approximately 200 employees  split between Financial Advisory  Asset Management and corporate  I think  as you mentioned  I mean  given the current environment for the first half of this year  we saw the business performance  We wanted to get ahead of the curve  We thought it was a good opportunity to take a hard look and identify areas of business strategies  some of the debts we ve made that we re performing slower or had less opportunity in the future  to take the initiative to kind of take those off the table and redeploy them in other areas  Now we re    we ve been continuously reinvesting throughout the year  and you can see that in the fact that our    even with the impacted employees relating to business realignment  our headcount is roughly flat  within 1  of where we started the year  So we ve been continuously to reinvesting this into the areas that we continue to see as bigger opportunities  So this is more    for us  is sort of self funding some of the growth opportunities and the investments we ve been wanting to make  And I think a lot of that has to relate to the areas where Ken has mentioned that we see bigger opportunities in the future  Some of the components of Financial Advisory  where we think the biggest opportunity is from a white space perspective  as we ve talked about in the past  And also the Asset Management  just making sure we re putting resources in areas of growth  such as alternatives and others and just redeploying on a consistent basis into the areas that are doing well and have greatest opportunity Manan Gosalia    Morgan Stanley    Analyst Got it  And then just a quick one for me on the noncomp side  You mentioned you increased marketing and business development this quarter  Where are you spending the incremental dollars  And is that a change in strategy at the margin  Or is that just normal quarter to quarter volatility Evan Russo    Chief Financial Officer Yeah  It s normal quarter to quarter volatility  I mean it s really marketing business development throughout this year was a little bit higher than it s been in the past  As we saw the slowdown in revenue  specifically in the Financial Advisory business  we had higher marketing costs as we spent more time on the road engaging with clients  and that s just natural in the business there  I don t think there s any material change in the way in which we re managing the business or seeing the tight spend we re doing  This has always   it kind of comes up and down  depending on business activity  depending on closing  the kind of the types of reimbursements we get from clients  So I think it s sort of in that range  And I don t think there s anything specific there that I would call out Manan Gosalia    Morgan Stanley    Analyst Got it  Thanks very much Operator Operator signoff  Duration  41

BOSTON  Reuters    Financial public relations firm ICR will announce on Thursday that it launched a business to advise corporate boards on governance matters and hired fund industry veteran Lyndon Park to lead it  CEO Tom Ryan said on Wednesday 
Park  44  joins ICR and its newly created Governance Advisory Solutions practice from Dimensional Fund Advisors where he was head of global corporate governance for the Austin  Texas based investment firm  Earlier in his career Park was a vice president with investment giant BlackRock s Investment Stewardship unit 
Park will aim to work with corporate boards on issues ranging from board composition to succession planning and what shareholders  including powerful index funds  expect from corporations in the areas of environmental  social and governance programs

NYSE LAZ   Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research 5 Excellent Dividend Growth Stocks to Beat May SwoonWith the start of May  investors have turned cautious given the long history of weak performance during the summer months  May to October  per the old adage  Sell in May and Go Away   Amid such a scenario  honing in on the dividend growth strategy seems to the best practice  This is because investors can enjoy rising current income while awaiting capital appreciation irrespective of market conditions Why Dividend Growth Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies  which are less susceptible to large swings in the market  and thus act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility  At the same time  these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts Additionally  these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term  These include a sustainable business model  a long track of profitability  rising cash flows  good liquidity  a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics  Further  a history of strong dividend growth indicates that dividend increase is likely in the future Moreover  a history of dividend growth year over year leads to a healthy portfolio with greater scope of capital appreciation as opposed to simple dividend paying stocks or those with high yields  Although these stocks do not necessarily have the highest yields  they have outperformed for a longer period than the broader stock market or any other dividend paying stock And that s what we re screening for today For the rest of this Screen of the Week article please visit Zacks com at  Get the remaining

117103,338618,LAZ,China s Anbang abandons  14 billion bid to buy Starwood Hotels,news,"By Greg Roumeliotis  Reuters    China s Anbang Insurance Group Co said on Thursday it has abandoned its  14 billion bid for  Starwood Hotels    Resorts Worldwide Inc  N HOT   paving the way for Marriott International Inc  O MAR  to buy the Sheraton and Westin hotels operator  The surprise withdrawal marks an anticlimactic end to a bidding war that had pitted Marriott s ambitions to create the world s largest lodging company  with about 5 700 hotels  against Anbang s drive to create a vast portfolio of U S  real estate assets  It also represents a blow to corporate China s growing ambitions to acquire U S  assets  Anbang s acquisition of Starwood would have been the largest takeover of a U S  company by a Chinese buyer   We were attracted to the opportunity presented by Starwood because of its high quality  leading global hotel brands  which met many of our acquisition criteria  including the ability to generate consistent  long term returns over time   Anbang said in a statement   However  due to various market considerations  the consortium has determined not to proceed further   Anbang added  referring to the joint bid it had put together with private equity firms J C  Flowers   Co and Primavera Capital Ltd  Anbang did not offer Starwood a reason for not following through on its raised offer of March 26  according to people familiar with the matter  They asked not to be identified disclosing confidential discussions  Starwood said on Monday that Anbang had raised its offer to almost  14 billion  Anbang had been expected to firm up that non binding offer  so that Starwood would formally declare it superior to Marriott s  Anbang had already made a  13 2 billion binding and fully financed offer earlier this month  which Starwood accepted as superior  Had Marriott not counterbid on March 21  Starwood would have proceeded with the earlier Anbang offer  Starwood also said in a statement on Thursday that Anbang had withdrawn its offer  as a result of market considerations   which it did not specify  Marriott declined to provide immediate comment  The move fueled speculation on what drove Anbang to change course  especially given that many Chinese overseas acquisitions have been encouraged by the country s authorities  Chinese financial magazine Caixin reported earlier this month that China s insurance regulator would likely reject a bid by Anbang to buy Starwood  since it would put the insurer s offshore assets above a 15 percent threshold for overseas investments  Should Anbang have clinched an agreement with Starwood  it would have been scrutinized by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States  CFIUS   an interagency panel that reviews deals to ensure they do not harm national security  However  sources had said that both Starwood and Anbang believed the deal would have received CFIUS clearance   My guess is that Starwood wanted either a higher break up fee  maybe a billion dollars  or a higher price from Anbang to offset the risk   said Ryan Meliker  an analyst at Canaccord Genuity Group Inc  TO CF   In its latest offer  Anbang s consortium had offered  82 75 per share in cash  Marriott s latest cash and stock offer  which was announced on March 21  is worth around  75 per share  Starwood shareholders will also receive stock in  Interval Leisure  Group Inc  O IILG   worth  6 13 per Starwood share  This is the result of a deal last year to spin off Starwood s timeshare business and combine it with Interval Leisure Group  Starwood s shares fell 4 4 percent to  79 80 in extended trading  while Marriott shares fell 4 9 percent to  67 68  This indicates that some Marriott shareholders are disappointed that the company is moving ahead with the deal at such a high price  GLOBAL SHOPPING SPREE Anbang was established in 2004 as an automotive and property insurer by Chairman Wu Xiaohui  a native of China s entrepreneurial coastal city Wenzhou  The company has been leveraging its 1 65 trillion yuan   253 billion  in assets to transform into a worldwide investor  In October 2014  Anbang agreed to pay  1 95 billion for the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York  a move Wu said brought the insurer  extra brand recognition  and business opportunities  Earlier this month  Anbang agreed to pay Blackstone Group LP  N BX   6 5 billion for Strategic Hotels   Resorts Inc  whose 16 luxury properties include the Four Seasons Washington D C  Last year  Anbang agreed to buy U S  insurer Fidelity   Guaranty Life  N FGL  for  1 6 billion  and paid around  1 billion for South Korea s Tong Yang Life Insurance Co  KS 082640   It has also bought control of Fidea  a Belgium based insurer  and the Belgian banking operations of Dutch insurer  Delta Lloyd  NV  AS DLL   At home  Anbang has a leading stake in  China Minsheng Banking  Corp Ltd  600016 SS   HK 1988   the country s biggest private lender  and is a significant shareholder in  China Vanke  Co  000002 SZ   HK 2202   the largest residential property developer  The Starwood deal would give Marriott a greater presence in markets such as Europe  Latin America and Asia  and allow it to better compete with apartment sharing startups such as Airbnb  Marriott said last week it believed it could achieve  250 million in annual cost synergies within two years after closing the deal with Starwood  up from  200 million estimated in November 2015 when it signed its original merger agreement  Starwood and Marriott shareholders are

117145,338660,LAZ,Should Value Investors Pick Lazard  LAZ  Stock Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Lazard Ltd   NYSE LAZ   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Lazard has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 13 9  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 21 4  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Lazard s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  Moreover  the current level is fairly below the highs for this stock  suggesting it might be a good entry point Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 21 4  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers Nevertheless  we should point out that Lazard has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 14 7  so it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near future P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Lazard has a P S ratio of about 2 6  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 4 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  Lazard is towards the higher end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  which suggests that the company s stock price has already appreciated to some degree  relative to its sales Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Lazard currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Lazard a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 8 3  which is far better than the industry average of 13 0  Clearly  LAZ is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Lazard might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of B and a Momentum score of B  This gives LAZ a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mostly trending higher  While  the current quarter has not seen any estimate revisions in the past sixty days  the full year estimate has seen two upward and zero downward revisions in the same time period This has had a meaningful impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 5 6  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has increased 1 7   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Lazard Ltd  Price and Consensus    Even though Lazard has a better estimates trend  the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   That is why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineLazard is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Despite having a Zacks Rank  3  the stock belongs to an industry which is ranked among the Top 42   which indicates that broader factors are favorable for the company  In fact  over the past two years  the industry has outperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company s prospects  as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pick Zacks Editor in Chief Goes  All In  on This

117154,338669,LAZ,Western Advisers Help Egypt Remodel Its Economy After Sisi Takes Over,news,"By    Advisers from Western countries are trying to help Egypt s new leader Abdel Fattah al Sisi s administration  which has been struggling to remodel the country s economy  Reuters reported Saturday  Egypt  the most populous Middle Eastern country  is also benefitting from international support following Sisi s removal of the Muslim Brotherhood from power 
Egypt s allies in the Gulf region  including the United Arab Emirates  Saudi Arabia and Kuwait have sent nearly  12 billion in cash and petroleum products to the strife ridden country  If Egypt accepts the offer from the U S  financial services company Lazard Ltd  NYSE LAZ  a loan deal with the International Monetary Fund might be achieved  which would rekindle a level of trust necessary to spur investment 
 UAE are involved in the process  as they are among the country s lenders  Lending money is not enough in itself  You also need to make sure the government has the means to identify what needs to change and execute it   an official told Reuters 
Egypt s economy is predicted to grow at the rate of 3 2 percent for the next fiscal year ending 2015  while the country has been seeing a rapid increase in poverty and unemployment levels  Annual fuel subsidies in the country currently stand at nearly  19 billion  while issues like rampant corruption and a widening deficit have strangulated Egypt s economy 
 This should be changed  but that s a political decision  Bermuda  based Lazard can only make recommendations  but in the end the government will decide   the official told Reuters  referring to the efforts the American bank is taking by sending specialists to do research reforms that could be undertaken to help Egypt 
While the privatization of state owned firms was being explored by the previous leader Hosni Mubarak  who was ousted in 2011  and the current interim president  Adly Mansour  the announcement of any decision has been postponed because it would have been  a political decision  in the wake of the election 

But people close to Sisi have indicated that he might be willing to institute austerity measures  which previous leaders in the country have been hesitant to do  to get Egypt s economy on track 
  Management consultant  Booz  Allen  has been working for the past seven months on a reform plan in collaboration with the Egyptian military   Tarek Zakaria Tawfik  the deputy chairman of the Federation of Egyptian Industries  who met with Sisi in May and has talked to the consultants to determine what course of action the new government will take   
Salah Diab  an Egyptian industrialist familiar with the consulting project  said according to Reuters   If Sisi had intentions of maintaining the status quo regarding the unbalanced economic situation  he never would have entertained Booz   said  adding   Booz is preparing the Egyptian side     If we are going to sit with the IMF  we would be prepared to have an intelligent argument  ",2014-06-07,International Business Times,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/western-advisers-help-egypt-remodel-its-economy-after-sisi-takes-over-288478,288478

However  the company boasts an impressive earnings surprise history  It topped earnings in three of the trailing four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 19 9  
In the last quarter  the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate driven by higher net interest income and lower provisions  However  lower non interest income was an undermining factor

Factors to Affect Q3 ResultsExpenses Might Remain Flat  Fifth Third s ongoing strategic investments in several areas  such as technology  will increase expenses  However  the company might be successful in offsetting the expense growth through its North Star initiatives 
Revenues Might Decline  Owing to low volatility in the market and lack of sufficient mortgage banking activities  Fifth Third s fee income is likely to decline  Also  weak loan growth during the quarter might impact net interest income 
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of  1 55 billion indicates an 11 5  year over year decline Alleviated Pressure on Net Interest Margin  NIM   The interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve in June 2017 is likely to have a full quarter impact and should ease some margin pressure  However  higher deposit costs will likely offset this benefit to some extent  Management expects NIM to expand 2 basis points on a sequential basis Other Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other stocks you may want to consider  as according to our model they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter

dividend yields  All these makes dividend growth a quality and promising investment metric for the long term Further  a history of strong dividend growth indicates that dividend increase in the future is likely  This makes the portfolio healthy and safe  Though these stocks have a long history of outperformance compared with the broader stock market or any other dividend paying stock  it does not necessarily mean that they have the highest yields As a result  picking dividend growth stocks appear as winning strategies when some other parameters are also included 5 Year Historical Dividend

117210,338725,LAZ,5 Must Have Dividend Stocks For Small Gains In Second Half,opinion,The first half of the year has been splendid  with returns surpassing Wall Street estimates and being double of the average 4  gain since World War II  as per research firm CFRA  But  what could cap gains in the second half is an economy that s not expanding fast enough  policy gridlock  a more hawkish Federal Reserve and stock prices that are stretched Given the widespread uncertainty  investing in companies that pay consistent dividends can make for wonderful investment choices  Such companies are financially stable and mature  and can even generate steady cash flow irrespective of market conditions Small Upside for Stocks in the Second HalfThe Dow Jones and the S P 500 gained around 8  in the first six months of the year  their best performance since 2013  The Nasdaq Composite Index carved its best first half of a year since 2009  rising 14 1   Gains were driven by expectations that the Trump administration will deliver on the much awaited policy changes  strong corporate earnings  more confident consumers and an upbeat labor market However  the stock market is expected to rise marginally in the second half of the year  with the S P 500 projected to close the year at 2 460  just 1 1  above its Jul 5 close of 2 432 5  as per a Reuters poll  In fact  several poll participants projected a correction of at least 10  this year  something which the benchmark index hasn t witnessed since the beginning of 2016 It s hard to imagine a second half as strong as the first  Economic growth in the U S  is likely to disappoint in the second half as prospects of the much anticipated Trump administration policies continue to dwindle  An overly aggressive Fed  pricier U S  stocks and the cooling off of top performing tech stocks raised concerns  Let us now take a look at the factors that are expected to plague the broader markets in the second half Economic Growth Worries Loom  Policy GridlockThe International Monetary Fund  IMF  trimmed its projections for U S  economic growth to 2 1  this year from 2 3   The IMF curtailed its growth forecasts as it rejected Trump s tax cut and fiscal spending plans  The outlook for Trump s pro growth policies is also clouded as he failed to get the stimulus agenda passed  Senate Republicans were compelled to delay the healthcare vote due to lack of support  with Trump s administration seeing few legislative successes  Trump has repeatedly said that he wants to repeal and replace Obamacare before moving on to his other business friendly policies Trump  in the meanwhile  is promising to increase U S  economic growth to 3  a year during his first term  However  the IMF says that 3  goal is  an extremely optimistic growth assumption   With the U S  jobs market nearing full employment levels and slow gains in productivity  IMF believes it will be an uphill task to boost growth to 3   IMF also warned that lower and middle class Americans will bear the brunt of Trump s budget cuts in the near term Fed Rate Hike FearsLast month  Fed hiked rates for the second time in three months  They also stuck to their plans of another hike this year and issued forecasts that showed three more quarter point rate increases next year  similar to the projection issued in March  At the same time  minutes of the June 13 14 Federal Open Market Committee meeting showed that  several  officials were in favor of paring back its  4 trillion plus bond portfolio within a  couple of months   read more     Such tightening measures without a considerable pickup in economic growth are concerns for investors  Both the moves mean fewer stimuli for the broader markets Stocks Overvalued The market s big gains in the first half have drove the S P 500 s valuation  The benchmark index is trading at about 18 times its expected earnings over the next year  which is close to its priciest in over a decade  Double digit gains among key internet stocks were mostly responsible for such big gains  read more    But  lofty valuations have raised a lot of question whether investors still have faith in the fast growing tech sector  The tech heavy Nasdaq  which is up more than 14  this year  has been trading below its Jun 8 record close  a clear indication that investors are hesitant to push the index higher  Moreover  as stocks are no longer cheap  it will take a stronger economic rebound to make them look attractive  But  as mentioned above  the latest IMF report has poured cold water on such prospects Play Safe with These 5 Dividend Stocks in the Second HalfThanks to the aforementioned factors  the second half is certainly cast into uncertainty  This calls for investing in dividend paying stocks which boast immense financial strength and are immune to market vagaries  Such stocks reflect solid financial structure  healthy underlying fundamentals and better quality business  They have also raked in excellent risk adjusted returns this year  while their large customer base  sustainable business model  long track of profitability and strong liquidity allow them to offer sizable yields on a regular

117214,338729,LAZ,5 Market Beating Dividend Stocks For Steady Growth,opinion,"Though the stock market are at all time highs  geopolitics  Washington turmoil  and Fed s dovish views make dividend investing a perfect choice  These cash payouts are major sources of consistent income for investors when returns from the equity market are at risk In particular  stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth as opposed to those that pay high yields form a healthy portfolio with more scope for capital appreciation Why Dividend Growth Stocks Dividend growth stocks offer the best of both worlds    potential for capital appreciation and rising income even in a volatile market  This is because these stocks belong to mature companies  which are less susceptible to large swings in the

E TRADE Financial Corporation Price and EPS Surprise   Earnings Whispers
Will the upcoming earnings release give a further boost to the E TRADE s stock  A lot depends on whether the firm posts a beat for the fifth straight quarter  However  our quantitative model does not conclusively predict a beat  Here s why 
E TRADE doesn t have the right combination of the two key ingredients   a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or at least 2  Buy  or 3  Hold    to increase the odds of an earnings beat

Margin Pressure to Ease  The rate hikes in 2017 are likely to ease margin pressure  However  lower treasury yields might curb this improvement to some extent 
Growth in Client Assets  On the back of decent equity performance in the quarter  evident from 3  growth in the S P 500 Index  it is likely that the company will experience a rise in client assets 
Lower Trading Revenues  Owing to low volatility in the bond and equity markets  E TRADE Financial s trading revenues might decline in the second quarter Activities of E TRADE during the quarter were inadequate to win analysts  confidence  As a result  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter remained stable over the last seven days

117221,338736,LAZ,Can Citizens  CFG  Maintain Its Earnings Beat Streak In Q2 ,opinion,"Citizens Financial Group  Inc    NYSE CFG   is scheduled to report second quarter 2017 results on Jul 21  before the market opens  The company is expected to witness year over year growth in revenues and earnings 
Further  Citizens Financial boasts an impressive surprise history  It surpassed earnings estimates in each of the trailing four quarters  with an average positive surprise of 9 1  
The Providence  RI based bank s organic growth was reflected in first quarter 2017 results  which witnessed continued rise in loan and deposit balances  On the downside  the company recorded increased expenses and provisions 
The stock has gained 3 9  over the last six months versus the Zacks categorized  industry s decline of 2 6  
Citizens Financial Group  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise   Will the rally in stock price continue post second quarter earnings release  It majorly depends on whether the firm is able to maintain its earnings beat trend 
Why a Likely Positive Surprise Our proven model shows that Citizens Financial has the right combination of two key ingredients   positive  and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better   to increase the odds of an earnings beat Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  stands at  1 70   This is a major indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise 
You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Zacks Rank  Citizens Financial s Zacks Rank  2  Buy  when combined with a positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat 
Factors to Drive Better than Expected ResultsLoan Growth  Though the quarter witnessed slow loan growth due to lack of any tangible progress on the regulatory reform front  slight growth in the loan balances can be expected due to the optimism prevailing in the market  Further  management expects loan growth to be modest on a sequential basis Pressure on Net Interest Margin  NIM  Might Ease  The latest hike in interest rates might be successful in easing some margin pressure  However  the contraction in the three month 10 year Treasury spread might offset some benefits Controlled Expenses  Expenses in the second quarter are usually affected seasonally by personnel benefits related expenses and variable compensation related to mortgage banking activity  However  it is likely that Citizens Financial s cost base will remain controlled due to its TOP III Efficiency initiatives Fee Income to Decline  Fee income might decline in the second quarter as a higher interest rate environment is likely to dampen mortgage banking business  However  improved capital markets are anticipated to be a favorable factor Activities of Citizens Financial during the quarter were inadequate to win analysts  confidence  As a result  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter remained unchanged at 59 cents over the last seven days

117222,338737,LAZ,Should Value Investors Pick Lazard  LAZ  Stock Right Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Lazard Ltd   NYSE LAZ   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Lazard has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 13 75  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 20 63  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Lazard s current PE ratio somewhat below its midpoint  which is 16 73  over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified Financial   Investment Management industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 17 24  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Lazard has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 13 74  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Lazard stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Lazard has a P S ratio of about 2 54  This is somewhat lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 20 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Lazard currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  A   putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes LAZ a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Lazard might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  C  and a Momentum score of  F   This gives LAZ a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  B    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current quarter has seen two estimates go higher in the past sixty days  compared to none lower  while the full year estimate has seen a similar trend in the same time period This has had a favorable impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has increased about 6 8  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has risen by about 2 1   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Lazard Ltd  Price and Consensus    This positive trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and why we are looking for better performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineLazard is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Boasting a decent industry rank  top 32  out of more than 250 industries  and a strong Zacks Rank  the company deserves attention right now  In fact  over the past one year  the Zacks Financial   Investment Management sector has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company s prospects  as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pick Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set

117247,338762,LAZ,Fed Minutes Hint At Rate Hike In June  Top 5 Gainers,opinion,Minutes from the Federal Reserve s May 2 3 meeting showed that policymakers anticipate a rate hike soon  possibly in the central bank meeting next month  At the same time  by agreeing to shrink the balance sheet gradually over a number of years  the Federal Open Market Committee has minimized possibilities of market gyrations and its impact on economic growth This calls for investing in banks  insurance and brokerage houses as such institutions will see a ramp up in profits on an interest rate hike and stable economic conditions Fed Forecasts Rate Hike  Soon Federal Reserve s latest policy meeting showed that officials believe that an interest rate hike is in the cards  soon   And if economic reports come in as expected  the Fed could raise rates when it meets on Jun 13 14  a move that markets have been anticipating  Traders see a 79  chance of a rate hike in June  according to the CME Group  NASDAQ CME   Lest we forget  talks of a hike in January had not matured as the hike had come in March Several Fed officials have said in recent weeks that they see a strengthening economy which is enough to warrant two more quarter percentage point rate increases this year  In fact  officials plan to stick to this stance even if the economy has faced a minor hit in the first quarter  And while some doubted the recent softness in inflation  it wasn t able to knock them off the track  Most officials believe that the deceleration in price pressure was temporary  while only a few expressed concerns that progress toward the Committee s objective may have slowed  The Fed s preferred gauge of inflation  the personal consumption expenditures index  did  briefly exceed the Fed s annual 2  target in February  but  registered a greater than expected drop in March Fed officials  in the meantime  expect job additions  rise in household income and an upbeat consumer sentiment to bolster spending levels in the months ahead  and they took great comforts in improvement in business investments  This in turn could warrant a faster pace of rate hikes Gradual   Predictable Reduction in Fed s Balance SheetThe Fed also moved toward a consensus on a proposal to gradually unwind the massive balance sheet built up over the course of the asset buying program that was the core of Fed s quantitative strategy   Beginning late 2008  the Fed started to accumulate treasury and mortgage backed securities to counter a complete collapse of the financial system But the Fed does not want to reduce the massive  4 5 trillion balance sheet at one go  Rather  it plans to let it shrink as the securities mature  The Fed officials did agree to end the reinvestment of principal of maturing securities in slow but increasing stages  Such an approach will stay on auto pilot  until and unless there is major deterioration in the domestic economic front With interest rate hikes and balance sheet reduction  investors may fear that economic tightening will occur too soon  But  nearly all Fed officials agree to a slow and cautious approach toward unwinding the balance sheet  which won t slow down the economy drastically Who Stands to Benefit Higher interest rates can boost bank profits as they increase the spread between what banks earn by funding longer term assets  such as loans  with shorter term liabilities  The spread between long term and short term rates also expands during interest rate hikes because long term rates tend to rise faster than short term rates Non banking financial institutions including insurance companies  asset managers and brokerage firms should also benefit  Rising rates act as a boon for insurance companies as they derive their investment income from investing premiums  which are received from policyholders in corporate and government bonds  Yields and coupons on these bonds rise in response to a hike in Fed fund rates and bank interest rates  This enables life insurers to invest their premiums at higher yields and earn more investment income  expanding their profit margins  Not only investment income  which is an important component of insurers  top line  annuity sales should gain from a higher rate environment Brokerage firms and asset managers also advantage immensely from a rising rate environment since an increase in rates generally concurs during periods of economic strength and upbeat investor sentiments Top 5 PicksGiven the aforementioned benefits  we have selected five sturdy stocks from these areas that boast a solid Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   The search was also narrowed down with a of  A  or  B   Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of

Company  which is a commercial bank  It provides commercial and retail financial services to customers located in its market areas  Select Bancorp has a Zacks Rank  2 and a VGM score of  B   The

117274,338789,LAZ,Is Lazard  LAZ  A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Lazard Ltd    NYSE LAZ   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Lazard has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 12 78  This level compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE ratio for the S P 500 comes in at about 20 01 If we focus on the long term trend of the stock the current level puts Lazard s current PE near its lows over the observed period  This suggests that the stock is undervalued compared to its own historical levels and thus it could be a suitable entry point from the PE perspective Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified Finance   Investment Management industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 14 96  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers PS RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Lazard has a P S ratio of about 2 36  This is lower than the Zacks categorized Finance   Investment Management industry average  which comes in at 3 43 right now If anything  LAZ is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Lazard currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  B   putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Lazard an apt choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Lazard might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  C  and a Momentum score of  B   This gives LAZ a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  B    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s earnings estimates have been trending upwards lately  The current quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days compared to one lower  while the full year estimate has seen two upward revisions and no downward revisions in the same time period This has had a meaningful impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate has moved higher by 1 5  over the past month  while the full year estimate has increased 5 7   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Lazard Ltd  Price and Consensus   This positive trend signifies bullish analyst sentiment  and its Zacks Rank  2  Buy  indicates robust fundamentals and expectations of outperformance in the near term Bottom LineLazard is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Boasting a good industry rank  Top 39  out of more than 250 industries  and a strong Zacks Rank  the company deserves attention right now Notably  in 2016  Lazard acquired Verus Partners and its remaining stake in MBA Lazard  to fortify its financial advisory business footprint across America  Meanwhile  though the company s dependence on local and global economic conditions for revenue generation and regulatory pressure can hurt top line growth in the near term  it is well positioned to grow organically  driven by its strength in its Financial Advisory and Asset Management segments  Further  focus on cost management should enhance the company s profitability  Also  strong capital deployment activities help to boost shareholders  value So  it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company s prospects  as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pick Looking for Ideas with Even Greater Upside Today s investment ideas

117278,338793,LAZ,5 Dividend Growth Stocks For Guaranteed Returns,opinion,"Investors have turned cautious given that the stock market has a long history of weak performance during the summer months  May to October  per the old adage  Sell in May and Go Away   Amid such a scenario  falling back on the dividend growth strategy seems the best practice  This is because investors can enjoy rising current income while awaiting capital appreciation irrespective of market conditions Dividend Growth StrategyStocks that have a strong history of dividend growth generally act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as these belong to mature companies  which are less susceptible to large swings in the market while simultaneously offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts These stocks have superior fundamentals as opposed to their traditional dividend counterparts such as a sustainable business model  a long track record of profitability  rising cash flows  good liquidity  strong balance sheet and some value characteristics  They have a history of outperformance over the long term but not necessarily high dividend yields  All these makes dividend growth a quality and promising investment metric for the long term Further  a history of strong dividend growth indicates that a future dividend increase is likely  This makes the portfolio healthy and safe Here are the screening parameters that could result in a winning dividend growth portfolio 5 Year Historical Dividend Growth greater than zero  This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history 5 Year Historical Sales Growth greater than zero  This represents stocks with a strong record of growing revenue 5 Year Historical EPS Growth greater than zero  This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history Next 3 5 Year EPS Growth Rate greater than zero  This represents the rate at which a company s earnings are expected to grow  Improving earnings should help companies sustain dividend payments Price Cash Flow less than M Industry  A ratio less than M industry indicates that the stock is undervalued in that industry and that an investor needs to pay less for better cash flow generated by the company 52 Week Price Change greater than S P 500  Market Weight   This ensures that the stock appreciated more than the S P 500 over the past one year Top Zacks

117285,338800,LAZ,Janus Capital Keeps Aside Severance Payments For Executives,opinion,"Janus Capital Group  Inc    NYSE JNS   kept aside around  55 5 million as potential severance payments for its five senior executives  critical in making the Janus Henderson merger successful  as reported by the Financial Times 
These payments are usually made in case of a merger  if an executive s responsibility is changed considerably or the annual pay is reduced  Companies use this as a strategy to retain key people and to encourage them to cater to the shareholders  needs

President of Janus International  Augustus Cheh will receive  2 6 million as his position has been given to the current executive chairman of Henderson 
The agreement shall become invalid after two years of the merger completion  The company does not expect to make any other payment as four of the five executives have been offered new roles in the combined company  Janus Henderson Global Investors plc 
Per the report  this move has led to resentmentin the staffon account of the large amount involved  The combined company is expected to achieve  110 million of annual cost savings by laying off about 2200 employees from both the companies 
The merger agreement is expected to result in revenue growth opportunities  While the company s efforts to expand business through strategic investments are encouraging  escalating expenses remain an undermining factor

117317,338832,LAZ,5 Top Dividend Picks To Cast Out Sell In May Spell,opinion,Market returns justify the popular  Sell in May  adage  Broader markets traditionally post meager returns in the May October period  thanks to lower trading volumes in summer  while the November April period witnesses a substantial increase in investments Of late  stock gains have been muted by a series of tepid U S  economic reports  with the only exception being tech stocks  The tech laden Nasdaq closed at a record high  crossing the 6000 barrier  However  we shouldn t expect things to be as rosy as in 1999  when the index had gone beyond the 5000 mark buoyed by the tech bubble  Sadly  it had taken just a few years for the index to plunge to a low of 1 108 49 after the bubble burst Since the election  the markets have been riding high on President Trump s tax reform policies  The White House rolled out the opening salvo of Trump s massive tax cut plan  but  the one page set of bullet points lacked specifics  a sheer disappointment for investors At the same time  there are two primary factors plaguing the stock market  Oil prices look weak  a major drag on energy shares  while U S  treasury yields losing all of its post election gains aren t looking beneficial for banking stocks right now  In the wake of this  investing in companies that pay consistent dividends can make for wonderful investments  Such companies are financially stable and mature  and can even generate steady cash flow irrespective of market conditions A Slew of Weak Economic ReportsStock gains may have been muted by a series of tepid U S  economic reports  The economy saw the slowest growth in the first quarter in over three years  while construction spending slipped from record highs in March and U S  factory activity cooled off a bit in April  To top it  consumer confidence lagged last month levels as Americans lost faith in the economy US Economy Saw Weakest Growth in 3 YearsU S  economy in the first quarter pointed to weakest growth in three years  owing to the slightest increase in consumer spending since the end of 2009 and a slowdown in the pace of inventory investment  As per the Bureau of Economic Analysis  real gross domestic product  GDP  increased at an annual rate of 0 7  in the first quarter of 2017  less than the consensus expectation of 1 2   The last quarter of 2016 recorded real GDP growth of 2 1  The slowdown in first quarter GDP growth is primarily attributable to sluggish consumer spending  Consumer spending increased 0 3   marking the smallest increase since the last quarter of 2009  Number of purchases of durable goods  including big ticket items  such as cars and refrigerators declined  Spending on services also recorded the slowest growth in four years  Government spending at state and local levels also declined 1 7   marking its steepest fall in four years Construction Spending Slips  Manufacturing Expansion SlowsPause in construction investment after five straight months of increases led to decline in construction spending in March  Less spending in the nonresidential and government sectors led to the decline  According to the Commerce Department  construction outlays slipped 0 2  in March  in contrast to analysts  expected increase of 0 4  Economic activity in the manufacturing industry didn t expand as much as economists had anticipated for the month of April  The nation s factory activity dropped to 54 8 in April  the weakest since December  as per the Institute for Supply Management  U S  manufacturers scaled back hiring while demand for new products ebbed Consumers Lag ConfidenceThe degree of optimism that consumers feel about the overall state of the economy and their personal financial situation also took a beating last month  The consumer confidence index fell to 120 3 in April  while economists were expecting the index to fall to only 122 9 Consumers  assessment of current economic conditions dipped in April as lesser number of investors believed that business conditions are  good   Individuals that believe that business conditions are  good  declined to 30 2  in April from 32 4   while those who deemed conditions as  bad  increased to 13 8  from 13 1   Consumers  outlook for the labor market also declined to 23  from 23 8  Trump s Tax Plan Lacks DetailThe highly anticipated Trump s tax plan missed a number of important details  This bothered investors and also led to weakness in the broader markets  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn laid out the plan that calls for three new income tax brackets  with rates of 10   25  and 35   down from the current seven brackets  But  it does not specify the income levels associated with each bracket Another vital detail miss is pertaining to the repatriation tax  The one time tax will permit companies to bring overseas profits back into the U S  at a lower tax rate  In this regard  the new plan does not provide any detail  unlike the earlier proposal that levied a 5 25  tax on money returning to the country 5 Safe Dividend Stocks for MayDealing with dividend stocks is the best practice

    Shares of Comerica gained 38 0  over the past six months  outperforming the Zacks categorized  industry s 26 6  growth 
Factors to Influence Q1 ResultsFee Income Strength  Non interest income might get a lift owing to Comerica s several new initiatives  including enhanced product offerings  Further  the to be reported quarter might exhibit higher card fees and fiduciary income  as the company remains focused on cross selling opportunities 
Sluggish Loan Growth  Owing to the uncertainties over Trump s policy goals  banks faced sluggish loan growth in the last few months  We can expect this loan trend to partially offset the increase in revenues derived from the rate hikes Easing Pressure on Net Interest Margin  While loan growth remained tepid during the quarter  the two rate hikes since Dec 2016 might have eased some pressure on Comerica s net interest margin  NIM  Effective Cost Saving Initiatives  Expenses might trend downward in the upcoming release due to the company s GEAR Up expense savings initiatives  However  it can be partly offset by expenses related to the restructuring projects undertaken by Comerica Energy Portfolio Exposures  The performance of Comerica s energy portfolio  representing less than 5  of total loans  improved during fourth quarter 2016  Management remains cautious and believes that the company is adequately prepared with reserve allocation of over 7  of energy loans as of Dec 31  2016  We believe  given the rebound in oil prices  the allowances tied with energy portfolio should not be significant  Though management considers the company s exposures manageable  risk grade migration within the energy portfolio may lead to higher provisions Activities of Comerica during the quarter were adequate to win analysts  confidence  Over the last seven days  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter s earnings increased to  1 01

117414,338929,LAZ,5 Top Trade Ideas For This Week  ASH  FMER  LAZ  MRK  RHT,opinion,"Here are the Rest of the Top 10 
Ashland Inc  NYSE ASH 
Ashland  ASH  was a Top 10 pick when it broke above the base in March  Since then it had a strong run higher to a new base  Last week it reported earnings and fell hard  to the bottom of the base it has jumped out of  But it ended the week with some bottoming action  The RSI is turning back up but the MACD remains in a downtrend  Look for a reversal higher to participate   
FirstMerit Corporation  NASDAQ FMER 
FirstMerit  FMER  rose from the February low with a quick gap higher and then continued to a high in June  The pullback had found support until it moved lower following the Brexit vote  That made a new low under the 200 day SMA  After consolidation it moved back higher and stabilized  The end of last week saw the price lift out of that stability  The RSI is rising and bullish and the MACD is moving higher in the bullish zone  Look for continuation to participate to the upside   
Lazard Ltd  NYSE LAZ 
Lazard  LAZ  fell with the market to start 2016  making a bottom in February  A bounce in March met resistance and it started lower again  ended with a lower low in June  Since then it has moved higher and last week went through resistance Friday  The RSI is now in the bullish zone and the MACD is rising  Look for continuation to participate to the upside   
Merck  NYSE MRK 
Merck  MRK  started higher off of a low in February and ran to the middle of April  A small pullback and it then made a higher high and consolidated before another run higher  The pullback from that was in a bull flag pattern and broke to the upside  out of the flag Friday  before pulling back  The RSI has held in the bullish zone and the MACD is falling but positive  Look for a move over Friday s high to participate to the upside

Red Hat  RHT  also moved up off of the February low and then consolidated under 76 for over 2 months  It broke that to the upside and successfully retested it before a push higher in June  That failed and it sold off to the prior channel low  Since then it has been slowly moving higher and is now back at resistance  The RSI is crossing the mid line as it moves higher and the MACD is rising and about to turn positive  Look for a push through resistance to participate to the upside  
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad  picture reviewed Friday which heading into August sees the Equity markets still look strong but the smaller cap and technology laden indexes stronger than the large caps 
Elsewhere look for Gold to continue its uptrend while Crude Oil continues lower  The US Dollar Index looks better to the downside short term while US Treasuries are biased higher  The Shanghai Composite looks like it will continue to drift lower while Emerging Markets move higher

117438,338953,LAZ,Tuesday s Small Cap BioPharma Strong Buys For Consideration,opinion,At Stockmatusow com  my team of traders and investors scan the biotech sector daily  looking for stocks we believe provide excellent trading and investment opportunities  We factor in potential price moving catalyst events along with chart technicals and current news events  then pick what we feel are the best stocks  Peregrine Pharmaceuticals  PPHM  Buying factor  Company  stating it found an error in the study data for its Phase II drug  Bavituximab  that caused the data to appear to be negative  Selling factor  Overbought Peregrine said the problems  first disclosed in September  are limited to the 1 milligram dose of the drug  After reviewing testing procedures at various trial sites  the company said there is no evidence that the problems affected results for the 3 milligram treatment of the arm  That study showed that patients taking the drug survived about 13 months after beginning treatment  The company is studying Bavituximab as a second option for non small cell lung cancer  Roth Capital Partners analyst Joseph Pantginis upgraded the company s shares to  Buy  from  Neutral   In a note to investors Pantginis said   We believe this is a major step forward for Peregrine in getting Bavi back on track  though the company is still faced with a bit of an uphill battle   In September of 2012  the company originally  a positive report on Bavituximab  causing the stock to surge  to over  5 a share  However  later in September  the company released a report stating that there was an error in the data  causing the stock to plunge from  5 39 to  1 16 in   While the company has a long way to go to gain investor trust back  the news yesterday is a step in the right direction  In my estimation  if the new report actually holds water this time  Peregrine could see the  4 level very soon  At yesterday s closing price of  2 43 and a market cap of  322 07M  Peregrine might have excellent speculation value at this level  Regardless  both traders and investors should understand that the company s track record with Bavituximab has been very shaky along with the stock potentially in an overbought situation  So  investors need to proceed with caution  The chart above indicates that the stock recently began to retrace its gap on significant volume  It seems the stock has run out of some steam at its current level  hitting hard resistance in the  2 50 range  I expect the stock to pull back and find support at the  1 65 level  If the data holds up this time  it s possible to see the price climb back over  4 a share in the next quarter or so  Pacific Biosciences of California  PACB  Buying Factor  Recent large insider buying  PACB stock struggled for most of 2012  but heavy insider buying along with a bullish chart indicate that the company might see a nice recovery for 2013  PACB develops  manufactures  and markets an integrated platform for genetic analysis  The company engages in developing a technology platform that enables single molecule  real time detection of biological processes  It primarily focuses on the deoxyribonucleic acid sequencing market  Recently  the CEO along with the CFO both agreed to a pay reduction down to a base salary of  1  This along with the pair s heavy insider buying  is a sign of committed management as far as I am concerned    The stock has been beaten up since its IPO in 2010  but recently has found a support level that indicates a move up  The inverted head and shoulders is very bullish and is just now testing the neckline after forming the final shoulder  A significant break of this can take the stock to the retrace and resistance level of  2 67  Sarepta Therapeutics  SRPT  Buying Factor  Possible early FDA approval for Eteplisen  On 10 3 12 Sarepta announced a positive increase in novel dystrophin using the drug Eteplirsen  where patients achieved a significant clinical benefit on a 6 Minute Walk test after 48 weeks of treatment for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy  DMD   After the 60 week data was released on 12 7 12  the company requested an end of Phase II meeting with the FDA which is expected to occur at the end of this month early February  At this time  Sarepta should receive an answer from the FDA how to proceed  The FDA could choose to grant Sarepta an accelerated approval right away or require a larger Phase III trial prior to approval  Because DMD is such a rare disease and because the data looks very promising  I predict the FDA will allow the accelerated approved  enacted as part of the FDA Safety   Innovation Act  This act encourages the FDA to consider a more efficient path for drugs that can treat rare diseases  The FDA could also allow Eteplirsen to market faster under another newly enacted provision  called  Breakthrough Therapy   Breakthrough Therapy is a new pathway that was developed for targeted cancer drugs  designed to drive a much closer interaction between sponsors of drugs that show large efficacy results in earlier clinical trials  Although Eteplirsen is designed to treat DMD  I believe the drug qualifies for accelerated approval under the guideline  If we hear word that the FDA has allowed Eteplirsen to market in this manner  I would expect the stock to explode much higher  possibly taking out its 52 week high of  45   Since the stock hit  45  it has come back down to reality  falling to a low around  21  Now the stock is setting up for another big move as indicated by a strong wedge shown in brown  I anticipate the stock to continue to oscillate in this range and coil up for a breakout  Enzon Pharmaceuticals  ENZN  Buying factor  Recent hiring of Lazard  LAZ  to serve as a financial advisor for the review of exploring selling the company  new large institutional position  and bullish chart technicals  On 12 17 12  Enzon  that its Board of Directors has retained Lazard to act as financial advisor in a review of the possible sale or disposition of one or more of the corporate assets  or a sale of the Company  The company announced on the same day its plan to suspend clinical development of its androgen receptor program due to poor clinical data surrounding the program  Alex Denner  Chairman of the Board  commented   The Board of Directors  following a review of the company s assets and strategic direction  has determined that it is in the best interest of Enzon s shareholders to pursue a sale  in whole or in part  of the company  In addition to a strong balance sheet and royalty revenues  Enzon s drug candidates and technologies offer the potential for a variety of transactions    Billionaire investor Carl Icahn has a 13  stake in the company  and has met with management to discuss the sale of the company as well  Also of note  Steelhead Partners  LLC purchased 2 7M shares of the company in December 2012  as shown in a  form 13G  Shares have been down since he announced that meeting in late November  but the chart shows that the stock is on the way back up   The stock has been in an extended down channel  but has recently shown signs of reversal  A break over  5 would be a key pivot point and over  5 15 would be very bullish as there would be a break of the trend line resistance  The MACD has recently crossed bullish and the RSI is bullish as well  still showing plenty of room to run  Enzon has good potential to bring in a decent sized premium upon a buyout  This one is not a rumor trade as the company is actively shopping the company around  I estimate the company s net assets to be worth around  170M  The company pulls in  50M in annual revenue and has a few high potential drugs in its pipeline  Being so cash rich with  278M on its books as well as just turning profitable in Q3 2012 means future dilution won t be necessary  Considering these factors  the company should be worth  350M  With the current outstanding share count of 44 42M  this equates to  7 87 a share  In my estimation  the fair buyout price should be around  7 a share ,2013-01-08,Scott

117451,338966,LAZ,Will CME Group Miss Q2 Earnings On Lower Volumes ,opinion,"Global futures exchange CME Group Inc   NASDAQ CME   is scheduled to release second quarter 2014 financial results before the opening bell on Jul 31 
In the last reported quarter  the company posted break even results  although the four quarter trailing average beat is pegged at 0 5   Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors at Play
CME Group s average daily volumes fell 12  year over year in the second quarter due to lower rate per contracts and sluggish volatility  Trading volumes account for a substantial portion of transaction fees revenues  a major revenue driver for the company 
Alongside  higher operating and interest expenses as well as capital expenditure are likely to adversely affect operating margins  which has been below the historical average of  60  over the last several quarters 
Moreover  risks from OTC markets and lack of any significant growth catalyst amid stiff competition and stringent regulations pose operational and financial risks  Alongside  a weak capital market and limited fund resources have compelled CME Group to delay its current share repurchase program  although dividend payouts continue to retain investors  confidence 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model shows that CME Group is unlikely to beat earnings as it lacks the required combination of two key components 
Zacks ESP  CME Group has a negative Zacks ESP  That is because the Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate of 79 cents per share and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 80 cents  is  1 25  
Zacks Rank  CME Group has a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   We caution against stocks with Zacks Rank  4 and 5  Sell rated stocks  going into an earnings announcement  
Other Stocks to Consider
Here are some other financial companies you may want to consider as our model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter  
Qiwi Plc  NASDAQ QIWI  has Earnings ESP of  4 76  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  
United Insurance Holdings Corp   NASDAQ UIHC  has Earnings ESP of  2 33  and a Zacks Rank  1

117452,338967,LAZ,Top Trade Ideas For The Week Of June 29th  2015,opinion,"Here are the Rest of the Top 10 
Abbott Laboratories  NYSE ABT 
Abbott Laboratories has shown steady progress higher since the October market low  with several  steps  along the way  Two weeks ago  it broke above resistance to start another step higher  and pulled back to retest the break out level last week  It held and is now moving back higher  The momentum indicators are positive  with the RSI in the bullish zone and the MACD rising and looking to avert a cross down 
Cognex  NASDAQ CGNX 
Cognex rose from a double bottom at 36 to a peak at 52 41 in April  From there  it created the familiar  V  recovery and has stalled  Friday put the stock at the lower Bollinger Band  with a second bottoming candle in a row  a Spinning Top Doji  With the RSI holding in the bullish zone  look for a reversal higher to get involved 
Lazard  NYSE LAZ 
Lazard also printed a double bottom  near 42  and has been rising since mid January  With a consolidation under resistance at 57 from April through mid June  it finally broke above 2 weeks ago  What makes it interesting is that it then back tested the breakout and held  reversing back higher Friday 
Northern Trust  NASDAQ NTRS 
Northern Trust looks very similar to Lazard  with the double bottom and run up to resistance  It broke above that resistance last week  and then consolidated with a drifting pullback that held above the break point  and reversed up Friday  The RSI is bullish and the MACD is avoiding a cross down  giving the upward bias 
Tractor Supply  NASDAQ TSCO 
Tractor Supply first appeared as a trade idea 2 weeks ago  as it broke above a symmetrical triangle  It has been consolidating that break out in a channel since  but well short of the target move  The RSI is bullish and rising  while the MACD is also rising  both supporting more upside price action 

After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad Market Macro picture reviewed Friday which  heading into the holiday shortened week  sees the equity markets continuing to look better on the longer timeframe  with some vulnerability on the short timeframe 
Elsewhere  look for gold to continue consolidation with a downward bias  while crude oil consolidates with an upward bias  The US dollar index continues to move sideways in broad consolidation after the uptrend  while US Treasuries are biased lower  The Shanghai Composite may finally be in the long awaited correction  while Emerging Markets are biased to the downside 
Volatility looks to remain subdued  keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETF s ARCA SPY  ARCA IWM and NASDAQ QQQ  Their charts continue to show the SPY and QQQ moving similarly on the shorter timeframe  while the IWM was stronger until late in the week  The rotation may be starting out of the small caps again  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well
