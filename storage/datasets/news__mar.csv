3694,225209,MAR,Exclusive  Clues in Marriott hack implicate China   sources,news,"By Christopher Bing  Reuters    Hackers behind a massive breach at hotel group Marriott International Inc  O MAR  left clues suggesting they were working for a Chinese government intelligence gathering operation  according to sources familiar with the matter  Marriott said last week that a hack that began four years ago had exposed the records of up to 500 million customers in its Starwood hotels reservation system  Private investigators looking into the breach have found hacking tools  techniques and procedures previously used in attacks attributed to Chinese hackers  said three sources who were not authorized to discuss the company s private probe into the attack   That suggests that Chinese hackers may have been behind a campaign designed to collect information for use in Beijing s espionage efforts and not for financial gain  two of the sources said   While China has emerged as the lead suspect in the case  the sources cautioned it was possible somebody else was behind the hack because other parties had access to the same hacking tools  some of which have previously been posted online   Identifying the culprit is further complicated by the fact that investigators suspect multiple hacking groups may have simultaneously been inside Starwood s computer networks since 2014  said one of the sources   If investigators confirm that China was behind the attack  that could complicate already tense relations between Washington and Beijing  amid an ongoing tariff dispute and U S  accusations of Chinese espionage and the theft of trade secrets   China firmly opposes all forms of cyber attack and cracks down on them in accordance with law   Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Geng Shuang told Reuters  If offered evidence  the relevant Chinese departments will carry out investigations according to law    Marriott spokeswoman Connie Kim declined to comment  saying  We ve got nothing to share   when asked about involvement of Chinese hackers  Marriott disclosed the hack on Friday  prompting U S  and UK regulators to quickly launch probes into the case   Compromised customer data included names  passport numbers  addresses  phone numbers  birth dates and email addresses  A small percentage of accounts included scrambled payment card data  said Kim  Marriott acquired Starwood in 2016 for  13 6 billion  including the Sheraton  Westin  W Hotels  St  Regis  Aloft  Le Meridien  Tribute  Four Points and Luxury Collection hotel brands  forming the world s largest hotel operator  The hack began in 2014  shortly after an attack on the U S  government s Office of Personnel Management  OPM  compromised sensitive data on tens of millions of employees  including application forms for security clearances  White House National Security advisor John Bolton recently told reporters he believed Beijing was behind the OPM hack  a claim first made by the United States in 2015   Beijing has strongly denied those charges and also refuted charges that it was behind other hacks  Former senior FBI official Robert Anderson told Reuters that the Marriott case looked similar to hacks that the Chinese government was conducting in 2014 as part of its intelligence operations    Think of the depth of knowledge they could now have about travel habits or who happened to be in a certain city at the same time as another person   said Anderson  who served as FBI executive assistant director until 2015    It fits with how the Chinese intelligence services think about things  It s all very long range   said Anderson  who was not involved in investigating the Marriott case and is now a principal with Chertoff Group   Michael Sussmann  a former senior Department of Justice official for its computer crimes section  said that the long duration of the campaign was an indicator that the hackers were seeking data for intelligence and not information to use in cyber crime schemes    One clue pointing to a government attacker is the amount of time the intruders were working quietly inside the network   he said   Patience is a virtue for spies  but not for criminals trying to steal credit card numbers   
FBI representatives could not immediately be reached for comment on the evidence linking the attack to China  A spokesperson said on Friday that the agency was looking into the attack  but declined to elaborate ",2018-12-06,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/exclusive-clues-in-marriott-hack-implicate-china--sources-1712483,1712483

The country has seen slower growth in tourism in recent years  versus global growth  and the part public body Brand USA is  critical to the U S  effectively competing for lucrative international tourism dollars   industry group U S  Travel Association said in a statement on Wednesday 
Executives from companies such as Seaworld Parks   Entertainment and Carnival  NYSE CCL  Cruise Line were also among those calling for federal funding of Brand USA  the statement shows 
The U S  Department of Commerce was not immediately available for comment after midnight on Wednesday 
Brand USA was established by the Travel Promotion Act of 2009 and began operations in 2011 to promote the country as a travel destination and to communicate visa and entry policies 
The organization receives a part of the fees collected from foreign visitors  but the U S  Congress approved a budget agreement in 2018 to divert this away from the program  in a move the Travel Association describes as a strong signal that the future of Brand USA may be in jeopardy

132569,354084,MAR,Trump brand to exit Toronto skyline after buyout deal,news,"TORONTO  Reuters    The name Trump will be removed from a high rise hotel and condo development in downtown Toronto after the project s new owner  JCF Capital ULC  reached a deal with Trump Hotels to buy out its management contracts for an undisclosed amount 
U S  President Donald Trump never owned the project  but his company had signed a long term branding and management deal with the building s developer  Talon International Development Inc  which defaulted on its construction loan last year 
JCF Capital ULC earlier this year bought units in the 65 story Trump International Hotel   Tower that were not owned by individuals in a court run sale 
In a statement announcing the buyout on Tuesday  JCF Capital did not say whether it had reached a deal yet with another group to take over the management and branding of the building in Toronto s financial district 
Sources told Reuters earlier in June that Marriott International Inc s  O MAR  St  Regis brand was the lead bidder to take over the brand and management rights  with one saying that the Trump Organization had agreed to sever its connections 
 We are pleased to have reached this agreement with JCF and have enjoyed our relationship with them as the new owners of this property   Eric Danziger  chief executive of Trump Hotels  said in the JCF statement 
JCF is a vehicle created by Juniper Capital Partners LLC and Cowie Capital Partners Inc to buy the tower 
Trump s business interest will receive at least  6 million for walking away from its long term contracts  and the Trump signage could be removed as early as Aug  1  Bloomberg reported  citing a person it did not identify 
The tower  which opened in 2012 after construction delays  has had a troubled history  including lawsuits from unhappy investors and has also been the scene of several protests against President Trump s policies and statements 
His business connections around the world have sparked lawsuits and criticism about potential conflicts of interest since he took office in January 
Since its opening  Talon had sold less than half of the tower s residential condos  and the hotel s occupancy rates have been lower than some investors in the rooms had hoped  A court last year ordered the developer to pay damages to one investor for  negligent misrepresentation  and for another sale to be rescinded ",2017-06-27,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/trump-hotels-agrees-to-buy-out-of-its-management-of-toronto-tower-499738,499738

NEW YORK  Reuters    A data breach at 20 U S  hotels operated by HEI Hotels   Resorts for Starwood  Marriott  Hyatt and Intercontinental may have divulged payment card data from tens of thousands of food  drink and other transactions  HEI said on Sunday 
The breach follows similar attacks at  Hyatt Hotels Corp   N H  and  Starwood Hotels    Resorts Worldwide Inc  N HOT  in recent months 
Norwalk  Connecticut based HEI  which is privately held  said malware designed to collect card data was found on HEI s systems 
The malware was discovered in early to mid June on payment systems used at restaurants  bars  spas  lobby shops and other facilities at the properties  Chris Daly  a spokesman for HEI  said in emails and phone calls

HEI said outside experts investigated the breach and determined that hackers might have stolen customer names  account numbers  payment card expiration dates and verification codes  The hackers did not appear to have gained PIN codes  since those are not collected by its system  it added 
The company has informed federal authorities and has installed a new payment processing system that is separate from other parts of its computer network

proposed deal with the rival hotel chain  Anbang has been on a U S  hotel buying spree as Chinese insurers rush to acquire cash generating assets as they struggle to keep up with the policy liabilities of the country s aging population  U S  assets are also seen as a good hedge against weakness in the Chinese yuan currency  The Anbang led consortium   which also includes private equity firms J C  Flowers   Co from the United States and Primavera Capital from China   has bid  78 per share in cash  or  13 16 billion overall  based on shares outstanding as of Feb  19  Anbang s bid is binding and fully financed  Starwood said  At Thursday s close  Marriott s bid for Starwood was worth  68 06 per share  or around  11 5 billion overall  Starwood will have to pay a  400 million breakup fee to Marriott if it walks away from their deal  Starwood s shares were up 5 percent at  80 20 in afternoon trading  their highest level since November  Marriott  which has until March 28 to counter Anbang s offer  said it was considering its options  Dan Wasiolek  a hotel industry analyst at Morningstar  said Marriott could still counter with a higher offer    Marriott can increase their offer because they have the balance sheet flexibility   he said  suggesting the larger rival hotel company could sweeten its offer by  700 million in cash   If Anbang s offer is successful  it would boost the company s reputation as one of China s top corporate acquirers  adding Starwood to its stable with its nearly 1 300 hotels in about 100 countries  Starwood brings with it several well regarded hotel brands as well as a loyal business customer base  The offer follows Anbang s  6 5 billion deal struck last week for Strategic Hotels   Resorts Inc and its  2 billion purchase of New York s iconic Waldorf Astoria hotel last year  John Paulson  president of hedge fund Paulson   Co  Starwood s largest shareholder  welcomed Anbang s sweetened offer  saying it  better reflects the value of Starwood   He called the Chinese company a  proven  sophisticated buyer of related assets   Beijing based Anbang s bid for Starwood epitomizes its meteoric rise since it was founded in 2014 with an initial focus on car insurance   Thanks to a spate of dealmaking at home and abroad  privately held Anbang now manages more than 1 9 trillion yuan   292 3 billion  in assets  according to its website  Its chairman Wu Xiaohui married the granddaughter of former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping  REGULATORY REVIEW A deal with Anbang would likely face a review by the U S  Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States  an interagency panel that reviews deals to ensure they do not harm national security   A CFIUS probe would take around 10 weeks and would focus on the proximity of Starwood s several hundred U S  hotels to critical facilities and the protection of customers  privacy  such as credit card data and information that passes through hotel Wi Fi  said a source close to the deal   Anbang won approval to buy the Waldorf Astoria last year and to buy annuities and life insurer Fidelity   Guaranty Life just this week  giving it confidence that it can also win approval for the Starwood deal  the source said  In 2012  CFIUS ordered the purchase of a wind farm in Oregon to be reversed because it was too close to a naval base   Stephen Heifetz  a partner with law firm Steptoe   Johnson LLP  said this was unlikely in this case    I d be surprised if there were any deal killer for a large multi property location   he said  although he warned that the companies might have to make some concessions to get the deal through   Other CFIUS experts have said previously that U S  regulators might be concerned about a Starwood property  the W Hotel in downtown Washington  which overlooks the U S  Treasury Department and the White House   The U S  government would also likely reconsider allowing some government officials to stay in the chain s hotels  said Michael Wessel  a commissioner on Congress s U S  China Economic and Security Review Commission    Anbang may have to requalify the chain for coverage under federal travel regulations   he said   If any individual properties posed a problem  one of the mitigation strategies could either be the sale of problem assets to another chain or potentially to limit reimbursement for government employees on government business at those properties    In either deal  Starwood shareholders will also receive stock in  Interval Leisure  Group Inc  O IILG   which is buying Starwood s vacation ownership business for about  5 67 per Starwood share

132779,354294,MAR,Goodell tackles NFL domestic abuse crisis with vow to reform,news,"By Larry Fine
NEW YORK  Reuters    A chastened NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said on Friday that the league s poor response to its domestic violence crisis will prompt an overhaul of how it deals with player behavior and punishment in America s most popular sports league 
Goodell has been under fire since the NFL s slow and fumbled response to the domestic violence incident involving Baltimore Ravens star Ray Rice  whose knock out punch to his then fiancee was captured in a video that went viral last week 
 I got it wrong in the handling of the Ray Rice matter   Goodell told a packed news conference   And I m sorry for that  I got it wrong on a number of levels  from the process that I led to the decision that I reached  
It was the embattled commissioner s first public appearance in more than a week  after the number of domestic violence cases involving players grew to five  teams bowed to public pressure and major sponsors criticized the league 
Doubts about Goodell s leadership had spiraled due to his failure to address the issue in public earlier  But Goodell said he never considered resigning from the post he has held since 2006 
Rules governing personal conduct for players and other employees will change  he said  and experts from outside the league will help it shape that new policy 
A  conduct committee  will be established by the NFL to review policy  a significant concession for an organization known for its top down  fortress like approach to management 
 We will get our house in order   Goodell said  I know this because we will make it happen   he said   Nothing is off the table  Let me say it again  we will implement new conduct policies  
Players often criticize Goodell as being  judge  jury and executioner  on disciplinary matters  as he hands out punishment and rules on most appeals 
While Goodell offered no specifics on what the future would be like  it was clear he was preparing to cede a measure of the near absolute authority that had made him one of the most powerful and well paid figures in all of sports 
Although the committee could make the NFL punishment process more democratic  it also allows Goodell to distance himself from future controversies in how the league metes out discipline 
Goodell said he will discuss many of the pending changes with the union but NFL Players Association Executive Director DeMaurice Smith was not at the news conference  raising some eyebrows 
 TOOK THE BLAME 
The domestic violence issue emerged when Goodell suspended Rice for two games after he knocked out fiancee Janay Palmer  who is now his wife  in a New Jersey casino elevator in February  Many saw the commissioner s penalty as too light 
Only when a video of the punch emerged on the website TMZ on Sept  8 did Goodell decide to suspend Rice indefinitely  The Ravens then cut him from the team 
ESPN said on Friday the Ravens knew about the second video within hours of the assault and later sought leniency for Rice  The Ravens said the report contained  numerous errors  which it will address next week 
Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson  the NFL s most valuable player in 2012  and defensive end Greg Hardy of the Carolina Panthers have been placed on the league s  exempt  list until their domestic violence cases are resolved 
Sponsors who have billions invested in the NFL were unusually critical of the league this week  including brewing giant Anheuser Busch 
Goodell  normally stoic but on Friday apologetic  spoke slowly and in a halting voice  He said personnel and staff will be required to undergo training on the prevention of domestic violence and sexual assault starting within 30 days 
He said the league will partner with the National Domestic Violence Hotline and National Sexual Violence Resource Center 
 I feel passionately that working in the NFL in any capacity is a privilege  something that we must earn every day and never take for granted   Goodell said   The vast majority of players  owners and coaches it the NFL  stand tall  
He said the league will work with players  their union  coaches  owners and outside experts to set the right standards for changing the league s policies for domestic violence  He said the panel will examine the commissioner s role in determining punishments 
Since the controversy erupted  Goodell has strengthened the league s penalties for domestic abuse 
Goodell s long awaited appearance got mixed reviews in the football world and some like former NFL coach Tony Dungy said they had hoped for more answers 
 It was a step in the right direction   Dungy tweeted   He definitely took the blame  
But calls for Goodell s resignation did not stop 

 The big reset button needs to be pushed on the NFL right now and it starts by Roger Goodell stepping down   former New England Patriots linebacker Tedy Bruschi said on ESPN  where he now works as a commentator

132863,354378,MAR,Rates To Zero  REITs To The Sky  3 Cheap Landlords Paying 5  To 6 ,opinion,"Are interest rates heading to zero in the US  Or  dare I say  negative range 
I don t think so  But if they do  real estate investment trusts  REITs  are going to absolutely skyrocket  This year to date has been a sneak preview  Most REITs have seen their valuations expand with the market rally  but we haven t missed out on all of them 
In a minute  we ll discuss a trio of dirt cheap REITs with attractive yields between 5  and 6   But first  let me show you just how overstretched this market has become 
First  let s look at the  Shiller PE   This is the  second level  price to earnings ratio  created by legendary economist Robert Shiller  that factors in average inflation adjusted earnings over the past decade  It has only been this expensive twice in American history  The 1999 2000 tech bubble   and right before the stock market collapsed in October 1929 
Stock Valuations are Pricey  Per Shiller PE Ratio 





The market s valuation doesn t look as dire if you just look at trailing 12 month earnings  but even then  the S P 500 has only traded this richly a handful of times previously  and in all those cases  market drops weren t far behind  
It s not just earnings either  Stocks are exorbitantly priced based on sales  
Investors are Paying Up for a Dollar in Sales





Real estate investment trusts  REITs  are no exception  The Real Estate Select Sector SPDR  NYSE XLRE  has rocketed 25  higher year to date  and now yields less than 3   The average price to FFO ratio in the space has jumped from 15 3 at the end of 2018 to 16 4 as I write this 
I don t know about you  but I prefer my REITs with big dividends at bargain prices 
The REIT industry does boast several names that are trading for far less than the average  but the question is  Are they cheap for a reason 
Let s explore three REITs yielding 5  to 6  that are trading at least 25  cheaper than their peers  and see if Wall Street is missing out on any hidden gems 

Summit Hotel Properties  INN 
Dividend Yield  5 8 
Many of the cheapest REITs on the market right now are hospitality focused property owners  While many of them have joined the sector s rally in 2019  they ve been among the most notable laggards of the past 15 18 months 
Hotel REITs Have Been Inhospitable





Summit Hotel Properties  NYSE INN  is no exception  The firm boasts a 70 hotel  roughly 11 000 room portfolio that spans 24 states across the country  This is a truly diversified portfolio  too  with no single city contributing more than 9  to portfolio EBITDA   Atlanta  San Francisco and New Orleans are its top three markets  combining to make up about 23  of EBITDA  

Leases involve upscale brands across Marriott International  NASDAQ MAR    Hilton Worldwide   NYSE HLT   Hyatt Hotel  H  and InterContinental Hotels Group  NYSE IHG   However  you ll find  efficient  peppered across the REIT s marketing and investor materials  Properties will eschew outdated  ornate trappings and amenities such as full service restaurants  and instead lean toward modern  functional rooms and services  as well as high quality bars with tighter menus 
Summit also leans on in house corporate revenue managers  exhaustive property inspections and data analytics to squeeze cash out of its properties 
Of particular interest  however  is Summit s 51  stake in a joint venture with GIC Singapore s sovereign wealth fund that it entered earlier this year  The JV s purpose is to acquire U S  hotels  Summit announced in its third quarter report that it completed a four hotel acquisition  bringing the new JV s portfolio to five properties  worth about  300 million  in high growth markets 
This focus on growth is great  as is its price  a dirt cheap 9 7 times adjusted FFO  But it comes at a price  a suddenly lethargic dividend  INN  after multiple dividend increases across 2016 and 2017  has kept its payout fixed at 18 cents per share for eight consecutive quarters 
It s possible that Summit re prioritizes the dividend once the JV begins to yield fruit  But if you want management to place as high a priority on income as you do  look elsewhere 
Pebblebrook Hotel Trust  PEB 
Dividend Yield  5 8 

 Pebblebrook Hotel Trust   NYSE PEB  is another underpriced hotel REIT  though it shares little in common with Summit  Pebblebrook invests in upper upscale  full service hotels and resorts  While it does feature a few hotels under easily recognizable brands such as Hilton and Westin  the majority of its properties are more like The Donovan in Washington  Sir Francis Drake in San Francisco  or Boston s Liberty Hotel  a boutique lodging in the former Charles Street Jail where you can dine at the  Clink  and enjoy libations in the jail s drunk tank 
While Summit and similar operators are sprinting away from these types of hotels  Pebblebrook is making a name with them  In fact  the REIT spent a whopping  5 2 billion to buy LaSalle Hotel Properties  in a deal completed in December 2018  to get its mitts on more of these experiential properties 
Despite this massive undertaking  PEB shares are trading at a lean 11 4 times funds from operations  That FFO  by the way  continues to grow at a mid single digit rate  even though hotel operating performance came in under internal expectations thanks to the effects of Hurricane Dorian 
Pebblebrook does share one other trait with Summit  a stalled out dividend  The payout has been locked in at 38 cents per share since 2016  and given  2 2 billion in debt  versus PEB s market cap of just  3 6 billion   it s unlikely Pebblebrook will have the financial means to give income investors a boost anytime soon 
The Dividend Isn t Doing Pebblebrook s Stock Any Favors




This might be a good buy in price for a potential rebound in PEB shares  as well as a solid yield on cost  But you might be stuck with this yield for a while 
Outfront Media  OUT 
Dividend Yield  5 4 
Let s step out of the hotel lobby and into the subway station 
And into the bus station  And into the airport  And onto the highway 

All these places  and so many more  are the purview of outdoor advertising REIT Outfront Media  NYSE OUT   The company catches America s eyes via a network of more than 510 000 total displays across rural  suburban and urban markets 
Yes  Outdoor s offerings include static billboards on the highway  But as I ve written before    Its dynamic digital displays in places such as airports  metro trains and urban centers that can be customized depending upon location  Rather than competing with internet and mobile advertising  it sees its solutions as a way to augment them  boasting that  consumers are 48  more likely to engage with a mobile ad after being exposed to the same ad on  Outfront s  out of home  displays  first  
Outfront has been growing its AFFO slowly but steadily since 2014  at a little more than 6  annually  It ran into a bit of a hiccup recently  with third quarter numbers coming in under analysts  expectations  But even then  its AFFO still grew at 7 2  year over year  Sellers may have overreacted on that one 
Outfront  OUT  Takes a Dip on Good  But Not Great  Results




Regardless  OUT shares have run nearly 40  so far this year  and remain priced to buy at just 11 times AFFO  The yield is nice  too at well more than 5  
But again  investors are being deprived of dividend growth  with the last upgrade to the payout coming in early 2017  What s curious is  it s not for lack of means  Outfront is paying just 64  of its AFFO out as dividends over the past 12 months 
The REIT can afford to be a little more generous  It just isn t 
2 REITs That Can Double Your Money  Pay 8 9  Yields
You can ride REITs to rip roaring returns if you do it the right way 
And the right way doesn t involve jumping into merely above average yielders with spotty histories of dividend growth 
Instead  it involves a select class of elite REITs that boast growth  increasing payouts and big  fat yields of nearly 9  
 But the need to buy this specific group of real estate plays has gone from  pressing  to  urgent   That s because my Triple Digit Profit System just did something it hasn t done since 2015 
It tripped its final indicator for us to dive into a totally ignored corner of the market 
The last time all five of my indicators flashed green  like they are this very minute   the group of stocks I want to show you in my  where cash dividends of 6   7  and even 8  are commonplace started red hot rallies that resulted in triple digit profits 
One member of this snubbed group of stocks a rock steady  landlord  spinning off a 7  plus cash dividend did something that income plays just aren t supposed to do 
It soared for a market crushing 580  return 
Doubling the Market With Real Estate Sounds Crazy  But  




It wasn t alone  Another one of these overlooked cash machines produced a total return  so  including dividends  of 379  in just more than six years  You re lucky to get 100  out of the market in that amount of time 
And because this stock had such a large dividend  a big slice of those returns were in cold  hard cash 
That was four years ago  Fast forward to today  and the Federal Reserve has put its hand on the easy money spigot  triggering the last of my five buy signals  And now  I have another pair of urgent REIT buys boasting triple digit price potential and yields of nearly 9  that I want to email to you now

133070,354585,MAR,3 Hospitality Stocks Poised For Growth In 2019 ,opinion,The hospitality sector downturns are often stimulated by external catalysts  The sector faced softer demand owing to the US China trade spat last year  Also  President Trump s stringent policies made the United States a somewhat less popular tourist destination  leaving the hotel  cruise and hospitality businesses slightly dry However  since the beginning of 2019  both the U S  lodging and leisure industries have experienced an upside and the trend is likely to continue in the quarters to come  The appreciation can be attributed to strong GDP growth  healthy labor market  rising wages and growing disposable income A Favorable 2019 for Hoteliers Despite Near Term RisksPer the   international and domestic travel in the first few months of 2019 is expected to grow in a decelerating rate  This is because softening global growth and the increase in the value of the dollar against other currencies throughout 2018 may dampen international inbound travel in the near term  This in turn will impede the United States  efforts to increase its share in the global international travel market Then again   the industry s revenue per available room  RevPAR  growth for 2019 at 2 3  as compared with 2 9  recorded in 2019  RevPAR growth is likely to be largely driven by a 2 7  increase in average daily rate  Occupancy  in the meanwhile  is expected to slip to 65 9  this year However  it should be noted that for the first time since 2007  a higher daily rate may solely drive RevPAR  Major hoteliers like Hyatt   NYSE H    Marriott   NASDAQ MAR   and Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc    NYSE H   are focusing on boosting revenues through unit expansion  Embracing digital innovation and adopting loyalty programs  these hotel bigwigs are relentlessly expanding their customer base and market share  Many hoteliers are also setting up analytics tools to understand consumer preferences and deliver a differentiated experience  which could eventually entice customers to visit frequently  stay longer and spend more According to PwC s outlook  demand growth of 1 6  in 2019 is likely to keep pace with a projected supply growth of 2 1   Also  2018 has been a record breaking year for the lodging industry given an optimal demand supply balance  Per CBRE researchers  the hotel industry is likely to continue on a growth trajectory in 2019  Additionally  CBRE expects overall returns on hotels to be the highest for any commercial real estate sector over the next three years How Will the Cruise Industry Hold Up The cruise industry in 2019 is likely to benefit from increased travel demand  The role of technology is playing a massive role in driving demand for cruises  The companies continue to make use of digital tools for marketing  product development and enhancing consumer experience  The initiatives include revamped websites  new vacation packaging capabilities  support for mobile apps and increased bandwidth onboard to help guests remain well connected while traveling Moreover  Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd    NYSE RCL   noted that the Wave Season has seen a solid start and overall booking in 2019 is likely to exceed the record high mark in 2018   the cruise industry is expected to grow through 2019 with 30 million cruisers  up 6  from 28 2 million in 2018  Picking the Right

133172,354687,MAR,Amazon Roundup  Healthcare  Employment  Hub  Alexa  More,opinion,"There s so much going on with Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN   right now that we can just hit the high spots now  These include a new CEO to head up its health insurance initiative  its physical expansion  its apartment house pickup service Hub and new skills for Alexa 
Amazon   Banks Choose CEO
Amazon s ambition to crack healthcare or at least the insurance side of it through partnerships with leading banks took another step forward with the appointment of a CEO effective Jul 9  The Boston based company will operate as an independent entity that is free from profit making incentives and constraints with the goal of ensuring people take their prescriptions to thereby reduce health complications and cost  Healthier people will also be less of a burden for insurance companies 
The person chosen for the job is Dr  Atul Gawande  a world famous surgeon  writer and public health innovator  specializing in general and endocrine surgery at Brigham and Women s Hospital  He is also Professor at the Harvard T H  Chan School of Public Health and Harvard Medical School  as well as founding executive director of the health systems innovation center  Ariadne Labs 
 We said at the outset that the degree of difficulty is high and success is going to require an expert s knowledge  a beginner s mind  and a long term orientation   said Jeff Bezos  founder and CEO of Amazon 
 Atul embodies all three  and we re starting strong as we move forward in this challenging and worthwhile endeavor   Warren Buffett  Chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway   and Jamie Dimon  Chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase   NYSE JPM   had similar words of praise for the incoming CEO 
Amazon Expansion and Employment
We can debate about whether Amazon s operating cost will increase as it creates more of a physical presence because this will require real estate and a larger employee base  In fact this is one of the biggest disadvantages that traditional retailers have to deal with when compared with Amazon  Moreover  once you re already employing a lot of people like Walmart   NYSE WMT    it is relatively harder to automate operations because retrenchment will put you up against labor unions 
Amazon is making the most of its position as a mainly online retailer by significantly automating operations and processes and employing as few people as possible  This is visible in its Amazon Go shop concept and also in its fulfillment centers 
So its fourth Michigan fulfillment center in Gaines Township  which is an 850 000 square foot facility  will create just a 1 000 full time jobs  Similarly  the new Bessemer fulfillment center  the first of its kind in the state of Alabama   which is an 855 000 square foot facility will employ just 1 500 employees  These employees  who will work alongside robots to pick  pack and ship small items to customers such as books  household items and toys  will however be well taken care of in terms of wages and benefits 
What s more  it isn t just the mundane jobs of the warehouses that are being automated  Over time  Amazon has even shifted tasks like forecasting demand  ordering inventory and negotiating prices to algorithms 
Amazon says in a statement   We ve been working for some time on standardizing the products  tools and services we offer to the brands and resellers that sell on Amazon  and have made some organizational changes as a result   It also says that it has more than 16 000 corporate jobs open worldwide and that it had created 130 000 jobs last year 
So Amazon s physical expansion may not be as good as it might have been in terms of employment  but it s good nonetheless because of the rate of expansion 
Hub by Amazon
Amazon recently announced Hub by Amazon  which is essentially a package pickup location for apartment buildings  The service is available not only on Amazon packages but also from others like UPS  FedEx  NYSE FDX   or even the Post Office   
Delivery persons enter their code to drop off packages while residents enter their code to pick them up at any time 24 7  Amazon offers security for the packages and also personal assistance if required  The facility helps Amazon deliver packages for pickup within one day   
Amazon says that the service is already available to 500 000 residents from 30 such locations across the U S  Big residential property owners and managers  collectively overseeing thousands of apartment properties like AvalonBay  Fairfield Residential  Pinnacle  J P  Morgan Asset Management  WinnResidential and Equity Residential  NYSE EQR   have already signed up to use the service 
This looks like a rather neat way to creep into the broader logistics business 
Alexa Acquires More Skills
Alexa acquired a number of skills over the past week or so 
First  through Alexa for Hospitality  she can serve guests asking for hotel information  guest services  music playback in their room and more  The goal is to improve guest experience while offering them the kind of voice services many are now accustomed to in their own homes  Marriott International   NASDAQ MAR   was the first big hotel to adopt the technology  introducing the new Alexa experience at select properties in Marriott Hotels  Westin Hotels   Resorts  St  Regis Hotels   Resorts  Aloft Hotels  and Autograph Collection Hotels starting this summer 
Designed by tech startup n Powered  college students can now ask Alexa questions  such as when their classes are scheduled  how much cash remains on their food cards and how much they owe for tuition  Northeastern University will be offering its students Echo Dots through which the service will be available but it isn t known yet what if anything it will charge them for it   It should make life easier for students and save faculty time  so other colleges may go for similar programs as well 
A voice based  music education startup called Bamboo Learning has released an Alexa skill called Bamboo Music that will help students learn and practice music theory through voice and listening exercises  The company was founded by Amazon veteran Ian Freed  who was VP of Amazon devices from 2010 to 2015 and helped design the Alexa enabled Echo 
Users will now be able to get Alexa to set recordings  launch apps and navigate menus on the Dish Hopper range of set top boxes 
Private Label
D A Davidson analyst Tom Forte raised his price target on the stock from  1 900 to  2 100  because of  the increase in our annual sales forecasts by 100 basis points  per year  due to our increased confidence in its ability to generate additional private label and advertising revenues  
With private label growing in importance at Amazon  Coresight Research  in partnership with DataWeave  recently aggregated data on 6 825 products across 74 identified Amazon private labels to study their progress  Coresight had the following observations 
The bulk of Amazon private labels are apparel brands with many sub categories containing relatively few  around 100  products each as Amazon tries to cater to a broad cross section of people with targeted offerings  But other leading retail categories like food and beauty haven t received the same attention  With the acquisition of Whole Foods  the company gained access to its food brands  which are listed on its site  It appears that Amazon will take a similar approach to food and beauty as it has with apparel 
Its private label brands are also getting a boost with Amazon Prime Wardrobe that is now available to all U S  users  The system allows you to select at least three and at most eight items that you have a week to try on and reject if necessary  Amazon says that its private label brands Lark   Ro  Daily Ritual  Amazon Essentials  and Goodthreads are the top ordered items  which could just be because its own brands are more widely available on the service 
Customers
Amazon has reported that online retailer zulily has been moving its business critical workloads to AWS  including its store  mobile application  and supply chain  as it leverages the cloud to serve customers better  The press release said that zulily has seen a 30 40  performance improvement per request made on its website and mobile app 
  Meanwhile  Sears   NASDAQ SHLD   has announced that the number of its Auto Centers accepting Amazon tire pickup and fixing has now been increased by 71 to total 118  Sears collects a small fee for the service 
Facial Recognition Issue
Amazon employees are protesting its marketing of face recognition technology called rekognition to private businesses and law enforcement agencies  An American Civil Liberties Union  ACLU  investigation earlier this month showed that Amazon has been selling such information to police in Florida and Oregon 
The WSJ reports that in fact anyone with a credit card and an Amazon Web Services account can access it  There is also no approval process for consumers  who can be tracked just about anywhere there is a camera  even if they aren t carrying any devices 
According to a recently published letter posted to an internal forum  employees who called themselves Amazonians said that  Our company should not be in the surveillance business  we should not be in the policing business  we should not be in the business of supporting those who monitor and oppress marginalized populations   It also objected to and called for the cessation of infrastructure service provision to Palantir  the Peter Thiel backed surveillance company  which has ties to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement  ICE  department 
Seattle Head Tax Battle Won
Big companies won the battle against homeless people when the Seattle City Council repealed a newly enacted  head tax  on the its largest companies by a 7 2 vote  The tax would have impacted only the largest companies by revenue  Amazon being one  It was expected to hit 500 companies that would have been required to pay a tax of roughly 14 cents per employee per hour worked within the city to raise at least  45 million over five years  The money was to go toward affordable housing and support services for the homeless 
Amazon was one of the most vociferous opposers  threatening to take its business to other states to avoid the tax  Since this trend would have led to unemployment  the state was forced to reconsider  Amazon promptly said it would support non profits working for the homeless 
Senators Question Echo Privacy
A recent controversy over the way an Echo device inadvertently recorded a conversation and even sent it to an unintended recipient have raised privacy questions around the device 
U S  Senators Jeff Flake and Chris Coons have written to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos requesting information about the technical design and privacy features of Echo devices as well as the Alexa digital assistant platform  Flake is chairman of the Judiciary subcommittee on Privacy  Technology and the Law  and Coons is a member 
Supreme Court Ruling Will Have Minimal Impact
In a 5 4 decision  the Supreme Court has said that states can tax online companies  The existing law based on physical presence hasn t however been nullified 
Since Amazon already collects taxes in all states in which it operates and also charges a fee for taking on the hassle for sellers that want the service  the decision is a slight positive for the retail business 
For buyers  cost of products on Amazon s marketplace  not the stuff it sells directly  could go up if the concerned sellers aren t collecting sales tax  However  since Amazon is also in the process of integrating its marketplaces business into the retail business  so any negative impact on this business will likely be small for Amazon 
One Month Pice Action

133173,354688,MAR,Will Marriott  MAR  Pull Through A Revenue Drop ,opinion,"Marriott  NASDAQ MAR  is set to report next Monday  August 6th  and there might be some problems for the hospitality provider  Estimize predicts that the EPS will increase to  1 39 which is a 23  increase year over year  YoY  and a two cent increase from the previous quarter  Q1 2018   This is a sign of growth for the company and demonstrates greater dollar yield per share 

Revenue is the main concern as it decreased significantly last quarter  Q1 2018  to  5 0 billion significantly lower than predicted estimates  Estimize predicts that Marriott revenue will be at  5 99 billion this quarter  Q2 2018  which is a 3   YoY  increase  Given that last quarter  Q1 2018  revenue was lower than expected  the Estimize consensus predicts a large bump in revenue this quarter  Q2 2018   If last quarter s trend continues  though  Marriott could be in a bit of trouble 

To look for new  innovative ways into its market  Marriott is  according to The Motley Fool   exploring several innovative strategies to continue to protect and expand its market share    1  In an experiment  Marriott in conjunction with a London based company is working on  bring ing  Marriott level service and quality to travelers seeking a curated home stay experience    1  With this  Marriott hopes to curtail the pressure from Airbnb  a company which mainly provides this  home stay  experience  Other innovations include a partnership with Chinese based tech giant Alibaba  NYSE BABA  and an investment into cruise ships  These two investments might prove costly in the short term  but could yield long term benefits 
Overall  Marriott should be a solid bet  Last quarter s revenue drop seems more like an outlier than anything else  So  will Marriott pull through its recent revenue slump  It s definitely looking that way

include Philip Morris   NYSE PM    ConocoPhillips   NYSE COP    Alibaba   NYSE BABA    Activision Blizzard   NASDAQ ATVI   and Marriott   NASDAQ MAR   Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations    Here are highlights from Friday s Analyst Blog Top Analyst Reports for Philip Morris  ConocoPhillips and AlibabaThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Philip Morris  ConocoPhillips and Alibaba  These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today You can see all of Philip Morris  shares have underperformed the Zacks Tobacco industry over the last six months   19 8  vs   17 5   due to persistent declines in cigarette volumes  stemming from consumers  rising health consciousness and stringent government regulations on tobacco products  These factors  which have been marring cigarette industry volumes for a while now  led to a 5 3  drop in Phillip Morris  cigarette volumes during first quarter 2018 Nevertheless  solid revenues from the reduced risk products  RRPs  category are a major driver for Phillip Morris  The company is making constant efforts to expand in the space  In fact  the top and the bottom line grew year over year during the first quarter  courtesy of favorable cigarette pricing and solid RRP performance  with the latter being driven by consistent success of IQOS  Management uplifted its earnings view for 2018  as it expects recent tax reforms to aid bottom line growth  You can   Shares of ConocoPhillips are up  47 6  over the last year  outperforming the Zacks U S  Integrated Oil industry  which has gained  33 6  over the same period  The Zacks analyst likes the company s initiative to divest non core assets as the explorer could divert the proceeds toward oil rich Eagle Ford and Bakken shale plays Significant opportunities are left for ConocoPhillips in the Eagle Ford where it owns 3 400 undrilled locations that could lend access to almost 2 3 billion barrels of oil equivalent estimated potential reserves  The company recently reported strong first quarter 2018 results  courtesy of higher oil and natural gas price realizations However  we are cautious about ConocoPhillips  expectations of a rise in production and operating expenses  Moreover  ConocoPhillips  long term debt is more than double its cash balance  which is a concern  You can   Alibaba s shares have outperformed the Zacks Electronic Commerce industry over the last year  gaining  62 8  vs   48 6   The company s fiscal fourth quarter results were driven by strong momentum in the company s core e commerce business  New Retail strategy and expanding cloud business Its recent investment in Lazada will expand its presence in Asia  The Zacks analyst likes the company s solid growth in the company s core e commerce business  strong growth in metrics  expanding cloud business and international strength Other drivers include strong mobile strength and its continued efforts to develop new products  However  macro headwinds  continued investments and increasing competition from Tencent Holdings and Baidu remain the overhangs  You can   Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Activision Blizzard and Marriott Looking

133250,354765,MAR,Chinese Conglomerate Over Reaches  We Benefit With Park Hotels,opinion,"We sold our Park Hotels  PK  a month ago  just before the deluge 
Our timing was lucky or brilliant  I m going with lucky 
We use trailing stops for almost all equity positions in our model portfolio 
That strategic imperative has saved our clients many times  this time we are flush with cash to buy back our favorite stocks even more cheaply 

We sold our Park Hotels  NYSE PK  the morning of February 5  as well as a very large chunk of the rest of our holdings  We sold at  27 83  As of Friday  March 2  PK sold as low as 24 23  Why 
A big Chinese conglomerate  the HNA Group  SZ 000616   was a 25  shareholder of Park Hotels  Good thing  HNA way over extended itself and got in big trouble  It announced as part of getting out of the hole they had dug themselves into they were going to sell all 53 million of their PK shares 
HNA is a big company  one of the Fortune Global 200  But even big companies can stumble  no matter what Jonathan Hart said   In one  Hart to Hart  episode he opined that  the first  5 million is difficult  after that it is inevitable    But according to Bloomberg  HNA has of late been conducting a fire sale of properties in order to keep some of its other businesses afloat  They have sold  9 billion worth of assets  That s the entire value of Park Hotels 

My full discussion of why I like Park so much was contained in one of three articles I wrote about the global hotel and lodging industry  This one was titled  Can Hotel Companies Survive Airbnb  This One Will   You can see it here 
That article gave me a chance to reminisce a bit about some of my stays at these premier properties  funded for the most part by the loyalty points I accrued by staying at Park s less upscale Hamptons  Hilton Garden Inns  and Doubletrees  
You see  Park today is comprised of 55 former Hilton Worldwide  NYSE HLT  properties that Hilton spun off when it decided that managing  branding and marketing hotels was their real forte and allowed them to leverage those skills without tying up capital in property ownership  That s  today   Park s plan  however  is to buy new properties and let the best bidders win their management  branding and marketing loyalty  be they Hilton  Hyatt  NYSE H   Marriott  NASDAQ MAR   Accor  OTC ACCYY  or any other big  flag  
Some have disparaged the airport properties and what some consider the  lesser  brands  but that s not necessarily correct  They also manage no question luxury properties as well as a couple  other  alternatives for those of us who don t need to spend  300 a night every time they travel 
Among the luxury category 

The Casa Marina  a Waldorf Astoria property  Key West
Hilton Hawaiian Village Waikiki
The Fess Parker Hotel Santa Barbara
The Hilton Berlin

Here are some of the  others  which the critics note are not luxury properties  But just because they don t bear the name Hilton  Conrad or Waldorf Astoria does not make them declasse 

The Embassy Suites in Old Town Alexandria VA
The Doubletree  Durango CO
Hilton Boston Logan Airport   The only hotel connected to terminals  Here s one of their  airport hotels  derided by some as  not luxury  

By the way  having made many a transcontinental flight in my business career or personal travels  there is nothing  simply nothing  so luxurious as waking up in what is for my body the middle of the night and walking  yes walking  usually under cover  to the Hilton Heathrow  the Hilton Fiumicino  Rome airport  or the Hilton Boston Logan  We each define luxury in our own way   Neither of these two Hiltons are Park Hotels but the way property owners change managers  you never know  
As I said in that first article  I consider the spun off properties some of the crown jewels of the lodging business  with lots of irreplaceable land and significant conference and meeting space  These properties are all accessible to Hilton guests  loyalty awards program HHonors  and are mostly in the USA 
Location  location  location  Park has at least one hotel in 14 of the top 25 U S  travel markets  almost all in central business districts  key on airport hotels or in highly desirable resort locations  such as The Reach  a second property in Key Wes  The total current value of these properties is somewhere in the  8 to  9 billion range 
As I mentioned  Park has no obligation to acquire additional Hilton properties or to keep any particular Hilton property  It is a company that stands on its own  beholden to no particular flag  The company has  I believe wisely  elected to hire Hilton to manage its current properties  assuring it of continued competitiveness in attracting Hilton s 73 million HHonors loyalty members  I m certain a flag s loyalty member base will be a key consideration in Park s strategic decisions going forward 
Why am I buying Park anew 
First  of course  it is cheaper now so I can own more shares by using the proceeds from our sell  Even so  I will buy in two or more tranches  buying a little now  then more if  as I suspect  the markets will back and fill over the next few weeks  If I m wrong I have a good position of a great company that pays me 6 6  a year and is likely to grow its distribution  If I m right I have an even better position 
Second  I am buying the second biggest lodging REIT and the 25th biggest REIT of any category  This means Park  in light of its recent sale of 12 properties  they had 67 last year  has plenty of cash to buy from those companies  partnerships or individual owners who over extended themselves  There is considerably less competition for the very expensive  dream  properties that mirror many of those Park already owns 
Third  Park has superb geographic distribution  Its remaining hotels are in key US cities and resort areas  with 12  international   a figure I believe will grow  Because of the size of many of their properties they are not merely dependent on  putting heads in beds  as purveyors of limited service brands are  Renting rooms is just 2 3 of Park s revenue  the rest comes from food and beverage  conferences  weddings  etc 
In short  I like to buy quality  But I m cheap  I like to buy quality when it is on sale  Selling at less than 9 times Funds From Operations  Park Hotels qualifies

133251,354766,MAR,7 Reits  Paying Up To 8   With Big Dividend Raises Coming ,opinion," First level  investors   those who buy and sell on headlines   mistakenly believe that real estate investment trust  REIT  profits will suffer if rates continue to rise  They re wrong  This is actually an ideal time to buy the strongest names in the sector 
Note that I said strongest  The sector s popular proxy is something you should avoid  despite its popularity  I ll call it out in a moment 
Overall  rising rates are actually good for the best REITs because it signals a rolling economy  These landlords have no problem raising their rents when their tenants are making money 
Unfortunately  the business world is increasingly becoming a neighborhood of  haves  and  have nots   And some REITs are not doing well  despite the broader tailwinds 
Take the Vanguard REIT  NYSE VNQ   which is now paying its highest current yield   Buy the dip  No way  Its annual payout actually declined in 2017 year over year 
VNQ s Disappearing DividendSource  Contrarian Outlook
One year of Amazon powered disruption  and VNQ s dividends are back to their 2013 levels  Yikes 
But VNQ is  of course  a flawed index  It s  low cost    but so what  Investors who buy it are getting what they pay for 
A better idea is to cherry pick the firms who do have booming businesses that are not being eaten alive by Jeff Bezos   Co  Here are seven landlords who own their respective property niches  These stocks pay up to 8   All have dividend upside to boot 
American Tower Corporation REIT  NYSE AMT Dividend Yield  1 8 
American Tower  AMT  may have one of the smallest yields in the REIT space  but it also has one of the most impressive dividend growth streaks in the entire real estate sector 
Namely  AMT has increased its quarterly payout for 25 consecutive quarters 
Not years  Quarters 
American Tower is at the attractive crossroads of technology and real estate  owning and operating wireless and broadcast towers  as well as other telecommunications infrastructure  in the U S  and abroad  In short  it helps companies such as Verizon Communications Inc  NYSE VZ  and AT T  NYSE T  connect tens of millions of Americans with voice and internet service 
But unlike Verizon and AT T  American Tower is very much a growth story  The company s revenues and funds from operations  FFO  have been consistently climbing for years  and 2017 saw another blowout performance from this telecom REIT  The top line exploded by 15 2  to  6 7 billion  while consolidated adjusted FFO jumped 16 5  to  2 9 billion  That allowed the company to grow its dividend by nearly 20  across four separate increases 
And with deals such as an agreement with Vodafone  LON VOD  and Idea Cellular to widen its exposure in India by roughly a third  that growth path should continue 
American Tower  AMT  Keeps Building a Fundamental Bull Case
Alexandria Real Estate Equities Inc  NYSE ARE Dividend Yield  2 8 
Alexandria Real Estate Equities  ARE  is one of the most niche but intriguing office REITs on the market  This company focuses on life sciences real estate  specifically focusing its efforts on industry business clusters 
It owns a portfolio of 213 properties across North America totaling 29 6 million square feet  clustered in seven major regions  Seattle  San Francisco  San Diego  Greater Boston  New York City  Maryland and Research Triangle Park in North Carolina 
Like American Tower  Alexandria Real Estate is sitting on a growth geyser  with the company building its top line by 22 4  to  1 1 billion in 2017  Same property net operating income grew 3 1  year over year  and FFO shot up 31 6  to  554 5 million 
Better still  the company has grown its payout for years    including a 7  bump across two hikes in 2017  And the below chart shows exactly what you should expect   that is  dividend growth being rewarded by share price growth almost identically over time 
As Alexandria Real Estate s  ARE  Dividend Goes  So Go Its Shares
Regency Centers Corporation  NYSE REG Dividend Yield  3 6 
Regency Centers  REG  prides itself as being  The Leading National Shopping Center REIT   Uh oh 
But Regency has some angles that may help buffer it from Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  
Regency s portfolio consists of 426 properties encompassing 59 million square feet  As of the company s fourth quarter 2017 investor presentation  some 96 3  of the properties were leased  with 80  of properties anchored by a grocery store  And REG boasts an average of  138 000 people and  110 000 average incomes in Gateway  18  Hour and select growth markets  
Grocery stores do provide much needed foot traffic to shopping centers  and Regency s grocery sales in specific are significantly better than its peers  That hasn t stopped Wall Street from selling Regency off alongside the narrative  Shares have been hammered by about 30  since mid 2016  roughly doubling the losses of the VNQ 
But Regency is making smart moves  including clipping away at its interest costs via changes to its unsecured revolving credit facility  and it continues to get cheaper by the day  now trading at about 19 times FFO  That s not exactly cheap for a company that ultimately still plays in the troubled retail space  but REG might be one of the best of a bad breed  Also heartening is a small stretch of consecutive dividend improvements starting in 2014 
Summit Hotel Properties Inc  NYSE INN Dividend Yield  5 1 
Summit Hotel Properties  INN   like Regency  has received more than its share of losses  getting knocked down by more than 30  since summer 2017  And also like Regency  Summit is starting to look increasingly appealing as its price is whittled away 
Summit is one of several plays that center around the growing trend of the  in which Americans  especially Millennials  are increasingly valuing experiences such as travel over  stuff   And importantly  Summit is a play on the wealthier individuals within this economy 
INN owns 83 hotels under the Marriott International Inc  NASDAQ MAR   Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc  NYSE HLT  and InterContinental Hotels Group  NYSE IHG  brands  as well as under a Hyatt Hotels Corporation  NYSE H  affiliate  The portfolio spans 26 states  with 89  located in the top 50 metropolitan statistical areas  96  is within the top 100  The company is rapidly upgrading its portfolio  too  including a  163 million  five hotel acquisition from Xenia Hotels   Resorts Inc  NYSE XHR  in June 2017  and a  164 million  four hotel buyout in November of last year spanning Yale  Boston  Cleveland and Tuscon 
While several hotel REITs struggled in 2017  Summit put up an 8 4  improvement in its adjusted FFO for the full 12 months  That served as a springboard for another increase to the quarterly dividend   its fourth since 2016  when it began improving its payout after years of stagnation 
That payout is easily covered  too  at just 54  of its FFO  And shares are cheap  trading for just 10 times FFO 
Summit Hotel Properties  INN  Is a High Rent Value
One Liberty Properties Inc  NYSE OLP Dividend Yield  8 0 
One Liberty Properties  OLP  is a diversified small cap net lease REIT that s primarily retail in nature  but also features a significant chunk of industrial real estate  Its 118 properties across 30 states include name brand tenants such as FedEx  NYSE FDX   Whole Foods  Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc  NASDAQ WBA  and The Wendy s Co  NASDAQ WEN   not to mention numerous industrial operators that are less familiar to consumers 
Tenant concentration is a little on the high side  with the top five composing more than a fifth of One Liberty s contractual rental income  but there s little concentration risk  The same can be said about geography  with Texas the top state holding at 12  of the portfolio 
Again  retail is problematic at present  but many of OLP s individual tenants aren t at as much risk from the likes of Amazon as many mall retailers  And operationally speaking  One Liberty has been solid for years  with 2017 serving as no exception  Rental income improved by 6 2  to  68 2 million  and adjusted funds from operations grew 5  to  2 09 per share 
Moreover  the dividend has been increased for a sixth consecutive year  and unlike many other REITs whose yields have been driven higher by large declines  OLP isn t prone to big swings   in either direction 
OLP provides strong total returns thanks to its massive 8  dividend  but Wall Street has stubbornly refused for years to recognize One Liberty s business success 
2 Recession Proof Dividend Growth REITs  7 5   Yields and 25  Upside
My favorite commercial real estate lender lets us play Monopoly from the convenience of our brokerage accounts  They do all the legwork  building a secure  diversified loan portfolio featuring offices  retail space  hotels and multifamily units 
Management then collects the monthly payments  deposits the checks
  and then it sends most of the profits our way as dividends  a requirement of its REIT status  
The stock s current dividend  a 7 7  yield today  is covered by earnings per share  EPS  today  And don t be fooled by the stagnant dividend  not that stability is bad   The firm continues to originate an increasing number of loans 
37  Loan Growth Today Tees Up Dividend Growth Tomorrow
This firm is a conservative lender with perfect loan performance  100    Its growing portfolio will drive higher profits  which in turn will inspire the next dividend hike  The best time to buy the stock is right now  as it makes the investments which will drive its payout and share price higher from here 
Plus this firm has also smartly eliminated interest rate risk because it uses floating rates  In fact  it s actually set up to make more money as interest rates move higher 
More Income as Interest Rates Rise
Same for another REIT favorite of mine  a 7 5  payer backed by an unstoppable demographic trend that will deliver growing dividends for the next 30 years  Interest rates are no problem for this landlord because it will simply continue raising the rents on its  must have  facilities 
Its founder Ed Aldag admitted that  fourteen years ago  he had  zero assets  a dream  and a business plan  
Well his dream and plan were plenty   Ed parlayed them into  6 7  billion in assets 
And right now is the best time yet to  bet on Ed  because his growing base of assets is generating higher and higher cash flows  powering an accelerating dividend 

I love dividend increases because they are proof that management is actually making more money  so can afford to pay us shareholders more  And an accelerating payout is a flat out cry for help 
Any management team that raises its dividend faster and faster is clearly making more money than it knows what to do with  This usually happens when it achieves a tipping point where its machine no longer requires as much reinvestment to continue growing  So leadership says   Please  take a bigger raise  shareholders  
Meanwhile investors and money managers who spot dividend accelerators lose their minds because  in theory  there is no valuation too high for a company that is increasing its dividend at an accelerating rate  Their spreadsheets literally break  and they buy the stock in a frenzy 
Ed s stock should be owned by any serious dividend investor for three simple reasons 
It s recession proof 
It yields a fat  and secure  7 5  
Its dividend increases are actually accelerating 
These two REITs are both  best buys  in my 8  No Withdrawal Portfolio   an 8  dividend paying portfolio that lets retirees live on secure payouts alone  And they can even enjoy price upside to boot  thanks to the bargain prices they re buying at 
Now  as active recommendations for my premium subscribers  it wouldn t be fair to reveal their names here 
But I would like to send you a free copy of my latest special report  Recession Proof REITs  2 Plays With 7 5   Yields and 25  Upside  with all the details

133264,354779,MAR,Bargain Bin Shopping For Yields Up To 8 4  ,opinion,"The market just dropped the big  ugly  C  word on us   Correction   that is  The old stalwart Dow Jones Industrial Average recently broke into correction territory  dipping just over 10  in two weeks before clawing a little bit of it back  Along the way  the VIX   you know  the  fear index    spiked to its highest levels since the 2007 09 bear market 
But while many investors might see this sudden burst of volatility as a reason to run or duck for cover  I see it as a chance to go hunting in high yield dividend stocks 
They call it a  correction  for a reason  It s because something was broken  and a price decline fixes it  In this case  what was  broken  was the wildly overbought nature of the entire market  which I ll show you using two charts 
First up is a chart of the S P 500 s price to earnings ratio throughout time  As you can see  the market s valuation has reached rarefied air  with the last two such occurrences coming during the 2007 09 bear market  in which a recession blasted earnings   and the 1999 2000 dot com bubble  including its lead up and aftermath   Simply put  This is a pricey market 
The S P 500 Rarely Plumps Up Like ThisSource  Multpl com
The second chart is a simple technical view of the index  On the top part of the chart  you ll see a momentum indicator called  Relative Strength Index   A reading above 70 is considered  overbought   and the S P 500 typically is good at working off this kind of condition in short order  a couple weeks to a month  by pulling back  as you can see over the past decade 
But look at how lofty things got for the past few months across 2018 and 2017  and you can see that the market was simply primed to correct 

Is the market s overvaluation now  fixed   Hardly  The S P 500 s valuation still sits at a historically elevated level  but some stocks have indeed worked off some froth over the past couple days   and in some cases  the past couple of months 
Today  I d like to show you three such stocks  yielding up to 8 4   that have become more wallet friendly of late 
Preferred Apartment Communities
Dividend Yield  6 9 
We last discussed Preferred Apartment Communities  NYSE APTS    and it proceeded to run almost 40  higher over the next five months  From that point  however  it got caught up in a REIT sector pullback   and eventually  the market s broader decline   dropping more than 30  through today 
Both moves were overdone  A 40  move in five months for a REIT is simply too much  too fast  but its pullback has been overwrought and begs buying once more 
A refresher  Preferred Apartment Communities  APTS   as the name would imply  an apartment property owner that boasts a presence in 13 states across the East Coast  Southeast and Midwest  The real estate investment trust  REIT  also  may make real estate loan investments in multifamily communities and other multi family related assets  such as off campus student housing communities   But it goes a step farther afield from the housing business by also investing in things such as office buildings and grocery anchored shopping centers  providing some diversification that you typically don t see in residential REITs 
On the one hand  Preferred Apartment Communities hasn t corrected for nothing  While shares probably were a pullback concern just because of how fast they d shot up in such a short amount of time  there also were concerns about its growing pile of non trading preferred shares  as well as its expansion into non core areas such as retail and office space 
On the flip side  APTS still is a massive growth machine that posted a 40  top line improvement in its most recent quarter  improved its FFO and has a payout ratio of just 65   Moreover  with the recent correction  it s now trading at less than 10 times its core funds from operations 
Consider the recent action a deserved punch of the  reset  button  This REIT still has plenty of upside 
Ryman Hospitality Properties
Dividend Yield  4 8 
The thing with most real estate investment trusts  REITs  is that they tend to own dozens if not hundreds of properties  making it really difficult to precisely gauge the quality of their portfolio and truly understand the areas in which they have a presence 
That s not the case with Ryman Hospitality Properties  NYSE RHP   which has precisely four holdings   a quartet of resorts conference centers under Marriott s  NASDAQ MAR  Gaylord brand  located near Nashville  Tennessee  Orlando  Florida  Dallas  Texas  and Washington  D C 
It s an interesting niche for a REIT in that while it s certainly a hotel play  it s not as vulnerable to the whims of the traveling public  Instead  demand largely comes from conferences and other planned meetings that  when they find a favorable host resort  tend to remain there for several years 
Ryman s geographic positioning put it at the mercy of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma  which contributed to a 15  year over year drop in funds from operations in the company s most recent quarter  Nonetheless    posting  5 38 in FFO over the past four quarters  which translates into an attractive 67  payout ratio  Moreover  thanks to a quick 10  dip since late January  it sports a plenty reasonable current valuation of less than 13 times FFO 
PowerShares KBW Premium Yield Equity REIT Portfolio
Dividend Yield  8 4 Expenses  0 35 
The clobbering in the REIT space isn t a company here and a company there  Much of the industry has been getting pummeled amid inflation and interest rate fears  with the investing world once again forgetting that REITs and their growing dividend payouts are 
That has created an opportunity that we ve simply never seen before in the PowerShares KBW Premium Yield Equity REIT Portfolio  NASDAQ KBWY  
The KBWY is unlike the Vanguard REIT ETF  NYSE VNQ   Schwab US REIT ETF  NYSE SCHH  and other basic REIT funds in that this isn t a collection of high market cap real estate plays  Instead  KBWY invests in a basket of 30 small  and mid cap REITs and uses a methodology that allocates higher weights to stocks with higher dividends  Washington Prime Group  NYSE WPG  and New Senior Investment Group  NYSE SNR  are the ETF s largest weights as of this writing 
KBWY s yield had been expanding for years thanks to good  old fashioned dividend growth  but the recent plunge in prices has shot the fund s annual dole to an all time high 8 4  on a trailing 12 month basis 
Simply put  If you believe in a near term rebound across the board  this ETF will pay you more than most to express your inner bull 
My Top Seven Dividends Paying 8   to Buy Right Now
I don t mess around with expired business models  Nor do I waste time with paltry 2   3  or even 4  or 5  dividends 
So let s discuss my seven top 8   dividends to buy right now  All of these payouts are well funded  and likely to grow in the future 
My favorite firm has now increased its payout every quarter for 17 consecutive quarters  And these have been meaningful increases with sustained momentum  The company s most recent hike represented a 10 1  increase year over year 
An Accelerated Aristocrat  17 Straight Hikes
The best time to buy a dividend grower like this is anytime  But we can tip the odds in our favor even further when we buy at moments like these   when the share price is due to  catch up  to the dividend 
There have been two great times to buy these shares in the last five years 
Early 2016  Its stock price plunged below its ever growing dividend  providing opportunistic investors with quick 35  price upside  And 
Right now 
Stocks tend to appreciate as fast as their dividends  Buy a static payer  and you shouldn t expect much upside  Buy a 10  annual dividend grower like this  and you should expect 10  price upside to go along with your 8 9  yield 
Remember  total returns are made up of dividends and price appreciation  The latter  price gains  are driven by some combination of 
Dividend raises  which inspire investors to pay more for the stock or fund   and or
A climb towards fair value  a closing of the discount window in a closed end fund s  CEF s  case  or a higher multiple on FFO for a REIT  
All together  my dividend superstar 7 pack yields 8 8   And each play has price upside to boot   giving us the potential for 25  total returns or more in the year ahead

133272,354787,MAR,These 6  Dividends Are Flashing  Buy ,opinion,"I had to laugh when I saw this Barron s headline last week 
 REITs Are Sending a Powerful Buy Signal 
My response  Of course they are  They have been for a while now 
If you ve been following my articles on Contrarian Outlook  you know   with their outsized dividends  and dividend growth  and upside potential 
And now the press is finally paying attention 
It is satisfying when the pundits finally catch up to us  But the bad news is that it also means our shot at the biggest gains  and dividends  is likely on borrowed time as the headline driven herd piles in 
That s why I m publishing this article today  including 3 REIT sectors set to rebound  along with 4 individual REITs and REIT funds yielding 6 1  on average and ripe for buying now  See below for more on that  
I can sum up today s REIT buying opportunity in one chart 
REIT Blowout Sale  Everything Must Go  
The double digit price drop in the Vanguard REIT  NYSE VNQ  since January 1 has inflated its dividend yield to 4 8   because yields rise as share prices fall  
Surging Yield Grabs the Spotlight 
And you can do way better than that with just a bit of research zeroing in on trusts with solid 6   dividends and or outsized dividend growth  just like the 4 names I ll reveal in just a few more seconds 
But you know what makes the big drop in REIT prices even more ridiculous 
As Barron s says  REITs  adjusted funds from operations  AFFO  a better measure of REIT performance than earnings per share  are healthy and set to soar  with one analyst calling for a 5 5  rise in 2018  then a 6 5  jump next year 
And for that  the market whacks REITs with an 11  drop 
You and I both know a dead giveaway like that cash flow up  prices down is our  bat signal  to dive into REITs  especially as most of the herd hasn t caught on yet 
They re still sitting in cash  terrified that rising interest rates will  a  boost REITs  interest costs and b  boost the yield on the 10 year Treasury Note  helping so called  safe  investments like Treasuries steal investors from yield plays like REITs 
Of course  they will overcome this silly fear  and that Barron s article I just mentioned is the canary in the coal mine 
If you need more proof  this is exactly how things played out from May 2003 to late June 2006  when the yield on the 10 Year surged from 3 4  to 5 25  a 56  jump 
How did REITs do 
Going by the iShares US Real Estate  NYSE IYR   which I m using in this example because VNQ didn t launch till September 2004 pretty well 
Rates Rise REITs Explode 
Take a close look at that chart  Notice how IYR  in orange  mostly matches or lags the rise in the 10 Year Treasury yield  blue  and the gain of the SPDR S P 500 ETF  NYSE SPY   in red  until July 2004 before breaking out 
That s the exact moment we re in now 
So you re ready when the REIT wave crests  here are 3 REIT sectors to buy into now  ranked from worst to first   plus a standout REIT from each  I m leaving out retail REITs  Amazon com  NASDAQ AMZN  is eating their tenants alive  
I ve also included a REIT closed end fund  CEF    throwing off a gaudy 8 2  dividend yield now 
REIT Sector  3  Self Storage
As   self storage is a great play on the booming economy and downsizing baby boomers 
But it also has a low barrier to entry  once you ve built a facility  you really only have to hand out keys and collect the rent   That s triggered a boom in self storage construction  leading to predictable oversupply in some cities 
In fact  according to Life Storage Inc  NYSE LSI   owner of 700 facilities in 28 states  there are 89 square miles of self storage in the US  That s nearly triple the size of Manhattan 
But LSI is still worth your attention because it does a great job of tapping neglected markets  occupancy ticked up 70 basis points in the fourth quarter from a year ago  to 91 6   revenue gained 3 4   and adjusted FFO edged up 2 3   Those are steady gains for LSI  which yields 5 1  and has doubled its payout since 2013 
The kicker  Thanks to the REIT selloff and its competitors  antics  you can buy it for 14 7 times the midpoint of management s forecast 2018 FFO  Cheap 
REIT Sector  2  Lodging
Lodging REITs have a lot in common with self storage  they re benefiting from the surging economy     But some operators have had a tough time keeping themselves from overbuilding  Then there s disruption from the likes of Airbnb 
So where should we turn here 
To a  do everything  REIT like Hospitality Properites Trust  NASDAQ HPT   It s fighting off Airbnb with 20 hotel brands anchored by instantly recognizable names like Radisson  Holiday Inn and Marriott International Inc  NASDAQ MAR   Better still  it focuses on business travel  a market Airbnb mostly ignores 
The Entire Hotel Business in 1 Buy 
But these aren t even the best reasons to like HPT 
This is  it boasts 199 Petro and TA travel centers along key interstates  and these humble pit stops will cash in as 3 4  more freight zooms down American highways every year through 2023  according to the American Trucking Association  
That s all translating into an incredible 7 9  dividend and payout growth 
The Best of Both Worlds 
Two more things  the dividend is easily covered by HPT s FFO  eating up just 57  over the last 12 months  And the stock trades at 7 4 times FFO a ridiculous multiple that just can t last 
REIT Sector  1  Warehouses 
Imagine being Amazon s landlord sitting back and collecting rent as the e commerce giant spreads across the world   filling up your warehouses as it does 
Imagine no more  because you can start  indirectly  collecting those checks from Jeff Bezos s company through Duke Realty Corporation  NYSE DRE   owner of 492 warehouses in 21 major markets  Amazon is its No  1 tenant 
A Strong E Commerce Play  Source  Duke Realty Q4 investor presentation
Rising warehouse demand is feeding into stronger sales  Q4 revenue jumped 19   while occupancy at Duke s operating warehouses held steady at a high 95 7  
You are only getting a 3 2  dividend here  lower than our other picks  but management has been inching up the payout in recent years and just handed shareholders a nice  0 85 special dividend after unloading its medical office business 
That sale gives DRE more upside as management focuses on the growing warehouse segment  Plus  the REIT s payout only occupies 62  of core FFO  so it has lots of room to do more there too 
Finally  DRE trades at 19 5 times the midpoint of management s 2018 FFO forecast  more than reasonable in light of its growth potential 
An  All in One  REIT Play With an 8 2  Dividend
Finally  let s add some international zip with a REIT closed end fund  CEF   the CBRE Clarion Global Real Estate Income Fund  NYSE IGR  
Two numbers stand out here  8 2   the fund s incredible dividend yield  and 11 8   IGR s discount to net asset value  NAV  
We don t have to get into the weeds with that last figure  It basically means IGR trades 11 8  below the market value of the assets it owns  That s way below its five year average of 7 4   so there s some nice  snapback  potential here 
Another great thing about IGR  The diversification you get in one quick buy 
 Source  CBRE Clarion Global Real Estate Income Fund December 2017 fact sheet
IGR s diversification has paid off for investors during the REIT rout  they ve pocketed a nice gain  including dividends  compared to folks who simply bought VNQ a year ago and promptly went underwater  even with dividends 
Diversification Keeps Your Nest Egg Safe 
One last thing  if you ve heard about CEFs and worry about leverage  don t bother  Clarion has only borrowed against 14  of the portfolio  That s way below the 27  our in house CEF expert  Michael Foster   for your average equity CEF 
Just Released  8 Life Changing 8   Dividends Paid Monthly
Buying the 3 REITs  and 1 REIT CEF  I just showed you gets you in on an incredible number of assets everything from preferred shares  which are held in IGR  to self storage REITs and even hotel operators 
The only drawback 
Taken together  these stocks and funds  only  yield 6 1   on average 
Don t get me wrong here that s a terrific payout in anyone s book  It s 3 times more than you d get from the average S P 500 stock 
But we can do better  AND we can get our dividend payouts every single month  instead of quarterly   to boot 
The key 
My 8   Monthly Dividend  portfolio  which I first shared with a select few investors a couple weeks ago  I ll show it to you now FREE  
This powerful set of stocks hands you 2 HUGE advantages that will help you retire rich on a lot less than the so called  experts  say you need

133292,354807,MAR,Hilton Vs  Marriott  Which Is A Better Buy Ahead Of Q4 Earnings ,opinion,After experiencing a strong 2017  the hotel industry is likely to enjoy another successful year  A confluence of factors is working in favor of the sector at the moment  Firstly  the economy remains strong and the labor market continues to strengthen  Also  the recent jump in yearly wage growth bears evidence of the fact that the American consumer is likely to have even greater levels of disposable levels of income over the rest of the year According to the recently released Deloitte 2018 Travel and Hospitality Industry Outlook  the hotel industry is likely to expand by 5 6  over 2018  This is likely to result in record gross bookings of around  170 billion In January  a report by PricewaterhouseCoopers  PwC  indicated that a strong economy and recent tax cuts would fuel the highest rates of occupancy for the hospitality industry since 1981  According to PwC  occupancy is likely to increase to 66 1  for hotels in the United States in 2018 With Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc    NYSE HLT   and Marriott International Inc    NASDAQ MAR   both scheduled to report on Feb 14  this may be a good time to consider which of these is a better stock  Both stocks have a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  Other major stocks reporting earnings on Feb 14 include Cisco Systems   NASDAQ CSCO   and Applied Materials  Inc    NASDAQ AMAT   Price PerformanceWhen considering price performance over the last three months  Marriott has gained 13 2   higher than the broader  s 9 9  increase over the same period  On the other hand  Hilton has gained 10 8  over this period  which exceeds the broader industry s performance but falls behind Marriott Current RatioThe hospitality industry requires a large quantum of working capital  Additionally  it also needs to service a number of short term financial obligations  This is why liquidity ratios are an essential component of the industry s analysis The current ratio measures the ability of a company to meet short term debt obligations  In other words  it is the ratio of the current level of total assets and expresses to that of the current level of liabilities  Here  Hilton is a clear winner with a current ratio of 0 94  which is superior to the industry average of 0 72 as well as Marriott s reading of 0 53 Debt RatioThe hospitality industry is characterized by a high level of long term debt as well as current liabilities  Such high levels of debt are required to finance  maintain and operate large cruise lines as well  Given the high proportion of long term assets  debt financing over an extended period is a necessary requirement Since the sector has a high level of financial leverage  debt ratios naturally come into the picture  This measures the ability of a company to services long term debt  Hospitality stocks should ideally have lower debt ratios  This implies that assets are present in higher proportion compared to debt over the long term Here Hilton is at a disadvantage with a debt ratio of 46 5   which is higher than the industry average of 41 1   At 35 8   Marriott has a debt component  which is lower than both Hilton s as well as the industry Dividend YieldIn the last one year period  Marriott has provided a dividend yield of 0 95   marginally higher than the industry average of 0 94  In comparison  Hilton offers a dividend of 0 73   Hence  on a comparable basis  Marriott shareholders earned better dividend yield than those of Hilton ValuationThe most appropriate metric to capital intensive companies like hotels is the EV EBITDA multiple  This ratio helps to overcome several of the drawbacks of the P E ratio  This is because  unlike P E  the EV EBITDA ratio accounts for both the debt and shareholder perspectives With an EV  EBITDA value of 21 6  Marriott is clearly overvalued compared with the industry which as an EV EBITDA value of 12 77  In contrast  Hilton is a cheaper stock with an EV EBITDA value of 11 19 Gross MarginCompanies which are part of the hospitality industry generate billions of dollars of revenues  Additionally  several companies are well established which implies that appreciably high profit margins are generated by companies with differing market capitalizations With a gross margin TTM value of 16 1   Marriott underperforms its smaller rival Hilton on this count  On the other hand  Hilton sports a gross margin TTM value of 72 6   which outperforms Marriott as well as the broader industry  which has a gross margin TTM value of 36 8  Earnings History  ESP and Estimate RevisionsWhen considering   Hilton is a clear winner with an ESP value of  0 13   which is superior to Marriott s reading of  1 11   The situation is similar when comparing the increase in earnings estimates over the last thirty days  While Marriott s estimate has increased by 2 1   Hilton is better off on this count since its estimate has increased by 3 9  over the same period Considering a more comprehensive earnings history  both Hilton and Marriott have delivered positive surprises in each of the trailing four quarters  However  Hilton has a superior average earnings surprise of 19 2  compared to Marriott s figure of 9 1  ConclusionBoth Hilton and Marriott carry a Zacks Rank  2  so there is little to choose between the two on this count  However  our comparative analysis shows that Marriott has an edge over Hilton when considering price performance  debt ratios and dividend yields But when considering valuations  gross margins and current ratios  Hilton is a superior stock  Hilton is also ahead when considering their comprehensive earnings histories and estimate revisions What clinches the case firmly in favor of Hilton is a superior ESP value of  0 13  than Marriott s reading of  1 11   This is why it may be a good idea to bet on Hilton over Marriott as they prepare to report earnings on Feb 14   The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of All                 Last year  it generated  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  47 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce  the world s first trillionaires   but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early ,2018-02-12,Zacks Investment

133315,354830,MAR,Will Soft Sales   High Costs Hurt Mattel s  MAT  Q4 Earnings ,opinion,Mattel  Inc    NASDAQ MAT   is scheduled to report fourth quarter 2017 numbers on Feb 1  after market close Last quarter  the company s earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 83 93   In fact  Mattel saw earnings misses in each of the trailing four quarters  the average negative surprise being 68 48  Further  shares of the company have lost 43  in the past year  against the  s gain of 51 3  Mattel  Inc  Price     Sales to Decline FurtherThe consensus estimate for revenues in the to be reported quarter is pegged at  1 76 billion  reflecting a 4 2  year over year decline The projected sales decline is primarily due to a challenging sales environment owing to growing demand for a broad array of alternative modes of entertainment  including video games  MP3 players  tablets  smartphones and other electronic devices from companies like Electronic Arts  Inc    NASDAQ EA   Moreover  the recent Toys  R  Us bankruptcy aggravated matters  Mattel has been particularly affected by the bankruptcy as it resulted in a year over year decline in third quarter 2017 revenues and profits  This is expected to reflect in fourth quarter revenues as well Also  per a recent regulatory filing  the company expects 2017 sales to decline by a percentage of at least mid to high single digits compared to 2016  For the to be reported quarter  the company expects particularly weak sales as a few of its major brands have been underperforming for quite some time now  Also  the company s key retail partners are moving toward tighter inventory management Weak Margins to Hurt Bottom LineThe consensus estimate for fourth quarter earnings is pegged at 20 cents  suggesting 61 5  year over year decline  Also  the company witnessed a 51 2  downward revision in earnings estimates over the past 60 days  reflecting analysts  pessimism surrounding the stock This bottom line is expected to be hurt primarily by a rise in operating expenses  We note that  even though Mattel suspended its dividend payments and adopted cost cutting initiatives  it is expected to see a slight uptick in 2017 expenses in comparison to 2016 on a gross dollar basis  For fourth quarter 2017  the company expects year over year rise in operating expenses  leading to a drop in operating margin Additionally  owing to the Toys  R  Us bankruptcy  the company s gross margins are likely to decline in the fourth quarter  For the first nine months of 2017  net sales reversal in Toys  R  Us accounted for approximately one fifth of the year over year decline in total margin The company reported a 620 basis points  bps  year over year decline in gross margin during the said time  This decline  led by unfavorable product mix  higher freight and logistics expenses and lower fixed cost absorption  is expected to be reflected in fourth quarter 2017 results  A persistent decline in the top line is likely to result in gross margin deterioration due to higher inventory write downs and discounts offered to clear inventory Finally  the company stated that its gross margin and operating income might get affected by fourth quarter charges or expenses which include restructuring and other non cash write offs  These expenses could be material or incurred in connection with the company s recent cost savings program  targeting run rate cost savings of at least  650 million Our Quantitative Model Predicts a MissMattel does not have the right combination of two main ingredients   a positive  and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or higher   for increasing the odds of an earnings beat Zacks ESP  Mattel has an Earnings ESP of  38 78   You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Zacks

of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter Marriott International   NASDAQ MAR   and Penn National Gaming  Inc    NASDAQ PENN   have an Earnings ESP of  0 32 and  8 71  respectively  Both the companies sport a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see  Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest StrategiesIt s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But while the market gained  18 8  from 2016   Q1

133322,354837,MAR,Hotel Industry To Break Records Through 2019  4 Solid Buys,opinion,The U S hotel industry posted a stellar performance in 2017 and experts believe that it will break more records through next year  Demand for hotel rooms is burgeoning  with revenue per available room  RevPAR  increasing for a whopping 94 months in a row A strong economy bolstered by record consumer spending levels was cited as the primary reason for the impressive performance  Such encouraging factors will help the hotel industry gain traction in the near future  while GOP tax cuts will spur an increase in leisure as well as hotel development  Given the positives  doubling down on the hottest hotel stocks seems judicious Record Breaking Growth Projected for Hotel IndustryAs per hotel research firm STR and Tourism Economics  the hotel industry is projected to see a 0 3  rise in occupancy in 2018  Average daily rate  ADR  and RevPAR are expected to rise 2 4  to  129 77 and 2 7  to  85 82  While the luxury and independent segments will witness the largest increase in occupancy this year  Independent hotels are expected to post considerable growth in ADR   2 5   and RevPAR   2 9   As per the report s initial forecast for 2019  the hotel industry is projected to report a 0 1  increase in occupancy  2 3  growth in ADR to  132 81 and 2 4  rise in RevPAR to  87 89  RevPAR is expected to be the maximum at the Luxury segment All the three key metrics are poised to scale north this year and the next as demand continues to outpace supply  Source  STR Tourism Economics Needless to say  occupancy increased 0 9  last year and ADR rose 2 1  to almost  127  driving RevPAR by 3   All the metrics surpassed projections and touched record levels  per the report  Houston  Texas  in the meantime  reported the highest spike in RevPAR  thanks to displaced residents seeking rooms due to hurricane Harvey  Meanwhile  Nashville  Tennessee  posted the largest rise in ADR Stronger GDP   A Key CatalystThe hotel industry is in a solid position moving through the next year  particularly due to a stronger economy powered by record consumer spending levels  The nation s GDP increased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2 6  in the final three months of 2017 following gains in the previous two quarters of more than 3   per the  advance  estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis  This marked the economy s strongest stretch of growth since the expansion started in mid 2009 The economy was driven by solid consumer spending in the fourth quarter  The main engine of the economy grew at 3 8  over the quarter after a 2 2  gain in the third quarter  Consumer outlays  thus  registered the fastest pace of growth in the fourth quarter in almost two years  Spending  in fact  climbed 0 4  in December  notching the highest increase in household buying since 2011 Consumers are  largely  benefitting from a low unemployment level and rise in income  Jobless rate remained at an ultra low level of 4 1  and workers  pay increased 2 5  from December 2016 to December 2017  read more    Tax Overhaul Policy to Benefit Hotel IndustryThe GOP tax cuts are a blessing in disguise for the hotel industry  President Trump s new tax plan will reduce individual tax rates as the headline grabbing move lowers corporate tax rate from 35  to 21   The tax cut will be implemented this year  instead of being delayed until 2019  read more    On an individual level  tax cuts will boost the paychecks for many workers and will result in higher discretionary income for leisure travel  This in turn will boost revenues for hoteliers  Major hotels  in the meantime  will advantage from the corporate tax cut and spend the extra money on business development and growth in America 4 Top PicksIt will  therefore  be prudent to invest in fundamentally sound hotel stocks that can make the most of the bullish run  We have  thus  selected four such companies that carry a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  The strength in the  space is also confirmed by its solid Zacks Industry Rank in the top 27   In fact  the top 50  of Zacks Ranked Industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a

133335,354850,MAR,5 Top Ranked Consumer Stocks That Crushed The Market In 2017,opinion,Consumers  who are the core of all economic activity  have shown profound optimism lately as is evident from the increased consumer confidence  consumer spending and stable job scenario  Consumers  favorable position also reflects a steady U S  economy  which is poised for growth The commerce department revealed that annual gross domestic product  GDP  rose 3 3  in third quarter 2017  second estimate   above the advance reading of 3  and up from 3 1  growth in the preceding quarter  This growth was supported by increases in consumer spending  inventory investment  business investment  and exports Consumer spending rose 2 3  in the third quarter  Further  initial holiday period sales data  during the Thanksgiving weekend  suggests that consumers are increasingly spending on restaurants  clothing  electronics  fuel and groceries in November Moreover  consumers  optimism is well reflected in the Consumer Confidence data  which increased for the fifth straight month and remains at a 17 year high in November  The Conference Board s Consumer Confidence Index surged to 129 5 in November from October s reading of 126 2 A major reason for the high consumer confidence is consumers  expectations of further improvement in labor market  Notably  the labor market remains attractive with a gradual decline in unemployment rate  The unemployment rate has gone down significantly to 4 1  in November from 4 8  in January The uptick in the U S  economy is well supported by the bullish run of the stock markets in 2017  Major stock indices Nasdaq Composite Index  the S P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average registered year to date growths of 15 2   nearly 20  and 24 3   respectively  Not surprisingly  investors can make the most of this market momentum by investing in stocks that have crushed these indices in 2017 Why Consumer Discretionary Sector Well  spending on discretionary items which form a part of the  sector is largely dependent on consumers  spending appetite  Given the favorable background discussed above  consumers are currently willing to spend on discretionary items like durable goods  apparel  entertainment and leisure  and automobiles The Consumer Discretionary sector growth trends since the start of 2017 have been very appeasing  Markedly  the sector

133340,354855,MAR,5 Top Stocks With Attractive Sales Growth To Buy Right Away,opinion,With ever changing market dynamics  investors are often lured into undertaking complex investment strategies  But this may not yield the desired results always  Therefore  using conventional strategies based on key fundamentals to select stocks is always a safe and sound approach for ensuring steady returns Among several rational and down to earth investment strategies  we picked one that is focused on the sales growth of a company  Steady sales growth is the key to survival for a business Flat or declining sales growth shows obstacles at the company  which will limit scope for sustained growth  Stagnant companies may generate profits for a short period  but they do not ensure enough growth to attract new investors Revenues are often more closely monitored than earnings when assessing the growth of a business  It s worth keeping in mind that in cases when companies incur a loss  albeit temporarily  they are valued on their revenues  as top line growth  or decline  is usually an indicator of a company s future performance  So  the Price to Sales  P S  ratio can turn out to be an apt metric for stock valuation  This metric s importance further lies in the fact that management has limited opportunities to manipulate revenues unlike earnings Focusing solely on sales growth is  however  not desirable  A consideration of a company s cash position along with its sales number can be a more dependable strategy  Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and investments Choosing the Winning StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance  we have selected 5 Year Historical Sales Growth     greater than X Industry and Cash Flow greater than  500 million as our main screening parameters But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks  So  we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy Price to Sales  P S  Ratio less than X Industry  This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company s revenues  The lower the ratio  the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales   Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions  4 Weeks  greater than X Industry  Better than industry estimate revision has often been seen to trigger an increase in the stock price Operating Margin  Average Last 5 years  greater than 5   Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company s sales translates into profits  A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs  an optimal situation for the company Return on Equity  ROE  greater than 5   This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash  A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment  You can see  Here are five of the 16 stocks that qualified the screening Based in Bethesda  MD  Marriott International  Inc    NASDAQ MAR   operates  franchises and licenses hotels and timeshare properties  The

133390,354905,MAR,Thanksgiving Travel To Be Highest In 12 Years  5 Picks,opinion,More Americans will hit the roads or take to the skies this Thanksgiving weekend  a number that would surpass the levels of the past 12 years  Traveling by car  train or plane is in the cards  courtesy of an uptick in personal income and steady wage growth  Upbeat consumer confidence and a healthier economy are also fueling the travel boom  Lest we forget  airfares are cheap this travel season and gasoline prices are finally declining as hurricane effects wane  Thus  traveling this season won t burn a hole in your pocket Given this upbeat scenario  investing in travel and leisure companies will be judicious  Uptick in travel during the holiday period will certainly boost airlines  while pre tax profits of all major airlines are already solid  Another profitable investment options are hotel and resort companies  More travel will lead to increased hotel occupancy and in turn revenue per available room Thanksgiving Travel to Hit 12 Year HighAccording to the American Automobile Association  AAA   about 50 9 million travelers are expected to travel 50 miles or more  the highest since 2005  Thanksgiving travel is anticipated to increase 3 3  from last year About 89  or 45 5 million travelers are expected to travel by car  hinting at an increase of 3 2  over the last Thanksgiving weekend  Modes of transport including cruises  trains and buses are expected to make up 1 1  of all travel this Thanksgiving  serving around 1 48 million travelers However  3 95 million travelers are expected to opt for flights  which is 5  higher than the year ago level  Flights are expected to account for 9 9  of all travel this Thanksgiving Airports to Be Busy  Pre Tax Profits SolidThe industry trade organization for U S  airlines  Airlines for America  A4A  sounded even more optimistic  They expect about 28 5 million passengers to take to the skies over the 12 day Thanksgiving holiday period that stretches from Nov 17 to Nov 28  up 3  from 2016  On average  additional 69 000 travelers are expected to fly each day  compared to the same period last year  The trade organization expects Nov 26 to be the busiest  with an estimated 2 88 million passengers A4A Vice President and Chief Economist John Heimlich said that  airline passengers continue to benefit from the highly competitive air service landscape this holiday season  as low fares and increased availability of seats continue to make air travel widely accessible  Collectively  all major airlines including Alaska  Allegiant  American  Delta  Hawaiian  JetBlue  Southwest  Spirit and United had posted a healthy pre tax profit of around  14 7 billion during the first nine months of this year and operating revenues for the group jumped 3 8  Will Travel Become Expensive Airfares are expected to fall 23  this Thanksgiving compared to the previous year  For the top 40 domestic flight routes  average airfares may come in at  157 this year  according to AAA s Leisure Travel Index Gasoline prices during Thanksgiving are expected to reach  2 53 a gallon  Even though this is the highest since 2014  it is far below the all time high of  3 44 in 2012  In fact  gasoline prices are expected to drop as the effects of hurricanes and other disruptions began to wane  This possibly explains why so many Americans are willing to travel by road  As the bulk of the travel is expected to be via road  rental car giant Avis Budget is poised to be among the biggest gainers Meanwhile  average stay in a Two Diamond Hotel will cost 5  lower this year at  117  Conversely  the cost of a Three Diamond hotel is expected to increase 14  to  176 per night  Rise in prices  however  shouldn t be a deterrent to travelers  thanks to the increase in wages and personal income What s Boosting Travel This Thanksgiving Rise in income levels is driving the travel industry  Average hourly earnings increased 2 4  from October 2016 to October 2017 Personal income  in the meanwhile  increased by  66 9 billion  or 0 4   in September  while disposable personal income that measures the total amount of money available for use after payment of taxes rose by  73 6 billion  or 2 1   in the third quarter  according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis 5 Stocks to Ride the Thanksgiving RushWith the rise in income levels  people are willing to spend more on travel this holiday period  As travel volumes are expected to shoot up  investing in travel and leisure companies seems profitable  Increase in travel will surely lead to an uptick in demand for air tickets and hotel rooms  We have  thus  selected five such stocks that boast a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  SkyWest  Inc    NASDAQ SKYW    through its subsidiaries  operates a

the firms are expected to benefit immensely  CEO and COO Larry D  De Shon of car rental company  Avis Budget Group Inc    NASDAQ CAR   said that eclipse helped push rental prices higher  Maven  the on demand car sharing brand from General Motors   NYSE GM    had offered a  10 discount code ECLIPSE for travelers to move towards the eclipse lookout point   And with millions of Americans hitting the road to catch a glimpse of the once in a century solar eclipse  such a move will surely lift the company s margins Financial and bank holding company  First Interstate Bancsystem Inc   NASDAQ FIBK   has more than 120 offices in the states of Idaho  Montana  Oregon  South Dakota  Wyoming and Washington  These are some of the key states that experienced the total solar eclipse and with millions flocking to these states  the bank s business will surely get a shot in the arm Many brands also geared up to cash in on this rare event  Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd   NYSE RCL   aptly named its cruise Total Eclipse  where Bonnie Tyler sang  Total Eclipse of the Heart   And for those who haven t traveled  Discovery Communications Inc s   NASDAQ DISCA   Science Channel gave live eclipse coverage all through the day Solar Eclipse a Bonanza for Airlines  HotelsAirlines have largely benefitted from this once in a lifetime event  as many traveled to large parts of the country that are

133498,355013,MAR,Ritz Carlton Is Heading To The Seas  Should Traditional Cruise Lines Worry ,opinion,"The Ritz Carlton Hotel Company is about to make serious waves  both literally and figuratively  Yesterday  the luxury  five star hotel chain  which is owned by Marriot International   NASDAQ MAR    announced that it will soon enter the cruise industry 
Dubbed the   the hotel s foray into the cruise market will consist of three ultra luxe yachts that invoke the vibe of a Ritz Carlton resort  Each yacht is custom built  and includes 149 suites and duplex penthouses with enough space for 298 guests  small cruisers  on average  can carry upwards of 650 passengers  so these yachts will give guests a much more intimate experience 
Interiors are  thoughtfully designed  by Tillberg Design of Sweden  one of the world s leading ship design firms  Luxury amenities include The Ritz Carlton Spa  as well as a restaurant by chef Sven Elverfeld of Aqua  the three Michelin starred restaurant at The Ritz Carlton  Wolfsburg in Germany  There will also be a Panorama Lounge and wine bar 
Voyages will range from seven to 10 days  and the first ship will travel to various destinations like the Mediterranean  Northern Europe  the Caribbean  and Latin American  Because these yachts will be smaller than your typical cruise ship  the vessels will be able to dock in smaller ports like Cartagena  Colombia  Capri  Italy  and St  Barths 
 This unique combination of yachting and cruising will usher in a new way of luxury travel for guests seeking to discover the world in a relaxed  casually elegant and comfortable atmosphere with the highest level of personalized service   Herve Humler  president and chief operating officer of The Ritz Carlton Hotel Company  said in a written statement 
Guests can begin making reservations next May  and the first voyage sets sail late in 2019 
Should Traditional Cruisers Be Worried 
There s no doubt Ritz Carlton and Marriot are entering a crowded space  Cruise companies like Carnival  LON CCL  Corp    NYSE CCL    Royal Caribbean   NYSE RCL    and Norwegian Cruise Lines   NASDAQ NCLH   dominate this sector of the travel industry  and are likely the first examples of an all inclusive cruise ship that come to mind 
But because of the size of their commercial ships  these companies are limited on where they can travel  Ritz Carlton s yachts  however  will be able to use their small size to their advantage  going to and staying in more exclusive port cities that big companies like Carnival can t access 
Additionally  guests will have the opportunity to spend less time at sea and more time to explore the cities the yachts dock in  Douglas Prothero  managing director of the Ritz Carlton Yacht Collection  that  We ll do four ports in seven days  not seven ports in seven days  
Voyages  then  will be slower  and each new destination will feature local chefs and artists  and even dignitaries and guest lecturers will come aboard  for a constantly rotating roster of talent and entertainment options   notes Bloomberg 
Guests will also be able to book pre  and post hotel stays in Ritz Carltons at these port cities  combining cruise and land vacations through one operator  And  it s safe to assume that Marriot s Rewards program will be an included perk of traveling on a Ritz Carlton yacht  though the hotel chain will likely have its own loyalty program as well 
The Ritz Carlton Yacht Collection will certainly be a one of a kind luxury cruise experience  Pricing hasn t been announced yet  but one can only guess it is very expensive  Due to this  traditional cruise lines shouldn t be too concerned  as Carnival  Royal Caribbean  and Norwegian have mass market appeal  and are much easier on the wallet  But if this venture proves profitable for Ritz Carlton and Marriot  and a huge hotel conglomerate successfully expands out into water  the impact will surely be far reaching

133519,355034,MAR,5 Top Ranked Stocks With Strong Sales Growth To Buy Now,opinion,Sales growth is a major financial indicator  which is often neglected while searching for a profitable investment strategy  In the current market scenario  marked by changing customer preferences and habits  evolving needs  demographic changes and an extremely competitive environment  maintaining stable sales growth is vital for any business Companies are always looking out for ways to boost their marketing initiatives to drive revenues  Notably  revenues are often more closely monitored than earnings when assessing the growth of a business It s worth keeping in mind that in cases when companies incur a loss  albeit briefly  they are valued on their revenues  as top line growth  or decline  is usually an indicator of a company s future earnings performance  So  the Price to Sales  P S  ratio can turn out to be an apt metric for stock valuation  It remains a major stock selection criterion as management usually has limited opportunities to manipulate revenues unlike earnings  Thus  the P S ratio is subject to lesser influence than the Price to Earnings ratio Sales growth in isolation  however  does not assure success  A consideration of a company s cash position along with its sales number can be a more dependable strategy  Substantial cash in hand and steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and investments Selecting the Winning StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance  we have selected 5 Year Historical Sales Growth     greater than X Industry and Cash Flow greater than  500 million as our main screening parameters But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks  So  we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy Price to Sales  P S  Ratio less than X Industry  This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company s revenues  The lower the ratio  the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales   Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions  4 Weeks  greater than X Industry  Better than industry estimate revision has often been seen to trigger an increase in the stock price Operating Margin  Average Last 5 years  greater than 5   Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company s sales translates into profits  A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs  an optimal situation for the company Return on Equity  ROE  greater than 5   This metric will ensure that sales growth is being translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash  A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment Here are five of the 20 stocks that qualified the screening Marriott International  Inc    NASDAQ MAR    based in Bethesda  MD  operates  franchises  and licenses hotels and timeshare

    Why a Likely Positive Surprise Our proven model shows that Marriott is likely to beat on earnings because it has the perfect combination of the two key ingredients Zacks ESP  Marriott has an  of  1 11   because the Most Accurate estimate is 91 cents  while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 90 cents  A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Zacks Rank  Marriott currently has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates Conversely  Sell rated stocks  Zacks Rank  4 or 5  should never be considered going into an earnings announcement The combination of Marriott s favorable Zacks Rank and positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat this quarter What is Driving the Better than Expected Earnings Marriott s earnings have been surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate consistently over the past 11 quarters on the back of growth in revenues as well as strong margins  We expect the trend to have continued in the to be reported quarter as well  Particularly  Marriott s increased scale and a robust development pipeline post Starwood purchase is likely to bolster the top line in the first quarter Moreover  increasing business and leisure travel on the back of improving economic indicators and positive employment numbers along with higher transaction volumes should further boost performance  In fact  its rising North American business and large international exposure are also expected to drive growth  Further  investments in technology for hotel bookings are likely to improve guest experience  which in turn is anticipated to boost occupancy For the first quarter  earnings per share are estimated between 87 cents and 91 cents  Meanwhile  comparable system wide revenue per available room  RevPAR  is expected to increase in the range of 1 3  on a constant dollar basis in North America and worldwide  Outside North America  the company projects the same to inch up in the 1 2  band However  lingering global uncertainty in some key operating regions is likely to limit revenue growth  Also  various macro concerns in the Middle East along with heightened competition in the domestic market are expected to mar first quarter RevPAR  Additionally  the company has been witnessing fewer international guests at its U S  hotels over the past few quarters  given the stronger dollar  This may continue to hurt revenues and profits in the to be reported quarter Other Stocks to ConsiderMarriott is not the only company looking up this earnings season  Here are some other companies to consider as our model shows that they also have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter Playa Hotels   Resorts N V    NASDAQ PLYA   has an Earnings ESP of  9 68  and a Zacks Rank  3  You can see  Red Lion Hotels Corporation   NYSE RLH   has an Earnings ESP of  3 33  and a Zacks Rank  3 Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd    NASDAQ NCLH   has an Earnings ESP of  2 70  and a Zacks Rank  3 Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply  one company stands out as the  1 stock to buy according to Zacks research It s not the one you think ",2017-05-04,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-a-beat-in-the-cards-for-marriott-(mar)-in-q1-earnings-200187123,200187123

133577,355092,MAR,Marriott Is Running On Fumes,opinion,"Marriott International might look tempting  but it seems to be exhausted  too 
Marriott International  NASDAQ MAR  operates and franchises hotels and lodging facilities in over 110 countries worldwide  With over 5700 properties and more than a million rooms  it is the largest hotel company in the world today  As of today  its market capitalization stands slightly under  35 billion at  89 44 a share  Things were looking a lot differently in November  2008  when the stock barely managed to stay above the  11 mark 
So  after eight full years of impressive advance  many might start wondering if it is time to invest in this industry leader  Well  we believe that buying because the price has been rising is not the best approach  Instead  let s analyze the post crisis uptrend and see what its wave structure can tell us about Marriott stock s prospects 
Marriott s weekly chart allows us to quickly realize that the stock is now trading within the fifth wave of the rally  which began in late 2008  According to the Elliott Wave Principle  this is the last phase of the uptrend  because once wave  5  is over  a three wave retracement should start  In a more distant perspective  the anticipated corrective decline is likely to drag Marriott s stock price back down to the support level of wave  4   In other words  instead of joining the bulls now  investors  who would like to own a share in this business  should consider saving their money for the moment  when Marriott falls between  60 and  50 again 
If this is the correct count  chances are the bulls are going to reach  100 a share  because wave  5  does not seem complete yet  That is why shorting is not even an option  However  buying seems risky  too  You do not want to go long just before a major bearish reversal  do you ",2017-02-17,EWM Interactive,https://www.investing.com/analysis/marriott-stock-running-on-fumes-200176083,200176083

133633,355148,MAR,Today s Trading Plan  Market Is Passed Out,opinion,"Technical Outlook 
There is only so much that can be said about a market that isn t going any where  Yesterday  S P 500  SPX  went right up to the all time highs and then proceeded to spend the rest of the day shaving off around 70  of the day s gains  
Volume on SPDRs S P 500  SPY  NYSE SPY   fell for a second consecutive day  and well below recent averages 
The difficulty in this market is holding on to a long position for any length in time because of the market s natural tendency for  mean reversion during mid July and August trading 
It is concerning that SPX is making new   but marginal   highs on a near daily basis  yet only 2 3 s of stocks are even managing to trade above their 40 day moving average  Individual stocks are not showing the same enthusiasm for this market run as the indices are 
Possible double top on the SPX 30 minute chart  Needs to break the August highs to nullify the pattern 
SPX attempting to sell off for a second consecutive week  which is something that hasn t been seen since the 3 week Brexit sell off  also counting the two weeks that led up to it  
If SPX finishes in the red for the week  there is a good chance it will be the lightest sell off you ve ever seen 
Janet Yellen speaks at Jackson Hole on Friday  The market seems to be in a holding pattern until then 
CBOE Market Volatility Index  VIX  is just about as boring as the broader market  It rose 0 9  yesterday  but still trading in the 12 s and little motivation at this point to break above  in the 13 s or below  in the 11 s 
Oil rebounded sharply yesterday and off of its lows yesterday  The current rally is running into some headwinds here  and even on the United States Oil Fund  NYSE USO  you have a possible  being formed 
The market is begging for a sell off but with the central markets accommodating continuously  that also gets in the way of any kind of meaningful pullback  Not to mention it is blatantly obvious that they are shelving any kind of rate hike until after the election 
Dow Jones Industrial Average  DJIA is keeping the double top pattern in play here  However it is coiling just underneath resistance which leads me to believe it wants to break through 
Overall  August is the worst performing month for the Dow Jones 30 and S P 500 
At this point  and with the election ahead  I d expect the market to keep rallying higher  I don t expect there to be a rate hike between now and the election  To do so would impact the market and thereby the election  I don t think the Fed wants that  particularly since Trump has indicated that he would replace Yellen

133638,355153,MAR,Looking For Yield and Capital Gains  Consider Sunstone Hotel Investors,opinion,"Lodging REITs have been underperformers this year even as investors have raced to find yield
Other REIT categories have seen appreciation while lodging REITs have languished  yet there is more to these REITs than outsized distributions
The best of them are likely to provide outsized capital gains  as well 

I have owned a number of lodging REITs in past years  Our most recent  however  was Hersha Hospitality  NYSE HT  which we sold at a nice profit back in late 2014   FYI  with its round trip back near what we paid this past year  Hersha is starting to look good again   But of the three most undervalued lodging REITs I see right now   Pebblebrook Hotel Trust  NYSE PEB   Hersha and Sunstone Hotel Investors  NYSE SHO    Sunstone would be my first choice with the others as further diversification later 
I travel a great deal for my business as well as for pleasure and in support of a non profit on whose board I serve  This puts me in lots of different hotels  where I always inquire which companies actually own and  if different  which manage the property  In most cases Marriott  NASDAQ MAR   Hilton  NYSE HLT   Hyatt  NYSE H  et al provide some combination of employee training  marketing and branding  logistics and supply  restaurant management  etc   but they do not own the land and buildings they occupy 
Often  the owners  typically REITs  large real estate development companies  or consortiums of successful individuals  will also hire a property management company to oversee day to day operations  No matter the business model  most quality properties then affiliate themselves with a nationally known hotelier like Hyatt  Hilton or Marriott in order to gain national exposure  provide loyalty programs  and train employees to the standard guests have come to expect from these names 
One of my favorite hotels  to which I return whenever I am in Southern California  is the Newport Beach Hyatt  This is an older hotel in a sylvan setting  spread across 26 acres with buildings no higher than three stories  The sense of being in the country  while really an easy walk to Balboa Island or a slightly longer one to Fashion Island  is enhanced by the views of Back Bay  beautiful landscaping and the contiguous golf course  The service is always superb and the onsite dining excellent  They are a typical Sunstone acquisition  The staff is attentive without being intrusive and leadership is innovative and guest focused 
Other Sunstone properties include those branded by Marriott  Hilton  Renaissance  Fairmont as well as other Hyatts  Specifically  this includes Marriott hotels in Portland  Park City  Wailea  Maui   Houston  New Orleans  the J W    Tyson s Corner  Virginia  suburban D C    Boston and Philadelphia  Renaissance branded hotels occupy Sunstone property and facilities are in Westchester N Y   D C   Baltimore  Orlando  Long Beach and Los Angeles  Other Sunstone properties include Hilton branded hotels in San Diego  La Jolla  Houston  Chicago  and New Orleans as well as the Fairmont in Newport Beach and Hyatts in Chicago and San Francisco 

One common theme you ll notice about Sunstone s locations  whether urban or resort setting  these properties are all located in cities with significant business travel or destination vacation attractions or both  With properties like these  all Sunstone has to do is keep them well maintained and occasionally remodeled  If ever there were  build it  they will come  destinations   these be them  
With these great locations and hotels  how is Sunstone executing  Pretty darn well  They are actively acquiring properties whose previous owners have been too parsimonious  Many of these are  faded glory  properties that were premier hotels in premier locations but have been overtaken by neighboring properties 

The lodging industry is fiercely competitive  Deep pocketed neighbors with newer properties can easily steal guests away if you don t keep your own properties fresh and new  For example  the Marriott branded Wailea  Maui Beach Resort   Spa sits directly between the Andaz  a Hyatt brand  on one side and the Grand Wailea  Four Seasons and Fairmont on the other  By purchasing from owners who wanted to milk their cash cow without spending the money to keep it competitive in such a crowd  Sunstone is able to add significant value 
Revenue per available room  RevPAR  is a performance metric used in the hotel industry  It is computed by multiplying a hotel s average daily room rate by its occupancy rate  In the case of this Wailea property  the RevPAR for its immediate competitors is  442  For Sunstone s new acquisition  still being upgraded  it is less than  240  As SHO completes its remodel  SHO will benefit twice  I believe the rooms themselves will see an increase in revenue and occupancy will also rise 

SHO s equity assets ratio  at 67   is among the highest in the hotel industry  Nat margins are just under 30   Return on equity is 14  and return on assets is 9 5   Revenue growth has stalled with all the upgrading of various properties  but I consider this to be a temporary event  If SHO s revenues declined because they were content to own declining properties I d be concerned  But as I see it revenues declined because the company made an investment in its future   buying properties that provide less revenue today but will yield more revenue as all upgrades are completed  Their debt is well covered by cash flow so they are still quite profitable 

As for stock valuation  Sunstone sells for 8 25 times TTM earnings   Of course  for REITs  PEs are not an important metric  adjusted FFO  funds from operations  are a better one  I think AFFO for SHO will come in at 11 or so this year  
Price book is 1 2 and price sales indicates good value at 2 2  Quarterly yield is just 1 5  however REITs must pay out 90  of earnings and  like many REITs  SHO pays a substantial  catch up  distribution at year end as well  This has typically taken it to the 7 5  to as high as 11  yield level for the year 
We are now buying Sunstone

133667,355182,MAR,Hotel Data Breach Possibly Compromises Data Of Thousands,opinion,"On August 12  HEI Hotels   Resorts  which manages over 50 luxury hotels across the United States  announced a security incident that may have compromised the personal information of customers who have made purchases on its properties 
As per the company s official statement   it appears that unauthorized individuals installed malicious software on our payment processing systems at certain properties designed to capture payment card information as it was routed through these systems   Data breaches stem as far back as March of 2015 to as recently as June of this year 
The company went on to state that the malware could  could have affected payment card data  including name  payment  card account number  card expiration date  and verification code   The malicious software was discovered in early to mid June and was found on payment systems in bars  spas  restaurants  and other amenities 
In response to the incident  HEI alerted federal authorities and has in the meantime installed a new payment system that is entirely separate from the rest of its network 
The list of properties affected can be seen   and spans locations in 10 states on and between the East and West coasts  It includes hotels such as Hyatt   NYSE H    InterContinental   NYSE IHG    and Marriott   NASDAQ MAR    amongst others 
Information is Power
The 21st century has seen an unprecedented technological revolution  It has seen the rise of the market known as the  Internet of Things   IoT   which our team extensively discussed   IoT describes the increased connectivity of household and commercial items through the internet and cloud based services 
Just as the IoT has altered consumer behavior and streamlined otherwise tedious tasks  it has also left consumers more exposed  The more technological services consumers use  the more personal data is collected  This data is quite valuable  not only to advertisers  but to hackers who can use it to steal identities and engage in less than savory activities 
HEI s data breach is not an isolated event  Recent news has seen other companies fall victim to the same type of attack  with organizations as high up as the Democratic National Committee seeing thousands of its emails leaked by hackers as well 
Although technology makes life easier  consumers should be weary of how much personal data they release on a day to day basis ",2016-08-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/hotel-data-breach-possibly-compromises-data-of-thousands-200148045,200148045

133692,355207,MAR,Thanks To Brexit  This Sector Is Making A HUGE Comeback,opinion,"It s been just over two weeks since the EU referendum vote  and investors are still dumping stocks as fast as their fingers can sell them 
Since the vote  the S P 500 Index has declined 1   But spot gold is up 9   and the iShares 20  Year Treasury Bond  NYSE TLT  has added another 8  over the same period  In fact  TLT is now trading at an all time high as fear grips the masses 
But the full blown disruption of the market has created a huge opportunity in a segment where few people are looking right now 
Cruising in the Slow Lane
Before the pivotal referendum vote  the financial sector was on fire with the prospect of rising interest rates 
From its February bottom  the S P 500 financial sector  outperformed the market for three consecutive months  Financials gained as much as 21  before the vote 
But the UK s vote to leave the European Union took much of the market by surprise 
And now  the Fed will likely hit the brakes on rate hikes for the rest of the year 
The odds of a hike at any point this year are now less than 10  
As you may know  banks  profits   and their stock prices   have lagged behind the broader market during the near zero interest rate era  ZIRP  
And the prospect of low rates for longer  will continue to weigh heavily on the already battered sector 
However  low rates do favor one crucial segment of the financial stock universe 
Low Rates  High Profits
Real estate investment trusts   or REITS   benefit greatly from low rates 
As you know  these companies buy up revenue generating real estate  often using leverage 
When rates are low  REITs make out like bandits taking advantage of cheap financing  And they can afford to reward shareholders with fat dividend payouts 
Since the start of the bull market  the Dow Jones U S  Select REIT Total Return has soared 479   That s more than twice the total return of the Dow Jones Industrial Average 
The caveat to this market segment is that it is sensitive to even the suggestion of rate hikes 
But thanks to Brexit  we may not see another interest rate hike for the next twelve months   or more 
This makes the current pullback the perfect opportunity to dive into the sector  And I ve got just the name to get you started 
The Diamond in the Rough
Diamondrock Hospitality Company  NYSE DRH  is a lodging focused real estate investment trust 
Founded in 2004 with headquarters in Bethesda  Maryland  the company owns approximately 30 hotels and resorts in North America  with a total of nearly 11 000 guest rooms 
Its properties are managed by some of the biggest names in the hospitality business  Marriot International  NASDAQ MAR   Starwood Hotels   Resorts Worldwide  NYSE HOT   and Hilton Worldwide  NYSE HLT  
The company reported third quarter financials on July 7 that exceeded Wall Street earnings estimates by a whopping 68  
Over the last five years  the company has increased funds from operations by 21    twice the median of its peers  And it currently sports a 5 5  yield   more than twice the S P 500 s 2 54  yield  and four times the yield of the US 10 year treasury bonds 
On a forward earnings basis  shares are trading at a 52  discount to their 10 year average 
Most importantly  the company is shielded from the chaos unfolding overseas 
As I noted last week  post Brexit currency fluctuations will wreak havoc on international revenue through the end of the year 
But the overwhelming majority of American small cap companies book their revenue here in the US 
DiamondRock  which sports a market cap of  1 8 billion  is well insulated from these effects  All of its revenue  which has grown at an average clip of 12  over the last five years  is generated in the US or its territories 
Best of all  its shares are moving in an ascending triangle pattern   which often precedes a breakout 
Despite rocky trade over the last few weeks  shares have stayed on their seven month uptrend channel 
Bottom line  With rates low and international fears high  domestically focused REITs are one of the market s juiciest opportunities right now

133704,355219,MAR,Marriott  MAR  Q1 Earnings  Can the Stock Pull a Surprise ,opinion,"Marriott International  Inc    NASDAQ MAR   is set to report first quarter 2016 results on Apr 27  after the market closes 
Last quarter  the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 1 32   In fact  the company has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters with an average positive surprise of 3 06  

Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors at Play
Marriott expects earnings in the range of 81 cents to 85 cents per share for the first quarter  The Zacks Consensus Estimate of 84 cents lies near the high end of the guided range 
Given the property locations and strong brand recognition  Marriott is poised to benefit from growing demand backed by its stepped up business and rising leisure traveling in the major North American markets  Moreover a low supply growth environment and greater pricing power should lead to strong RevPAR growth  Meanwhile  the company is capitalizing on digital innovation and social media  which is driving hotel bookings  Driven by these factors  RevPAR in North America is expected to grow 2 4  in the first quarter 
International system wide RevPAR is also expected to increase 2 4  this quarter backed by strong demand across certain important markets of Europe  like London and Amsterdam  as well as in India  Japan and Thailand  Additionally  the Mexican and Caribbean markets are performing well 
However  political disruption in the Middle East might hurt RevPAR in the to be reported quarter  Moreover  a sluggish economy in Brazil has been hurting demand in the region  The slowdown in the Chinese economy and persistent political disruption in Hong Kong may also prove to be headwinds in the quarter Further  security concerns would continue to hurt demand in Paris  Brussels and to a certain extent  in London 
Also  negative foreign currency impact would hurt Marriott s revenues as the strengthening dollar is eroding the value of international sales  The company is simultaneously bearing the brunt of the Venezuelan currency devaluation  Such volatility in exchange rates is expected to hurt revenues in the upcoming quarter  Apart from that  in the domestic market  the company is facing competition in New York due to a continuous increase in the number of hotels  which is limiting room rents and thus hurting RevPAR 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Marriott International is likely to beat earnings this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here  as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  Marriott International has an Earnings ESP of 0 00   This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 84 cents 
Zacks Rank  Marriott International s Zacks Rank  3 increases the predictive power of ESP  However  we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings beat 
Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum 
Stocks to Consider
Here are some companies in the broader consumer discretionary sector that investors may consider  as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter 
Boyd Gaming Corporation   NYSE BYD    with an Earnings ESP of  12 00  and a Zacks Rank  1

133709,355224,MAR,Hotel Stocks Slated To Report Q1 Earnings This Week  HOT  H,opinion,"This week  we expect to see earnings releases from a number of hoteliers as we move further ahead into the earnings season  Among these are some of the major players in the U S  hotel industry 
Despite the turmoil in international markets  the U S  hotel industry started 2016 on a bright note  Occupancy increased over the past few months driven by a rise in both business and leisure travel in the wake of a gradually improving economy and lower energy prices  Favorable supply and demand balances  strong investor appetite  thanks to higher transaction volumes  and solid lodging fundamentals spread cheer across the industry 
Despite the positives  increased competition and shifting consumer trends have been pressurizing profits in the industry in the recent past  As a result  hoteliers are firing on all pistons to ensure optimal profits while capitalizing on the growing tourism numbers  Higher costs incurred by leading hoteliers for renovation as well as technological and marketing initiatives to boost traffic are  however  taking a toll on profits  Further  online travel agents are limiting the pricing power  Therefore  hotels are struggling significantly to increase average daily rates 
Also  sluggish conditions in important emerging economies like Brazil and China continue to pose headwinds  Going forward  declining crude and commodity prices  rising inflation  and devaluation of currencies in these markets are expected to hurt the top line 
This week will see earnings releases from major hoteliers like Starwood Hotels   Resorts Worldwide Inc    NYSE HOT   and Hyatt Hotels Corporation   NYSE H    Let s take a look at how these companies are placed ahead of their scheduled announcements 
Starwood is set to report first quarter 2016 results on May 3  before the opening bell  The company s earnings have surpassed earnings estimates in all of the trailing four quarters  with an average surprise of 10 75   Starwood s quarterly revenues have also topped the consensus mark over this period  The company s revenues in North America  in particular  would benefit from economic growth  along with lower unemployment numbers and oil prices  which should translate to rising disposable incomes in U S  households  However  exchange rate fluctuations and various political issues around the globe are expected to hurt the top line to some extent  Meanwhile  a weak performance in China  one of the major markets  would keep the international RevPAR under pressure  Starwood has a Zacks Rank  4 and an  of 0 00    Read   

Another hotelier  Hyatt is also set to report first quarter 2016 results on May 3  before the opening bell  The company s earnings have missed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters  with an average negative surprise of  14 34   Hyatt has been facing major headwinds over the past few quarters in the form of a strong dollar  which is leading to unfavorable foreign exchange translation  Moreover  given its significant presence in Europe and Asia  especially China  the company s first quarter revenues are likely to be hurt by currency headwinds  However  strong occupancy trends in U S  would somewhat mitigate these headwinds  Hyatt has a Zacks Rank  3 and an Earnings ESP of  4 17    Read   

Despite the slowdown in the emerging markets  major hotel companies like Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc    NYSE H   and Marriott International  Inc    NASDAQ MAR   have reported better than expected numbers in the first quarter  thanks to low expectations 
As such  not all hope is lost for hotel stocks as the market has already adjusted the prices  and their expectations  for the uncertain environment  This leaves ample scope for an earnings beat

Revenues  on the other hand  decreased a marginal 0 8  to  1 40 billion mostly due to a decline in contribution from owned  leased and consolidated joint venture hotels  and lower vacation ownership revenues  These were offset by a rise in other revenues from managed and franchised properties  and higher management fees  franchise fees and other income

Other Events
On Apr 29  2016  Interval Leisure Group  Inc  and Starwood announced a brief delay in the  closing of Interval Leisure s acquisition of Vistana  Starwood s vacation ownership business  due to certain tax related issues  The acquisition was previously expected to close on Apr 30  2016  and is currently scheduled in May 
On Apr 8  2016  and Starwood and Marriott International  Inc    NASDAQ MAR   announced that their stockholders have approved the proposed acquisition at their individual shareholders meet  The deal is expected to close in mid 2016  Per the deal  Starwood s shareholders will receive 0 8 shares of Marriott  along with  21 00 in cash for each Starwood share  In addition  they will receive a separate consideration from the spin off of the company s timeshare business   Vistana Signature Experiences  The deal was announced last November and would create the world s largest hotel company 
Our Take
Starwood is expected to benefit from the economic revival and steady rise in demand for hotels  Moreover  demand growth is expected to exceed supply growth through the rest of the year  allowing hoteliers to increase room rate and thus improve RevPAR 
Additionally  Starwood s strong developmental pipeline  significant international exposure  asset disposition strategy and shift to a fee based business model are expected to bode well over the long run 
However  we are concerned about the company s declining residential business revenues  which could continue to hurt the top line in the near term  Also  the lingering political uncertainty in Europe  Latin America and some parts of Africa  and an economic slowdown in China remain headwinds 
Starwood presently has a Zacks Rank  4  Sell

133731,355246,MAR,Why I Went 100  Cash Ahead Of Greek Referendum,opinion,"This was a decision that I really struggled with all day on Thursday 
I came into the day 30  short  which included positions Marriott  NASDAQ MAR  and Jarden  NYSE JAH   and long position in ARCA SDS   the ProShares UltraShort S P 500 
I really wanted to hold every position into the weekend  In fact  I desired  desperately wanted  to hold my positions over the weekend 
The S P 500 chart on the daily time frame indicated that the bounce on Tuesday and Wednesday was nothing more than a dead cat bounce 

Here s the dead cat bounce setup 

As you can see  the price action closed in a doji type of manner and right below key resistance  So why didn t I have the courage to hold my positions in the face of the Greek referendum vote to be held on Sunday ahead of Monday s market open 
 Because I was a coward  
Kind of a mean thing to say about myself  don t you think  Not necessarily  In fact in trading  cowards survive and those with the guts that aim for the glory  are the ones that ultimately blow up their accounts 
Yes  the temptation was there to go short into the weekend and roll the dice  If I was right  member of the SharePlanner Splash Zone would love me for it  However  that is not my purpose in trading  My purpose isn t to go for the glory or to be the hero  Not even close  Instead it is to play the risk  when it is in my favor 

But the problem with the holding positions over the Greek weekend was many 
  Having a good and firm grasp on the situation in Greece was a tall task  I spent over 20 hours  this week alone  studying the situation  not to mention the past 5 years as well  and the conclusion that I can form is that a  Greece has spent too much money over the years  b  they can t pay it back as it currently stands c  and no one truly know the consequences of these action 
  There are just as many opinions out there that state a  yes  vote on the referendum is bad as there are that a  yes  vote is good  and so is the case for the  no  vote 
  What Greece may ultimately due as a result of a  yes  or  no  vote remains unclear  Tsipras speaks out of both sides of his mouth  Not to mention the sudden change of heart on Wednesday where he suddenly want to accept all the demands  really spooked me as well 
  Politicians will ultimately seek the path of least resistance  At this point  if there is a situation that can be obtained  even at the detriment of the people they represent  these politicians will take it if it allows them to retain their power  I have no confidence in Tsipras or any of the main characters associated with the IMF  ECB or Germany 
  The polls were tightening on the Greek Referendum  and then the latest poll on Friday was rumored to be incomplete  and even shot down by the pollsters themselves  So that data was unreliable 
  It was a three day weekend  I really wanted one more day of trading to get a better feel for what this market ultimately wanted to do  The extra day of the market being closed created another day of risk and rumor that would have to be dealt with 

Then there was the strategy of my trades 
  If I was right and the market sold off hard on Monday  then I would profit nicely 
  If I was wrong and the market rallied hard on Monday  I would likely be stopped out of my positions at the market open and lose much of the profits from shorting the market from last week 
  The likelihood of a flat opening was unlikely in my opinion 

And then the alternatives that I could have by covering my positions prior to the close 
  By being 100  cash  it allows me to reset  see where the market wants to go following the Greek debt  and regardless if it is up or down  I can get long or short and follow the trend 
  If the market sells off  I will have to add the short positions back into the portfolio following the opening bell  and I won t make nearly as much profit had I simply held over the weekend 
  In the case of a rally  I would avoid significant losses  and have the ability after the opening bell to get long and actually make some profits on a move to the upside 
  A flat open allows me to jump back into the market at no cost to me and with the Greek Referendum in the rear view 
Overall  regardless of what the market does Sunday night when futures open back up and the subsequent open on Monday Morning  I know that I am making the right move  Was I reluctant to do so  Absolutely  From an emotional standpoint  it nearly ruined my night  I hated getting out of those positions  But the mark of a successful trader isn t the absence of emotions in trading  but the ability to ignore them and do what is in the best interest of preserving capital and increasing the portfolio value 
By going in cash  I believe I give myself an opportunity to do both ",2015-07-05,Ryan Mallory,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-i-went-100-cash-ahead-of-greek-referendum-257164,257164
133754,355269,MAR,AUD USD  Pushing Up To Resistance At 97 Cents,opinion,The AUD USD has returned to a level that was providing it support only a couple of weeks ago in 97 cents  Over the last few days  as the Australian dollar has rallied  it has run into a brick wall of resistance at this level which has temporarily halted its rally  It had spent the best part of the last week not moving a lot and remaining within a range between 0 96 and 0 97  The last couple of days have also seen support kick in at 0 9550 which has halted the strong fall  Last week it enjoyed a relatively solid few days which saw it halt the falls and rally back up towards 0 9850 before a sharp which saw it drop two cents  The week prior it experienced its worst week in a long time which saw it continue to move to new lows near 0 98  from highs not so long ago above 1 0250  although last week it did settle a little and find some support at the long term support level at 97 cents   Although presently appearing unlikely in the short term  should it recover and move back  it is likely the 1 00 level may now provide some resistance to higher prices  The AUD USD has now experienced an ordinary last few weeks as it wasn t so long ago it was moving up above 1 03 and threatening the key level at 1 0360  Up until earlier in May  the 1 02 level was one of significance and presented as a long term support level however this has now clearly been broken  It had been showing some bearish as it continued to place selling pressure on the 1 0220 and 1 02 levels and the RBA rate cut a few weeks ago was the catalyst for a strong push lower  seeing it just fall very heavily as if all support gave way  The last month or so have seen the AUD USD establish a strong medium term down trend with lower peaks and lower troughs  as it has moved from near 1 06 down to below 0 96 in that time   Over the course of the last month  the Australian dollar has fallen very sharply from near 1 06 to its lows near 0 9500  and in doing so  it also completely ignored any likely support at either 1 04 or 1 0360  In contrast  the week prior  it enjoyed a solid week moving strongly off the key level of 1 0360 towards 1 06 and to its highest levels since January  Up until mid April  the Australian dollar was enjoying its best move higher since October and November last year  Up until a few weeks ago  the AUD USD spent the best part of a month trading between the two key levels of 1 0220 and 1 0360 and it will take some effort to return it to this range  with the resistance being offered at the 1 02 level and now likely at 1 too   In economic news  key Australian data was mixed  as Building Approvals sparkled  while Private Capital Expenditure recorded a sharp drop  The Aussie will want to delete the month of May and move on  as the currency has plunged more than seven cents against the US dollar this month  The greenback has taken advantage of the RBA interest rate cut  lukewarm Australian data and the government s budget which pointed to the high value of the Australian dollar as an impediment to economic growth  These factors have resulted in nervous investors shifting their funds to US assets  resulting in the Aussie plunging in value  On Thursday  Building Approvals jumped to 9 1   blowing past the estimate of 4 1   However  Private Capital Expenditure posted its sharpest drop in four years  declining

narrow range right around 0 9670  after surged higher from new one year lows near 0 9500 over the last couple of days  A month ago the AUD USD was spending a fair amount of time trading roughly between 1 02 and 1 0550  however that range seems a distant memory as it has fallen down to near a 12 month low below 0 9600 late last week  In moving through to 1 0580 only a month ago  it moved to

133755,355270,MAR,GBP USD  Surges Strongly Through 1 52,opinion,The GBP USD has done very well to surge higher and move back through the 1 52 over the last couple of days  In doing so  it has moved through 1 5150 which it had previously experienced some difficulty with over the last week or so  It did well at the end of last week to reverse and recover a little back above 1 51 after having fallen strongly to a new two month low close to 1 50 in the couple of days prior  Interestingly in the last 48 hours it has moved to a lower level and therefore a reached a new two month low close to 1 50 before the strong surge higher  For a few days about a week ago it found some support around 1 5160 however this level has been clearly broken  The area around 1 5160 level has been providing some resistance of late as the pound continues to try and rally higher  The pound has now experienced a strong fall over the last few weeks  Prior to the last few weeks  the pound enjoyed a strong couple of weeks and move to new highs above 1 56  It experienced all sorts of bother at 1 56 as it made several pushes to this significant level however it was turned away with excessive supply  For about a week it ran into a wall of resistance right around the 1 56 level  The pound had enjoyed a very solid couple of weeks moving from the support level at 1 52 to reach new highs at 1 56  a new ten week high   Back around mid April the pound experienced solid support at 1 52 for about a week which greatly assisted the recent surge higher  and recently this level was called upon again to offer some support and a soft landing  however the pound fell strongly through it on its way down to near 1 50  A couple of weeks ago  we saw some evidence that the decline had been slowed down as it traded around 1 52 for about a week whilst receiving solid support from around 1 5160  The last few weeks has seen the pound fall strongly and return almost all of its gains from the few weeks before that  About a month ago the 1 54 level provided a little piece of resistance and this level has since been broken as it offered limited support  Now that the pound has drifted back down below 1 54  it may provide some resistance again although presently it has some other levels to deal with beforehand   Over the last month or so  the GBP USD has been experiencing a variety of different levels which have played a role on the price action  Towards the end of March the GBP USD was trading within a range roughly between 1 51 and 1 5250 and now on a couple of occasions it has been able to move outside that range and push higher  A few weeks ago  the 1 5350 level was one of significance as it offered resistance before the GBP USD was able to move higher through to 1 56  In early March the pound moved to new lows around 1 4830 from a starting point near 1 64 at the beginning of the year  With the surge higher over the last couple of months  the GBP USD had completely turned around its fortunes from earlier in the year  however it is starting to ease off and return most of the good work   The British pound continues to push hard against the US dollar  GBP USD has crossed above the 1 52 line in Thursday s North American session  The pound has taken advantage of disappointing US numbers earlier today  as GDP  employment and housing numbers missed their estimates  In the UK  Nationwide HPI rose 0 4   just shy of the estimate of 0 5   The US dollar is broadly weaker in Thursday trading  following weak US numbers  Unemployment Claims  which often moves the markets

After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad  picture reviewed Friday which  heading into the January Options Expiration week sees the equity markets looking at best to be consolidating  Elsewhere look for Gold to bounce higher in the possible bottoming while Crude Oil continues lower  The US Dollar Index looks ready to pause or pullback in its uptrend while US Treasuries are biased higher 
The Shanghai Composite also may be ready for a pause or short term pullback in the uptrend while the Emerging Markets are consolidating and biased to the downside  Volatility looks to remain subdued but perhaps slightly drifting up  keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETF s SPY  IWM and QQQ  but less so marginally  Their charts suggest some consolidation is in order and perhaps a short term pullback  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

133795,355310,MAR,GBP USD  Falls Sharply To Two Month Low Near 1 50,opinion,Over the last 48 hours the GBP USD has reversed again and fallen strongly to a new two month low close to 1 50  after enjoying a reasonable rally for a couple of days beforehand  For a few days it found some support around 1 5160 however the last 24 hours has seen a sharp drop and smash through a couple of support levels  This has resulted in seeing the pound at levels not seen since early March  The pound has now experienced a strong fall over the last couple of weeks  Prior to the last couple of weeks  the pound enjoyed a strong couple of weeks and move to new highs above 1 56  It experienced all sorts of bother at 1 56 as it made several pushes to this significant level however it was turned away with excessive supply  For about a week it ran into a wall of resistance right around the 1 56 level  This showed how much buying pressure there was on the 1 56 level but equally how well that level provided resistance to any movement higher  The pound had enjoyed a very solid couple of weeks moving from the support level at 1 52 to reach new highs at 1 56  a new ten week high   Back around mid April the pound experienced solid support at 1 52 for about a week which greatly assisted the recent surge higher  and now this level is being called upon again to offer some support and a soft landing  although the pound has drifted a little lower than 1 52 now  Towards the end of last week  we saw some evidence of that as the decline had been slowed down halted  although it has fallen slightly lower since  The last couple of weeks has seen the pound fall strongly and return almost all of its gains from the few weeks before that  About a month ago the 1 54 level provided a little piece of resistance and this level has since been broken as it offered limited support  Now that the pound has drifted back down below 1 54  it may provide some resistance again  During its push to 1 56  the pound was able to find some support at 1 55  although this level was also broken a couple of weeks ago   Over the last month or so  the GBP USD has been experiencing a variety of different levels which have played a role on the price action  Towards the end of March the GBP USD was trading within a range roughly between 1 51 and 1 5250 and now on a couple of occasions it has been able to move outside that range and push higher  A few weeks ago  the 1 5350 level was one of significance as it offered resistance before the GBP USD was able to move higher through to 1 56  In early March the pound moved to new lows around 1 4830 from a starting point near 1 64 at the beginning of the year  With the surge higher over the last couple of months  the GBP USD had completely turned around its fortunes from earlier in the year  however it is starting to ease off and return most of the good work   In the UK  another weak key release meant more bad news for the struggling pound  Retail Sales posted a decline of 1 3   way off the estimate of 0 0   It was the second straight decline for the key indicator  and its lowest reading since last May  There were no surprises as the Bank of England released the minutes of its recent policy meeting  which showed a unanimous vote to maintain the interest rate  while there was a split with regard to quantitative easing  as three of the nine MPC members voted to increase QE  The pound has had a disastrous month of May  and the downward slide shows no sign of letting up  The British currency has now shed about four cents against the dollar since the beginning of the month and if market sentiment continues to be negative  we could soon see the pound test the all important 1 50  May 23 at 04 30 GMT 1 5029 H  1 5157 L  1 5014GBP

133797,355312,MAR,EUR USD Trading Between 1 29 And 1 30,opinion,The Euro did well to finish last week by moving back up through the 1 29 level after experiencing a wild ride in that time by surging higher to the resistance level at 1 30 before falling sharply back down towards the long term support level at 1 28  only to be followed by another surge higher back above 1 29  This followed a couple of days earlier last week where the Euro was able to finally show some resilience and rally higher to regain some lost ground moving back to above 1 29  Over the couple of weeks prior to last week  the Euro fell considerably from near 1 32 down to six week lows near 1 28  Back at the beginning of April the Euro received solid support around 1 28 and this level has been called upon over the last week to provide additional support  A couple of weeks ago the Euro traded ever so slightly below 1 2800 and this level represented the lowest levels it had traded to since early April It has become evident over the last week that the 1 30 level is now providing some resistance and placing pressure on price  Over the last month the 1 32 level has become quite significant and has been an obstacle to the Euro moving higher  evident in the right half of the daily chart below   During this time  it has had some periods of little movement followed by sharp bursts  At the beginning of May the Euro exhibited a classic pin bar reversal candlestick pattern which was indicating the significant selling pressure it experienced at any price above the 1 32 level and likely lower prices to follow  This reinforced the significance of the 1 32 level and how it was going to take considerable effort to move through there  On this pin bar  it moved to near 1 325 and to its highest level in more than two months  since the end of February when it was falling heavily from up near 1 34  Just as quickly  it fell away and moved down to the six week low below 1 28  Prior to that  it was quiet and spent the most part of two weeks ago trading within a narrow range between 1 30 and 1 31  which reinforced how significant this two cent range was Over the last month the Euro has done well to weather the storm through February and March which saw it fall sharply from around 1 37  although its decline over the last few weeks may be reversing this good fortune  Despite its strong rally in the first half of April  it was only a few weeks ago that the Euro dropped to its lowest level since the middle of November around 1 2750  so it did very well of late to move back strongly above 1 30  despite its recent lapse  The Euro has spent the best part of the last month consolidating above the key 1 30 and 1 29 levels after its decline throughout February  Sentiment has completely changed with the Euro and the last couple of months has seen a rollercoaster ride for the Euro as it continued to move strongly towards levels not seen in over 12 months above 1 37 before falling very sharply to below 1 28 and setting a 14 week low a month ago The EUR USD had a roller coaster ride  Last week Fed member comments regarding a near end of the US QE program sapped strength away from the EUR  This week Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke warned against ending the program too soon  as it might hurt more than help  The comments and a surprisingly strong German IFO Business Climate figure drove the EUR USD above the 1 29  May 27 at 00 25 GMT 1 2938 H  1 2944 L  1 2931EUR USD Technical  title  EUR USD Technical  width  599  height  80    During the early hours of the Asian trading session on Monday  the Euro is trading within a narrow range around 1 2940 after starting the week pushing up a little from 1 29  Since the start of February  it has fallen sharply from new highs above 1 37  although it has experienced some strong rallies in that time trying to claw back lost ground  Current range  trading right around 1 2940 Further levels in both directions   Below  1 2800   Above  1 3000  and 1 32000 Shows the ratio of long vs  short positions held for the EUR USD among all OANDA clients  The left percentage  blue  shows long positions  the right percentage  orange  shows short positions  The EUR USD long position ratio has moved lower as the Euro has rallied a little to over 1 29  The trader sentiment shifts to in favour of short positions Economic Releases06 00 DE Retail Sales  27th 31st   Apr 07 30 NL Producer Confi dence  May 07 30 SE Retail sales  Apr 08 00 NO Unemployment  AKU LFS   Mar ,2013-05-27,Stuart McPhee,https://www.investing.com/analysis/eur-usd-trading-between-1.29-and-1.30-168532,168532

133801,355316,MAR,EUR USD Rallies Strongly To Back Above 1 29 Again,opinion,The 1 28 level is certainly providing some much needed support for the Euro as it as over the last couple of weeks helped maintain its price level around the 1 29 level  In the last 24 hours it has surged higher through the 1 29 level again before consolidating in recent hours  It did well to finish last week by moving back up through the 1 29 level after experiencing a wild ride in that time by surging higher to the resistance level at 1 30 before falling sharply back down towards the long term support level at 1 28  only to be followed by another surge higher back above 1 29  This followed a couple of days earlier last week where the Euro was able to finally show some resilience and rally higher to regain some lost ground moving back to above 1 29  Over the couple of weeks prior to last week  the Euro fell considerably from near 1 32 down to six week lows near 1 28  Back at the beginning of April the Euro received solid support around 1 28 and this level has been called upon over the last week to provide additional support  A couple of weeks ago the Euro traded ever so slightly below 1 2800 and this level represented the lowest levels it had traded to since early April It has become evident over the last week or so that the 1 30 level is now providing some resistance and placing pressure on price  Over the last month the 1 32 level has become quite significant and has been an obstacle to the Euro moving higher  evident near the middle of daily chart below   During this time  it has had some periods of little movement followed by sharp bursts  At the beginning of May the Euro exhibited a classic pin bar reversal candlestick pattern which was indicating the significant selling pressure it experienced at any price above the 1 32 level and likely lower prices to follow  This reinforced the significance of the 1 32 level and how it was going to take considerable effort to move through there  On this pin bar  it moved to near 1 325 and to its highest level in more than two months  since the end of February when it was falling heavily from up near 1 34  Just as quickly  it fell away and moved down to the six week low below 1 28  Prior to that  it was quiet and spent the most part of two weeks ago trading within a narrow range between 1 30 and 1 31  which reinforced how significant this two cent range was Over the last month the Euro has done well to weather the storm through February and March which saw it fall sharply from around 1 37  although its decline over the last few weeks may be reversing this good fortune  Despite its strong rally in the first half of April  it was only a few weeks ago that the Euro dropped to its lowest level since the middle of November around 1 2750  so it did very well of late to move back strongly above 1 30  despite its recent lapse  The Euro has spent the best part of the last month consolidating above the key 1 30 and 1 29 levels after its decline throughout February  Sentiment has completely changed with the Euro and the last couple of months has seen a rollercoaster ride for the Euro as it continued to move strongly towards levels not seen in over 12 months above 1 37 before falling very sharply to below 1 28 and setting a 14 week low a month ago The OECD has again cut its growth forecasts for the eurozone and called on the European Central Bank to consider doing more to boost growth  The organisation says the eurozone will shrink by 0 6  this year  widening the gap between it and faster growing economies such as the US and Japan  Meanwhile  the European Commission has given France two more years to complete its austerity programme  France fell back into recession in the first three months of the year  Spain  Poland  Portugal  the Netherlands and Slovenia have also been given more time to complete fiscal tightening  The move suggests a shift away from a focus on austerity in Europe  EUR USD May 29 at 22 30 GMT 1 2942 H  1 2977 L  1 2837During the early hours of the Asian trading session on Thursday  the Euro is trading within a narrow range around 1 2940 after having recently pushed up towards 1 2980 before retracing a little  Since the start of February  it has fallen sharply from new highs above 1 37  although it has experienced some strong rallies in that time

133802,355317,MAR,AUD USD Rallies Back Above The Key Level Of 96 Cents,opinion,The AUD USD has done well in the last 24 hours to rally strongly and move back above what has become a key level at 96 cents  It had spent the best part of the last week not moving a lot and remaining within a range between 0 96 and 0 97  It is still facing an uphill battle trying to rally higher after it finished last week under 97 cents and appears to be placing a lot of selling pressure on the 96 cents level  Last week it enjoyed a relatively solid few days which saw it halt the falls and rally back up towards 0 9850 before a sharp which saw it drop two cents  The week prior it experienced its worst week in a long time which saw it continue to move to new lows near 0 98  from highs not so long ago above 1 0250  although last week it did settle a little and find some support at the long term support level at 97 cents  Although presently appearing unlikely in the short term  should it recover and move back  it is likely the 1 00 level may now provide some resistance to higher prices The AUD USD has now experienced an ordinary last few weeks as it wasn t so long ago it was moving up above 1 03 and threatening the key level at 1 0360  Up until earlier in May  the 1 02 level was one of significance and presented as a long term support level however this has now clearly been broken  It had been showing some bearish as it continued to place selling pressure on the 1 0220 and 1 02 levels and the RBA rate cut a few weeks ago was the catalyst for a strong push lower  seeing it just fall very heavily as if all support gave way  The last month or so have seen the AUD USD establish a strong medium term down trend with lower peaks and lower troughs  as it has moved from near 1 06 down to below 0 96 in that time Over the course of the last month  the Australian dollar has fallen very sharply from near 1 06 to its lows near 0 9500  and in doing so  it also completely ignored any likely support at either 1 04 or 1 0360  In contrast  the week prior  it enjoyed a solid week moving strongly off the key level of 1 0360 towards 1 06 and to its highest levels since January  Up until mid April  the Australian dollar was enjoying its best move higher since October and November last year  Up until a few weeks ago  the AUD USD spent the best part of a month trading between the two key levels of 1 0220 and 1 0360 and it will take some effort to return it to this range  with the resistance being offered at the 1 02 level and now likely at 1 too The Australian dollar is showing some strength against the US currency  which has become an increasingly rare sight lately  The Aussie will want to delete the month of May and move on  as the currency has plunged a staggering seven cents against the US dollar this month  The greenback has taken advantage of the RBA interest rate cut  lukewarm Australian data and the government s budget which pointed to the high value of the Australian dollar as an impediment to economic growth  These factors have resulted in nervous investors shifting their funds to US assets  resulting in the Aussie plunging in value  AUD USD May 30 at 00 30 GMT 0 9627 H  0 9670 L  0 9528During the early hours of the Asian trading session on Thursday  the AUD USD is continuing to trade within a narrow range right around 0 9630  after having recently surged higher from new one year lows near 0 9500  A month ago the AUD USD was spending a fair amount of time trading roughly between 1 02 and 1 0550  however that range seems a distant memory as it has fallen down to near a 12 month low below 0 9600 late last week  In moving through to 1 0580 only a month ago  it moved to its highest level since January  Current range  trading right around 0 9630 Further levels in both directions    Below  0 9600    Above  0 9850 and 1 0000  Shows the ratio of long vs  short positions held for the AUD USD among all OANDA clients  The left percentage  blue  shows long positions  the right percentage  orange  shows short positions  The long position ratio for the AUD USD has eased back under 70  after recent highs of over 75  as the Australian dollar has rallied a little to back above 96 cents  The trader sentiment remains strongly in favour of long positions Economic Releases01 30 AU Building approvals  Apr 01 30 AU Capital Expenditure  Q1 05 45 CH GDP  Q1 09 00 EU Business Climate Index  May 09 00 EU Consumer Sentiment  May 09 00 EU Economic Sentiment  May 09 00 EU Industrial Sentiment  May 12 30 CA Current Account  Q1 12 30 CA Industrial   Raw product price index  Mar 12 30 US Core PCE Price Index  Prelim    Q1 12 30 US GDP Deflator  Prelim    Q1 12 30 US Initial Claims  24 05 2013 12 30 US Pending Home Sales  Apr ,2013-05-30,Stuart McPhee,https://www.investing.com/analysis/aud-usd-rallies-back-above-the-key-level-of-96-cents-168983,168983
133803,355318,MAR,GBP USD Runs Into Resistance At 1 5150  Again,opinion,The GBP USD has done very well to surge higher and move back through the 1 51 level however it has again run into the short term resistance level at 1 5150  It has experienced some difficulty at the 1 5150 level over the last week or so  It did well at the end of last week to reverse and recover a little back above 1 51 after having fallen strongly to a new two month low close to 1 50 in the couple of days prior  In the last 24 hours it has moved to a lower level and therefore a reached a new two month low close to 1 50 before the recovery  For a few days about a week ago it found some support around 1 5160 however this level has been clearly broken  The area around 1 5160 level has been providing some resistance of late as the pound continues to try and rally higher  The pound has now experienced a strong fall over the last few weeks  Prior to the last few weeks  the pound enjoyed a strong couple of weeks and move to new highs above 1 56  It experienced all sorts of bother at 1 56 as it made several pushes to this significant level however it was turned away with excessive supply  For about a week it ran into a wall of resistance right around the 1 56 level  The pound had enjoyed a very solid couple of weeks moving from the support level at 1 52 to reach new highs at 1 56  a new ten week high Back around mid April the pound experienced solid support at 1 52 for about a week which greatly assisted the recent surge higher  and recently this level was called upon again to offer some support and a soft landing  however the pound fell strongly through it on its way down to near 1 50  A couple of weeks ago  we saw some evidence that the decline had been slowed down as it traded around 1 52 for about a week whilst receiving solid support from around 1 5160  The last few weeks has seen the pound fall strongly and return almost all of its gains from the few weeks before that  About a month ago the 1 54 level provided a little piece of resistance and this level has since been broken as it offered limited support  Now that the pound has drifted back down below 1 54  it may provide some resistance again although presently it has some other levels to deal with beforehand Over the last month or so  the GBP USD has been experiencing a variety of different levels which have played a role on the price action  Towards the end of March the GBP USD was trading within a range roughly between 1 51 and 1 5250 and now on a couple of occasions it has been able to move outside that range and push higher  A few weeks ago  the 1 5350 level was one of significance as it offered resistance before the GBP USD was able to move higher through to 1 56  In early March the pound moved to new lows around 1 4830 from a starting point near 1 64 at the beginning of the year  With the surge higher over the last couple of months  the GBP USD had completely turned around its fortunes from earlier in the year  however it is starting to ease off and return most of the good work The GBP USD lost around one cent on Monday  but has rebounded sharply and recovered these losses  However  the pound remains under pressure and has been no match for the surging US dollar  losing about four cents in the month of May  The British economy continues to stumble  and on Tuesday there was more bad news  as CBI Realized Sales plunged from  1 point to  11 points  The sharp drop surprised the markets  which had anticipated a gain of 4 points  The dismal reading points to weak sales  as the British

133804,355319,MAR,EUR USD Surges Through 1 30 And Settles,opinion,The Euro has done exceptionally well over the last couple of days used the solid support at 1 28 and surged higher not only through 1 29 but also the significant level of 1 30  before consolidating in recent hours  It did well to finish last week by moving back up through the 1 29 level after experiencing a wild ride in that time by surging higher to the resistance level at 1 30 before falling sharply back down towards the long term support level at 1 28  only to be followed by another surge higher back above 1 29  This followed a couple of days earlier last week where the Euro was able to finally show some resilience and rally higher to regain some lost ground moving back to above 1 29  Over the couple of weeks prior to last week  the Euro fell considerably from near 1 32 down to six week lows near 1 28  Back at the beginning of April the Euro received solid support around 1 28 and this level has been called upon over the last couple of weeks to provide additional support  A couple of weeks ago the Euro traded ever so slightly below 1 2800 and this level represented the lowest levels it had traded to since early April  It is significant that it has moved so strongly through 1 30 as evidence was mounting that the 1 30 level was providing resistance and placing downward pressure on price  Over the last month the 1 32 level has become quite significant and has been an obstacle to the Euro moving higher  evident near the middle of daily chart below   During this time  it has had some periods of little movement followed by sharp bursts  At the beginning of May the Euro exhibited a classic pin bar reversal candlestick pattern which was indicating the significant selling pressure it experienced at any price above the 1 32 level and likely lower prices to follow  This reinforced the significance of the 1 32 level and how it was going to take considerable effort to move through there  On this pin bar  it moved to near 1 325 and to its highest level in more than two months  since the end of February when it was falling heavily from up near 1 34  Just as quickly  it fell away and moved down to the six week low below 1 28  Prior to that  it was quiet and spent the most part of two weeks ago trading within a narrow range between 1 30 and 1 31  which reinforced how significant this two cent range was  Over the last month the Euro has done well to weather the storm through February and March which saw it fall sharply from around 1 37  although its decline over the last few weeks may be reversing this good fortune  Despite its strong rally in the first half of April  it was only a few weeks ago that the Euro dropped to its lowest level since the middle of November around 1 2750  so it did very well of late to move back strongly above 1 30  despite its recent lapse  The Euro has spent the best part of the last month consolidating above the key 1 30 and 1 29 levels after its decline throughout February  Sentiment has completely changed with the Euro and the last couple of months has seen a rollercoaster ride for the Euro as it continued to move strongly towards levels not seen in over 12 months above 1 37 before falling very sharply to below 1 28 and setting a 14 week low a month ago  In Germany  we continue to see  this week  German employment numbers were a big disappointment  as Unemployment Change rose to 21 thousand  well above the estimate of 4 thousand  This was the highest reading since June 2008  There was better news from Preliminary CPI  which rebounded from a decline and posted a 0 4  gain  beating the forecast of 0 2   Which direction is the German economy headed  The Eurozone will find it more than difficult to recover without Germany

133836,355351,MAR,GBP USD Bounces Off Support At 1 52,opinion,Over the last 24 hours the GBP USD has fallen lower again down below 1 52 and to levels not seen since early April  It appears to be consolidating a little around the support level at 1 52  which has temporarily halted the slide of the last week  The pound has now experienced a strong fall over the last week or so  Prior to the last week  the pound has enjoyed a strong couple of weeks and move to new highs above 1 56  It experienced all sorts of bother at 1 56 as it made several pushes to this significant level however it was turned away with excessive supply  For about a week it ran into a wall of resistance right around the 1 56 level which is very evident in the 4 hourly chart below  This showed how much buying

133837,355352,MAR,EUR USD Finds Some Support at 1 2850,opinion,In the short term the euro has found some much needed support right around 1 2850 which has held it up recently and just for the moment  stopped the strong falls it is presently experiencing  It has ever so slightly traded below 1 2850 and these levels represent the lowest levels it has traded to since early April  It has also become evident over the last few days  especially on the 4 hourly chart below  that the 1 30 level is now providing some resistance and placing pressure on price  The Euro finished last week moving back down through the long term key level of 1 30  It did spend the last couple of weeks trading right around the 1 31 level and finding support and resistance at 1 30 and 1 32 respectively  however the former level has now been broken  In finishing last week below 1 30  it moved to levels not seen in over a month  Over the last month the 1 32 level has become quite significant and has been an obstacle to

reinforced the significance of the 1 32 level and how it was going to take considerable effort to move through there  On this pin bar  it moved to near 1 325 and to its highest level in more than two

spent the most part of two weeks ago trading within a narrow range between 1 30 and 1 31  which reinforced how significant this two cent range was  In the middle of April the Euro surged up towards 1

a 14 week low a month ago This week  fell by 0 2  while Italian GDP declined 0 5   German GDP managed a weak gain of 0 1   but this missed the estimate of 0 3   These weak numbers point to contraction in the major economies of the Eurozone  which continue to struggle  There was better news on Thursday  as Eurozone inflation numbers were positive  CPI posted a 1 2  gain  and Core CPI rose 1 0   Both readings matched their estimates  There has been a lot of volatility from EUR USD recently  and one of the reasons has been statements from the ECB regarding negative deposit rates  Essentially  this means that depositors would be charged a fee for cash deposits held in European banks  ECB head Mario Draghi broached the idea earlier this month  and the euro dropped almost immediately  The reason  Negative deposit rates would lead to the flow of funds out of the Eurozone  as deposit holders seek better returns on their money  Earlier in the week  ECB member Ignazio Visco said that the ECB was open to the idea of negative deposits  Proponents of the idea argue that it would increase lending to businesses and help boost economic activity in the sluggish Eurozone  The ECB would be the first major central bank to adopt negative deposit rates  and if the ECB does take steps to adopt this measure  we can expect the euro to react  EUR USD May 17 at 00 10 GMT 1 2885 H  1 2929 L  1 2846EUR USD

133838,355353,MAR,AUD USD Finds Some Support At 0 98,opinion,The AUD USD is presently consolidating a little around 0 9820 after having recently bounced off the short term support level at 98 cents  It has experienced its worst week in a long time which has seen it continue to move to new lows just below 0 98  from highs not so long ago above 1 0250  although in the last 24 hours it has settled a little and found the support at 98 cents  It has slowed its decline a little however it has in the last 24 hours moved to a new 11 month low below 0 9800  It is likely the 1 00 level may now provide some resistance to higher prices as the AUD USD tried to claw back some lost ground  At the end of last week  it experienced its largest 24 hour drop in a long time falling strongly down through 1 02 and 1 01 and this week has seen this form continue falling sharply back down below parity It had an ordinary week last week as it wasn t so long ago it was moving up above 1 03  Up until recently  the 1 02 level was one of significance and presented as a long term support level however this has now clearly been broken  It had been showing some bearish signs over the last few weeks as it continued to place selling pressure on the 1 0220 and 1 02 levels and the RBA rate cut earlier last week was the catalyst for a strong push lower  seeing it just fall very heavily as if all support gave way  The last couple of weeks have seen the AUD USD establish a strong medium term down trend with lower peaks and lower troughs  as it has moved from near 1 04 down to below 1 in that time  In the previous few weeks  the AUD USD spent most of its time trading between 1 02 and 1 0360  During that time  it moved up to a two week high and back towards 1 04 however it has quickly handed back all of those gains and then some  A couple of times in that same period it received solid support around 1 0220  just above the key long term level at 1 02 Over the course of the last month  the Australian dollar has fallen very sharply from near 1 06 to its lows just below 0 9800  and in doing so  it also completely ignored any likely support at either 1 04 or 1 0360  In contrast  the week prior  it enjoyed a solid week moving strongly off the key level of 1 0360 towards 1 06 and to its highest levels since January  Up until mid April  the Australian dollar was enjoying its best move higher since October and November last year  Up until earlier this week  the AUD USD spent the best part of a month trading between the two key levels of 1 0220 and 1 0360 and it will take some effort to return it to this range  with the resistance being offered at the 1 02 level and now likely at 1 too The Aussie has had a miserable May  shedding over five cents since the start of the month  Australian New Motor Vehicle Sales looked weak  posting another decline  The slumping Australian dollar got no help from a bleak Australian budget  which was released earlier this week  The government  which faces elections later this year  shied away from unpopular spending cuts but also was forced to revise an earlier forecast of a surplus  In October  the government stated that it would post a modest surplus of A 2 2 billion for 2013 2014  but was forced to revise this to a record deficit of A 19 4 billion  The government blamed the high Australian dollar and weak commodity prices for a dramatic loss in

is likely the 1 00 level may now provide some resistance to higher prices as the AUD USD tried to claw back some lost ground  At the end of the week a couple of weeks ago  it experienced its largest

However  this has now clearly been broken  The pair had been showing some bearish signs over the last few weeks as it continued to place selling pressure on the 1 0220 and 1 02 levels  The RBA rate cut a couple of weeks ago was the catalyst for a strong push lower  seeing it just fall very heavily as if all support gave way  The past few weeks have seen the AUD USD establish a strong medium term down trend with lower peaks and lower troughs  as it has moved from near 1 04 down to below 1 during that time  In the previous few weeks  the AUD USD spent most of its time trading between 1 02 and 1

1 06 and to its highest levels since January  Up until mid April  the Australian dollar was enjoying its best move higher since October and November last year  Up until earlier this week  the AUD USD spent the best part of a month trading between the two key levels of 1 0220 and 1 0360 and it will take some effort to return it to this range  with the resistance being offered at the 1 02 level and

133841,355356,MAR,EUR USD Relying On Long Term Support Level At 1 28,opinion,The last week saw the Euro fall considerably from above 1 30 down to six week lows near 1 28  Back at the beginning of April the Euro received solid support around 1 28 and this level is being called upon right now to provide additional support  It has ever so slightly traded below 1 2800 and these levels represent the lowest levels it has traded to since early April  It has also become evident over the last few days  especially on the 4 hourly chart below  that the 1 30 and 1 29 levels are now providing some resistance and placing pressure on price  The Euro finished last week moving back down through the long term key level of 1 30  It did spend the last couple of weeks trading right around the 1 31 level and finding support and resistance at 1 30 and 1 32 respectively  however the former level has now been broken  In finishing the week a couple of weeks ago below 1 30  it moved to levels not seen in over a month Over the last month the 1 32 level has become quite significant and has been an obstacle to the Euro moving higher  evident in the right half of the daily chart below   During this time  it has had some periods of little movement followed by sharp bursts  A few weeks ago  the Euro exhibited a classic pin bar reversal candlestick pattern which was indicating the significant selling pressure it experienced at any price above the 1 32 level and likely lower prices to follow  This reinforced the significance of the 1 32 level and how it was going to take considerable effort to move through there  On this pin bar  it moved to near 1 325 and to its highest level in more than two months  since the end of February when it was falling heavily from up near 1 34  Just as quickly  it has fallen away and now moved down to the six week low below 1 28  Prior to that  it was quiet and spent the most part of two weeks ago trading within a narrow range between 1 30 and 1 31  which reinforced how significant this two cent range was  In the middle of April the Euro surged up towards 1 32 and ran into a wall of resistance at that level  to then be followed by a sharp fall back towards the then support level at 1 30 Over the last month the Euro has done well to weather the storm through February and March which saw it fall sharply from around 1 37  although its decline over the last couple of weeks may be reversing this good fortune  Despite its strong rally in the first half of April  it was only a few weeks ago that the Euro dropped to its lowest level since the middle of November around 1 2750  so it did very well of late to move back strongly above 1 30  despite its recent lapse  The Euro has spent the best part of the last month consolidating above the key 1 30 and 1 29 levels after its decline throughout February  Over the last couple of weeks  the 1 30 level has been called upon again to prop up price  although it may have reversed roles now as it is providing some resistance to movement higher  Sentiment has completely changed with the Euro and the last couple of months has seen a rollercoaster ride for the Euro as it continued to move strongly towards levels not seen in over 12 months above 1 37 before falling very sharply to below 1 28 and setting a 14 week low a month ago There has been a lot of volatility from EUR USD recently  and one of the reasons has been statements from the ECB regarding negative deposit rates  Essentially  this means that depositors would be charged a fee for cash deposits held in European banks  ECB head Mario Draghi broached the idea earlier this month  and the euro dropped almost immediately  The reason  Negative deposit rates would lead to the flow of funds out of the Eurozone  as deposit holders seek better returns on their money  Earlier in the week  ECB member Ignazio Visco said that the ECB was open to the idea of negative deposits  Proponents of the idea argue that it would increase lending to businesses and help boost economic activity in the sluggish Eurozone  The ECB would be the first major central bank to adopt negative deposit rates  and if the ECB does take steps to adopt this measure  we can expect the euro to  May 20 at 02 15 GMT 1 2824 H  1 2848 L  1 2819EUR USD Technical  title  EUR USD Technical  width  599  height  81    During the early hours of the Asian

133843,355358,MAR,GBP USD  Reverses To New Six Week Low  Near 1 51,opinion,Over the last 24 hours the GBP USD has reversed again and fallen down further to a new six week low close to 1 51  after enjoying a reasonable rally for a couple of days  It has continued to find some support around 1 5160 and this is close to where it presently sits as it consolidates and trades within a very narrow range  This has resulted in seeing the pound at levels not seen since early April  The pound has now experienced a strong fall over the last couple of weeks  Prior to the last couple of weeks  the pound enjoyed a strong couple of weeks and move to new highs above 1 56  It experienced all sorts of bother at 1 56 as it made several pushes to this significant level however it was turned away with excessive supply  For about a week it ran into a wall of resistance right around the 1 56 level which is very evident in the left hand part of the 4 hourly chart below  This showed how much buying pressure there was on the 1 56 level but equally how well that level provided resistance to any movement higher  The pound had enjoyed a very solid couple of weeks moving from the support level at 1 52 to reach new highs at 1 56  a new ten week high   Back around mid April the pound experienced solid support at 1 52 for about a week which greatly assisted the recent surge higher  and now this level is being called upon again to offer some support and a soft landing  although the pound has drifted a little lower than 1 52 now  Towards the end of last week  we saw some evidence of that as the decline had been slowed down halted  although it has fallen slightly lower since  The last couple of weeks has seen the pound fall strongly and return almost all of its gains from the few weeks before that  About a month ago the 1 54 level provided a little piece of resistance and this level has since been broken as it offered limited support  Now that the pound has drifted back down below 1 54  it may provide some resistance again  During its push to 1 56  the pound was able to find some support at 1 55  although this level was also broken a couple of weeks ago   Over the last month or so  the GBP USD has been experiencing a variety of different levels which have played a role on the price action  Towards the end of March the GBP USD was trading within a range roughly between 1 51 and 1 5250 and now on a couple of occasions it has been able to move outside that range and push higher  A few weeks ago  the 1 5350 level was one of significance as it offered resistance before the GBP USD was able to move higher through to 1 56  In early March the pound moved to new lows around 1 4830 from a starting point near 1 64 at the beginning of the year  With the surge higher over the last couple of months  the GBP USD had completely turned around its fortunes from earlier in the year  however it is starting to ease off and return most of the good work   The catalyst behind the pound s recent sharp drop was weak inflation numbers out of the UK  as a host of indicators missed their estimates  Although the UK has posted solid numbers for some key releases this month  including Manufacturing Production and Claimant Count Change  the markets  aren t buying  and continue to give a thumbs down to the prospects of the British economy  If market sentiment continues to be negative  we could soon see the pound test the all important 1 50 level  Tuesday s inflation numbers out of the UK were weak across the board  indicating that deflation continues to hobble the struggling

showing some bearish signs over the last few weeks as it continued to place selling pressure on the 1 0220 and 1 02 levels and the RBA rate cut a couple of weeks ago was the catalyst for a strong push lower  seeing it just fall very heavily as if all support gave way  The past few weeks have seen the AUD USD establish a strong medium term down trend with lower peaks and lower troughs  as it has moved from near 1 04 down to below 1 in that time  In the previous few weeks  the AUD USD spent most of its time trading between 1 02 and 1 0360  During that time  it moved up to a two week high and back towards 1 04 however it has quickly handed back all of those gains and then some  A couple of times in that same period it received solid support around 1 0220  just above the key long term level at 1 02  Over the course of the last month  the Australian dollar has fallen very sharply from near 1 06 to its lows near 0 9600  and in doing so  it also completely ignored any likely support at either 1 04 or 1 0360  In contrast  the week prior  it enjoyed a solid week moving strongly off the key level of 1 0360 towards 1 06 and to its highest levels since January  Up until mid April  the Australian dollar was enjoying its best move higher since October and November last year  Up until a couple of weeks ago  the AUD USD spent the best part of a month trading between the two key levels of 1 0220 and 1 0360 and it will take some effort to return it to this range  with the resistance being offered at the 1 02 level and now likely at 1 too  AUD USD continues on its downward journey  as Australia released  on Wednesday  Westpac Consumer Sentiment plunged 7 0   its second straight sharp drop  This indicates weak consumer confidence in the Australian economy  and a pessimistic consumer can be expected to scale back on purchases  which is bad news for the Australian economy  On Tuesday  the RBA released the minutes of its most recent policy meeting  At that time  the RBA surprised the markets with a rate cut from 3 0  to 2 75   and the Aussie has been on a sharp downhill ride ever since  The RBA minutes stated that the RBA reduced rates in response to low inflation and a strong Australian dollar  which were hindering economic growth  The central bank also predicted improvement in the economies of Australia s major trading partners   China  Japan and the US  This is expected to boost Australian exports and help the struggling economy  Meanwhile  the Aussie s free fall in recent weeks make another rate cut in the near future less  May 23 at 04 05 GMT 0 9641 H  0 9825 L  0

133845,355360,MAR,EUR USD Drops Sharply Towards Key Level At 1 28,opinion,The last 24 hours has seen the Euro experience a wild ride surging higher to the resistance level at 1 30 before falling sharply back down towards the long term support level at 1 28  This followed a couple of days where the Euro was able to finally show some resilience and rally higher to regain some lost ground moving back to above 1 29  Over the last week or so it has fallen considerably from above 1 30 down to six week lows near 1 28  Back at the beginning of April the Euro received solid support around 1 28 and this level has been called upon over the last week  especially in the last few hours to provide additional support  Late last week it has ever so slightly traded below 1 2800 and these levels represent the lowest levels it has traded to since early April  It has also become evident over the last few days  especially on the 4 hourly chart below  that the 1 30 and 1 29 levels are now providing some resistance and placing pressure on price  although the 1 29 level has been cleared in the last 48 hours   Over the last month the 1 32 level has become quite significant and has been an obstacle to the Euro moving higher  evident in the right half of the daily chart below   During this time  it has had some periods of little movement followed by sharp bursts  A few weeks ago  the Euro exhibited a classic pin bar reversal candlestick pattern which was indicating the significant selling pressure it experienced at any price above the 1 32 level and likely lower prices to follow  This reinforced the significance of the 1 32 level and how it was going to take considerable effort to move through there  On this pin bar  it moved to near 1 325 and to its highest level in more than two months  since the end of February when it was falling heavily from up near 1 34  Just as quickly  it has fallen away and now moved down to the six week low below 1 28  Prior to that  it was quiet and spent the most part of two weeks ago trading within a narrow range between 1 30 and 1 31  which reinforced how significant this two cent range was  In the middle of April the Euro surged up towards 1 32 and ran into a wall of resistance at that level  to then be followed by a sharp fall back towards the then support level at 1 30   Over the last month the Euro has done well to weather the storm through February and March which saw it fall sharply from around 1 37  although its decline over the last few weeks may be reversing this good fortune  Despite its strong rally in the first half of April  it was only a few weeks ago that the Euro dropped to its lowest level since the middle of November around 1 2750  so it did very well of late to move back strongly above 1 30  despite its recent lapse  The Euro has spent the best part of the last month consolidating above the key 1 30 and 1 29 levels after its decline throughout February  Over the last couple of weeks  the 1 30 level has been called upon again to prop up price  although it may have reversed roles now as it is providing some resistance to movement higher  Sentiment has completely changed with the Euro and the last couple of months has seen a rollercoaster ride for the Euro as it continued to move strongly towards levels not seen in over 12 months above 1 37 before falling very sharply to below 1 28 and setting a 14 week low a month ago   Germany  the largest economy in the Eurozone and the  locomotive of Europe   has raised concerns as German economic releases have looked sluggish  Last week  ZEW Economic Sentiment  one of the most important German releases  came in well below the estimate  German CPI and WPI posted declines  indicating weak activity in the economy  GDP posted a slight gain of 0 1   but this was below the 0 3  forecast  This week hasn t started any better  as the important PPI indicator declined for the third straight reading  The index fell 0 2   a sharper drop than the forecast of  0 1   If the Eurozone is to have any hope of getting back on solid economic footing  it will need Germany to lead the way and post some positive numbers  We ll see a string of German releases later in the week  highlighted by PMIs and the German Ifo Business  May 23 at 02 15 GMT 1 2827 H  1 2998 L  1 2824During the early hours of the Asian trading session on Thursday  the Euro is continuing to ease a little lower down towards 1 28 after surging higher towards 1 30 within the last 12 hours  Since the start of February  it has fallen sharply from new highs above 1 37  although it has experienced some strong rallies in that time trying to claw back lost ground  Current range  trading right around 1 2830 Further levels in both directions   Below  1 2800   Above  1 2940  1

133880,355395,MAR,GBP USD  Claws Back To Above 1 53,opinion,The GBP USD continues its slide from the last week  touching below 1 53 before rallying recently to move back above 1 53  Prior to the last week  the pound has enjoyed a strong couple of weeks and move to new highs above 1 56  It experienced all sorts of bother at 1 56 as it made several pushes to this significant level however it was turned away with excessive supply  For about a week it ran into a wall of resistance right around the 1 56 level which is very evident in the 4 hourly chart below  This showed how much buying pressure there was on the 1 56 level but equally how well that level provided resistance to any movement higher  The pound had enjoyed a very solid couple of weeks moving from the support level at 1 52 to reach new highs at 1 56  a new ten week high It was only a few weeks ago  it found solid support at 1 52 for about a week which greatly assisted the recent surge higher  It had previously run into a wall of supply at 1 53 which had created resistance however it well and truly pushed through this level strongly followed by moving strongly through 1 54 within the following day  The last week however has seen the pound fall strongly and return most of its gains from the last few weeks  About a month ago the 1 54 level provided a little piece of resistance and this level has since been broken as it offered limited support  Now that the pound has drifted back down below 1 54  it may provide some resistance again  During its push to 1 56  the pound was able to find some support at 1 55  although this level has been broken last week  Over the last month or so  the GBP USD has been experiencing a variety of different levels which have played a role on the price action Towards the end of March the GBP USD was trading within a range roughly between 1 51 and 1 5250 and now on a couple of occasions it has been able to move outside that range and push higher  A few weeks ago  the 1 5350 level was one of significance as it offered resistance before the GBP USD was able to move higher through to 1 56  In early March the pound moved to new lows around 1 4830 from a starting point near 1 64 at the beginning of the year  With the surge higher over the last couple of months  the GBP USD has completely turned around its fortunes from earlier in the year  After the doom and gloom of the first couple of months of the year  the recent movement higher has seen the pound stop the rot and regain almost half of the year s losses In the US  retail sales numbers were not very exciting  Core Retail Sales posted a second straight decline  as it fell by 0 1   matching the forecast  Retail Sales fared slightly better  jumping from  0 4  to 0 1   This beat the estimate of  0 3   After a bad streak in April  we are seeing better numbers out of the US  notably employment figures  This has raised speculation that the Fed might adjust or even terminate its QE program  in which it buys  85 billion in assets every month  Terminating the QE program is dollar positive  and the US dollar was broadly stronger against all the major currencies on Friday  The markets will be looking for any clues as to the Fed ending QE  which would likely push the dollar  May 14 at 01 50 GMT 1 5325 H  1 5384 L  1 5277During the early hours of the Asian trading session on Tuesday  the GBP USD is rallying a little higher moving back up above 1 53  after having recently fallen strongly down through 1 54 and to a two week low below 1 53 at the end of last week  Throughout the first part of this year  the Cable fell very strongly from the key resistance level at 1 63 level down to levels not seen in two and a half years and has done well the last month to rally well and move back up above 1 56  Current range  Right around 1 5350 Further levels in both directions   Below  1 5300  1 5200 and 1 5100   Above  1 5600  Shows the ratio of long vs  short positions held for the GBP USD among all OANDA clients  The left percentage  blue  shows long positions  the right percentage  orange  shows short positions  The GBP USD long positions ratio has moved back up above 50  after the GBP USD has fallen down to the two week low near 1 53  Trader sentiment has shifted to in favour of long positions Economic Releases09 00 EU Industrial production  Mar 09 00 EU ZEW  Economic Sentiment   May 09 30 AU Treasurer Swan announces Federal Budget for 2013 14 Financial Year12 30 US Import Price Index  Apr ,2013-05-14,Stuart McPhee,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gbp-usd:-claws-back-to-above-1.53-166781,166781
133881,355396,MAR,EUR USD Moves To One Month Low Below 1 29,opinion,The euro is presently consolidating in a narrow trading range right around 1 2880 after having recently moved down towards 1 2850 and then rallied higher  The lows below 1 2850 are the lowest levels it has traded to since early April  It has also become evident over the last few days  especially on the 4 hourly chart below  that the 1 30 level is now providing some resistance and placing pressure on price  The euro finished last week moving back down through the long term key level of 1 30  It did spend the last couple of weeks trading right around the 1 31 level and finding support and resistance at 1 30 and 1 32 respectively  however the former level has now been broken  In finishing last week below 1 30  it moved to levels not seen in over a month  Over the last month the 1 32 level has become quite significant and has been an obstacle to the euro moving higher  evident in the right half of the daily chart below   During this time  it has had some periods of little movement followed by sharp bursts A couple of weeks ago  the euro exhibited a classic pin bar reversal candlestick pattern which was indicating the significant selling pressure it experienced at any price above the 1 32 level and likely lower prices to follow  This reinforced the significance of the 1 32 level and how it was going to take considerable effort to move through there  On this pin bar  it moved to near 1 325 and to its highest level in more than two months  since the end of February when it was falling heavily from up near 1 34  Just as quickly  it has fallen away and now moved down to the one month low below 1 30  Previously  it was quiet and spent the bulk of the prior two weeks trading within a narrow range between 1 30 and 1 31  which reinforced how significant this two cent range was  In the middle of April the euro surged up towards 1 32 and ran into a wall of resistance at that level  to then be followed by a sharp fall back towards the then support level at 1 30 Over the last month the euro has done well to weather the storm through February and March which saw it fall sharply from around 1 37  although its decline over the last few days may be reversing this good fortune  Despite its strong rally in the first half of April  it was only a few weeks ago that the euro dropped to its lowest level since the middle of November around 1 2750  so it did very well of late to move back strongly above 1 30  despite its recent lapse  The euro has spent the best part of the last month consolidating above the key 1 30 and 1 29 levels after its decline throughout February  Over the last couple of weeks  the 1 30 level has been called upon again to prop up price  although it may have reversed roles now as it is providing some resistance to movement higher  Sentiment has completely changed with the euro and the last couple of months has seen a rollercoaster ride for the euro as it continued to move strongly towards levels not seen in over 12 months above 1 37 before falling very sharply to below 1 28 and setting a 14 week low a month ago The eurozone has slumped into its  ever  after economic

133882,355397,MAR,AUD USD Settles Around 0 99,opinion,The AUD USD has experienced its worst week in a long time which has seen it continue to move to new lows below 0 99  from highs above 1 0250  although in the last 24 hours it has settled a little and consolidated right around the 99 cents level  It has slowed its decline a little however it has in the last 24 hours moved to a new 11 month low below 0 9850  It is likely the 1 00 level may now provide some resistance to higher prices as the AUD USD tried to claw back some lost ground  At the end of last week  it experienced its largest 24 hour drop in a long time falling strongly down through 1 02 and 1 01 and this week has seen this form continue falling sharply back down below parity  It had an ordinary week last week as it wasn t so long ago it was moving up above 1 03  Up until recently  the 1 02 level was one of significance and presented as a long term support level however this has now clearly been broken It had been showing some bearish signs over the last few weeks as it continued to place selling pressure on the 1 0220 and 1 02 levels and the RBA rate cut earlier last week was the catalyst for a strong push lower  The last couple of weeks have seen the AUD USD establish a strong medium term down trend with lower peaks and lower troughs  as it has moved from near 1 04 down to below 1 in that time  In the previous few weeks  the AUD USD spent most of its time trading between 1 02 and 1 0360  During that time  it moved up to a two week high and back towards 1 04 however it has quickly handed back all of those gains and then some  A couple of times in that same period it received solid support around 1 0220  just above the key long term level at 1 02  All of this just gave way last week as the AUD USD was heavily sold down  and now the 1 02 level is poised to provide resistance and thwart attempts to push higher  although it seems some distance away presently Over the course of the last month  the Australian dollar has fallen very sharply from near 1 06 to its lows around 0 9850  and in doing so  it also completely ignored any likely support at either 1 04 or 1 0360  In contrast  the week prior  it enjoyed a solid week moving strongly off the key level of 1 0360 towards 1 06 and to its highest levels since January  Up until mid April  the Australian dollar was enjoying its best move higher since October and November last year  Up until earlier this week  the AUD USD spent the best part of a month trading between the two key levels of 1 0220 and 1 0360 and it will take some effort to return it to this range  with the resistance being offered at the 1 02 level  A couple of months ago  it did well to push back up off the support level at 1 02 and start the move that it was enjoying
