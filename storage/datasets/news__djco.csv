1772,223287,DJCO,Inflation Surprises As CPI PPI Run Hot  Interest Rates Rise  Yet Market Bounces ,opinion,"If you recall  the investor class was worried about a whole bunch of things  especially inflation and the dreaded rising 10 year bond yield  On both those fronts  economic data didn t necessarily cooperate as the CPI and PPI came in hotter than expected  Bond yields shot up a touch  and stocks sold off to start trading sessions early in the week  Low and behold  after the initial drop  equities firmed up and finished the week with a nice bounce  In fact  stocks remain a touch lower than their all time highs  What gives  Well  earnings reports from heavyweights like Cisco Systems Inc  NASDAQ CSCO   PepsiCo Inc  NASDAQ PEP   Under Armour Inc C  NYSE UA   and Coca Cola Company NYSE KO   NYSE KO  were strong  and increased dividends and buybacks are balm to soothe frayed nerves  Supplementing the succor of strong financials was the drying up of forced selling from misplaced bets on volatility and gosh knows what else  Applying Mrs  Stowe s wise words to any endeavor is probably good advice  but especially so with financial assets  Sentiment changes not only daily  but these days  hourly  minute  or even second  The pesky algo s can be triggered by any metric imaginable  As a result  thousand point drops over a ten minute time frame are not impossible  but increasingly  should be anticipated  However  if one focuses on the quality of your holdings  the operational performance  and extending your time horizon  accepting these fluctuations and trying to selectively benefit from them seems like a reasonable course of action  As Scarlett O  Hara famously once said   Tomorrow is another day  
Elsewhere  a small company called the Daily Journal  NASDAQ DJCO  held it s annual meeting this week  and investors pay particular attention to it each year because of one man  that being Charlie Munger  Groupies  as Mr  Munger calls them  from all over the world come to hear Munger opine on all kinds of subjects  One of them was the topic of Wells Fargo  NYSE WFC   Buffett s partner believes the regulators should leave Wells alone as they have been through the ringer  Respectfully  I would disagree  Wells  rhymes with smells for a reason  has over ten percent of all U S  banking deposits and deserves ongoing scrutiny for its operational shortcomings  No reason to let them off the hook any time soon  Other than that  Munger is always worth a watch  and you might take a look

1779,223294,DJCO,Charlie Munger urges regulators to ease off Wells Fargo  blasts bitcoin,news,"By Jonathan Stempel and Jennifer Ablan  Reuters    Charlie Munger  the longtime business partner of fellow billionaire Warren Buffett  said on Wednesday it is time for regulators to  let up  on  Wells Fargo    Co  N WFC   which will end up  better off  as it corrects a series of mistakes in how it treated banking customers  Munger spoke at the annual meeting of  Daily Journal Corp   O DJCO   the Los Angeles based newspaper publisher he chairs  where he also denigrated bitcoin  BTC BTSP  as  noxious poison  and urged reforms in the healthcare system  He spoke less than two weeks after the Federal Reserve took the unprecedented step of curbing the San Francisco based bank s asset growth until it fixes its shortcomings  Daily Journal typically draws little attention from investors  but CNBC broadcast the meeting on its website  That is because the company s star attraction is Munger  94  who has for four decades also been vice chairman at Buffett s  Berkshire Hathaway Inc   N BRKa   which is Wells Fargo s largest shareholder   Of course  Wells Fargo had incentive systems that were too strong in the wrong direction  and of course they were too slow in reacting properly to bad news   but  practically everyone  makes those kinds of mistakes  Munger said   Wells Fargo will end up better off for having made those mistakes   he added   I think it s time for regulators to let up on Wells Fargo  They ve learned   The San Francisco based bank has been beset by scandals for deceiving customers  such as by opening unauthorized accounts and forcing them to take out auto insurance they did not need  Wells Fargo shares gained 2 7 percent to  59 55 on Wednesday  Though Wells Fargo may be learning its lessons  Munger said the banking industry remains a  dangerous  place to invest because of the temptation for chief executives to take unwise long term risks to boost short term results  Buffett has credited Munger with broadening his investment horizon  and to seek out great companies at fair prices rather than emphasizing fair companies that can be bought cheaply  BITCOIN IS  TOTALLY ASININE  For Munger  that leaves no room for bitcoin  saying the recent  craze  in the cryptocurrency is  totally asinine  and a means for people to make a quick buck  He urged the government to help wring out its excesses   Bitcoin is noxious poison   Munger said   The more popular it got the more I hated it   Munger also endorsed the plan announced by Berkshire  Amazon com Inc  O AMZN  and JPMorgan Chase   Co  N JPM  to set up a healthcare company for their employees to combat spiraling costs that Buffett has called a  tapeworm  on the economy  The current system  runs out of control on the cost side   causing behavior that is  regrettable  and  evil   Munger said   It s not right to bleed so much money out of our dying people   Munger said   I m all for somebody trying to figure it out   Munger also expressed concern about rising U S  government debt levels  calling it  new territory for us   though he expressed no alarm about the current economy  He said higher inflation may follow  and that long term U S  Treasuries  whose prices can fall quickly as yields rise  remain a losing bet over the long haul  Munger fielded questions for two hours  He and Buffett  87  are expected to field shareholder questions for an even longer period  five hours  at Berkshire s annual meeting on May 5  Given their ages  that meeting is likely to be among their last  and Berkshire is preparing for their succession  Last month  it promoted executives Greg Abel and Ajit Jain to vice chairmen  overseeing non insurance and insurance businesses  respectively  They are widely considered the frontrunners to succeed Buffett as chief executive officer

1782,223297,DJCO,Wells Fargo Gains Amid Government Backlash  Berkshire Backing ,opinion,"Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC   stock surged over 2 60  on Wednesday  despite reports that Sen  Elizabeth Warren sent a critical letter to CEO Tim Sloan  questioning the embattled banking giant s recent customer refund initiatives 
Sen  Warren called out Sloan and Wells Fargo just days after the Wall Street Journal  that the company s latest wave of consumer refunds were marred by missteps  An array of mistakes large and small were reportedly made during the company s effort to repay customers hurt by improper fees on car loans and home mortgages 
Wells Fargo  last August that the company charged nearly 600 000 customers for auto insurance they didn t need and improperly charged 110 000 customers fees related to their mortgage rates  This comes on top of Wells Fargo s massive fake account scandal that forced the bank s previous CEO to step down in the fall of 2016 
In her Feb  13 letter  Sen  Warren  nearly a dozen questions and accused Wells Fargo s current CEO of breaking his promise to customers  However  the bank also received some praise from one of its biggest investors in the wake of Sen  Warren s letter 
Berkshire Backing 
Berkshire Hathaway s    vice chairman  Charlie Munger  supported Wells Fargo on Wednesday while he spoke at the Daily Journal Corporation s   NASDAQ DJCO   annual meeting in Los Angeles 
 Of course  Wells Fargo had incentive systems that were too strong in the wrong direction      Of course  they were too slow in reacting to the bad news when it came  Everyone makes those mistakes  but we make fewer than others  
Munger went on to say that it s  time for the regulators to let up on Wells Fargo  and that long term the bank and its customers will likely be better off  It seems clear that the Berkshire executive thinks punishments levied against the company have been more than fair 
Wells Fargo fired more than 5 000 employees in relation to its initial fraudulent account scandal and was also fined  185 million  More recently  in one of her final acts as head of the Federal Reserve  Janet Yellen and regulators notified Wells Fargo that is could not grow beyond the  1 95 trillion in total assets it ended 2017 with  until it sufficiently improves its governance and controls  
As one of Warren Buffett s right hand men  what Munger says can carry significant weight  But it is unclear if federal regulators will care about what he has to say  as Wells Fargo was Berkshire s top holding as of its most recent SEC filing  Berkshire owns roughly  27 5 billion worth of Wells Fargo shares 
Wells Fargo  which is currently a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   has seen its stock price surge over the fast few days  even before today s climb
