analyst believes that ExxonMobil s bellwether status in the energy space and optimal integrated capital structure have helped it come up with industry leading returns Moreover  the management s track record of capex discipline across the commodity price cycle make it a relatively lower risk energy sector play  Notably  the company owns some of the most prolific upstream assets globally  with a number of major projects slated to come online over the next few years  Since 2018  ExxonMobil has made several oil discoveries in offshore Guyana The firm estimates 750 000 barrels of oil production per day from the region by 2025  However  the integrated energy player s downstream   chemical units significantly underperformed in the first nine months of 2019  The units are unlikely to recover in the fourth quarter owing to scheduled maintenance activities Shares of Starbucks have lost 10 8  in the past three months against the Zacks Food   Restaurants industry s fall of 9 8   The Zacks

value The company reiterated its medium term sales and operating margin growth targets  However  cost inflation and higher marketing expenses partly offset margins  which should continue in fiscal

142733,364248,FIS,Worldpay charges  disclosed in fine print  anger small U S  merchants,news,"By David Henry NEW YORK  Reuters    Mark VenHuizen  the comptroller of a family business which sells parts for boat engines in Florida  says he has complained three times to Worldpay Inc since 2016 for tacking on extra fees to process his customers  credit and debit card payments without clearly telling him about it  The first two times when he complained after noticing larger costs on his billing statement  the additional fees disappeared for a few months  Last August  he discovered Worldpay had added a 0 3  charge on top of an initial fee of 0 2  on many transactions  boosting his bill by hundreds of dollars   It has been so frustrating with them   VenHuizen said  In the course of several interviews and email exchanges over the past two months  Worldpay told Reuters it had notified VenHuizen in his June 2018 statement that fees for many transactions would increase by up to 0 8   That happened for transactions such as when his customers made payments using cards that offer spending rewards like cashback and travel points  The company also referred to VenHuizen s original agreement  where in fine print it says it may charge up to 1 95  for those types of transactions  It said such markups are tied to risks and costs associated with individual businesses and depend on factors such as the type of merchant  how often it takes cards online  and whether the cards tend to have high credit limits   Worldpay s fees are properly disclosed   the company said  Payment processors like Worldpay are a key part of the plumbing for everyday non cash transactions such as credit and debit card swipes at grocery stores and restaurants  They gather transaction information and send it through the card networks such as Visa  NYSE V  and Mastercard  NYSE MA  to the card issuers  which are typically banks  They also take on some risk as they vouch to card companies for the merchants  ability to cover refunds on bad charges  Processors were paid about  20 billion for their work in 2018  according to industry publication The Nilson Report  Worldpay  the largest U S  processor by transaction volume  was bought by Fidelity National Information Services Inc for  50 billion in a deal that closed on July 31  In a statement sent this week to Reuters for this story  FIS said   As part of the integration activities for our recent acquisition of Worldpay  we are currently reviewing Worldpay s sales and billing practices to ensure they are fair and transparent   The company added   We take any concern over unfair practices very seriously   Interviews with three merchants  several competitors and five former Worldpay salespeople  as well as a review of billing statements sent to more than a dozen merchants  show that Worldpay tells merchants upfront that it will collect two different kinds of fees on card transactions  Those are a fee for its own services  and charges levied by the card networks and issuers that it collects and passes on  In fact  the processor adds a third fee for some small merchants that is disclosed in the fine print   a markup to the card network and issuer charges  these people said  In its billing statements  it mixes that markup with the card company charges and does not show the specific amount it has added  according to the people and the documents  As a result  when small U S  businesses  such as VenHuizen s company  Jerry s Marine Service  sign up with Worldpay  they at times end up paying hundreds of dollars more for the service than they realize  the billing statements show   It is very confusing to try to interpret one of these billing statements   said Anthony Barnett  who owns two restaurants in the U S  Northeast   It is all in the fine print   Barnett said he switched processors earlier this year after Worldpay added a 0 65  markup to his statements for one restaurant and then offered to reduce his charges by roughly  2 700 a month when he complained  Worldpay said it had not increased its rates for Barnett s restaurant  in nearly two years    SALES PRACTICES In contrast to Worldpay  JPMorgan Chase  NYSE JPM    Co s payment processing unit  for example  said it separately discloses card company costs and its fees in statements to merchants in plans that compare with Worldpay s   Square Inc   NYSE SQ  offers flat rates that cover all charges  Worldpay  which commented to Reuters before its sale to FIS closed  said that its statements and pricing were not  significantly different than industry practices   Worldpay declined to provide the number  or proportion  of its merchant customers who are assessed a markup  Nor would it quantify the additional revenue it brings  Nearly 200 000 merchants were allegedly overcharged by the company for such markups or other extra fees  according to court documents filed in 2017 when Worldpay settled a lawsuit  The suit was brought by class action lawyers representing merchants who claimed the company had misled them  Worldpay settled the lawsuit for  52 million   While we believe we had meritorious defenses to the claims  we settled the matter two years ago to avoid potentially protracted and costly litigation   the company told Reuters  FIS said it was engaging a third party as part of its review of Worldpay s practices   We are committed to ensuring that any historic issues are addressed going forward   it said  Sales practices of the payments industry fall under the purview of the Federal Trade Commission  which is charged with preventing  unfair or deceptive acts or practices  in commerce  Two former agency lawyers said the agency expects consistent language in marketing and sales agreements  But the FTC has brought only a handful of cases against processors over the past two decades  leaving practices largely unchallenged  An FTC spokesman declined to comment  DIFFERENT MARKUPS Reuters reviewed monthly Worldpay billing statements with markups issued to more than a dozen small merchants between January 2018 and April 2019  Some were provided directly to Reuters by the merchants and others came through industry sources  Those businesses were paying markups of at least 0 2  on many credit card transactions  A vitamin shop in Colorado was paying an extra 0 95  on many of its transactions  A dentist in Illinois was paying 1 85  more but a dentist in Alabama was being marked up 0 65   For each type of transaction  it took five calculations  including a reference to rates from complex card industry tables  to figure out how much the merchants were being charged extra   There is no way for a merchant to know what they are going to pay   said Ben Dwyer  who writes about the industry and makes money selling processing services for selected Worldpay competitors  In VenHuizen s case  Worldpay removed information showing card company charges when it added its markup  In his July 2018 statement  the company had shown specific rates for what it was collecting on behalf of card companies  When Worldpay added its markups in August 2018  the rate disclosures disappeared from his statement  Worldpay said it notified VenHuizen in advance and its charges were proper  The five former salespeople  who worked at Worldpay until 2017  said they did not tell customers about the possibility of extra fees when they signed them up  in part because they had an incentive to close on sales quickly  Salespeople were expected to sign 60 to 80 new merchants each month  three of the sources said  and lower fees helped do that   Worldpay told Reuters it does not offer low introductory rates to win customers  Worldpay used pricing tables to include about 20 different levels of markups  three of the former salespeople said  The tables added markups in increments of 0 05  to 0 10  and topped out at an extra 1 85   the three sources said  
Some customers  including ones who licensed sales software from important Worldpay business partners  were exempt from markups  two of the former salespeople said ",2019-08-23,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/worldpay-charges-disclosed-in-fine-print-anger-small-us-merchants-1962309,1962309

143049,364564,FIS,4 Stocks To Profit From The Fintech Revolution  ,opinion,Ever since its inception  the banking industry has more or less had a stranglehold on our financial transactions  And till only recently  their familiar brick and mortar format was the only option available for nearly all consumers  Now  with the rise of fintech  such scenes will soon become part of the financial history books Once a nascent industry  fintech has reached an inflection point  It is now poised to increasingly determine how we transfer  save and invest our money  Modest startups and early disruptors are now growing into industry leaders  As they build up their brands and widen their market share  it would be prudent to invest in fintech stocks to cash in on a phenomenon ready to explode From Disruptors to Industry LeadersAccording to Itay Goldstein  a professor of finance at Wharton  fintech consists of a bunch of emerging technologies that will  completely reshape the finance industry   Essentially  the term refers to technological innovations in financial services These could be used to both support and disrupt traditional banking and financial services  The term encompasses everything from the blockchain phenomenon to cryptocurrency and robo advisors for investors But after posing as a minor worry to major financial players  fintech companies are now set to replace them altogether  Most early disruptors are now building additional functionality around their core offering and expanding their range of services  And their potential is beginning to increasingly reflect these opportunities Robinhood  which enables commission free equity and ETF trading  saw its valuation skyrocket to  5 billion last year  This was primarily due to the opportunity that it presents rather than its current financial metrics    Brand Identity vs  FunctionalityUltimately  the fintech disruptors of the past will slowly morph into the next generation of banks  Existing players will fight back  but the opportunity their existing business represents is too lucrative to resist  This will convince venture capital to keep fintech companies well funded  This trend would also likely extend to late stage entrants with huge growth potential A higher level of personalization holds the key to fintech s future  In fact  users could utilize fintech products to differentiate themselves  as much as say their choice of music or car would  This means brand identity would become as important for fintech products as everyday functionality For instance  SoFi  known primarily for its student loan offering  assigns most of its marketing spend toward member experiences  This includes career counseling and happy hours  Ellevest is targeted at women looking to invest and offers a set of tools specifically designed for this purpose  And the list goes on with newer entrants targeting veterans  Baby Boomers and other such categories Our ChoicesWith budding startups and disruptors poised to become industry leaders  fintech seems to be the next frontier  Initially geared toward a specific purpose  fintech companies are widening both the scope and scale of their services  This is intended to challenge and even replace sector incumbents This is why it s a great time to invest in fintech  especially in those stocks that make up KBW   NASDAQ s Fintech Index  KFTX   The index is a performance benchmark for publicly traded fintech companies  We have narrowed our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and other relevant metrics Fidelity National Information

4 Stocks to Profit from the FinTech Revolution
Ever since its inception  the banking industry has more or less had a stranglehold on our financial transactions  And till only recently  their familiar brick and mortar format was the only option available for nearly all consumers  Now  with the rise of fintech  such scenes will soon become part of the financial history books 
Once a nascent industry  fintech has reached an inflection point  It is now poised to increasingly determine how we transfer  save and invest our money  Modest startups and early disruptors are now growing into industry leaders  As they build up their brands and widen their market share  it would be prudent to invest in fintech stocks to cash in on a phenomenon ready to explode 
From Disruptors to Industry Leaders
According to Itay Goldstein  a professor of finance at Wharton  fintech consists of a bunch of emerging technologies that will  completely reshape the finance industry   Essentially  the term refers to technological innovations in financial services 
These could be used to both support and disrupt traditional banking and financial services  The term encompasses everything from the blockchain phenomenon to cryptocurrency and robo advisors for investors 
But after posing as a minor worry to major financial players  fintech companies are now set to replace them altogether  Most early disruptors are now building additional functionality around their core offering and expanding their range of services  And their potential is beginning to increasingly reflect these opportunities 
Robinhood  which enables commission free equity and ETF trading  saw its valuation skyrocket to  5 billion last year  This was primarily due to the opportunity that it presents rather than its current financial metrics 
Brand Identity vs  Functionality
Ultimately  the fintech disruptors of the past will slowly morph into the next generation of banks  Existing players will fight back  but the opportunity their existing business represents is too lucrative to resist  This will convince venture capital to keep fintech companies well funded  This trend would also likely extend to late stage entrants with huge growth potential 
A higher level of personalization holds the key to fintech s future  In fact  users could utilize fintech products to differentiate themselves  as much as say their choice of music or car would  This means brand identity would become as important for fintech products as everyday functionality 
For instance  SoFi  known primarily for its student loan offering  assigns most of its marketing spend toward member experiences  This includes career counseling and happy hours  Ellevest is targeted at women looking to invest and offers a set of tools specifically designed for this purpose  And the list goes on with newer entrants targeting veterans  Baby Boomers and other such categories 
Our Choices
With budding startups and disruptors poised to become industry leaders  fintech seems to be the next frontier  Initially geared toward a specific purpose  fintech companies are widening both the scope and scale of their services  This is intended to challenge and even replace sector incumbents 
This is why it s a great time to invest in fintech  especially in those stocks that make up KBW   NASDAQ s Fintech Index  KFTX   The index is a performance benchmark for publicly traded fintech companies  We have narrowed our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and other relevant metrics

143080,364595,FIS,Will Western Union Gain From Business Sale  Share Buyback ,opinion,"Last week  Western Union Co    NYSE WU   signed an agreement for the sale of its Speedpay business to ACI Worldwide 
The deal would fetch the company  750 million in cash and is expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter of 2019  subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals 
Simultaneously  this leader in money remittance space announced a new three year share repurchase authorization of  1 billion  set to expire on Dec 31  2021  and is accretive to worth  544 million remaining under its previous buyback plan as of Dec 31  2018 
Focus on Core Areas
Western Union s bill pay business accounted for nearly 6  of the company s 2018 total revenues  providing electronic bill presentment  and payment solutions to a variety of business sectors in the United States including utilities  auto finance  mortgage  consumer finance  insurance  telecommunications and government finance  Revenues for this business declined in 2018  due to a decrease in Western Union s United States electronic bill payments services 
The divestiture will thus allow Western Union to concentrate on its focal point of cross border money transfer  The company seeks to expand its digital services  thereby leveraging its platform to unlock new cross border  cross currency payments opportunities and generate additional operating efficiencies 
Western Union expects this deal to lead to a pre tax gain of approximately  500 million  Net proceeds of the transaction  after taxes on the gain  are projected to be approximately  575 million and the company intends to use the same to return capital to shareholders as well as manage its capital structure 
Per the recent guidance  the company expects revenue growth in low single digit  on a constant currency basis   operating margin of approximately 20   EPS in the range of  1 83  1 95 and cash flow from operating activities of approximately  1 billion  However  following the closure of this deal  the company is likely to revise its earnings outlook  The company  however  does not anticipate the divestment to affect its 2019 operating margin view of approximately 20  
This business streamlining and share buyback should help the company s both top and the bottom line  thereby aiding overall growth 
Will These Developments Favor Western Union 
The stock has been under pressure of late after experiencing a stiff competition from the entry of numerous fintech players in the industry  While the company s business was mostly physical  involving stores and agents operating those  the fintech players with their cutting edge technology were able to eat into its market share 
Though Western Union has been investing heavily in developing its technology platform to face the tough rivalry and has been able to grow its digital business  all this has induced an increase in expenses  which has weighed on its margins as well as earnings 
Consequently  the stock has lost 8  of value in a years  time versus the  s growth of 16

143115,364630,FIS,Fidelity National  FIS  Q4 Earnings Beat  Expenses Decline,opinion,"Fidelity National Information Services    NYSE FIS   fourth quarter 2018 adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations came in at  1 60  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 58  Also  the bottom line improved 29  from the year ago quarter figure of  1 24 
Lower expenses and expanding margin were the key tailwinds  Slight growth in GAAP revenues was another positive factor  However  huge outstanding debt posed a key concern 
On a GAAP basis  the company reported net earnings attributable to common stockholders of  299 million or 91 cents in the quarter compared with  934 million or  2 77 in the prior year quarter  In fourth quarter 2017  the company reported a large favorable adjustment due to the tax reform 
For full year 2018  adjusted net earnings attributable to common stockholders came in at  1 7 billion or  5 23 per share compared with  1 4 billion or  4 27 per share in the prior year  The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at  5 22 
Revenues Increase  Expenses Decline
GAAP revenues for the quarter came in at  2 17 billion  which increased marginally year over year  However  the figure lagged the consensus estimate of  2 21 billion 
For 2018  the company reported GAAP revenues of  8 42 billion  down 2 8  year over year  Also  the top line lagged the consensus estimate of  8 47 billion 
Organic revenue growth was nearly 3  in the quarter 
Selling  general and administrative expenses came in at  321 million  down 4 7  year over year 
Segment wise  Integrated Financial Solutions  GAAP revenues grew 2 5  to  1 13 billion while revenues from Global Financial Solutions declined 1  to  976 million  Corporate Other revenues decreased 20 7  to  65 million 
Adjusted earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortization  EBITDA  rose nearly 5 4  year over year to  864 million while adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 200 basis points  bps  to 39 9  
Balance Sheet   Cash Flow
As of Dec 31  2018  cash and cash equivalents were  703 million compared with  665 million as of Dec 31  2017  Debt outstanding was nearly  9 billion 
In the fourth quarter  net cash provided by operations was  705 million and free cash flow was  551 million 
Fidelity paid dividends worth  105 million in the quarter and repurchased 1 4 million shares at a total cost of about  150 million  As of Dec 31  2018  the company had about  2 68 billion share repurchase authorization remaining 
Guidance for 2019
Fidelity expects organic revenue growth to be between 3 5  and 4 5  while GAAP revenues are expected to remain flat 
Adjusted earnings per share are expected to be in the band of  7 35  7 55 
Adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to expand in the range of 150 200 bps 
Our Take
Fidelity enjoys a dominant position in financial and payments solutions business  backed by a robust product portfolio  We believe that the company is well positioned to benefit from increasing investment in digitization 
However  increasing consolidation in the banking sector  challenging environment for the Payments Solutions business and an uncertain regulatory environment are the primary headwinds

143122,364637,FIS,Is It Wise To Hold On To Fidelity National  FIS  Stock Now ,opinion,"On Jun 5  we issued an updated research report on Fidelity National Information Services  Inc    NYSE FIS     The company is benefiting from solid organic growth and evolving digital platform like mobile banking  However  intense competition and high debt level keep us apprehensive 
Fidelity National s shares have gained 14 4  over the last six months  underperforming the Zacks categorized  industry s rally of 16 9  
Also  the company s earnings estimates for 2017 and 2018 have been revised slightly downward in the last 30 days  As a result  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  

The company has witnessed an impressive compound annual growth rate of 12 4  in the last five years  ended 2016  on the back of its strong market position and broad customer base  Also  its initiatives such as digitization encourage us  Further  Fidelity National expects organic revenues to grow 2 3  in 2017 
Fidelity National began the year by increasing common stock dividend by 12   boosting shareholders  confidence in the stock  Also  the company witnesses strong cash flows 
However  the company s balance sheet seems leveraged  Despite its efforts to reduce the debt level  Fidelity National had outstanding debt of about  9 5 billion as of Mar 31  2017  This is likely to restrict the company s future expansion plans and mar profitability 
Moreover  the company is exposed to significant competition from the new entrants along with the existing  well experienced peers

Prior to this hike  the company had raised its dividend by 12  to 29 cents per share in January 2017 
The company also has a share repurchase program in action  It includes a  4 billion share repurchase authorization  which expires on Dec 31  2020  Supported by a solid balance sheet position  it continues to enhance shareholder value through efficient capital deployment activities 
However  the news failed to cheer investors  In fact  shares of Fidelity declined 1 3  in the last trading session  perhaps reflecting investors  concerns over its weak revenue growth prospects 
Concerns
Though the company srevenues have witnessed a compound annual growth rate of 12 4  over the last five years  ended 2016   it is projected to increase only marginally in 2017 compared with the industry s 8 9  growth  Revenues from Global Financial Solutions segment are likely to have contributed less due to softness in trading volume on account of lower volatility 
Further  Fidelity s return on equity indicates that it utilizes shareholders  funds less efficiently than the industry  The company s ROE of 14 05  compares unfavorably with 24 45  for the industry 
Growth Drivers
The company s earnings per share  EPS  have increased 11 15  over the last three to five years  The trend is expected to continue in the near term as well  Fidelity s projected EPS growth is 15 5  and 10 2  for 2017 and 2018  respectively 
Its strong capital position keeps it well poised to undertake opportunistic growth strategies  Its past acquisitions have been accretive to earnings  Further  it continues to drive synergies from the SunGard acquisition completed in 2015   
Moreover  the company s leverage picture looks encouraging  Its debt equity ratio of 0 87 compares positively with 0 97 for the broader industry 
Additionally  the stock looks undervalued based on its price to book and price to cash flow ratios  which are below the respective industry averages 
Our Viewpoint
Fidelity s growth prospects look encouraging based on its inorganic growth strategies and lower debt burden  Further  the projected increase in EPS is also encouraging  Also  the company has been able to gain analysts  confidence  as indicated by a slight upward revision in the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current year earnings over the last 30 days 
However  poor revenue growth prospects continue to remain a drag 
Shares of Fidelity have gained 11 3  over the past six months  underperforming the 20 1  rally of the  it belongs to

Notably  Fidelity delivered positive earnings surprises in three of the trailing four quarters  with an average beat of 5 3  
Last quarter  the company pulled off a positive earnings surprise of 11 3   Results benefited from lower expenses and a strong liquidity position  However  decline in revenues was a headwind 
Fidelity National Information Services  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise   Factors to Influence Q4 Results
Fidelity s service revenues are expected to increase because of higher U S  debit and credit card payment volumes  However  per the consensus estimate  rise in revenues from Integrated Financial Solutions of nearly 3  to  1 2 billion will be offset by a decline in revenues in Global Financial Solutions of 4 5  to  1 1 billion  Also  the consensus estimate for overall revenues of  2 4 billion indicates a 3 1  decline from the prior year quarter 
The company s focus on introducing new and innovative products in order to meet the growing demand of customers will likely increase expenses  as witnessed in the past 
The Florida based financial service provider s earnings are expected to benefit this quarter on the back of synergies from the SunGard acquisition  During last quarter earnings  the company had updated guidance for adjusted earnings per share for 2017 to  4 38  4 43 from  4 22  4 32

143141,364656,FIS,What s In Store For Fidelity National  FIS  In Q3 Earnings ,opinion,"Fidelity National Information Services  Inc    NYSE FIS   is set to release third quarter 2016 earnings results on Nov 1  In the last quarter  the company reported a positive earnings surprise of 4 65   The company delivered positive earnings surprises in three out of the last four quarters  with an average positive earnings surprise of 2 58  
Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors to Consider                                               
Fidelity delivered mixed results in the second quarter of 2016  While earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate  revenues missed the consensus mark  On a year over year basis  both the top line and the bottom line registered decent growth 
Fidelity has strengthened its dominant position in the financial and payments solutions business  primarily based on its superior product portfolio 
Also  Fidelity is well positioned to benefit from increasing investment in mobile banking and innovative products such as PayNet  Mobile banking is developing into an essential extension of online banking as smartphone and tablet usage continues to accelerate globally 
We believe that banks and financial institutions will choose the company s innovative solutions  such as mobile wallet  in order to differentiate their services  thereby driving top line growth 
Moreover  Fidelity s Open Payment Framework has witnessed consumer adoptions this year in Hong Kong  India and Canada  We believe new customer wins as well as accretive acquisitions are key catalysts in the near term  Nevertheless  increasing consolidation in the banking sector  challenging environment for the Payments Solutions business and uncertain regulatory environment are the primary headwinds  Also  intensifying competition from the likes of Fiserv  NASDAQ FISV  Inc    NYSE FIS    Global Payments Inc    NYSE GPN   and Alliance Data Systems Corp  NYSE ADS   remains a concern 
Earnings Whispers 
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Fidelity National is likely to beat earnings this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here  as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  Fidelity s Earnings ESP is  1 02   This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at 97 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 98 cents per share  Please check our  that enables you to find stocks that are expected to come out with earnings surprises

143173,364688,FIS,Fidelity National Information Services  FIS   Moving Average Crossover Alert,opinion,"Are you a technical investor  If so  it may be time to consider Fidelity National Information Services  Inc    NYSE FIS   for your portfolio  The company just saw its 50 Day Moving Average breakout above its 200 Day Simple moving average  a trend that could indicate some bullishness in the future for FIS 
This trend may have already begun  as shares of FIS have moved by higher by 12  in just the past month  Plus  FIS has earned itself a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   so there is plenty of reason to believe that the run for Fidelity National Information Services has plenty of life left

So given this move in estimates  and the positive technical factors  investors may want to watch this breakout candidate closely for more gains in the near future ",2016-05-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/fidelity-national-information-services-(fis):-moving-average-crossover-alert-200132159,200132159
143178,364693,FIS,MasterCard s Capital Strong Despite Acquisitions  Debt,opinion,"On Dec 8  2014  we issued an updated research report on Mastercard Inc  NYSE MA   The company s secure capital position  despite its string of acquisitions and debt issuance in 2014  is commendable  An efficient capital deployment strategy along with organic growth initiatives should further counter competitive and market risks 

This Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock has delivered positive earnings surprises in three of the last four quarters with an average beat of 3 6   The company s third quarter 2014 earnings topped both the Zacks Consensus Estimate and the year ago quarter figure by 14 1  and 21 9   respectively 

MasterCard is steadily gaining competitive advantage on its recent acquisitions  alliances  along with product diversification and geographic expansion initiatives  Rapidly growing digital payments and technology upgrades are minimizing the gap toward cashless payments  and raising opportunities for long term growth 

The expansion of MasterPass to about 14 countries so far  and ease of sanctions in China and Myanmar generate optimism over management s expectation of delivering earnings growth of at least 20  in the next two to three years 

While cash flows remained weak in the first nine months of 2014  given five consecutive acquisitions and  1 5 billion of debt issuance earlier this year  MasterCard s effective capital deployment assures incremental shareholder return  This is also reflected by the recent 45 5  hike in dividends and expansion of new buyback program by  3 75 billion  The company is also likely to maintain a safe long term adjusted debt to EBITDA of 1 0x going ahead 

Risks Ahead

Nevertheless  caution remains on increased regulatory compliances and economic volatility in global markets  Implementation of the new payments law in Russia is delayed to Mar 2015 from Oct 2014  while a final verdict on capping of interchange fees in European Union is expected in the first half of 2015  Although these timelines may not affect financials this year  the amendments will likely have significant adverse implications in 2015 and beyond 

Moreover  higher international dependence  stiff competition  currency fluctuations  operating challenges across emerging economies and higher expenses  threaten both the top line and operating leverage  A 10  adverse currency fluctuation is expected to cause a loss of  193 million in the company s hedging program  thereby raising ample market and counterparty credit risks 

Overall  a balanced risk reward profile in the near term prompted slight upward estimate revisions for 2014 and 2015 in the past 60 days  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2014 and 2015 moved north by 2 3  and 0 6  to  3 07 and  3 60 per share  respectively  On a year over year basis  earnings are expected to grow by about 17 8  in 2014 and 17 3  in 2015 

Moreover  the Most Accurate estimate for MasterCard s 2014 and 2015 earnings currently stand at  3 05 and  3 63 a share  respectively  translating into  of  0 7  and  0 8   respectively  While this indicates a likely earnings miss for 2014  it also signals possibility of an earnings beat next year
