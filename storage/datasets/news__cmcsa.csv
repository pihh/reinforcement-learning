218507,440023,CMCSA,Sprint  T Mobile  and Comcast Collaborate to Stop Robocalls,news,"In a joint press release early Tuesday morning  telecom operator Sprint  NYSE S  and cable giant Comcast  NASDAQ CMCSA  announced a shared effort to block so called robocalls from reaching their phone service customers 
What s new 
Two technologies  known as Secure Telephone Identity Revisited  STIR  and Signature based Handling of Asserted information using toKENs  SHAKEN   will combine to check the identities of calls between these compliant networks  Robocalls often employ fake caller identities in order to spread unwanted marketing calls and other voice based spam 
These providers have already dipped the odd toe in the anti robocall waters  In a separate press release today  Sprint also announced a STIR SHAKEN implementation for connections to T Mobile  NASDAQ TMUS   Comcast recently signed a similar agreement with Canadian phone network operator Telus  NYSE TU  

What s next 
More deals should follow    STIR SHAKEN support among American carriers is a requirement under the TRACED Act  an anti robocall law that was signed at the end of December  The Federal Communications Commission is tasked to design a regulatory framework for this by the end of September 2020  Comcast  T Mobile  and Sprint are simply getting started before anybody forces them to 
 While all carriers compete fiercely in the marketplace  we all agree that the industrywide plague of robocalls and scammers must be tackled arm in arm with other carriers as we put the latest technology to work to help protect our customers   said Sprint CEO Michel Combes in a prepared statement   STIR SHAKEN is one tool among many that Sprint is utilizing in a multi year anti robocalling development program to improve our customers  experience  ",2020-02-04,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pr23q,2076036
218508,440024,CMCSA,How Comcast and Charter Have Used Cellphone Services to Sell Wifi,news,"Just a few years ago  some investors    along with a handful of analysts    scoffed at the idea of Comcast  NASDAQ CMCSA  successfully competing with more entrenched players in the mobile phone business  The chorus was repeated in 2018 when Charter Communications  NASDAQ CHTR  decided to take on the likes of AT T  NYSE T  and Verizon  NYSE VZ  by launching Spectrum Mobile under its Spectrum cable TV umbrella  Cable television companies have a cord cutting problem to stave off after all  they said  and shouldn t take on a lost cause 
Charter and Comcast are enjoying the last laugh now  Between the 288 000 wireless subscribers Charter signed on last quarter and Comcast s quarterly additions of 261 000  the two cable and internet providers now collectively service a total of 3 million cellphone customers 
That s not the most interesting part of the story for investors  however  Most curious is how both companies utilized their mobile services as a means of selling internet access    now arguably the more important and fruitful of the two other services each provide 
This bundle actually works
Recently  I suggested the days of cable television companies  bundles were over  with consumers now buying cable  phone  and internet services a la carte  In retrospect  there may be one exception to that new norm  People are willing to buy a broadband mobile phone combo  Those 3 million wireless customers Charter and Comcast now boast between them  They re also customers of each company s high speed internet service  It s a requirement  in fact 

The data tells the tale  Comcast once again added residential internet customers    to the tune of 424 000    last quarter in conjunction with its 261 000 new mobile customers  Charter picked up 313 000 internet customers along with its 288 000 new cellphone subscribers during the fourth quarter 
These numbers don t inherently indicate that all new phone customers also signed up for new high speed internet service  existing broadband customers could also be among the new cellphone subscribers  But  the numbers are strangely close  and the longer term trend of this data suggests there s a meaningful correlation between the two that somehow Verizon and AT T haven t plugged into  Clearly some bundles still work 


The contra data actually bolsters this argument  Verizon  for instance  only picked up 35 000 broadband customers during Q4  bringing its total to 5 9 million  but its total wireless connections  prepaid and postpaid  now stand at 94 5 million  up a whopping 731 000 from Q3 s count  AT T picked up a comparable number of mobility customers last quarter  yet somehow lost broadband customers  Those disparate numbers suggest there s little correlation between the addition of wireless customers and growing a high speed internet business  perhaps because AT T and Verizon don t require the purchase of one to buy the other 
Implications for established mobility companies
As for why Comcast and Charter have found co selling success with a package that would seemingly be difficult to market  one can only speculate  Most plausibly though  I believe the disparate numbers suggest Comcast and Charter are simply in a better position to sell mobile services to consumers than AT T and Verizon are positioned to sell broadband    or even television    to consumers 
Both Charter and Comcast can work with their existing cable television lines to deliver internet and are offloading much of their mobility workload to localized wifi connections in a way that ultimately lowers the cost of providing such service  That  in turn  means it can sell such service for less    and they are  Neither Verizon nor AT T has enough of the right infrastructure or technology in place to do the same  and instead  they rely on conventional mobile phone towers and spectrum  It s a more expensive means of connecting customers  phones to a network 
Addressing that cost is still a logistics nightmare for the phone giants  too  Whereas Comcast and Charter can mount strand mounted cells on poles propping up cable lines they already own without the need for permission or a permit  Verizon and AT T can t  They must get approval before setting up a pole mounted small cell that does the equivalent work 
Far more important  though  is what the advent of lower cost  wifi supported  as well as MIMO  and CBRS supported  mobility means for the future 
While slow and subtle thus far  the two cable giants in question are effectively turning wireless service into the easy  cheap add on that makes a particular internet service more marketable  Mobile service itself isn t the limited option  premium commanding service it used to be  That s not to say wireless is a full blown commodity and priced as such just yet  but it seems to be moving in that direction  It s another problem for the big and entrenched wireless service names simply because their broadband networks are already smaller and less robust than cable companies  are ",2020-02-07,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/psh18,2079200
218509,440025,CMCSA,Upstart Neon wins top Oscars prize  Netflix falls short again,news,"By Lisa Richwine
LOS ANGELES  Reuters    Three year old independent film distributor Neon upstaged the traditional Hollywood studios and streaming giant Netflix Inc  NASDAQ NFLX  on Sunday to grab the coveted best picture Oscar for South Korean have and have nots tale  Parasite  
The movie topped World War One drama  1917  from Comcast  NASDAQ CMCSA  Corp s Universal Pictures  gangster epic  The Irishman  from Netflix  and  Once Upon a Time in Hollywood  from Sony Corp  T 6758  among others at the televised Academy Awards 
Netflix  which had led all distributors going into the ceremony with 24 nominations  missed out on best picture for a second time  Its drama  Roma  was a leading contender last year  This year s  The Irishman   featuring an A list team including director Martin Scorsese and star Robert De Niro  ended the night without any Oscar trophies 
Overall  Netflix scored two golden statuettes  Laura Dern won best supporting actress for divorce drama  Marriage Story  while  American Factory  was named best documentary feature 
But it was Neon  founded in 2017 to produce and distribute independent films  that secured top bragging rights  The company s previous releases included  Vox Lux  and  I  Tonya   which won Allison Janney a supporting actress Oscar in 2019 
This year  Neon helped turn  Parasite  into a phenomenon in the United States and Canada  a rarity for a film with English subtitles  The movie tells the story of a poor family in Seoul that schemes its way into working in a wealthy household 
As of Sunday   Parasite  had collected  35 5 million in ticket sales in the U S  and Canadian market  part of its  165 4 million global haul 
Korean company CJ Entertainment released the film in South Korea  Shares in South Korea s Barunson Entertainment   Arts Corp  the producer of  Parasite   soared as much as 27  after the Oscars 
In total   Parasite  won four awards  including best director and best international feature film 
The Oscars recognition should immediately boost interest in  Parasite   which is playing in 1 000 theaters and is also available on DVD and streaming  said Paul Dergarabedian  senior media analyst at Comscore  Comcast owns the home distributing rights in the United States 
 Any self respecting film buff will be making immediate plans to hit the multiplex this week   Dergarabedian said  Many fans also will purchase the film  to watch it over and over again to unravel its many mysteries   he added

218510,440026,CMCSA,Will Disney  Blast DIS To Infinity   Beyond ,opinion,"Disney   NYSE DIS   is up to bat this earnings season  and this quarterly report is crucial to how investors perceive this evolving tech firm moving forward  It will be the first earning report that will include Disney   The entertainment conglomerates esteemed streaming platform 
Disney reported excellent traction in the first 24 hours of its release  with 10 million new subscribers right off the bat  Whether the platform was able to maintain its prolific user growth will be illuminated in DIS s earnings release on Tuesday  January 4th  after the bell 
Bernie McTernan  an analyst from Rosenblatt Securities  is estimated that Disney s new streaming service had 25 million subscribers rounding out 2019  This would represent a substantially higher signup rate than what was initially anticipated  Analysts are estimating that Disney has already pouched more than 1 million subscribers from Netflix   NASDAQ NFLX    Disney  is undoubtedly shaking up the streaming space 
Disney is not alone  Comcast   NASDAQ CMCSA   is releasing their new streaming platform  Peacock  on April 15th and AT T   NYSE T   is releasing HBO Max the following month  There is room for more than one platform to thrive in this space  Price point and content quantity   quality will be the deciding factors that dictate whether these services thrive or dive 
Disney  is this company s shiny new product offering  which is expected to be a significant profit driver for the company moving forward  Though  there is still quite a bit of uncertainty regarding this service s timeline to profitability  Disney is undercutting its cohorts  offering its platform for only  6 99 a month  which will allow the company to attract a broader demographic  This seemingly discounted price is exactly that  Disney is offering this low rate to initially attract customers but will increase this as its reach expands and its library of quality original content continues to develop  something that Netflix has been doing for years 
What To Expect On From The Report
Disney is typically not a huge mover on earnings releases  but its September quarter results excited investors with the anticipation of Disney   pushing the share price up 5  following the report  According to Zacks Consensus estimates  Disney is expected to report a record  21 08 billion in sales and an EPS of  1 43  This would represent sales growth of 38   but an EPS decline of 22  due to integration costs of recently acquired 21st Century Fox  as well as costs associated with the launch of Disney  
DIS has trended marginally down following the initial hype surrounding Disney   which launched the share price up over 15  in 14 trading days ending on November 26th  The stock has since broken down almost 9  

This downward price move may have created a springboard for this stock to jump off in the upcoming earnings  Disney  will be the most important topic to focus on while reading the report or listening to the earnings call  The exciting subscription expectations that Bernie McTernan is estimating gives me optimism about how much Disney  could have topped analyst s expectations 
Any realized synergies with 21st Century Fox could boost the stock while any unexpected additional integration costs could put downward pressure on the stock 
Take Away
Disney s new streaming service is the first step in the evolution of this media   entertainment conglomerate into a fast growing tech company  Disney  is changing the streaming game for binge watchers around the world as well as DIS shareholders  Management guidance and forward sentiment will be crucial to how this stock reacts following this report

Expectations have been growing since this service was released in November  The media giant announced that they had gained 10 million subscribers in the first 24 hours of the platform s release  which pushed shares of DIS towards growth multiples 
Disney  undercuts the cost of most of its cohorts at  6 99 per month and still offers a vast library of quality content  This service is slowly becoming a must have household streaming platform 
An analysts for Rosenblatt Securities think that Disney  rounded out the year with 25 million subscribers  This estimation would blow past market expectations 
DIS typically isn t a big mover on earning  but this new significant topline driver is changing everything for the firm  If Rosenblatt s subscriber estimations can be  I could see a sizable upside to the share price 
Another thing to look out for is any added integrations costs from the 21st Century Fox acquisition as well as the extent to which the coronavirus is impacting Disney s profitability  Both of these factors could put negative pressure on the stock

218514,440030,CMCSA,Buy Roku Stock On The Dip Before Q4 Earnings On Streaming TV Growth ,opinion,"Roku   NASDAQ ROKU   shares have moved sideways for six months and now the streaming TV firm is set to report its Q4 financial results after the closing bell on Thursday  The question is should investors consider buying once high flying Roku stock amid an ever expanding streaming TV market 
Recent Roku Worries 
Roku stock tumbled after it reported its Q3 earnings results in early November  even though its growth remained strong  Wall Street seemed to focus on slightly lower than expected new active account growth and  disappointing  fourth quarter guidance 
Investors also sold Roku stock in mid September after Comcast   NASDAQ CMCSA   announced that it would give its own streaming TV device to users of its broadband internet service for free 
Roku s Pitch 
Roku is famous for its small devices that plug into TVs that allow users to watch streaming TV content from the likes of Netflix   NASDAQ NFLX   and countless others  Despite some of the recent setbacks  Roku s pitch to Wall Street remains strong as more people drop cable 
For instance  1 7 million consumers cut the cord just during the third quarter of 2019  which continues to impact the likes of Comcast  AT T   NYSE T    and others 
Overall  roughly 56 million households will have canceled cable or satellite TV subscriptions by 2023  according to eMarketer  And Roku currently sells multiple streaming TV players  which compete against rival offerings from Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN    Google   NASDAQ GOOGL    and Apple   NASDAQ AAPL    that address this growing market 
The company has expanded its reach via smart TVs  which have its operating system built in  Its portfolio of devices helped Roku top the category with 44 2  of viewers  according to eMarketer  This came in well above Amazon Fire TV  Google Chromecast  and Apple TV 
 
 
 
 
 
Wall Street has also turned its focus to Roku s expanding digital advertising business  The company is able to attract advertisers through its Roku Channel that allows users to watch free streaming movies and TV shows  More importantly  the company sells advertising across its marketplace  enabling marketers to buy targeted ads and more 
Roku s monetized video ad impressions  again more than doubled YoY  in Q3  The company also completed its purchase of demand side platform firm Dataxu in November 
The deal is expected to help bolster its ad business  which is set to grow as more advertisers start to spend more heavily across connected TV   Acquiring Dataxu is a natural progression of our ad tech strategy to offer more buy side tools and to provide the industry s best holistic TV plus OTT planning and buying solution that delivers better results for TV buyers   Roku s senior VP of Platform Business Scott Rosenberg said in prepared remarks 
Outlook 
Last quarter  Roku s revenue soared 50   Meanwhile  its ad heavy platform revenue skyrocketed 79   which came on top of the year ago period s 74  expansion  Investors should note that platform revenue accounted for 69  of total Q3 sales  compared to 58  in Q3 2018 
Meanwhile  the company added 1 7 million accounts to close with 32 3 million  with average revenue per user up 30   Despite the solid expansion  Roku reported a larger adjusted loss last quarter    0 22 vs    0 09 in Q3 FY18   Some of the losses can be attributed to its international expansion efforts 
With this in mind  our current Zacks estimates call for Roku s Q4 revenue to jump 42 3  to  392 4 million  Overall  its full year fiscal 2019 sales are projected to climb over 49  to  1 11 billion  with 2020 expected to come in another 41  higher at  1 56 billion 
Investors should note that these growth estimates look strong compared to 2018 and 2017  The firm s full year 2018 sales jumped 45   with 2017 up 29  at  513 million  Roku went public in 2017  
The company s bottom line is expected to continue its decline  with its adjusted Q4 earnings projected to fall from   0 05 in the year ago period to a loss of   0 14 per share  Meanwhile  its adjusted full year EPS figure is expected to sink from   0 08 to   0 53 per share  Roku s 2020 earnings are then expected to come in nearly flat at   0 54 
Bottom Line
Roku stock is still up over 200  in the last two years and 460  since its September 2017 IPO  Thanks to its recent downturn  Roku shares closed regular trading Monday at  132 21  This marked a roughly 20  discount against their 52 week highs  which might give it room to run if it is able to impress investors Thursday

218524,440040,CMCSA,Comcast Raises Its Dividend 10  Ahead of Peacock Streaming TV Launch,news,"Although it often plays second fiddle to other entertainment and communications giants  Comcast  NASDAQ CMCSA  put the final wrap on a very successful 2019  Overall revenues and profits increased  overcoming a wave of residential customers canceling cable TV packages  a weak showing at the box office  and no broadcasting bump from big sporting events like the Super Bowl or the Olympics 
Fiscal 2020 should be an eventful year  though  with Comcast s NBCUniversal getting ready to enter the streaming TV wars  high speed internet connections still rising  and shareholders getting treated to a 10  boost to the dividend paid 

2019 by the numbers
Comcast ended 2019 with some healthy results  NBCUniversal finished down 3  in the fourth quarter  due to its near universally panned film rendition of Broadway classic Cats leading to a 21  year over year drop in the company s films segment  For the whole year  revenues were down 5   most of that due to the extra advertising and related broadcasting revenue from the NFL s Super Bowl and Winter Olympics in South Korea brought in during 2018  At the end of the day  profits excluding one time items were still up 2    
And then there was European TV network Sky  its first full year under Comcast s umbrella  Revenue and adjusted profits were flat in the fourth quarter    or up 1 4  and 0 4  respectively if excluding currency exchange rates    but notched healthy gains for full year 2019  Adjusted profits excluding currency fluctuations grew 12   thanks to Sky adding 394 000 customer relationships and direct to consumer programming  giving profit margins a boost

High speed internet is where it s at
Let s circle back around to the cable segment  Comcast s most important operation  Cord cutting gets lots of attention these days  and rightfully so as TV streaming services are hastening the decline of legacy cable TV operations  Comcast said it lost net 671 000 residential and 61 000 business cable TV relationships in 2019  lowering its total to just over 21 million relationships   
I m always surprised at just how much attention these figures get  though  Cable is undoubtedly on the downhill  but it isn t as if it s ready to completely disappear for Comcast in the near future  Those 21 million relationships are still a big number  Besides  NBCU s Peacock streaming service is landing this year  which is sure to help offset some cable pain via advertising revenue and maybe even some subscription fees  
But here s what should really be grabbing headlines  Comcast s bread and butter within the cable communications segment  high speed internet  It added another net 1 32 million residential and 89 000 business connections in 2019    bringing the grand total up to 28 6 million and easily offsetting cable TV losses  The move to broadband internet is the real number to watch here for the foreseeable future  and the growth rates remain healthy   
Add wireless business to the list of must watch items for Comcast as well  The company piggybacks off of Verizon s network to offer discount cellular services  and it reached 2 05 million total lines in Q4  Net lines added in 2019 were 816 000  and revenues from the segment grew 31  to  1 17 billion  Comcast s wireless is nearing break even and could be a solid addition to the bottom line in 2020 and beyond  
What s a potential investor to do 
All told  2019 was a great outing for Comcast  and the company announced it increased its annual dividend payout 10   good for a current yield of 2   Based on estimates for another solid year ahead for profits for the diversified media giant  the stock trades for a mere 12 9 times expected earnings  Existing shareholders might want to take a look at adding to positions as the stock has pulled back from highs post report    even though the company topped expectations    and Comcast looks like a must own value stock for those that aren t in already ",2020-01-27,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pnhc9,2068594
218525,440041,CMCSA,Will Comcast s Fears of Disrupting Cable Stifle Peacock s Streaming Future ,news,"Comcast owned  NASDAQ CMCSA  NBCUniversal is a part of the wave of companies releasing new streaming services  But you d be forgiven if you d forgotten about Peacock  which the company has been preparing with relatively little hype until an investor event earlier this month 
Compared to Disney s  NYSE DIS  juggernaut Disney  or even Apple s  NASDAQ AAPL  less popular Apple TV   Peacock hasn t captured the imagination of streaming customers  though investors seem to be starting to notice it  
The relatively low profile is reflective of NBCUniversal s modest strategy  The company has long had a reputation for caution in the streaming space  and the design and launch of Peacock seems like it will do little to change the conventional wisdom  NBCUniversal is clearly interested in limiting its potential downside  but will playing it safe hurt Peacock in the long run 

Peacock s structure
Peacock works a little differently than the SVOD giants that it will compete against  Unlike Netflix  NASDAQ NFLX   Disney   and the rest of the gang  Peacock does not require its viewers to have a paid subscription  Peacock is free and ad supported  though it gives users the option to pay  4 99 per month for a premium version  with extra content  or  9 99 per month for an ad free version of the premium subscription  Even that premium price  with ads  is less than Disney  s monthly rate  which itself is quite low for industry standards 
NBCUniversal hasn t confirmed which original series will be available when the service debuts  and none of the titles announced so far have gotten the sort of hype that Apple TV  s The Morning Show got    much less the level of anticipation that Disney  s The Mandalorian enjoyed 
Peacock may not have hot original series  though there s still time for hype to build   but what it will have are about 7 500 hours of free programming from NBCUniversal s stash  Recent episodes of some NBC shows    those in their first year airing    will appear the day after they air  Hulu style 
A limited vision
Ad supported streaming services can work  but they rarely draw as much attention    be it from customers  critics  or tech investors    as their paid counterparts  NBCUniversal s stash of media properties could help change that  especially with a hefty budget for original content 
And Peacock s content budget does look pretty hefty  at least in a vacuum  Comcast will spend  2 billion on content over the next two years  The problem is that  2 billion is not nearly as eye popping a figure for a content budget as it might have been a few years ago  Apple announced a content budget of  1 billion ahead of its Apple TV  launch  but soon allowed its budget to balloon to  6 billion as of Apple TV  s launch a few months ago  Disney  is spending  3 25 billion annually  and Netflix could spend north of  17 billion in 2020 
Can Peacock dazzle 
The comparison to Apple TV  only goes so far  While Peacock is spending less than Apple is  it also has more content in house from the get go  Apple  of course  had pretty much nothing   But it s also worth remembering that Apple TV  s spending has netted it just one noteworthy show    The Morning Show    and  even with that show  more attention from culture critics than from subscribers 
Peacock will be going to war with less to spend and with even more competitors  including the soon to launch HBO Max from AT T  NYSE T   It will have to make its way in a fractured market full of subscription churn  where pricing a service to be in direct competition with  and  to some budget minded consumers  mutually exclusive with  its peers may have more rewards but also more risks than its current free to stream strategy 
Comcast s decision to structure Peacock differently appears to be a part of a larger strategy to remain cautious and avoid tackling Netflix and Disney  head on with a big budget SVOD service  Strategies like rolling out the ad supported version of the service to existing Comcast customers should help limit the downside to this service 
But a limited vision also means a limited upside for Peacock  For the time being  it s hard to imagine that Peacock will draw attention in the way that Disney  has ",2020-01-28,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pnwie,2069362
218526,440042,CMCSA,Investors in Wireless Can t Ignore Comcast,news,"Comcast  NASDAQ CMCSA  added 261 000 subscribers to its Xfinity mobile service in the fourth quarter  and it now counts over 2 million total customers  That represents its highest net addition number of any quarter since launching the service in 2017  and reverses a trend of declining net addition growth seen in the first three quarters of the year 
Comcast s size and growth as an MVNO    a virtual network operator that relies on another wireless company s network    has become too big for investors in the big wireless companies to ignore  Not only does Comcast represent a competitor in the industry  stealing customers away from Verizon  NYSE VZ   AT T  NYSE T   T Mobile  NASDAQ TMUS   and Sprint  NYSE S   but it could represent a sizable customer for wholesaling network capacity 

Comcast can stay strong when the industry is weak
Comcast was a beneficiary of higher churn in the fourth quarter  When T Mobile provided a pre release of its fourth quarter earnings at the start of January  it noted an increase in its own postpaid phone subscriber churn for the first time in nearly four years  CFO Braxton Carter said industry churn was higher across the board at an investors conference the day of the release 
Carter  for one  welcomed the higher switching rates in the industry  He sees T Mobile as a share taker from AT T and Verizon  and it s easy to grow gross additions when customers are making a switching decision 
T Mobile remains one of the stronger wireless companies in the industry  growing its phone subscribers at a much better pace than AT T and Verizon  It s also smaller than the two wireless giants  so it has fewer customers to lose to Comcast  It s likely the bulk of Xfinity Mobile subscribers are coming from Verizon and AT T 
Comcast s able to leverage its 31 5 million existing customer relationships to attract new subscribers with relatively low customer acquisition costs  By comparison  a competitive environment may lead the bigger competitors to offer significant promotional discounts on devices or service to attract new customers  
If Comcast wants to increase subscriber growth  as management s commentary on its fourth quarter earnings call suggests  it could increase promotional activities  That would be an extremely effective strategy in an environment where industry churn is elevated already  AT T and Verizon would likely see greater impact on net additions than the smaller T Mobile or Sprint 
A wholesale opportunity
Comcast currently relies on Verizon s wireless network as well as its WiFi network to support Xfinity Mobile  But the terms of Verizon s deal aren t great  Even with the expectation for faster subscriber growth in 2020  management only expects Xfinity Mobile to reach EBITDA breakeven in 2021 
Comcast may be able to accelerate that timeline by renegotiating the deal with Verizon  the original contract is from 2011 and was amended in 2015  or striking new deals with AT T or T Mobile  To the degree Comcast might acquire more wireless spectrum and build out its own network capacity  management said   We ll be opportunistic on any spectrum opportunity  but we like our capital light MVNO approach today  
AT T s management said it s open to working with Comcast and other cable MVNOs as a wholesaler of its network capacity   We ve got a lot of capacity now in this network  and we re at the point of evolution in this industry where we ask   How do you monetize most efficiently     CEO Randall Stephenson said on the company s third quarter earnings call 
Winning a contract with Comcast could offset some of the pressure Xfinity Mobile s growth puts on AT T s retail wireless business  And with excess capacity from its FirstNet contract buildout  wholesaling could be an efficient means of boosting its returns on the capital invested in the first responder network 
As Comcast s wireless subscriber base grows  the wholesale opportunity becomes more attractive  but Comcast s negotiating power increases  As such  investors could see AT T or Verizon move to negotiate a contract in the next couple years before the wireless business turns profitable for Comcast ",2020-01-28,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pnyat,2069514
218527,440043,CMCSA,Comcast Customer Data  Bundling is Dying  and That s Not All Bad,news,"The concept is simple enough  Customers of one Comcast  NASDAQ CMCSA  service are the company s top prospects for another Comcast service 
The organization can even afford to offer price breaks to customers of multiple offerings since one of the telco industry s major expenses is bringing a consumer into an ecosystem  Once there  they can be further monetized in more cost effective ways  The idea eventually turned into the  triple play  offered by several phone  cable TV  and internet providers  Users of such services enjoy deep discounts when all three are purchased from the same company 
At least for Comcast though  customers are less and less interested in paying for multiple services  creating a retention challenge  But the company has been willing to become a disruptor    even disrupting itself    in a market environment that s becoming decidedly a la carte 

Just the internet  please
Of Comcast s 29 15 million residential service customers reported with its fourth quarter results  10 2 million only subscribe to one of the company s services  Most are broadband users  though it s still got a fair number of cable television customers despite a persistent cord cutting headwind  Another 8 9 million use two Comcast services  most likely cable and internet   Just a tad under 10 million are customers of three different Comcast offerings 

The noteworthy nuance of that data is  the single service cohort is growing in step with the  relative  shrinking of two and three service customers  despite strong efforts to the contrary 
It doesn t take a rocket scientist to figure out what s happening  Customers take no issue with the cost or quality of Comcast s high speed internet offering    their beef is with cable TV  Comcast has been losing paying subscribers for years  shedding another 733 000 in 2019  Assuming nothing stops the bleeding  it could feasibly lose another million this year 
The company is responding  The launch of its ad supported streaming platform Peacock is slated for the middle of this year  but it was providing alternatives as far back as early last year 
Something is better than nothing    in May the company unveiled Flex  offering reasonably full streaming service for  5 per month to Comcast internet customers who wanted to cut the cord  Later it made ad supported Flex free for its internet customers 
Comcast has also been in the wireless phone business since mid 2017  offering low cost mobile service to Comcast internet subscribers  but not to anyone else  And of course  for years it s offered TV  phone  and internet bundles to encourage the purchase of multiple services 
Consumers just aren t biting 
It can t be terribly surprising  Mobile phone stalwart AT T  NYSE T  acquired DirecTV in 2015 as a means of cross selling to each organization s existing customer base  Some nibbled  but most didn t despite the generous discounts available to them  Comcast has shown a comparable outcome with cross selling its services  More and more cable and internet customers are simply shrugging at the option 
More good news than bad
There s a clear downside to the data  That is  Comcast could be extracting more revenue per household  On average the company collected  156 98 per month from each of its customers  which is about two services  worth of sales  Given the effort intended to funnel all of its customers into multiple services  the cable giant has been a bit of a disappointment 

On balance though  there s more upside than downside to these numbers 
One of the chief upsides is the opportunity to grow revenue without necessarily bringing new customers into the ecosystem  The current plan is proving fairly ineffective  but it s an opportunity nonetheless 
Another upside  Margins should improve for its cable business even if revenue shrinks  Comcast CFO Mike Cavanagh explained last year that  we will not chase unprofitable video subs   echoing similar sentiments from AT T s chiefs as well as those steering Charter Communications through the industry s cord cutting nightmare 
The biggest upside buried in the customer breakdown data  however  is that Comcast is doing well in the one area where it needs to  While its cable television business continues to deteriorate and its wireless business is still only a shadow of the mobile operation operated by the likes of AT T  Comcast is absolutely crushing it as an internet service provider  It s now got 26 4 million high speed customers  versus 23 2 million as of the first quarter of 2017 

Of all the mediums available right now  it s the one to beat  That s because the plethora of video content providers coming to the market will not only all rely on high speed connectivity  they ll find themselves in a price war that costs a relative fortune to wage  Providing broadband service  conversely  is now easy and fairly cheap 
In other words  though not a growth name  Comcast will be fine in the shadow of de bundling    even if that wasn t the company s initial plan ",2020-01-29,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/poet0,2070527
218528,440044,CMCSA,AT T Ended 2019 With Fewer Video Subscribers Than Comcast,news,"AT T  NYSE T  lost another 1 16 million video subscribers in the fourth quarter  bringing its 2019 total to 4 1 million  The company ended the year with 20 4 million subscribers between DirecTV  U Verse  and AT T TV Now 
The rapid decline in subscribers puts AT T behind its biggest competitor in pay TV  Comcast  NASDAQ CMCSA   which closed out 2019 with 21 25 million video subscribers  Even when only counting Comcast s residential subscribers  it s about neck and neck with AT T at 20 29 million 
AT T s management expects its subscriber losses to have peaked last year  but that doesn t mean it s completely out of the woods  Meanwhile  Comcast expects its losses to increase in 2020 as it focuses more on profitability and its broadband business 
Ultimately  the relative size of AT T s video subscriber base could negatively affect the margins of the business as it loses leverage over media companies in negotiating carriage rates  That could have a meaningful impact on AT T s 2020 results as it looks to launch AT T TV nationwide 

AT T TV is the future of the video business
AT T TV will launch nationwide next month  and management is holding it up as the future of its video business alongside HBO Max  The product is a hybrid approach    somewhere between its premium DirecTV product and its over the top AT T TV Now product  
The service delivers linear TV over the top to consumers  but they ll only be able to receive it via AT T s proprietary set top box  That s in contrast to other live TV streaming services that allow consumers to use whatever connected TV device they choose  However  in doing so  AT T is able to exercise greater control over the user experience  which it thinks will enable it to attract consumers at the higher price point necessary to make such services profitable  Furthermore  it opens the opportunity for distribution revenue from other streaming services 
Sending customers an easy to install box that connects to their TV also means AT T will see significantly lower customer acquisition costs  DirecTV  by comparison  requires a contractor to come to a customer s home  install a satellite dish on their roof  and wire cable to their television set  Management says it ll be able to pass those cost savings onto subscribers in the form of lower prices compared to its legacy DirecTV service 
Management also expects to see a higher take rate from its broadband subscribers for AT T TV compared to DirecTV satellite  That could further reduce its average customer acquisition costs for the new video service 
All of those factors could lead to a video business with better margins  Operating margin for AT T s Entertainment segment  which also includes its broadband business  fell 30 basis points to 6 6  in the fourth quarter despite AT T eliminating many of its low value video subscribers over the past year 
Content is its biggest expense
AT T can cut overhead and operating expenses involved with acquiring new customers  but nothing changes the fact that its biggest expense for its video business is programming  And programming expenses per subscriber continue to climb 
Comcast saw its programming expenses increase 1 1  in 2019 despite a 3 2  decline in subscribers  That s the impact of contractual rate increases from media companies gaining increasing leverage after a series of mergers in the industry 
As AT T s subscriber base continues to shrink faster than the rest of the industry  it diminishes its ability to negotiate better contracts with media companies than the competition  In an industry competing for a smaller and smaller customer base  being able to negotiate better carriage deals could have the biggest impact on a company s ability to offer customers the best value and stand out from the competition  Ultimately  that s what s going to drive operating profits 
When AT T focused its AT T TV Now on profitability  raising prices twice in 2019 to offset higher programming expenses  it lost over 40  of its subscribers  Management expects to tell a different story for AT T TV despite offering a more expensive product to consumers and seeing diminishing negotiating power from its legacy subscriber base ",2020-01-30,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/po-ev,2071864

Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
Comcast  which belongs to the Zacks Cable Television industry  posted revenues of  28 40 billion for the quarter ended December 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 73   This compares to year ago revenues of  27 85 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call

What s Next for Comcast 
While Comcast has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately

Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Comcast was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

Hill  I think it s interesting that Comcast with their Peacock video streaming service  they are making a very clear decision  we are not going to be spending a ton of money on this  we re not going to be spending a lot on original content  So from an economic standpoint  I think if you re a Comcast shareholder  maybe you feel pretty good about this  because it s not like they are    I was going to say Netflix  but really it s Apple  I mean  if you look at the numbers that Apple is spending per episode  reportedly  on their shows    I mean  it s Apple they have all the money in the world  they can do that    but  for the profits that Comcast generates  I think it s an interesting and probably  at least out of the gate  a smart decision by Brian Roberts and his brain trust at Comcast to go this route 
Barker  Probably smart  I mean  you d make a lot of money betting on his moves being smart ones  or  you have over the last couple of decades  And I think that an indication of the degree to which they are doing this on the cheap  which I think is kind of how you framed it   
Hill  Not on the cheap   
Barker  Not to their faces  you re not framing it that way  but that s what I heard from you 
Hill   laughs  Sure  let s go with that 
Barker  Is the fact that one of the premiere new offerings that you re going to be able to get on this service is a reboot of Saved by the Bell  which I think  to me  underlines doing it on the cheap 
Hill   laughs  You re saying it s not the reports of Apple saying   We re going to spend  15 million per episode on this Jason Momoa futuristic show  
Barker  Or Picard  or The Mandalorian  or something like that  Saved by the Bell  one assumes less in space than these other things  So therefore a little easier to spend only  10   15 per episode 
Hill  Absolutely  And let s not forget that Comcast owns NBC and all the NBC properties  They ve got the Olympics coming this summer  so they will probably be using Peacock to serve up Summer Olympic content  I m assuming  And they will probably be promoting the hell out of Peacock on their TV network during the Summer Olympics 
Barker  Yeah  I think that s all pretty accurate  And so  in the meantime  internet use is growing  High speed broadband sales and installation  that sort of thing  They re more than making up for the lost pay TV subscribers with increased internet  And over time  it looks like it ll be the larger chunk of their revenue 
Hill  Let s move on to the airlines  We ve got three airlines that came out with fourth quarter results  Jet Blue s profits and revenues came in higher than expected  Different story for Amazon and Southwest  just because those two airlines have the 737 Max  which is grounded  So Southwest s profits were down more than 20  in the fourth quarter because of the 737 Max  American  their profits were up I would say despite having the 737 Max 
Barker  I was going to say  this is going to be correction week  because the first time through you said Amazon rather than American 
Hill  Did I 
Barker  Yeah  We ll edit that out 
Hill  You know what  I m not going to get any email from people at American Airlines or Amazon  I don t think  in the way that I clearly offended the people in Sweden for saying that Davos was in Sweden 
Barker  But you didn t offend the Swiss 
Hill  I don t know if we have dozens of listeners in Switzerland like we do in Sweden 
Barker  I would think that Sweden wouldn t be offended by that  They d be offended by our generic American lack of knowledge of basically everything outside of America 
Hill  Yeah  that s probably it 
Barker  So on behalf of Switzerland  perhaps  they were offended 
Hill  Exactly  And rising to Switzerland s honor 
Barker  Yes  All part of the European Union  Or not  Who can remember who s part of that this week 
Hill  Can we get back to the airlines 
Barker  Yes  we can 
Hill   laughs  By the way  Amazon doesn t have an airline  yet 
Barker  Right  And I was going to say  because people may have listened to that and thought   I haven t been following  are they taking over airlines  too   They have a pretty big logistics    look  you talk about Amazon five days a week  right  Four  Let s not talk about it today  despite your attempts to do so  American Airlines  different from Amazon  despite what you may have heard earlier in the day 
JetBlue doing a little better in part because they don t have exposure to the Boeing Max problem  Southwest really has large exposure to that  That s mostly known and embedded and built into the expectations of today s numbers  But still  I think  off a little bit 
JetBlue seemingly doing a little better  doing well with their cost cutting operations  which is what they highlighted in their report 
Hill  Yeah  And I don t own Jet Blue  But I always like to see  just as someone who is generally a fan of business  I like to see companies come out and say   This is our plan  This is how long it s going to take   And then  at the end of that timeframe  they actually hold themselves accountable and say   OK  this is what we did   In Jet Blue s case  it s a three year cost cutting plan that they executed  and it s paying off for them and their shareholders  literally 
Can we go to Boeing for a second  Because Dave Calhoun has been the CEO of Boeing for about  I m going to ballpark two or three weeks  Let s call it a month  And he came out on Wednesday and was  I think  trying to be very optimistic and even bullish about Boeing  as any CEO would want to be bullish about their company  But he said something    I don t know if you heard this  but I m curious to get your take on this    because he talked specifically about Boeing s dividend  And he said   We re not cutting the dividend unless something dramatic changes   And I feel like that s a mistake to say out loud  laughs  and for publication  because when companies cut their dividend  they are given the opportunity to share with the investing public why they re cutting the dividend  Dave Calhoun has now just basically removed any interpretation we as investors get to make  He s already said   Oh  if we cut the dividend in six months   which  by the way  is completely plausible  as they continue to have troubles with the 737 Max  So if they come out and cut the dividend even just a little bit  everyone rightfully is going to point back to this comment and be like   Wow  I guess something dramatic changed  huh  
Barker  Possibly  Look  certainly  he s inherited a very difficult situation 
Hill  And he s being well paid to inherit this situation 
Barker  The nice thing is  he s got an easy act to follow  That s always a plus  Yes  and he s being well paid  And even if he fails at the job  he ll be well paid to leave  because those are the rules of that game  And I think that  yeah  if somebody missteps on part of a sentence early on in their job  I ll note it and weigh it accordingly  But I think one interpretation is   It s safe  We can never be sure that there won t be something dramatic  We re not even calling what has happened so far dramatic from the perspective of a dividend cut  We re not trying to belittle the consequences of it  but vis a vis a dividend  it s not dramatic enough  We can t control everything that s going to happen in the future   and they can t 
So airlines are pretty poor performing stocks over the long term  That s really still been the case  although they ve gotten a little bit better  Over the last five years  airlines as a whole have only returned 1 5   The market s returned about 12   So pretty bad last three and five years for these things  And it is largely attributable to the fact that it is not only a heavily regulated industry  but for the most part one which people are not complaining about too many regulations  especially in light of something like the 737 Max  People look at that    I think today  there was a report from the Department of Transportation defending their work and saying   Look  we didn t drop the ball here  but we ve got 32 recommendations to ourselves about ways to improve this oversight  
So the outcome of this is  contrary to much of the rest of this administration s work on regulations    which is to find all of them  hunt them down  and kill them if possible    not to do so in the airline industry  So that inherently affects your profitability  And all three of these stocks are getting the job done as businesses  but really not keeping up with the rest of the market 
Hill  Procter   Gamble out with second quarter results  Revenue was lower than expected  Procter   Gamble is  obviously  a very big consumer goods company with a lot of different business lines  One thing I noted was    and they called this out    the global birth rate  which is slowing down  And when you re in the business of selling diapers  then you re just going to sell fewer diapers when the global birth rate  particularly in places like the United States and China  starts to slow down 
Barker  Yeah  And I hadn t been following China s birth rate  but that s been a problem  I had thought that that was already kept artificially low  But apparently it s trailing even more  So being the size of market that it is for Procter   Gamble and the competitors    Kimberly Clark as well  I think  talked about mid single digits off on diaper use  And I think they re also  of course  susceptible to increased and improved generics or white label 
Hill  Do you think a little bit of the drop that we re seeing in Procter   Gamble s stock today has to do with the fact that over the past year  the stock s up 30  
Barker  Yes 
Hill  That s kind of a crazy good year for a stock like Procter   Gamble 
Barker  Yeah  I ve got it up 42  over the last one year  It was already up a little bit this year  But  42  a year  for a consumer products company  which is not  obviously  growing the top line anywhere close to that amount  They ve obviously sort of improved some profitability issues  But any misstep is going to be an opportunity to take some profits off the table  as the saying goes  and I think that s a little bit of what s happening here  because the outlook for the year as a whole is a pretty good one for a consumer products company  I think they re talking about organic sales were up 5  for the quarter  and I think the earnings per share guidance is high single digits to low double digits  which  again  even though part of that is juiced by a lot of share buybacks  which they re in the middle of  that s still pretty impressive growth 
Hill  Do you think there s any chance Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger are looking at the results from Procter   Gamble  particularly over the past year  and saying   Hey  that Kraft Heinz acquisition  that s still not looking good   And they don t get to use the excuse that it s a bad time for consumer products companies  because P G is getting it done 
Barker  Yeah  they are getting it done  I imagine they have looked over their work for Kraft Heinz many times and thought    
Hill   What have we done    laughs   What have we done and how can we never do it again  
Barker   laughs   We know the mistakes we made  and we wish we hadn t made them  But we did  Thank goodness we ve got a lot of things that we ve done over the years that were not mistakes to make up for that one  because it s a pretty big one  
Hill  So you were pointing out before we started this show that part of the Kraft Heinz empire of products  you look at the brand portfolio within Kraft Heinz  you ve got Planters  Planters Nuts  and within that you ve got Mr  Peanut 
Barker  In the news 
Hill  Mr  Peanut very much in the news  because Mr  Peanut apparently is going to die on Super Bowl Sunday  There s an ad campaign that the Planters marketing folks are going to be rolling out where apparently  Mr  Peanut is going to die before the game  and then sometime during the third quarter  they re going to have a commercial featuring his funeral  I was already planning on watching the Super Bowl  but after initially being annoyed that Mr  Peanut was trending on Twitter over the last 24 hours  the more I read about this  the more I thought   OK  yeah  I m interested to see how this plays out   I m already a customer  I already think it s a fine product  I spend money on those peanuts 
Barker  Yeah  And here s my question  Has Mr  Peanut already died  Because they ve released the commercial where he dies  But only to the internet  right  So is he like Schrodinger s cat  both dead and not dead yet  Depending on whether you ve seen it  Depending on whether you ve observed the commercial  is he still alive  I m getting metaphysical here  You weren t expecting me to take it in that direction 
Hill  I really wasn t 
Barker  Were you expecting me to address this from a business perspective 
Hill   laughs  No  I was just going to say  I think we ve all come to expect at this point  when it comes to Super Bowl commercials  that in the age of YouTube  this is how it goes  It s no longer enough for companies to say   Yeah  we ve got a Super Bowl ad and we re really excited about it  You ll have to tune in to watch it   They have to tease it out  They have to  often  release it ahead of time on YouTube so that then  during the game  you can be like   Oh  there s that commercial I watched three days ago on YouTube  
Barker   Everybody come in  watch this thing now that we could watch on YouTube as well  
Hill  Yeah  and can for as long as we want  I mean  I know it doesn t look like a professional show  but can you turn your phone off at least and pretend it s a professional show 
Barker  I m trying to   laughs 
Hill   laughs  If we hadn t already  we ve now reached the end of this episode  Bill Barker   
Barker  You ll just edit that part out 
Hill  No  We re not editing out my Amazon   
Barker  Let me give you one thing that I learned while you were prattling on about something 
Hill  OK  great 
Barker  It was when you were mistakenly talking about my cross training  which is totally untrue  Because I only play racquet sports 
Hill  Yeah  but  all kidding aside    for anyone still listening    this is the truth  You compete at a national level in your racquet sport 
Barker  International level  yes 
Hill  I mean  you ve got to be in some kind of shape 
Barker  If you re in Chicago  come by  I ll be at the U S  Open in a couple of weeks  But  so  I was looking  apropos of this show    I know that when people hear the word  apropos  here  they assume that it s not going to be relevant  And yet here I go  Brian Roberts  a great squash player  played the Maccabiah Games a couple of times  the CEO of Comcast  And  looking up  he is in the Philadelphia Jewish Sports Hall of Fame  which I did not know  I did not know there was a Philadelphia Jewish Sports Hall of Fame to start with  but I m now going to spend a little time investigating 
Hill  Wait  he s a squash player 
Barker  Yes  He was  I believe  a squash player at Penn  and then still plays 
Hill  Aren t you and Brian Roberts roughly the same age  Is he a little bit older  I m just wondering if  in your time at Yale  you may have competed   
Barker  No  He s a little bit older than me 
Hill  OK  He s solidly older than you  Sports Hall of Fame  though  That s great 
Barker  Yeah   
Hill  Well  there s no more appropriate way to end this episode than petering out with some random sports tidbits 
Barker   laughs  We could talk about peanuts again  if you think that s better

218540,440056,CMCSA,Even Comcast Is Embracing Cord Cutting Now,news,"Industry disruption often happens slowly 
In video streaming  for example  Netflix  NASDAQ NFLX  was long ignored by entertainment incumbents eager to reap bumper profits from the cable ecosystem that worked so well for a generation  Time Warner s chief at one point dismissed the streaming challenger as the  Albanian army   but after years of growth inside the U S  and abroad for Netflix  the equation has changed 
Not only are a slew of new streaming services coming onto the market  including Disney  and Apple  late last year  and AT T s HBOMax and Comcast s  NASDAQ CMCSA  Peacock coming this year  but now even the country s biggest cable provider appears to see the light on streaming  
In its fourth quarter earnings report  Comcast s results and management commentary on the earnings call made clear that the company was looking forward to a future beyond its cable empire and  better yet  sees itself as a big winner in the streaming revolution  Here s why 

Cord cutting is accelerating
Investors have been talking about cord cutting for years  but the vast majority of Americans still subscribe to a traditional pay TV service  Still  the movement away from cable and satellite TV toward video streaming now seems to be accelerating  according to Comcast s latest numbers 
During the seasonally strong fourth quarter  when cable and streaming subscriptions are lifted by cold weather and the holidays driving more screen time  Comcast said it lost 133 000 residential video subscribers in the period  compared to a loss of just 19 000 in the quarter a year ago  Those losses were likely fueled by the launch of Disney  and Apple  in the quarter  as Netflix s domestic subscriber growth was unusually slow as well  However  Comcast s residential cable subscriber loss for the full year nearly doubled from 344 000 to 671 000  a sign that cord cutting momentum was picking up before the new services came online 
Comcast now sees those cable losses accelerating this year  Not only is Comcast launching its own streaming service  Peacock  but it s also shifting its video strategy as it sees video as primarily a way to add lifetime value to broadband centric subscribers  It s not chasing more price conscious customers  as CFO Michael Cavanagh explained on the call  which has led to fewer new customers  
Instead  it s counting on broadband and streaming to drive growth in the coming years 
Betting on streaming
What was even more notable from Comcast s earnings report is how bullish the company is on streaming  
Last year  Comcast introduced Flex  a set top box that give its broadband subscribers access to over 100 video and music apps to help give them a premium streaming experience even if they aren t cable subscribers   Describing the product  CEO Brian Roberts said   At Cable  we leveraged X1 to launch our newest service Flex to better serve the segment of our broadband customers that prefer streaming only  Our early results with Flex show that our customers love it  In our first month  we could not keep enough inventory in stock  and we re deploying Flex as fast as we can   The company is introducing a similar platform through Sky  the British cable service it acquired  so its European customers can enjoy the same benefits 
With a unique combination of assets  Roberts sees a bright future for Comcast in streaming  saying   So  if you include Dave s broadband business  plus Flex and Peacock  I think our company is better positioned as the world moves to streaming than any other company in the world  And I think you could argue  in the next 10 or 20 years  if you look at all those three businesses combined  we could make more money in streaming than anyone else by a lot  
Comcast  in other words  sees cord cutting as a driver of its future business  rather than a headwind as it s long been thought of  While it s not a company that investors think of as a player in the streaming industry  Comcast does have a unique position and a collection of strengths as an internet provider  a streaming device maker like Amazon or Roku  and soon a streaming service with Peacock that gives the company and investors a number of ways to get exposure to streaming 
What it means for the streaming industry
Comcast s report is the latest piece of good news for Netflix  as it shows that the transition from linear TV to internet TV is only accelerating  which will favor streaming stocks like Netflix and Roku over the coming years  as well as those looking to gain from the growth of connected TV like The Trade Desk and Telaria 
In Netflix s own earnings call earlier this week  management again sought to deflect concerns about competition from new streaming options  pointing instead to the massive opportunity coming from linear TV  When even Comcast  the nation s biggest cable company  is jumping into the streaming fray  we may be reaching the peak of this wave of disruption that has been building for a decade  With HBOMax and Peacock coming online soon  expect 2020 to be the biggest year yet for cord cutting  That s good news for streaming stocks like Netflix ",2020-01-25,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pmr9s,2067726
218541,440057,CMCSA,Comcast Gives  Cats  the Silent Treatment in a Rocky Q4 Report,news,"Media conglomerate Comcast  NASDAQ CMCSA  reported fourth quarter results on Thursday morning  The company exceeded Wall Street s expectations across the board  but the report was also studded with market by market trouble spots  Meow 
Comcast s fourth quarter results by the numbers

Data source  Comcast  GAAP   generally accepted accounting principles 
The reported year ago results were adjusted to include contributions from British broadcasting service Sky as if Comcast had acquired it on Jan  1  2017  This way  we get to look at reasonably comparable results rather than accounting for a partial quarter of Sky s revenues and operating income  as the deal was actually completed in mid October 2018 
Comcast s segment results
On that note  the Sky division s revenues rose 0 4  year over year according to the adjustments noted above  landing at  5 04 billion  EBITDA profits from this segment held steady at  765 million  The service added 77 000 subscribers during the fourth quarter  or 394 000 net new accounts across the full year  but advertising sales fell 5  due to stricter regulations on the advertising of gambling services in Italy and the U K 
Comcast s eponymous cable service lost 149 000 video subscribers while adding 442 000 broadband customers  High speed internet services accounted for  4 79 billion of top line sales  expanding its share of Comcast s total fourth quarter revenues from 14 9  two years ago to 16 9  this time 
The NBCUniversal studio posted total sales of  9 15 billion  2 6  below the year ago period s reading  The weakness was broad based with lower top line takes in nearly every sub section of this division  but theatrical content led the way with a 59  revenue drop  The star studded silver screen adaptation of the Broadway classic Cats collected just  60 million in global ticket sales on a  95 million production budget and an even larger advertising campaign  Comcast s top brass didn t mention this flop even once in the fourth quarter earnings release or conference call  Comcast would probably like us to forget about Cats  but the film clearly made a significant dent in NBCUniversal s financial results 

What s next for Comcast 
Comcast has come a long way from the pure play cable TV giant we saw just 10 years ago  The NBCUniversal buyout in 2011 was a game changer and the company is bleeding cable subscribers while adding internet accounts these days  If these trends keep up for a few more years  Comcast will become a marriage between a high speed internet service and a major movie studio that also happens to dabble in broadcasting on the side 
CEO Brian Roberts sees the writing on the wall 
 With the rate adjustments  read  price increases  that we are implementing in 2020  as well as the ongoing changes in consumer behavior  we expect higher video subscriber losses this year   Roberts said on the earnings call   Video is still valuable for us to attach to our broadband centric customer relationships  but only to the extent that it helps us increase the lifetime value of those relationships  
It s good to see Comcast s management copping to the challenges that lie ahead  2020 could be a decent year due to the upcoming Olympics coverage and the opening of a Nintendo themed theme park in Japan  That being said  I find it hard to invest in strategy overhaul concepts like Comcast s current situation and will happily watch this stock from the sidelines  There are too many better investment ideas on the market right now to make any significant bets on this patchy quilt of mismatched media businesses ",2020-01-25,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pmsbv,2067757
218542,440058,CMCSA,Comcast Thinks It Can Make More Money in Streaming Than Anyone Else,news,"Comcast  NASDAQ CMCSA  just took the wraps off its forthcoming Peacock streaming service earlier this month  and it discussed relatively modest expectations  30 million to 35 million viewers in the next five years  bringing in  6 or  7 per month a pop  for about  2 5 billion in annual revenue 
So  it was a bit curious when outgoing NBCUniversal Chairman Stephen Burke chimed in during Comcast s fourth quarter earnings call to say   We can make more money in streaming than anyone else  
Disney  NYSE DIS  and AT T  NYSE T  have much higher expectations for their flagship streaming services  Disney sees as many as 90 million global Disney  subscribers by 2024  AT T expects HBO Max to reach nearly the same level when including existing HBO subscribers  AT T expects HBO Max to generate  5 billion in incremental revenue by 2025  Not to mention  Netflix just wrapped up a year where it brought in over  20 billion in subscription revenue 
Perhaps Burke is taking a broader view of the streaming market  which seems to include providing broadband internet service in Burke s view  Still  the chairman seems to make a bad assumption about the strength of Comcast s streaming efforts and its competition 

Focusing on broadband customers
Comcast hasn t been shy about its shifting focus to provide greater value to its broadband customers  At the top of Comcast s earnings call  CEO Brian Roberts said broadband is one of the company s top areas of investment for 2020  
It s investing in faster speeds across its markets  At CES earlier this year  it introduced a new WiFi gateway to support those faster speeds  It s offering customers who take the new gateway free cybersecurity protections 
As it relates to streaming  the company made the move to offer a free Xfinity Flex set top box to its broadband only customers in September  The streaming device competes with Roku s  NASDAQ ROKU  devices and smart TVs and Amazon s Fire TV platform  Management said demand for the device among its customers was so high that it ran out of stock  and it s still trying to catch up 
Comcast added more subscribers in 2019 than in any of the past 12 years  and it expects another strong number in 2020  But it s also planning to raise its rates this year  as it adds more value to the subscription  The company can arguably justify higher rates with faster speeds  the free Flex boxes  and the inclusion of Peacock Premium in its broadband subscription  Comments from management suggest they don t expect a rate hike to have a significant negative effect on net additions 
If you consider broadband service as a key aspect of streaming  Comcast is well positioned to keep growing revenue  In fact  incremental revenue from rate hikes and customers self selecting higher speeds ought to significantly outpace Peacock s contribution  But that s a very broad definition of  making money on streaming  
Making a bad assumption about Flex and Peacock
Burke s comments about streaming seem to rely on an assumption that Comcast s Flex platform will become immensely popular  Sure  demand for Flex is extremely high  but it s also a free streaming device  Whether or not those customers actually use Flex and how much they use the devices remains to be seen 
Flex as a streaming platform is playing catch up to the big guns like Roku  Since Roku has a much broader and more engaged audience  it s become a must for any streaming service looking to reach an audience on television sets  As a result  the channel selection on Roku devices is vastly superior to the availability of services on Flex  Flex is notably missing Disney services  including Disney   Hulu  ESPN   and Disney s TV Everywhere apps  as well as several other high profile streaming services 
Meanwhile  Roku is highly focused on winning a share of the smart TV market  Management says Roku TVs account for one third of smart TVs sold in the U S  Baking Roku OS into the television itself renders devices like Flex or Roku s own devices redundant and often inferior  That s a market Comcast is unlikely to explore  which means it ll become even more challenging to convince subscribers to actually use their free Flex devices 
Burke s assumption about Flex s popularity is especially notable in his comment that Peacock represents a way for NBCUniversal to engage the growing audience of non linear television viewers  and keep 100  of the ad revenue  But if NBCU wants Peacock on the biggest streaming platforms like Roku  it ll have to give up some of its ad inventory 
On the other hand  the company seems to think media companies like Disney should give up some of their ad inventories to NBCUniversal to sell in exchange for distributing their streaming services on Flex  Burke s comments are out of alignment with Comcast s actual market power compared to its competitors in both the streaming platform and streaming content markets ",2020-01-25,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pmswi,2067767
218543,440059,CMCSA,Comcast Expects More Customers to Cut the Cord in 2020,news,"Comcast s  NASDAQ CMCSA  video subscriber losses nearly doubled in 2019  The leading cable TV provider ended the year with just 21 25 million video subscribers  down 733 000 from the end of 2018 
And management says cord cutting is going to get worse this year   We expect higher video subscriber losses this year   CFO Mike Cavanaugh stated plainly to investors during the company s fourth quarter earnings call 
That statement isn t entirely unexpected  Comcast s management previously said it s shifting its focus to more profitable video subscribers in the same way AT T  NYSE T  shifted last year  Since shifting its strategy to focus on profitable subscribers  AT T has seen millions of subscribers leave its service  Investors should expect a similar result at Comcast in 2020 

Not chasing unprofitable video customers
Comcast s legacy video service is only good for its business insofar as it increases its customer lifetime value  There s a growing segment of the market that doesn t value Comcast s video service to the point where it makes economic sense for Comcast to offer it to them  not even as an add on to a broadband internet subscription  As more and more streaming video options enter the market  that segment is getting bigger 
 We re not chasing this segment of the market   Cavanaugh said  That stands in contrast to what some of its competitors are doing  Charter Communications  NASDAQ CHTR   for instance  offers skinny bundles to its broadband subscribers in order to squeeze more revenue out of them and increase their likelihood of staying subscribed to Charter  Offering and marketing those skinny bundles may be heightened in markets where AT T has expanded its broadband efforts 
On the contrary  Comcast is raising its rates this year  That echoes the moves AT T made last year  when it raised rates across all of its video products and stopped offering big introductory discounts  Additionally  Comcast s introductory bundling discounts now reflect offers similar to AT T  about  20 off per month for 12 months 
Management already noted it s seeing fewer gross additions  Combined with its unwillingness to retain unprofitable customers and a growing segment of the market with a decreased value for the cable bundle  customer losses will surely take another step up in 2020  AT T lost 3 6 million out of 25 2 million subscribers in the 12 months ending in September  While Comcast s subscriber decline might not be as severe  it could easily top one million in 2020 
All about serving the growing market for streaming
Instead of offering broadband subscribers a bundle with video service  Comcast has shifted to focus on the growing demand for streaming video as a means to increase customer loyalty and increase revenue per subscriber 
Last year  it introduced a streaming device called Flex that its broadband only subscribers could rent for  5 per month  After a tepid response from customers  it switched to offering the device for free  and Comcast couldn t keep enough in stock 
Later this year  the company will begin offering its subscribers access to Peacock Premium  which it says is a  5 per month value  Peacock Premium provides access to additional content over the standard free Peacock offering  but it s still ad supported  
Make no mistake  though  Comcast expects the increased value these add ons provide to enable it to increase its broadband rates  Head of Comcast s Cable division Dave Watson said the company postponed planned rate increases from late 2019 to the early part of 2020  He expects to see a step up in revenue per subscriber in the first half of the year 
The success of Comcast s broadband business stands in contrast to AT T  The competitor lost about 150 000 subscribers over the past six months as it makes a similar shift to its TV business  focusing more on higher value fiber customers 
Comcast has managed to increase speeds and provide additional features and products for broadband subscribers  and those moves could stave off competition from AT T and others  That s essential as its de facto monopoly on video service erodes with the growing number of streaming video options ",2020-01-27,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pndyw,2068345

218545,440061,CMCSA,Comcast  CMCSA  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"Comcast  CMCSA  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 23  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This cable provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 76 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  18 8  
Revenues are expected to be  28 23 billion  up 1 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Comcast 
For Comcast  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 60  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Comcast will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Comcast would post earnings of  0 75 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 79  delivering a surprise of  5 33  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Comcast appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2020-01-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/comcast-cmcsa-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200499399,200499399

morning  everyone  Before we get to the results  I d like to embarrass my friend  Jason Armstrong  just for a moment and thank you for your incredible hard work these past six years as Head of Investor Relations  And on behalf of everyone at Comcast  and I believe all the investors  say thanks for a great run  and we wish you terrific success in your new role as Group Chief Financial Officer of Sky Also  I d like to welcome Marci Ryvicker  who s joining to take over Investor Relations  Marci has got a talented and successful past  and welcome to Comcast 2019 was a busy  productive and exciting year for our company  capped off by a strong fourth quarter  And we ve already jumped right into 2020 with the debut of our exciting new streaming service  Peacock  As you heard last week  it s a truly differentiated approach to streaming that leverages capabilities from all across our company As we look to the future  I am confident that the company we have built has all the necessary components to succeed  And our guiding principles remain the same  be leaders in our markets  continuously improve our products and experiences  and build deep  highly valuable  recurring customer relationships  Our world class teams are executing and operating at a high level  all of which allows us to invest in our businesses and deliver consistent results The success of our strategy is demonstrated in our consolidated financial performance  We delivered another year of terrific results with growth in pro forma EBITDA of 5 9   record free cash flow generation of  13 4 billion  growth in adjusted EPS of 14 7   the 10th year of double digit growth in the last 11 years  These results were driven by Cable  as the team s successful pivot to a connectivity centric strategy and investment in xFi continue to pay off Cable delivered broadband net additions of 1 4 million  the best in the last 12 years  finishing off with an exceptional fourth quarter  which included 442 000 net additions  a 26  increase over the prior year  In addition  we continue to reap the benefits from our ongoing investments to improve the customer experience  setting all time bests for many key metrics  including agent contact rate and first call resolution  We are increasing customer satisfaction and driving unnecessary costs out of the business  All in  this drove 1 1 million net customer relationship additions in 2019  our best year on record  as well as outstanding EBITDA growth of 7 3  and net cash flow growth of 18  for the full year  Thank you  Dave Watson and your incredible team  You re doing a phenomenal job At NBC  our content continues to resonate with consumers  We were the most watched media company in the US in 2019  NBC ended the 52 week season at Number 1 in the key demo for the sixth consecutive year and Telemundo was Number 1 for the third straight year in weekday prime  Our film business grew EBITDA by double digits to  833 million  making it the third most profitable year in Universal s history  providing further evidence that our strategic slate approach is working  At Theme Parks  we had a challenging fourth quarter  But overall  it was a solid year during a particularly competitive period  and we are looking forward to new attractions and parks to drive growth in the coming years In its first full year as part of Comcast  despite difficult European market conditions  Sky had a good year under Jeremy Darroch and his team  delivering healthy customer additions and 12  EBITDA growth on a constant currency basis  Our exclusive sports and award winning original content are resonating with our customers in Europe with viewership up year over year  Sky has been a great addition to Comcast and positions us to better compete in a world where global scale matters As I mentioned at the outset  we have all the pieces in place for long term success  True to our guiding principles  in 2020  we are leaning into investments that further improve our products and experiences across the Company  First  we ll continue to strengthen our already leading position in broadband  At Cable  we are launching our fastest gateway  delivering true multi gig speeds with unprecedented Wi Fi range  And we re providing our customers with added protection by offering new features like xFi Advanced Security for free  At SKY  we are building on our success in broadband in the UK and Cable s continued success with xFi in the US to launch broadband in Italy this year Second  we will focus on the emerging growth areas of streaming and content aggregation by launching Peacock and accelerating our deployment of Flex and Sky Q  Consumers are watching more and more video  driven by growth in streaming  And as we highlighted last week  we believe that Peacock  a premium ad supported service  hits the mark for both consumers and advertisers  In this app driven world  consumers increasingly are overwhelmed by content fragmentation and endless scrolling  So with X1 and Sky Q  we enable our customers to aggregate all their apps and linear channels under TV and seamlessly search  access and view all their content At Cable  we leveraged X1 to launch our newest service Flex to better serve the segment of our broadband customers that prefer streaming only  Our early results with Flex show that our customers love it  In our first month  we could not keep enough inventory in stock  and we re deploying Flex as fast as we can  Based on the proven success we had with X1 in the United States  at Sky  we are now accelerating the deployment of Sky Q  getting to X1 like penetration levels as quickly as possible  This is good for our customers and generates very attractive financial returns Finally  we have some exciting new investments in our park business  This year  we will open Super Nintendo World in Japan with launches in the US to follow in the coming years  Super Nintendo World combines one of a kind ride technology with iconic IP for a remarkable guest experience  And we believe it has the potential to drive substantial incremental attendance at Universal Studios Japan  On top of that  we are also investing for long term growth with two amazing brand new parks  We ll open in Beijing in 2021  the largest park we have ever built and have started construction on Universal s Epic Universe  a new world class park in Orlando  opening in 2023  The parks business is set up for growth for years to come The scale  capabilities and talent across our company enable us to successfully execute our long term growth strategy  while also strengthening our balance sheet and returning capital to shareholders  Earlier this morning  we announced that we are raising our dividend by  0 08 for 2020  up 10  over the prior year  and our 12th consecutive annual increase Before I hand the call over to Mike  I want to take a moment to personally recognized Steve Burke  whose contributions have been instrumental in shaping not only my career  but the company that we are today  It s impossible for me to overstate what a terrific partner Steve has been  His leadership  first to Comcast Cable and later to NBCUniversal  have been a critical component of our company s growth and success  And maybe even more significantly  his impact on our culture and personal integrity have been truly defining  Steve has built a great team at NBCUniversal  led by Jeff Shell  and I know we are in good hands going forward  Thank you  Steve Mike  over to you Michael J  Cavanagh    Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThanks Brian  and good morning  everyone  I ll begin by reviewing our consolidated results on Slides 4 and 5  As a reminder  we completed our acquisition of Sky in the fourth quarter of 2018  Our reported results include Sky from the acquisition date  while pro forma results are as if the Sky transaction had occurred on January 1  2017 Revenue increased 2  to  28 4 billion on a reported basis and was consistent with the prior year on a pro forma basis for the fourth quarter  For the full year  revenue increased 15  to  108 9 billion on a reported basis and was consistent with the prior year on a pro forma basis  Adjusted EBITDA increased 3  to  8 4 billion on a reported basis and 2 1  on a pro forma basis for the fourth quarter and increased 14  to  34 3 billion on a reported basis and 5 9  on a pro forma basis for the full year  Adjusted earnings per share increased 9 7  to  0 79 for the quarter and 15  to  3 13 for the year  Finally  free cash flow was  2 5 billion in the quarter and  13 4 billion for the full year Now  let s turn to our segment results  starting with Cable Communications on Slide 6  For the full year  Cable revenue increased 3 7   EBITDA increased 7 3  and net cash flow increased 18   Total customer relationships grew by 1 1 million to 31 5 million  an increase of 3 7  year over year  On a per relationship basis  EBITDA grew 3 5  and net cash flow grew 14  For the fourth quarter  Cable revenue increased 2 6  to  14 8 billion  EBITDA increased 5 4  to  5 9 billion and net cash flow increased 13  to  3 3 billion  We generated 372 000 customer relationship net additions in the quarter  a record for any quarter  These results reflect our commitment to innovation  execution and driving profitable growth  including our continued focus on our high margin connectivity businesses  residential high speed Internet and business services  Together  residential and business services generated 442 000 broadband customer net additions in the quarter and 1 4 million net additions for the full year In fact  on the residential side of the business  high speed Internet revenue was the largest contributor to year over year growth at Cable  growing 8 8  in the fourth quarter and 9 4  for the full year  We believe that our consistent and ongoing investment to extend our leadership in broadband through speed  coverage  control and now streaming  as well as through security and privacy is unique among our competitors and across the industry  We will continue to benefit from the growth in the overall market for broadband  and we are taking share with a superior product On the business services side  revenue increased 8 8  to  2 billion in the fourth quarter  driven by a 4 1  increase in business customers year over year and a 4 3  increase in revenue per business customer  as we ve added new products  including WiFi Pro and Security Edge  We ended the year at nearly  8 billion in business services revenue with an addressable market  just in our footprint  of approximately  50 billion  There is no shortage of new customers or additional revenue for us to capture in this margin accretive growth business  In 2020  we expect to deliver another year of well over  2 billion in highly margin accretive revenue growth in residential broadband and business services on top of the  26 5 billion in revenue that we generated from these businesses in 2019 Turning to video  video is still valuable for us to attach to our broadband centric customer relationships  but only to the extent that it helps us increase the lifetime value of those relationships  We ve consistently said that there is a segment of the market that either doesn t value a traditional pay TV service or isn t profitable for us to serve  We re not chasing this segment of the market  and we saw fewer new connects with these customers  With the rate adjustments that we are implementing in 2020  as well as the ongoing changes in consumer behavior  we expect higher video subscriber losses this year  Within this environment  our X1 platform enables us to compete well for customers who want the most content and a premium experience  including their favorite streaming apps  And now with Flex  we re able to better serve the customer segment that prefers to stream over the top  and we are prioritizing Flex as a key initiative in 2020 Moving on to our wireless business  we continue to be happy with what we re seeing with Xfinity Mobile and its positive impact on the Cable business  We launched Xfinity Mobile 2 5 years ago  and we ended 2019 with more than 2 million lines  including the 261 000 net adds in the fourth quarter  We are pleased with the acceleration in net adds in the fourth quarter  and we expect this momentum to continue in 2020  Our results to date indicate that adding mobile improves broadband customer retention and increases prospective customers  consideration  And importantly  we continue to see a significant improvement in the financial performance at Xfinity Mobile  We reduced our quarterly adjusted EBITDA losses at Xfinity Mobile to  116 million  a 40  improvement compared to last year s fourth quarter  And we expect Xfinity Mobile to be EBITDA positive for the full year in 2021 And finally  advertising revenue in the quarter decreased 19 1  due to a comparison to record political spending in the prior year period  Excluding political  advertising revenue in the fourth quarter was consistent with the same period last year Moving now to Cable expense and margin on Slide 7  Total Cable expenses in the fourth quarter were relatively consistent with the prior year despite a record growth in customer relationships  as we continued to benefit from cost management  our connectivity centric strategy and a lack of programming renewals  On a per customer relationship basis  non programming opex decreased 1 9  compared to the same period last year  We re clearly seeing the benefits of our ongoing focus on operational improvements as we continue to make progress in providing a better overall experience and eliminating unnecessary activity and transactions  including through digital service tools  On a full year basis  non programming opex per relationship improved by 2   and we expect continued improvement in 2020 Cable EBITDA margins were 39 8  in the fourth quarter of 2019  up 100 basis points year over year  and 40 1  for the full year  up 140 basis points  For 2020  we expect higher programming expense growth due to a number of contracts scheduled for renewal during the year  with the increase in expense back half weighted  Despite this  we expect to improve Cable EBITDA margin by up to 50 basis points for the full year  benefiting from growth in our high margin connectivity businesses  continued operational improvements  better performance at Xfinity Mobile  as well as higher political advertising revenue We re also pleased with the efficiency of and returns on our Cable capital expenditure  Capex decreased 10 5  to  6 9 billion for the full year  resulting in capex intensity of 11 9   190 basis points of year over year improvement  Looking ahead  we ll continue to invest in the business to extend our leading market position  However  based on the size and consistency of our past investment and our leading scale  we can continue to improve our capital intensity  In 2020  we expect approximately 50 basis points of year over year improvement  reflecting continued decreases in video centric CPE spending  partially offset by an increase in the level of investment in our network  consistent with the broader shift in our business toward connectivity  These are demand driven and success based investments  and we re happy to make them In summary  we feel great about Cable s results in 2019  and we re confident that the business will continue to deliver healthy growth in 2020 Now  I ll turn to NBCUniversal s results on Slide 8  NBCUniversal s revenue declined 2 6  to  9 2 billion and EBITDA declined 4 7  to  2 billion in the quarter  Cable Networks  revenue increased 1 2  to  2 9 billion and EBITDA declined 1 4  to  1 billion in the fourth quarter  as solid growth in advertising and content licensing and other revenue was more than offset by higher programming and production costs and subscriber declines  Advertising revenue increased 2   benefiting from the timing of returning series  Golf Presidents Cup  and improved MSNBC performance  Content licensing and other revenue increased 3 4   reflecting continued timing related licensing comparisons to last year  which was more than offset by the performance of some of our digital businesses  Distribution revenue was flat year over year  as the ongoing benefits of previous renewal agreements were largely offset by subscriber losses that modestly accelerated in the quarter  Against the backdrop of continued subscriber declines  it will be tough to grow affiliate revenue until our next round of renewals  starting in 2021  Overall  higher revenue in the quarter was more than offset by increased expenses  primarily driven by the timing of programming and a couple of new sports contracts that will continue to impact our first half 2020 result Broadcast revenue increased 2 1  to  3 2 billion and EBITDA increased 14  to  471 million  driven by growth in retrans and content licensing  partially offset by lower advertising revenue  Advertising revenue declined 1 5   largely reflecting a difficult comparison to record political advertising last year  Adjusting for this comparison  advertising would have been up low single digits  reflecting strong NFL results and the benefits of higher upfront pricing  partially offset by ratings declines Retrans increased over 10  to nearly  500 million  bringing the full year total to  2 billion  up about 15  compared to 2018  Content licensing increased 5 8   reflecting the delivery of content under our existing licensing agreements  as well as new licensing deals  Last  we expect to benefit from a profitable Tokyo Olympics this summer and anticipate robust political advertising in the back half of the year Turning to film  revenue declined 21  to  1 6 billion and EBITDA declined by  88 million to  91 million  reflecting a tough comparison to the size and timing of our slate in the fourth quarter of 2018  which included the successful releases of Grinch and Halloween  Overall  we had a great year in film  highlighted by key franchise animated hits including DreamWorks  How to Train Your Dragon  The Hidden World and Secret Life of Pets 2  the summer spin off of our tent pole Fast and Furious franchise  Hobbs   Shaw  successful original movies such as Glass and Us  as well as Downton Abbey  which was Focus Features  top title of all time  For the full year  film EBITDA increased 14  to  833 million Looking ahead to 2020  we are excited about our film business and outlook for growth  underscored by a continuation of our strategic slate strategy  Keep in mind  the first quarter will have a tough comparison to the release of How to Train Your Dragon  but we have several exciting films opening later this year  including more animated franchise titles with Trolls World Tour this spring  Minions 2 this summer and Croods 2 at the end of the year  along with another summer installment in the Fast and Furious franchise Wrapping up the TV and film segments  we are confident and optimistic in our ability to continue monetizing our vast portfolio of new and existing premium content  As we ve said before  we will sponsor a broad and varied distribution environment by continuing to license to third parties when it makes sense and NBCUniversal would benefit from selling to new buyers of content  including our very own Peacock  As we discussed at our investor event last week  we believe that Peacock will be a fantastic product for consumers and advertisers alike and a new channel to better monetize our content Theme Parks revenue increased 3 2  to  1 6 billion and EBITDA declined 4 5  to  636 million  reflecting steady results at our domestic parks  offset by some softness at our Japan park  Looking ahead  we remain confident in our outlook for growth in the parks business  which will benefit from our robust pipeline of new attractions  At our domestic parks  we ll have a new Jason Bourne themed live action stunt show and over 2 000 hotel rooms coming online in Orlando this year  as well as a Secret Life of Pets themed ride in Hollywood  And we re especially excited for the opening of Super Nintendo World at Universal Studios in Japan  which will be open and ready during the summer  coinciding nicely with the Tokyo Olympics  Pre opening expenses for this new land in Japan will weigh on results in the first half of 2020  but we expect Super Nintendo World to be a meaningful driver of our parks results in the second half We re also looking forward to the opening of our park in Beijing in 2021  which will be a major milestone for us  And we ll see some pre opening expenses throughout this year  Even longer term  we re excited for Epic Universe  which will transform our already successful Orlando park Now  let s move on to Sky results on Slide 9  As a reminder  I will be referring to our pro forma results as if the Sky transaction has occurred on January 1  2017  and growth rates on a constant currency basis  consistent with what s reflected in our earnings release Sky revenue increased 1 4  to  5 billion  as growth in direct to consumer and content revenue was offset by lower advertising  Overall  macro headwinds have persisted  but Sky continues to perform well in a challenging environment  Direct to consumer revenue increased by 2 3  to  4 billion  driven by growth in customer relationships  Sky added 77 000 customers during the quarter  ending the year with 24 million total customer relationships  and average revenue per customer remained stable  As expected  we delivered improvement in net adds compared to the third quarter  Sky delivered customer growth in all three territories in the fourth quarter and continued to make good progress in growing key products  including broadband and mobile Content revenue grew by 2 7  to  371 million with growth driven by the wholesaling of programming  Importantly  viewership on Sky channels was impressive  In the fourth quarter  total viewership on Sky s branded channels was up 5   while total TV viewership on non Sky channels was flat  Viewership across Sky Sports channels was up 8   driven by the performance of Formula One in Italy and the Premier League in the UK  On advertising  the market remained soft across all of our territories  reflecting continued macro weakness  as well as the impact of a change in legislation related to gambling advertising in the UK and Italy  which began impacting our results in 3Q  19  Against this backdrop  advertising revenue in the quarter declined by 4 1  to  647 million Sky s fourth quarter EBITDA of  765 million was consistent with the prior year  as revenue growth was offset by higher costs  in part driven by our efforts to accelerate the deployment of Sky Q  In 2020  we ll continue the accelerated deployment  and we are coming out of the gate quickly  As a reminder  like X1  Sky Q enables the aggregation of streaming apps and other advanced features  functionality that s not available on our legacy platform  Our Sky Q customers have higher viewership  better retention levels  better product attachment and higher ARPU  and therefore we want more of our customers to have it and quickly We re pleased with the progress Sky is making by delivering growth in customer relationships and creating award winning popular content  We expect these tailwinds to continue in 2020  but keep in mind  we also expect our results will continue to be impacted by the challenging macroeconomic environment and changes in gambling legislation All in  before the few hundred  Phonetic  million dollars of investment we ve previously outlined for Sky Q and broadband in Italy and using today s foreign exchange rates  we expect Sky s 2020 EBITDA to be consistent with our reported 2019 results I ll wrap up with free cash flow and capital allocation on Slide 10  We generated record  13 4 billion in free cash flow and paid  3 7 billion in dividends to our shareholders in 2019  We also made great progress in deleveraging  ending the year at 2 8 times net leverage  down from 3 3 times at the end of 2018  Deleveraging will remain a top focus for us in 2020  which we will balance with the key investment priorities we have outlined across Cable  NBCUniversal and Sky On return of capital  as Brian mentioned  we raised our dividend by  0 08 to  0 92 a share  a 10  increase  marking our 12th consecutive annual increase  And in 2021  we expect that we will be well positioned to resume share repurchases In summary  2019 was another fantastic year for Comcast  and the fundamentals of our business remain strong  We feel good about our outlook for 2020 and expect our overall performance to accelerate through the year Jason  over to you Jason S  Armstrong    Senior Vice President  Investor Relations and FinanceThanks Mike  Let s open up the call for Q A  please Questions and Answers Operator Operator Instructions  Our first question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley  Please go ahead Ben Swinburne    Morgan Stanley    AnalystThanks  Good morning  Two questions  Brian  you mentioned in your prepared remarks sort of the benefits of global scale across the Company  and I think there s certainly a debate in the market about that a bit  So I was curious if you could sort of touch on it in two ways  One  how does this scale allow Comcast to grow faster over time  Obviously  we ve seen some very strong results across the Company recently  but I d love to get more thoughts from you on how that plays out  And secondly  how do you assess sort of the optimal level of scale  I m sure there s a lot of interest from shareholders about where you think about future acquisition opportunities or how you think about deploying capital longer term And then  when you think about that  Mike  you mentioned some comments about free cash flow at a conference last year  Comcast delivers pretty consistent double digit earnings growth and you ve raised the dividend consistently double digits  Should free cash flow over time generally follow earnings and the overall dividend growth  Because obviously  you guys are in a pretty heavy investment year this year  and I think people are obviously interested in the free cash flow profile over time  Thank you  both Brian L  Roberts    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWell  let me begin    thank you  Ben  I do think we have consistent growth across all parts of the business  Sky was a unique asset  and I don t want to look backwards more than just for a moment here to your question  And I think it happened    I m really thrilled we bought it  I feel better about that decision today  The nature of our company  we displayed the great technical team at the Peacock Day  the ability for Cable to help with broadband  Jason going over to be CFO  the gentleman running Germany  Devesh was our Head of Strategy  It s    we re a better company  And it s    there is    it s a longer conversation  happy to have it But I think the essence of your question  if I might  might be  well  do you feel you have to go to other countries and what are you thinking about  And one of the points we tried to make throughout this year is that if you take the four countries  US plus the three principal    UK  Germany and Italy where Sky principally operates  that represents 50  of the world s broadband and video revenues  and that s pretty extraordinary  So our strategy with now 60 million or 55 million or so relationships and growing those relationships  and we had a great year in growing customer relationships with a terrific ARPU  north of  100  these are exceptional opportunities  So I don t want to say we won t look at other things and consider other things  but it s    there was nothing quite like Sky was unique  Mike Michael J  Cavanagh    Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSo Ben  on free cash flow  it s certainly our stated objective and belief that we can healthy    get healthy growth of free cash flow over the long term  I ve said that before  the recent conference  and continue to believe that s the case  We don t focus on it in the near term  And this year coming up  obviously  we talked about the many investments in organic growth that will benefit that long term free cash flow growth trajectory  So we ll have that pressure in some Olympics working capital in 2020  But the dividend increase is absolutely an indication that we feel very confident in the long term growth trajectory of free cash flow Ben Swinburne    Morgan Stanley    AnalystThank you  both Jason S  Armstrong    Senior Vice President  Investor Relations and FinanceThanks Ben  Next question  please OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Doug Mitchelson with Credit Suisse  Please go ahead Doug Mitchelson    Credit Suisse    AnalystThank you so much  I wanted to focus on streaming  so both Flex and Peacock  For Mike or Dave with    Mike  you talked about prioritizing Flex in 2020  Sort of what specifically does that mean  And for you both  what s your vision as to what that service will look like in a few years  And I guess  I m thinking not just everything that you bring to bear  but also third party apps and how they re authenticated  integrated into Flex as well And then for Steve  on Peacock  I think the Peacock Analyst Day was well received  but I m getting the question a lot as to what the difference will be between the premium and free tiers  And I m also getting the question that if it s free  what would the friction be signing up other distributors other than Cox  Phonetic   Thank you all David N  Watson    President and Chief Executive Officer  Comcast Cable CommunicationsHey  Doug  this is Dave  So let me start with Flex  And I think Flex shows  and in particular the Flex and Peacock combination just shows how uniquely positioned we are for streaming  And Flex is a natural extension of two things  our broadband innovation and also the fact that we ve been investing steadily in X1  So we re    Flex is going to help fuel broadband over time  comes with    it s free as Brian has said  And we ll continue to innovate around broadband  So you look at what s coming up  and we have tons of apps that are available right now  We re pleased with the road map ahead  good progress coming up for Flex in terms of content  Hulu  We ve talked about CBS All Access  We ll be the first to do that  But in particular  we re really excited about the prospects of Flex and Peacock together  So that is  I think  a real opportunity  In addition  down the road  of course  the main consideration is broadband growth with Flex  But I think it opens up other opportunities  whether it s app participation or    and or advertising  It s a great long term platform for us Brian L  Roberts    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSo  if you include Dave s broadband business  plus Flex and Peacock  I think our company is better positioned as the world moves to streaming than any other company in the world  And I think you could argue  in the next 10 or 20 years  if you look at all those three businesses combined  we could make more money in streaming than anyone else by a lot  If you then move to Peacock  the idea behind Peacock    and Matt Strauss mentioned Spotify  it s a little bit like Spotify  We have an entry level of Peacock  which is about 7 500 hours  which is completely free for anyone  We then have a 15 000 hour version of Peacock that costs  5 if you re not a member of a participating cable or satellite company that provides multi channel video  That universe is still about 80   So 80  of the people in America I think eventually are going to be able to get that  5 product for free As to your question about other cable companies and satellite companies  it s such a great value to be able to give all of your customers a product that s  5 a month in value or  60 a year for free that I think eventually we will get the vast majority  if not all  of cable and satellite  It will take some time  And a lot of times  the Peacock discussion will be tied to the ongoing MVPD discussion  and we have a lot of big deals up in this year  But I think by the end of this year  you re going to see the  5 Peacock product be offered for free to a lot of cable and satellite customers Doug Mitchelson    Credit Suisse    AnalystThank you  both Jason S  Armstrong    Senior Vice President  Investor Relations and FinanceThank you  Doug  Next question  please OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Jessica Ehrlich with Bank of America  Please go ahead Jessica Ehrlich    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystThanks  I have  I guess  three questions for the three divisions  On Peacock  can you talk a little bit about how you see    what will the impact be on your legacy businesses  including TV stations  cable networks and  I guess  other Comcast businesses  Going back to Flex  it s such an interesting product  You re keeping customers engaged on the Comcast platform  Can you talk about    a little bit more detail about what the benefits would be for    it seems like there might be benefits for advertising as well as other parts of your business  And then on Sky  this  300 million or so step up in investment  can you talk about how that will drive growth in the various businesses in 2020 and beyond  If there s anything more specific you could say about growth  that would be great Michael J  Cavanagh    Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerLet me start with Peacock s effect on the other businesses  If you imagine a television show where 70  of the viewing comes from some place other than linear television  what Peacock is designed to do is to go after that 70   get it on our platform in a place where we re ad supported and we get 100  of the ad revenue  That s the intent  And if you look at it from that perspective  I think Peacock is going to be very good for our company  We re going to make more money from the television ecosystem  and that will allow us to continue to invest in the linear platform  So if I were talking to an affiliate  if I were talking to a cable company  I would say Peacock is a way to make us a better  stronger competitor in a way that s good for all of our businesses  not just streaming Brian L  Roberts    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSo  in regards to Flex  Jessica  the    it starts with our strategy  and I think it gives us real choice in the marketplace  And we will continue to compete  I think  very well for the many segments that value X1 and everything that that brings  but for this growing streaming segment  it really positions us well  the great proposition being able to use all the attributes of X1  the voice capability  the integrated data  being able to find what you want very quickly  So in terms of the drivers  your point is a good one  You look at the first one is going to help us compete    continue to do well with broadband  So we re going to look at broadband share growth  and Flex will be part of that  one of several things that we re doing  You do look at additional revenue opportunities  whether it s everything from the    when we sell an app on this platform  we participate in that economically  there is going to be  I think  long term a platform  You can think about advertising  And in addition  there s syndication  We have great partners that we have with X1  And I would anticipate that we ll continue to make progress in syndication with Flex with these partners  So I think it s    we will use it as a growth platform  primarily focused on broadband  but we ll be opportunistic going forward in these other areas  Jeremy Jeremy Darroch    Group Chief Executive  SkyYeah  sorry  And then on Sky  the investments we re making here  so Sky Q  we think that s the best TV service here in Europe  So we want to accelerate its penetration in our base  We re actually pulling costs forward really  rather than spending additional costs  pulling costs forward in our plan to get Sky Q penetration up more quickly  The benefits really are twofold  The short term benefits are sort of  Phonetic  purely financial really  As Mike alluded to  we see lower churn  higher viewing  higher ARPU  And of course  as we sell Sky Q into our customer base  it gives us the opportunity to cross sell another product or more products in the point at which we do that  And then the second thing to say is  we have Sky Q in the base for some  Technical Issues  good line of sight in terms of the financial returns that flow from those investments  And while the number aggregates  it s all customer by customer  So if you don t get a customer  the    if you don t get the benefits  you don t spend the cost upfront  if you see what I mean The second one that is broadband in Italy  obviously that s a big new adjacent category for us  about  7 billion market in Italy  We ve got a very strong incredible brand  we know that  in Italy to step into the broadband market  I think we ve got all of the skills that we need across the Company to be able to do that for the longer term investment profile  although a very strong one  again given that it s a new category  And then beyond that  I think the real benefit  as we ve seen here in the UK  is that s a business that we think we can grow to significant scale over time  It was probably the single biggest thing we did in the UK to step change our business growth in the UK  So I think the tale of growth we ll see from broadband and the ability for broadband to reset the size of our business in Italy is pretty strong And then the final thing I d say  just operating in Europe  one of the great things about being part of the broader Comcast Group  from my point of view  is of course  we can keep our foot on the gas and accelerate these investments  while we see strong returns profiles at a time when many in Europe are probably being a bit more cautious in a more challenging consumer environment  So I think this is a good example of how  as part of the broader group  we can really think about the medium term returns from Sky and drive those hard  And we ll see those benefits progressively come through in 2020 and then into 2021 Jessica Ehrlich    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystThank you Jason S  Armstrong    Senior Vice President  Investor Relations and FinanceThank you  Jessica  Next question  please OperatorYour next question comes from the line of John Hodulik with UBS  Please go ahead John Hodulik    UBS    AnalystGreat  thanks  Maybe some questions for Dave  Dave  you ve had some solid results this quarter and this year in your connectivity business  So maybe first starting with broadband  the 1 4 million subs accelerated second time in a row on a year over year basis  Is that a decent number for 2020  And can you talk a little bit about the pricing power that you may have in that business  given the deceleration we re seeing in high speed data revenues  And then over in wireless  again  another solid quarter  You talked about momentum continuing into  20  What s driving the growth there  Is it improved distribution  Is at handset availability  I think your pricing has been the same  but the sub numbers continue to beat our view  So some commentary there would be great too  Thanks David N  Watson    President and Chief Executive Officer  Comcast Cable CommunicationsWell  thanks  John  And I won t give specifics in regards to  20  but we d say that the 1 4 million does demonstrate just consistency  broad based growth  strength across our entire area when it comes to broadband  So pleased with the quarter  pleased with the year  and pleased with momentum going forward  So  yeah  it starts with    we re going to grow relationships with broadband  This is our top priority  It s what we focus on when it comes to innovation  I talked about Flex  that we have many other examples of innovation  including the advanced security product that we are rolling out for free to those that lease our gateway device  Another example of that  speed increases we continue to do  So  very  very focused  We wake up every day thinking about how are we going to grow and sustain broadband  And so    and it s working  I think xFi  when you combine the best of speed  the best of control  coverage    Brian mentioned a great new gateway device  We re leading in regards to the gateway devices that are in the marketplace  We feel  in terms of the combination of speed  Wi Fi speed and Wi Fi coverage  and combine that with the pods that we have in the marketplace  so all these things I think position us well going forward So our game plan is to continue to lead with broadband  I think it is very sustainable  You look at the macro conditions  the marketplace is growing  Penetration  we have upside  And we re taking share  And we re balancing this share growth with a strong financial performance  For the year  we re pleased  One point in terms of the quarter to quarter revenue performance  just to make sure there are some context there  that we did move out a couple of rate increases off Q4 into the early part of 2020  So you can look    on a go forward basis  I think you re going to see good strong runway for growth in share  growth in revenue on a per subscriber basis and for the whole category  So we re pleased with our momentum going forward And wireless  I would say the keys there are a little bit of maturity  We talked about the reasons why we re doing it  We re real pleased with broadband retention  The area that s beginning to pick up that we re really pleased  that we wanted to focus on is just growing consideration using wireless because I think it does help broadband  But getting people into retail stores  they didn t really think about doing that before  beginning to see real traction in retail  Most certainly  when you see a solid product introduction like Apple that they had in other wireless devices  I think we benefit  We re in a good position for bring your own device  I think we re uniquely positioned in the ability to have a combination of unlimited and by the gig pricing  So you add all those things up and we re really pleased with our overall wireless momentum as well John Hodulik    UBS    AnalystOkay  Thanks Dave Jason S  Armstrong    Senior Vice President  Investor Relations and FinanceThank you  John  Next question  please OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs  Please go ahead Brett Feldman    Goldman Sachs    AnalystYeah  thanks  Actually  I m going to follow up here on wireless  Two questions  One  the big national operators are going to increasingly making 5G a part of their marketing throughout the year  I m interested if you can give us some context on how you re thinking about the 5G opportunity for your mobile business  And then obviously  the line is that you have to EBITDA break even next year is a key milestone  How do you think about maybe improving the profit profile of your wireless business even more from there  So for example  how much of a priority  if at all  is it to get better MVNO terms or find more MVNO vendors  And then you re going to have a few mid band spectrum auctions coming up over the next couple of months and into next year  Are you interested in maybe looking to acquire spectrum to see if you can bring traffic onto your own infrastructure  Thank you Brian L  Roberts    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWell  thanks  Brett  So  in regards to 5G  one of the great things about our existing relationship that we have with our partner that we have    we will participate in 5G mobile as that market matures and they start rolling it out in earnest  So we re    I think we ll be right there  and we ll evaluate that as it goes In regards to economics  we talked about    we re right on track with the profitability trajectory that we talked about  So we re absolutely pulling off what we thought we would in regards to the economics  And what I would say  we re always going to be opportunistic when it comes to either a combination of the ability to do more with Wi Fi and the LTE network and manage traffic flow between the two  we ll always be looking at that  We ll be opportunistic on any spectrum opportunity  But we like our capital light MVNO approach today  It s accomplishing what we need to  We ll always be talking to our partner about opportunities  but I think we re in a really good position going forward Brett Feldman    Goldman Sachs    AnalystThank you Jason S  Armstrong    Senior Vice President  Investor Relations and FinanceThank you  Brett  Next question  please OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Phil Cusick with J P  Morgan  Please go ahead Phil Cusick    J P  Morgan    AnalystHey  guys  thanks  Cable EBITDA margin guide of 50 basis points growth is similar to what you said a year ago  and it came in nearly 3 times that level  If I think about your price increase  which is similar to last year  and the trajectory of declining mobile losses  it seems like this is fairly conservative  How should we think about  programming is a headwind this year and next  or anything else going on  And then second  if I can  in parks  can you talk about the environment for customer traffic overall and any feel for share shift  And if we look forward to those new gates and parks in the next few years  what should we think about for the cadence of both capex and revenue  Thank you Brian L  Roberts    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerPhil  I ll start it off  As Mike mentioned earlier  as expected  we re going to have a number of programming renewals in 2020  So we had a couple of years where it was a lower number  and that is picking up in 2020  and in particular  it will ramp more toward the back half of 2020  So despite that  the part    even with that  we expect to improve Cable margins up to the 50 basis points that Mike talked about for the full year  And the strategy and the expectations are built around our focus on the connectivity businesses  which are margin accretive  We re going to continue to drive that  That pivot has happened  and we re making great progress there  We re going to continue to focus on the non programming opex  We re going to be taking a lot of transactions out  whether they re truck rolls or telephone calls  the customer experience improvements  There s a big runway ahead for us to continue to take out those transactions  We re always going to be disciplined on cost control  And I think you look at what we ve talked about earlier  Xfinity Mobile  economic improvement  if you look  there s going to be a pretty big year for political advertising in the tail end of this year  All those things considered  I think  put us in a pretty good position to overcome whatever programming renewals that are going to occur in 2020 Stephen B  Burke    Chief Executive Officer  NBCUniversalSo regarding parks  if you look over the last five years  our EBITDA  our OCF in the park business has almost exactly doubled to about  2 5 billion  Parks were about a third of NBCUniversal  30  of NBCUniversal  And when you have that kind of growth  you re used to parks being a driver of the overall NBCUniversal growth profile  which they were not this quarter  A big part of it  and Mike mentioned this in his introduction  was Japan where we faced a number of headwinds and actually went backwards If you look out  I think the next big thing on the horizon is Nintendo  Nintendo  based on our research  is one of the biggest potential drivers of attendance that you could have of any kind of IP  It s up there with Harry Potter  which    in some of our parks  Harry potter drove incremental attendance of about 2 million people  So Nintendo is in very rarefied air  And the attraction that we re building in Osaka is spectacular From a creative standpoint  it s really unbelievable  And that opens sometime midyear this year in Osaka  and then we re going to bring it to Hollywood and we re going to bring it  obviously  in the fourth gate in Florida  So I think Nintendo is going to be potentially a big accelerator of growth in the Theme Park business  And then once you get into 2021    we haven t talked about it maybe as much as we should  The fact that we re opening a park in Beijing and the fact that the park is so spectacular from a design and creative standpoint  I think is going to generate a lot of growth  And then  Brian mentioned in his introduction the fourth gate  which opens in 2023 So when you look at the capital side of it  these are all high return projects that are all    all make a ton of business sense  And I think if you look over the next five years  it s likely our Theme Park business is going to be a driver of growth  Maybe not quite as much as it has been in the last five years because the growth has been so phenomenal  and we re getting to a bigger base now  But I would look at the parks business as a real opportunity for us  We still don t have the share that I think we deserve  given the quality of the experience we re giving our guests  and there s a lot of opportunity over the next five  10  20 years Phil Cusick    J P  Morgan    AnalystThank you Jason S  Armstrong    Senior Vice President  Investor Relations and FinanceThank you  Phil  Next question  please OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson  Please go ahead Craig Moffett    MoffettNathanson    AnalystHi  I wonder if I could return to the wireless business for a second  With AT T having potentially opened the door to at least have a discussion about MVNO terms  can you just talk about what that process is like  Are you engaged in discussions with other potential MVNO suppliers  And have any of the discussions with any of the wireless operators expanded to ways that they might leverage your wired infrastructure So as you think about how your wired infrastructure sort of brings value to wireless  there are all different ways you could do it  whether it s capitalizing yourself through retail or doing something at a wholesale level or using it to get better terms with your MVNO  Just how do you think about those opportunities David N  Watson    President and Chief Executive Officer  Comcast Cable CommunicationsHey  Craig  So I think it starts with    that our very strong feeling that we are    the cable industry  Comcast  we re a great partner for the wireless industry  So I think we bring share  We bring customers over to them  I think we re a great investment for the long term  So that s kind of how we start our thinking and that    with all the goals that I mentioned before  From a process perspective  not much to talk about right now  We are always thinking about ways of improving an already good platform  a good approach to the business  If there are opportunities  we ll explore them  And if anything does develop  we ll let you know Brian L  Roberts    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  The only thing I want to add to that is simply that I think we ve shown we can get some scale  It s still early days  And that previous question about    it keeps accelerating a bit  I think we re seeing that now throughout the rest of the industry and others coming into wireless  So I think I just want to echo that point that we have a successful beginning and hopefully a very long runway that we re just getting started Craig Moffett    MoffettNathanson    AnalystAll right  Thank you Jason S  Armstrong    Senior Vice President  Investor Relations and FinanceThank you  Craig  Regina  we will take one last question OperatorOur final question will come from the line of Vijay Jayant with Evercore  Please go ahead Vijay Jayant    Evercore ISI    AnalystThanks  I have two  one for Jeremy  Just wanted to understand in the UK  Ofcom is pushing to reduce what I think they dubbed as the loyalty penalty  the difference between what new customers pay and what existing out of contract customers pay  Is there really any impact to your business from that regulation And then for Dave  at CES  I think you guys showed a new xFi advanced gateway that supports 85 megahertz mid split  really increasing the upstream part of your network  Obviously  I just want to understand  what business opportunity and capex implications that may have as you scale that  Thank you David N  Watson    President and Chief Executive Officer  Comcast Cable CommunicationsJeremy  do you want to go first Jeremy Darroch    Group Chief Executive  SkySure  I think  not majorly for us  If you think of our business  we ve really  I think  led the way over the last decade  really  around breaking out    breaking down the bundle  making pricing more transparent  We re a leader in service  According to Ofcom  it starts across all of our products  so not just pay TV  but broadband and mobile and fixed line as well  At the heart of that  we have a belief about trying to right size customers to the products that they want and the price that they want to pay  because we think that s important and is the most durable way  And typically  therefore  we moved a long time ago to essentially offering the same deals right across our bases  The deal for new customers is typically available for an existing customer as well  So there will be some transition  obviously  within that  There will be some    there s been noise as the market quickly moved to that  but I don t expect it would have a big effect on our business David N  Watson    President and Chief Executive Officer  Comcast Cable CommunicationsOn the new gateway that we did talk about at CES  we re excited about this  I think  there are several steps forward with this gateway  in regards to Wi Fi speed  the improvements in terms of coverage  both for the 2 4 band as well as the 5 band improvements  both in those areas  improvements in latency  Across the board  it checks a lot of boxes  And so  like we do with a great new product like this  we ll package that in some of our higher tier packages  And on a go forward basis  we ll compete  If you think about segments where this matters  it s an ideal product for the gaming segment  So we re going to    we ll segment it and go after it  But the fundamentals of being able to provide the best speed  the best coverage  control  all those aspects  I think  this gateway helps us in our position very well Vijay Jayant    Evercore ISI    AnalystThank you so much Michael J  Cavanagh    Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerAnd it

More details came out about the upcoming streaming service last week  In an investor presentation  Peacock management said it will have three tiers for subscribers to choose from  a free ad supported version with some limits on what can be streamed and over 7 500 hours of programming at launch  a  4 99 per month ad supported tier  free for the 24 million Comcast and Cox cable subscribers out there  with fewer limitations on what can be streamed and over 15 000 hours of programming at launch  and a  9 99 per month tier for an ad free experience  or  5 a month for those same Comcast and Cox customers   

Comcast will load up the service with its extensive library of movies and TV shows    including The Office  30 Rock  and Parks and Rec  which have been some of the most streamed programs running on Netflix    and the paid premium tiers will get next day access to current seasons of shows  and early access to things like late night talk shows  Live news and sports will also be available  including coverage of the 2020 Summer Olympics  Additionally   2 billion will be spent on new content in the first two years in an attempt to keep subscribers interested 
But it s the mix of live sports  news  and reality TV programming that s the real difference maker for Peacock compared with the other competition out there  with the service essentially mimicking many aspects of the broadcast and cable channels NBCUniversal already operates  Netflix  Disney   Apple   and others only address the on demand show and movie market  leaving out sports  late night and news  and most Spanish programming  That could help attract viewers in an increasingly crowded streaming TV market  Management expects Peacock to have 30 35 million subscribers by 2024 generating an average of  6 to  7 per user per month 
No need for a savior
While the paid tier subscriptions will surely be an element to the service s money making scheme  it does beg the question  What about Comcast s existing cable business  Won t Peacock hasten the cord cutting movement 
Maybe  However  since Peacock is aiming to bundle its service for free for current cable subscribers    in part through partnerships like an agreement with Cox for those cable customers  which NBC hopes to replicate with other cable providers in the future    it s clear NBC is trying not to undercut cable and is offering a free add on rather than a replacement  After all  for those millions of households that continue paying for cable  all Peacock needs to do to succeed is capture some of the time those viewers spend on a streaming platform  That ultimately would mean more ad dollars for Comcast 
The low price means NBCUniversal will be relying primarily on advertising  Live cable and broadcast TV viewers are already used to ads  so making the switch to internet based programming will be a cinch  All of this implies Peacock is aimed at being a sort of bridge between traditional TV and streaming  Do bear in mind  though  Comcast doesn t need Peacock to be a runaway success like Netflix or Disney   Comcast makes the bulk of its money on high speed internet  and that isn t going to change anytime soon  Three quarters of the company s profits came from the cable communications segment in 2018  which includes TV  internet  mobile phones  and related services  Through the first nine months of 2019 reported so far  cable communications still accounted for two thirds of the company s profits    which includes the addition of the European Sky business that Comcast acquired a year ago  
Besides  even though 222 000 cable customers were lost in Q3 2019  high speed internet subscriber additions more than offset that and helped Comcast increase its total relationship count by 3 4  to 31 2 million  while Sky added a net 482 000 new relationships in Europe during the period 
It remains to be seen how many of those millions of households around the globe will sign up for Peacock  but it s a safe assumption that a fair number of them will eventually use the service and contribute to Comcast s ad based revenue stream  Thus  it s important to remember that Peacock isn t meant to be a blockbuster success  It only needs to be a small bolt on value added segment to help offset cord cutting for it to make sense for shareholders ",2020-01-21,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pktvo,2063808
218576,440092,CMCSA,1 Big Hurdle That Could Prevent Comcast s Peacock From Succeeding,news,"Comcast  NASDAQ CMCSA  revealed a lot of details about its forthcoming streaming service  Peacock  earlier this month  It ll be mainly ad supported  It ll have lots of live and on demand content  And Comcast cable and internet subscribers will get early access to everything Peacock has to offer 
But there s still one big question  Will Peacock be able to partner with other companies for distribution 
At the event unveiling Peacock  management talked about partnering with other pay TV providers for distribution  It also showed off the streaming service on its X1 platform  which is licensed by Comcast s first distribution partner  Cox Communications  Comcast internet subscribers will be able to stream the service on Comcast s own Xfinity Flex platform 
But most consumers use one of two platforms to stream video on their televisions  Roku  NASDAQ ROKU  or Amazon s  NASDAQ AMZN  Fire TV  Comcast could have trouble negotiating deals with the connected TV leaders  which could seriously harm its growth prospects 

The connected TV duopoly Comcast is dealing with
Roku and Amazon combine to account for nearly 70  of all streaming devices in the United States  according to data from Parks Associates  Not only that  but both companies are seeing their installed bases grow faster than the rest of the industry  In other words  they re growing their market share 
That has serious implications for a company like Comcast that s trying to get its streaming service into the homes of 35 million viewers over the next five years  Roku and Amazon can be hard nosed negotiators 
Disney  NYSE DIS  notably saw negotiations with Amazon stretch out to the final week before Disney  s launch  The two were stuck negotiating ad inventory shares on Disney s other apps  Considering Comcast expects most Peacock viewers to use an ad supported version of the service  it could face a similar challenge from Amazon or Roku 
Peacock s ad load plans could make a deal even tougher to reach
One thing Comcast s management continuously harped on during its presentation was the industry low ad load in Peacock  The service will show a maximum of five minutes of ads per hour  which is nearly half of Hulu s ad load 
Amazon and Roku make money by taking a share of ad inventory in most ad supported apps  Some very popular apps that make the platform more attractive  like Alphabet s YouTube  often get a pass or share very little inventory  but new upstarts like Peacock generally have to share more    typically around 30  of inventory 
Since advertising    and the ad experience    are an important part of Peacock  Comcast  Roku  and Amazon may have an even tougher time coming to terms they can agree upon 
Can Comcast go without a distribution partner 
Comcast is a distribution company in its own right  Practically all of its 20 million cable TV subscribers receive video through its platform  Additionally  its broadband subscribers  of which it has around 26 million  are all eligible to receive its Xfinity Flex set top box at no additional cost  Comcast is also looking to partner with other pay TV distributors to include Peacock in their set top boxes 
Peacock s pricing and Comcast s efforts to partner with other pay TV distributors is indicative of the company s strategy to make Peacock more of a complement to pay TV than a competitive offering in the streaming space  And its modest goal of just 30 million to 35 million viewers within five years of launching also suggests it s not as aggressive about scaling its service as consumer discretionary competitors like Disney 
But there will surely be consumers without a Comcast subscription that are at least mildly interested in Peacock  Comcast will offer Peacock to everyone  albeit at a slightly higher price than if you have a relationship with Comcast or one of its partners  How will those people stream Peacock if there s no support for Roku or Amazon 
If Comcast wants to see engagement at any meaningful level  it needs to go to the places where consumers are streaming video  But supporting Roku and Amazon s platforms could detract from Comcast s main goal of supporting the cable TV ecosystem that represents the core of its business  Additionally  those partnerships will eat into the advertising inventory that ll be Peacock s main source of revenue  Comcast s unwillingness to go all in on streaming video the way Disney has puts it in a tough position ",2020-01-22,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/plc7w,2064864
218577,440093,CMCSA,Comcast s Peacock Streaming Service Will Be a Win for Viewers and Investors    Here s Why,news,"Comcast  NASDAQ CMCSA  unit NBCUniversal announced details for its Peacock streaming service at a star studded investor event held at the famed Studio 8H at 30 Rockefeller Plaza    the home of Saturday Night Live  SNL   The event was hosted by a variety of Comcast and NBCU execs and included celebrity appearances by Tina Fey  Jimmy Fallon  and Seth Meyers  
The company s approach will combine a premium catalog of content with a sustainable advertising and subscription model that will delight viewers and investors alike 

Plenty of choices
Peacock will take a different approach from existing services with a hybrid style that turns the streaming model on its head  The service will offer three tier choices with something for everyone  The first tier will contain 7 500 hours of long tail and current programming that will be free to everyone  The second tier will offer 15 000 hours of content  including premium and original programming and will be free to Comcast and Cox cable subscribers and  4 99 per month for everyone else 
By using targeted advertising  Peacock will limit commercials to five minutes per viewing hour  but viewers can go completely ad free for an additional  5 per month 
A huge library of current ad back catalog content
The service will offer a deep library of content including hit NBC shows like The Office  Parks and Recreation  Will   Grace  Bates Motel  Brooklyn Nine Nine  every episode of SNL  30 Rock  Frasier  and Cheers  and all of Dick Wolf s Law and Order and Chicago franchises 
There will also be a laundry list of movies from Universal  including Bridesmaids  Shrek  Field of Dreams  American Pie  A Beautiful Mind  Back to the Future  and E T  the Extra Terrestrial  as well as films from The Mummy  Fast   Furious  Bourne  Despicable Me  and Jurassic Park franchises 
Not to be outdone by its streaming rivals  Peacock is also developing a broad slate of original shows  including Dr  Death  based on the true crime podcast  Brave New World  based on the dystopian novel by Aldous Huxley  and the Tina Fey produced Girls5Eva   about a one hit wonder girl group from the  90s that reunites to give their pop star dreams one more shot   Peacock will also release revivals reboots of popular nostalgic favorites including Battlestar Galactica  Punky Brewster  and Saved by the Bell 
One thing that has been lacking in many streaming services is access to current news and live sports  but Peacock s familial connection with NBC puts that issue to rest  The streaming service will have access to news programming from NBC News  MSNBC  CNBC  and Sky News with both live news and same day rebroadcasts  For sports fans  Peacock will have live coverage and exclusive coverage of the 2020 Olympics  Premier League Soccer  and Ryder Cup golf 

Good for investors
While the lion s share of Comcast s revenue    about 38     comes from its cable business  the phenomenon of cord cutting is accelerating  Peacock gives Comcast a way to simultaneously protect its legacy pay TV business while profiting from the ongoing consumer shift toward streaming  A look at some of the metrics the company provided shows a pretty robust opportunity and plenty for investors to like  
Management said Peacock will eventually generate between  6 and  7 per month in average revenue per user  ARPU   but that could be conservative  Hulu is the closest approximation of Peacock s business model  with a free ad supported tier and a premium tier with no commercials  While some estimates put Hulu s ARPU at about  8 per subscriber for its ad supported tier  Comcast management said the figure was closer to  10  This gives Peacock room to expand its ARPU  even accounting for its promise of just five minutes of ads per viewing hour 
That isn t all  Comcast said it expects Peacock to attract between 30 million and 35 million subscribers by 2024  and it already has a head start  as 24 million Comcast and Cox cable customers will get free access to the ad supported tier of the service with their cable subscription  To put Peacock s goals in context  Disney expects its Disney  subscriber base to grow to between 60 million and 90 million by 2024  with about one third of subs coming from the U S  
A big opportunity
Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives  fresh from the investor presentation  said Comcast was lowballing the subscriber estimates   We believe given the massive content library  sports properties  and distribution footprint that these sub numbers are conservative as we believe 20 million subs over the next 12 to 18 months is a realistic goal   he said   
If Peacock were to reach its extremely modest ARPU and subscriber goals    and there isn t any reason to think it won t    it will reach adjusted EBITDA profitability by 2024 or sooner  and the majority of revenue from each successive subscriber will drop to the bottom line 
By providing both premium content and a free price tag    as well as low cost upgrades    Peacock is focusing on an untapped segment of the streaming market  which could turn out to be both popular and lucrative ",2020-01-22,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pld-n,2065008

Investor corner
During the investor presentation  Comcast provided its domestic financial outlook for the upcoming streaming service  The platform is built on the back of technology developed by Sky  which it acquired in late 2018  The company plans to spend about  2 billion for content over the coming two years and to attract between 30 million and 35 million active accounts by 2024

218587,440103,CMCSA,Comcast s Peacock Is a Big Bet With Modest Expectations,news,"Comcast  NASDAQ CMCSA  finally took the wraps off its forthcoming Peacock streaming service  During its two hour presentation on Thursday  Comcast and NBCUniversal management stressed the importance of Peacock to the company s future 
The cable giant will invest  2 billion in the streaming service over the next two years as it tries to take on new competitors like Disney  NYSE DIS  and AT T  NYSE T  as well as old cord cutting instigators like Netflix  NASDAQ NFLX  
And Comcast is offering consumers an extremely competitive price point  free  with ads  
Well  it s not exactly free  

If you want access to the best Peacock has to offer  you ll have to subscribe to Peacock Premium  which still has advertisements   which will either cost  5 per month or require a subscription to Comcast s video or broadband service  Comcast also has a partnership with Cox to offer Peacock Premium free to its pay TV subscribers  and it s working on deals with other distributors  An ad free Premium version will be offered for  9 99 a month 
Despite Comcast s management touting how much consumer demand there is for free ad supported streaming  it has fairly modest expectations for Peacock 
Half the viewers of its competitors
The first number to consider in Comcast s outlook for Peacock is total active accounts  Management expects to reach just 30 million to 35 million U S  viewers by 2024 
Disney  and HBO Max have much bigger expectations for their streaming services 
Disney expects to reach 60 million to 90 million total subscribers by 2024  That said  it anticipated just one third of those subscribers would come from the U S  On the other hand  Disney appears to have severely underestimated demand for the service  Moreover  Disney s Hulu  which still contains a lot of the content that will soon be on Peacock  ended fiscal 2019 with 29 million subscribers after moving to a subscription only model in 2016 
Meanwhile  AT T expects HBO Max to reach 50 million domestic subscribers by 2024  It thinks it can add another 25 million to 40 million subscribers in the rest of the world  HBO Max enters the market at the high end with a price of  15 per month  but AT T plans to add a less expensive ad supported version of the service next year to help boost subscriber count 
AT T is sure to get a head start  The 10 million customers that already pay for standard HBO through one of AT T s services will get their account upgraded to HBO Max in May  It s working with other distributors to get the other 24 million HBO subscribers the same deal 
That s a comparable strategy to Comcast s  which says 24 million consumers will have free access to Peacock Premium at launch through their cable provider  Comcast or Cox   Management said it s actively working with other pay TV providers to offer Peacock Premium for free  Management seems intent to offer the service free to distributors  but it could be using it as leverage in negotiations for affiliate fees on its cable networks  AT T  likewise  appears to be using HBO Max to increase the price of HBO for distributors without increasing the price for consumers 
Still  Comcast is starting with 24 million potential subscribers  and it expects to add just six million to 11 million over the next five years 
Half the ad revenue  too
Another number that stood out from Comcast s presentation is its expected revenue per user  By 2024  it expects the average viewer to generate between  6 and  7 per month  That number implies that management expects practically all of its viewers to get the service for free 
But that relatively low ad revenue also suggests relatively low engagement  Management pointed out analysts estimate Hulu generates around  10 per month per subscriber in ad revenue  There s reason to expect that number to climb even higher over the next few years  And while Peacock will have a lower ad load compared to Hulu  it s not cutting Hulu s ad load in half  
So  Comcast s either expecting lower average ad prices  lower engagement  or both  If it s the former  Comcast wouldn t have put such an emphasis on the advertising aspect of Peacock  Instead  it seems management expects Peacock to be a secondary service used sparingly by relatively few video on demand streamers  The financial outlook doesn t line up with what management is saying about consumer demand for ad supported streaming 
Intentionally handicapping itself
Peacock is a way for Comcast to test the streaming waters  It still has deals in place with other distributors  including Netflix  HBO  Hulu  and FX  also owned by Disney     four companies it s going to compete against in just a few months  And management said it ll explore taking back more of its content rights over time  particularly if it deems Peacock a success 
But Comcast is certainly being cautious to protect its legacy pay TV businesses  Both its distribution and cable network businesses are threatened by the growth of streaming  Offering Peacock as an incentive to keep the big cable bundle    where Comcast still makes most of its money    forces management to balance the quality of the content and limit access 
But if Disney   Hulu  HBO Max  Netflix  and dozens of other smaller competitors see substantial growth over the next five years  as those companies expect   Peacock might not be enough to prevent further cord cutting ",2020-01-17,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pjg-a,2062400
218588,440104,CMCSA,This Is The Smartest Thing About Comcast s New Peacock Streaming Service,news,"NBC parent Comcast  NASDAQ CMCSA  finally jumped into the streaming fray this past week with the launch of its new streaming service  Peacock 
The new service will launch on April 15 for Comcast customers and July 15 for everyone else  and will offer a broad range of NBC staples including scripted TV  talk and variety shows  and news and sports programming that make up the network s typical fare  
What s unique about the service is that it will be available in both free and paid tiers 
Peacock Free will be an ad supported service  including next day episodes of new broadcast series  complete classic series  around 600 movies and 400 TV series  sports programming including the Summer Olympics  select original programming  and curated channels like  SNL Vault   
Peacock Premium  which is also ad supported or  5 per month extra for an ad free version  will be free for Comcast and Cox subscribers  and  5 per month for other subscribers  That version will have next day access to current seasons of returning series  full season Peacock originals  early access to late night talk shows  and additional sports such as the Premier League  
NBC is targeting 30 million to 35 million active Peacock accounts by 2024  less than the 60 million to 90 million Disney  is aiming for  but Peacock will only be a domestic service for now  while Disney  is launching globally 

Finding the empty lane
What distinguishes Peacock from an increasingly crowded streaming field that includes Netflix  Disney  Hulu  Amazon  Apple  the upcoming HBOMax  and others  is that it offers a completely free version with no strings attached 
By designing a streaming service that seems intended to be ad supported  Peacock is meeting the needs of two underserved markets  viewers looking for free web based content  a la YouTube  and advertisers  a huge constituency that has been mostly left out in the cold by the streaming boom 
Launching Peacock will allow NBC to keep the ad revenue from reviews of segments of shows like  Saturday Night Live  and  The Tonight Show  that had traditionally been found on YouTube  However  tapping into the streaming ad market is the bigger side of the deal here 
NBC already has strong relationships with advertisers    as NBCUniversal Chairman Steve Burke said  the company had  the strongest ad sales track record in the business   
Among the advertisers signed up for launch include Eli Lilly  State Farm  Target  and Unilever  and additional sponsors will be named soon  Peacock will have the lowest ad load in the industry  at a maximum of five minutes per hour 
However  the streaming service will offer advertisers customizable and interactive products including things like Shoppable TV  allowing viewers to buy things within the environment of a TV show using their smartphone to scan a QR code  Such high value and innovative ads have the potential to bring in more revenue for Comcast  
Advertising brings in more than  2 billion in annual revenue at Comcast  and if Peacock reaches its goal of 30 to 35 million active accounts over the next five years  it could drive significant growth in that business  
There s more to cluck about
Launching a free  ad supported tier also borrows from the popular freemium model and gives viewers an opportunity to familiarize themselves with Peacock before deciding if they want to pay for the premium version 
Unlike other streaming services  Peacock will also have virtual channels that will stream automatically when they re pulled up  like linear TV  helping to eliminate some of the decision fatigue that comes from having to choose what to watch on services like Netflix  Such a format of auto playing has helped fuel the rise of TikTok as well 
Given its library of popular series like  The Office   which will arrive in 2022   Parks and Recreation   and  Friday Night Lights   as well as news  talk  sports  and kids  programming  Peacock is putting a strong foot forward in the streaming race  Since it s offering a free tier  I think the company is probably lowballing its estimate when it says it s targeting 30 to 35 million viewers in five years 
Comcast doesn t expect to make money on Peacock over the next five years  similar to Disney   and the cable giant is plowing  2 billion into it over the next two years   
Despite those upfront costs  the company is making the right move with Peacock  as it will ease the pain from cord cutting by giving the company a new growth outlet and incentivizing current Comcast cable customers to stick with the service  Over time  Peacock will strengthen relationships with advertisers and eventually tackle global expansion 
Comcast shares gained 1 3  on the announcement    much less than the bump Disney got from the Disney  reveal    but the stock could see gains later this year if the Peacock outperforms expectations in its first months ",2020-01-20,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pkbxa,2063160

218593,440109,CMCSA,Comcast Is Ready to Flex Its Muscle,news,"Some investors believe that traditional cable companies could be big losers as linear television gives way to streaming video  Comcast  NASDAQ CMCSA  wants to challenge this notion  and it s innovating to take on streaming  and the wireless market  at the same time  
In fact  Comcast s Xfinity Flex is a secret weapon that should have other streaming devices shaking in their circuits  The introduction of the Flex should accomplish two goals  One  to protect its profitable Internet subscribers from leaving for other services  Two  to make sure that Comcast is the gateway to streaming services instead of its rival Roku  
Along with the Flex  Xfinity Mobile might be the ultimate added bonus for Xfinity Internet subscribers  The wireless service may offer a better price for subscribers than they currently receive from larger carriers  Much like the Flex  Xfinity Mobile is also a retention tool for those all important Internet subscribers  
When you combine these two growth drivers  along with a reasonably priced stock  growth and income investors should have Comcast near the top of their buy list 

Flex on  em
According to Grand View Research  the global video streaming market is expected to exceed  124 billion by 2025  As a quick comparison  Comcast generated an annualized  22 billion from video revenue in the last quarter  With video revenue down 1  annually  and customers declining by 3   Comcast can t afford to sit still 
While Comcast tries to figure out how to get back in the game  one of the main beneficiaries of this shift toward streaming video is Roku  In the company s last quarter  active accounts increased by 36  annually to more than 32 million  In addition  streaming hours increased by nearly 70  year over year  
From a competitive standpoint  Comcast s potential to address the streaming market is limited by its geographic coverage  Roku on the other hand  has a shot at selling a device or Roku TV to anyone who wants to stream video  Another key difference between the two is that while Comcast wants to sell customers its Internet service  Roku wants to sell advertising by pushing its operating system into more homes 
The good news for Comcast is that it has a product that seems to be getting little press  yet poses a serious threat to Roku and others  It s time for Comcast customers to get ready to Flex 

Roku is willing to sacrifice some profits to sell its players and integrate into smart TVs  However  Comcast is willing to give Internet only users their first streaming box for free  Subscribers who want an additional box would pay  5 per month  The company doesn t seem to have plans for the Flex as a stand alone service  instead  it wants to use this streaming box as a retention tool  Looking at the hardware  according to PCMag  the top rated Roku device is the Premier  priced at  44  A quick comparison to the Flex suggests Roku should be concerned 

Data source  PC Mag Roku Premier  and Digital Trends for Xfinity Flex 
The short version is that Flex offers the same features as Roku  but at no cost  
While Roku already offers pretty much every streaming service you can think of  plus its own Roku channel  Flex is busy building its catalog  Some of the most popular services are on board  from Netflix to Amazon Prime Video to HBO  The service will be the home of NBCUniversal s Peacock service when it launches  and Hulu is expected soon  In the short term  customers may miss options like Disney  or Spotify  However  these missing pieces are likely more related to getting the right deal in place  rather than attempting to squeeze out a competitor  With 21  of Comcast s revenue coming from video  and billions of potential revenue expected from streaming  this is a war the company can t afford to lose 
Challenging the unlimited plan promise
Streaming isn t the only way Comcast is hoping to bring value to investors  The company s Xfinity Mobile service is a growth opportunity and a retention tool rolled into one  
The wireless industry seems to have an unwritten rule    everyone needs unlimited data  However  some cellphone users are beginning to realize that unlimited isn t the only option  One study found that over half of Americans on unlimited plans consume less than 10 GB of data monthly  In addition  42  of respondents on a capped data plan were using just over 5 GB of data per month  Consumer Reports found that  more than half of those who switched providers in the previous two years said they saw a big drop in their monthly bill  
For subscribers considering switching to Xfinity Mobile  one of the first questions is likely about coverage  The great thing for subscribers is that Xfinity Mobile runs on the Verizon wireless network  The same network that Verizon constantly touts as being one of the best in the country is what you are getting  
When it comes to service plans  on the surface  Xfinity Mobile s unlimited plan is challenging to recommend  The Verizon Play More Unlimited plan gives subscribers unlimited data    and Apple Music    for  45 per line per month  Xfinity Mobile s unlimited plan costs  45 per month  The good news for Comcast investors is unlimited pricing isn t the company s primary competitive advantage 
For customers who aren t using tons of data each month  Xfinity Mobile s pricing is quite aggressive  with 1 GB of shared data for just  12 per month  This strategy seems to be working  as wireless lines climbed to nearly 1 8 million last quarter  a more than 77  annual increase  Verizon s much larger base of more than 114 million subscribers increased by just over 2  annually  by comparison 
At just  12 for 1 GB   30 for 3 GB  or  60 for 10 GB  Comcast is challenging the unlimited for everyone mantra  As a quick example  if two people are using around 5 GB of data per person each month  they could spend  60 a month with Xfinity Mobile  This same couple on Verizon would pay at least  70  If you have one power user  and one light user  the comparison favors Xfinity even more  For two light users  the numbers are almost comical  As a real life example  my parents use less than 2 GB of data per month between them  so Xfinity Mobile means  24 for the entire month 
It s true that subscribers must also be with Xfinity Internet  but as I noted above  nearly 26 million already are  With fewer than 7  of Comcast Internet users also signed up for mobile service  the runway for growth is long indeed 
A rose by any other name
With the Flex offering a way for Comcast to gain ground in streaming  and Xfinity Mobile potentially poaching customers from bigger wireless carriers  the company has multiple ways to boost its revenue and earnings in the future  
Given the choice between Comcast and Verizon  the meter clearly tilts in Comcast s favor  Both stocks carry a forward price to earnings ratio around 12 to 14  Meanwhile  Verizon s dividend yield sits 2 percentage points higher than that of its peer  However  Comcast is expected to grow earnings per share by nearly 9  over the next five years  compared to just 2  from Verizon  
Investors looking for growth and income should gain some Flex ability by adding Comcast to their portfolio ",2020-01-09,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pft7q,2055689

218611,440127,CMCSA,Comcast tops profit forecast as it gains high speed internet customers,news,"By Helen Coster and Neha Malara
 Reuters    Comcast Corp  O CMCSA  beat Wall Street profit and revenue estimates on Thursday  as the company added high speed internet customers and lost more video subscribers than expected 
Comcast s third quarter showed that its focus on the higher margin broadband business   necessary to stream content   is helping to offset a decline in cable subscribers 
 Four things stood out as wrapped up the quarter  our incredible strength in broadband  the enduring popularity of our premium content  our strong global footing just one year after the Sky acquisition  and how the combination of these things puts us in a unique position to compete  including in the streaming market   said Chief Executive Officer Brian Roberts 
Comcast shares were up 2 32  at  46 78 in premarket trading 
Revenue from the company s high speed internet business grew 9 3  to  4 72 billion with the gain of 379 000 subscribers in the quarter  beating analysts  average estimate of 344 000 net additions  according to research firm FactSet 
Comcast s results also reflected the widespread  cord cutting  across the cable business  The company lost 238 000 video customers in the three months ended Sept  30  higher than the 224 000 it lost in the previous quarter  above the 203 000 loss estimated by research firm FactSet 
In September Comcast announced it will offer Xfinity Flex  its streaming media set top box  and a voice remote for free to its U S  internet only customers  It had previously charged those customers  5 per month for the service and remote  The product is meant to make it easier for subscribers of multiple streaming services to find shows 
The company s NBCUniversal business  which includes NBC Entertainment and Universal Pictures  reported revenue of  8 30 billion  down 3 5  from a year earlier  In April NBCUniversal is launching a streaming service called  Peacock   which will be available as a subscription or with ads  stocked with 15 000 hours of content from the company s library 
British pay TV group Sky  which Comcast acquired after outbidding Twenty First Century Fox last year  generated revenue of  4 55 billion  missing estimates of  4 75 billion  Comcast attributed that miss to tough macroeconomic conditions in the UK  Germany and Italy 
The Philadelphia company said revenue rose 21 2  to  26 83 billion  beating analysts  average estimate of  26 77 billion  according to IBES data from Refinitiv 
Net income attributable to Comcast rose to  3 22 billion  or 70 cents per share  from  2 89 billion  or 62 cents per share  a year earlier

218612,440128,CMCSA,Comcast  CMCSA  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Comcast  CMCSA  reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on October 24  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This cable provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 75 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  15 4  
Revenues are expected to be  27 07 billion  up 22 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2 5  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Comcast 
For Comcast  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 89  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Comcast will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Comcast would post earnings of  0 75 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 78  delivering a surprise of  4  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Comcast appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-10-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/comcast-cmcsa-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200474671,200474671

The potential uptick in user growth would bolster the company s financial performance  with Macquarie estimating that 72 million more subscribers by 2022 could drive platform revenue to  2 3 billion and generate total revenue of  2 7 billion 
That is more than double the company s 2019 guidance for revenue in the range of  1 075 billion to  1 095 billion 
The thumbs up from Macquarie cooled concerns somewhat about the threat of rising competition to Roku from bigger companies  with Comcast  NASDAQ CMCSA  rolling out its Xfinity Flex streaming box and Facebook  NASDAQ FB  set launch its Portal TV streaming device on Nov  5 
The concerns caused the shares to drop more than 44  from a Sept  9 peak of  176 55 to a low of  98 08 on Sept  27  The share have risen 19  since 
 
As a result  Roku is up 280  for the year and has an average price target of  131  according to consensus estimates from Investing com ",2019-10-09,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/stockbeat-roku-jumps-as-macquarie-says-users-could-triple-1994029,1994029
218616,440132,CMCSA,U S  arrests counterterrorism analyst over leaks to journalists,news,"By Sarah N  Lynch and Andy Sullivan WASHINGTON  Reuters    A counterterrorism analyst with the U S  Defense Intelligence Agency was arrested on Wednesday over charges he leaked classified materials about a foreign country s weapons system to two journalists in 2018 and 2019  the U S  Justice Department said in federal court filings on Wednesday  Information that 30 year old Henry Kyle Frese passed to the journalists appeared in at least eight different news stories  the Justice Department alleged in an indictment unsealed in the U S  District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia   The two reporters to whom he leaked information were colleagues  and one of them was apparently romantically involved with Frese  the FBI said in court filings  Those news stories relied on five separate intelligence reports issued between March and June 2018  Reuters could not immediately determine if Frese had obtained a lawyer in the case   This marks the sixth federal case involving leaks of classified information in a little over two years  A crackdown on leaking was initiated by the Trump administration in 2017 and led by then Attorney General Jeff Sessions  The first case to emerge during the Trump administration involved Reality Winner  a former intelligence analyst who divulged a report about Russian interference in the 2016 election to the Intercept news website  Another similar case earlier this year involved a former intelligence analyst named Daniel Everette Hale  who was also charged in connection with leaking information to the Intercept related to a U S  drone strike program  Until the criminal case against Winner  no one had been charged with leaking classified information since 2013  said John Demers  the head of the Justice Department s National Security Division  in a call with reporters on Wednesday to announce the charges against Frese   Our investigators and prosecutors nationwide will continue to devote themselves to media leak cases in order to protect our nation from the threat posed by the rare intelligence community official who breaks his or her oath   he said  During the course of its investigation  the FBI learned that Frese was a follower on one of the reporter s public Twitter feeds  and that Frese shared a residential address with the journalist from August 2017 through August 2018  The reporter with whom he lived is referred to in court records as  Journalist 1    It appears that they were involved in a romantic relationship for some or all of that period of time   the FBI agent wrote in a sworn statement   The Justice Department did not identify the two journalists to whom he allegedly leaked or their news outlets  but said they worked for two separate outlets owned by the same parent company  Public Twitter messages referenced in the court filings indicate that Journalist 1 is Amanda Macias  a national security reporter for CNBC  The filings also reference public Twitter messages that indicate Journalist 2 is Courtney Kube  a national security correspondent for NBC  Both CNBC and NBC are owned by Comcast  NASDAQ CMCSA   Macias authored or co authored with Kube a number of articles during the timeframes cited in the court filings that reference U S  intelligence reports and weapons systems of foreign nations such as China and Russia  Neither reporter was accused of any wrongdoing  Neither immediately responded to requests for comment  An NBC spokesman declined to comment  In the spring of 2018  the FBI alleges Journalist 1 called Frese on his cellphone  The next day  Frese started searching for an intelligence report involving topics unrelated to his work responsibilities  Seven days later  the reporter sent him a direct message on Twitter asking if he would speak with  Journalist 2   who was a more senior and seasoned reporter  He replied he was  down  to help Journalist 2 because doing so would help Journalist 1  progress  in her career

NEW YORK  Reuters     Twitter Inc   N TWTR  will have a chance to detail its plans to grow users and ad dollars on Friday when it releases its second quarter earnings before the market opens 
Investors will have their eyes on Twitter s monetizable daily active users  mDAUs   its revenues  ad growth and products  live steam partnerships and updates to its prototype app Twttr 
Below is a closer look at each in t DAILY ACTIVE USERS
Twitter reported 134 million average mDAUs in its first quarter  an 11  year over year increase  Analysts at Cowen expect a 28 million rise in mDAUs in the second quarter  a 1  increase 
Twitter began reporting mDAUs  a metric that tracks the number of daily users logging on to the platform  instead of monthly active users in the first quarter of this year  The new metric is supposed to help investors and advertisers better understand engagement on Twitter 
Twitter s introduction of mDAUs drew skepticism  however  some analysts think mDAUs paint a better picture of engagement  Investors need to keep an eye on Twitter s mDAU growth and how long people are using the app 
REVENUE
Ads make up a bulk of Twitter s revenue while data licensing are its other major revenue source  Twitter s first quarter saw revenue rise 18  year over year 
Twitter s revenues are slated for a slight 1  rise in its second quarter  from  778 million to  832 million  according to Refinitiv s Eikon  Investors should watch out for Twitter s second quarter ad revenue growth as the company plans to launch more ad products 
AD PRODUCTS
Twitter said last quarter that it planned to improve its ad formats and promotion products on its mobile app  a move that could make more advertisers happy 
 They re getting more attuned with their users  preferences   said analyst Michael Pachter at Wedbush Securities   They re making ads more likely to be seen  
Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey said the company tailors live content to users based on whom they follow 
Investors should watch out for new ad products and how they mesh with advertisers  needs  which could be a catalyst in Twitter s growth 
LIVE STREAM PARTNERSHIPS
Twitter s live video deals with NBCUniversal  O CMCSA  and the National Basketball Association point to the company s efforts to be a conversation hub as it focuses on elevating content that gets people to tweet 
Twitter wants to make following events and interests as easy as following an account  Bigger and better partnerships for the live streams could catch advertisers  attention 
Some experts are not convinced that the live streams will have a major impact on daily users or ads as the content is generally available on television and other platforms 
Investors need to look for other major brands partnering with Twitter and the amount of engagement live streams are able to pull in 
THE PROTOTYPE APP
Wall Street is wondering about Twitter s next steps for its prototype app  Twttr   The company launched the app in March to give users a place to test out features and designs  The invite only platform is  at times  a peephole into Twitter s upcoming tools and an additional avenue for advertisers ",2019-07-25,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/five-things-to-look-for-in-twitters-results-1934892,1934892

218640,440156,CMCSA,Dot com On Steroids  Roku s Stock Crashes 20  In One Day,opinion,"It didn t take long for high flying  Roku   NASDAQ ROKU  to nose dive after it skyrocketing more than 500  over the past eight months   Roku  a streaming equipment provider  saw its stock price plunge 20  today after fears of increased competition from Comcast  NASDAQ CMCSA  and Facebook  NASDAQ FB    The deathblow to Roku began on Wednesday as it s stock price fell 13  when Comcast released news that it would provide its customers with free streaming players 

On Thursday  Roku s stock recovered a bit  but then fell another 20  on Friday as Pivotal Research Group announced a  60 sell recommendation  Roku opened on Friday morning at  127 but then fell below  104 before closing at  108 





Now  if you watched my last video  China Silver Wildcard   Where s Silver Going  I posted a chart on Roku and explained why it wasn t worth  170 a share   The chart below was made on September 5th  when Roku closed at  166 





As I stated in the video  Roku had skyrocketed 530  over the past eight months from  27 to  170   I also showed Roku s financial Q2 2019 statement where I pointed out that ROKU continued to lose money and forecasted that   Roku s price is going to collapse at some point because it s not worth that sort of extreme valuation  

Here is Roku s weekly chart 





After Roku hit  175  in just two weeks  it crashed  67 lower to  108 05   Roku was a perfect Short Trade because the stock was extremely overbought and would have fallen at some point  regardless of the news of Comcast and Facebook  FB  competition   That news release was just an excuse for investors who bought at much lower prices  to CASH IN ON PROFITS before the stock fell even further 

If we take a look at Roku s Daily chart  we can see that it BROKE below a critical trend line 





Because Roku fell below that lower BLUE DASHED trend line  it will likely continue lower after correcting back and touching that lower trend line   I believe Roku will probably fall back to the  75 range where it has strong support level

218646,440162,CMCSA,Comcast  CMCSA  Upgraded To Buy  What Does It Mean For The Stock ,opinion,"Investors might want to bet on Comcast  CMCSA   as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   This upgrade is essentially a reflection of an upward trend in earnings estimates    one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices 
The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company s changing earnings picture  The Zacks Consensus Estimate    the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell side analysts covering the stock    for the current and following years is tracked by the system 
The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors  since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time 
Therefore  the Zacks rating upgrade for Comcast basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  and the near term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated  The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship  as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock 
For Comcast  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company s underlying business  And investors  appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Comcast
This cable provider is expected to earn  3 11 per share for the fiscal year ending December  2019  which represents a year over year change of 22  
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Comcast  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 2 5  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term 
You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here    
The upgrade of Comcast to a Zacks Rank  2 positions it in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions  implying that the stock might move higher in the near term ",2019-09-05,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/comcast-cmcsa-upgraded-to-buy-what-does-it-mean-for-the-stock-200462400,200462400
218647,440163,CMCSA,Comcast  CMCSA  Soars To 52 Week High  Time To Cash Out ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Comcast  CMCSA   Shares have been on the move with the stock up 8 8  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  46 62 in the previous session  Comcast has gained 36 3  since the start of the year compared to the 19 6  move for the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector and the 35 3  return for the Zacks Cable Television industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on July 25  2019  Comcast reported EPS of  0 78 versus consensus estimate of  0 75 while it missed the consensus revenue estimate by 1 2  
For the current fiscal year  Comcast is expected to post earnings of  3 11 per share on  110 19 billion in revenues  This represents a 21 96  change in EPS on a 16 59  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  3 39 per share on  116 06 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 9 21  and 5 33   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Comcast may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Comcast has a Value Score of B  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are C and B  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of A 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 15X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 9 3X versus its peer group s average of 8 5X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 1 26  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to consider the stock s Zacks Rank  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Comcast currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Comcast meets the list of requirements  Thus  it seems as though Comcast shares could still be poised for more gains ahead ",2019-09-05,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/comcast-cmcsa-soars-to-52week-high-time-to-cash-out-200462318,200462318
218648,440164,CMCSA,Here s Why Momentum Investors Will Love Comcast  CMCSA ,opinion,"Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock s recent trend in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will be essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   With this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving that way  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks  this can be very tough to define  There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance  The Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Comcast  CMCSA   a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B  We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions  two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Comcast currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
Let s discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for CMCSA that show why this cable provider shows promise as a solid momentum pick 
A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short term price activity  as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand  It s also helpful to compare a security to its industry  this can show investors the best companies in a particular area 
For CMCSA  shares are up 4 31  over the past week while the Zacks Cable Television industry is up 4 1  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 8 79  compares favorably with the industry s 4 37  performance as well 
While any stock can see its price increase  it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market  That is why looking at longer term price metrics    such as performance over the past three months or year    can be useful as well  Shares of Comcast have increased 11 32  over the past quarter  and have gained 29 2  in the last year  On the other hand  the S P 500 has only moved 5 81  and 5 06   respectively 
Investors should also take note of CMCSA s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  Right now  CMCSA is averaging 14 765 342 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions  in addition to price changes  Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well  A nice path here can help show promise  and we have recently been seeing that with CMCSA 
Over the past two months  7 earnings estimates moved higher compared to 2 lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost CMCSA s consensus estimate  increasing from  3 05 to  3 11 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  8 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 2 downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Given these factors  it shouldn t be surprising that CMCSA is a  2  Buy  stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B  If you re looking for a fresh pick that s set to soar in the near term  make sure to keep Comcast on your short list ",2019-09-05,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/heres-why-momentum-investors-will-love-comcast-cmcsa-200462438,200462438

218667,440183,CMCSA,Is Comcast  CMCSA  A Great Value Stock Right Now ,opinion,"While the proven Zacks Rank places an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find strong stocks  we also know that investors tend to develop their own individual strategies  With this in mind  we are always looking at value  growth  and momentum trends to discover great companies 
Considering these trends  value investing is clearly one of the most preferred ways to find strong stocks in any type of market  Value investors rely on traditional forms of analysis on key valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are undervalued  leaving room for profits 
On top of the Zacks Rank  investors can also look at our innovative Style Scores system to find stocks with specific traits  For example  value investors will want to focus on the  Value  category  Stocks with high Zacks Ranks and  A  grades for Value will be some of the highest quality value stocks on the market today

218677,440193,CMCSA,3 Reasons Why Comcast  CMCSA  Is A Great Growth Stock,opinion,"Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market s attention and produce exceptional returns  However  it isn t easy to find a great growth stock 
By their very nature  these stocks carry above average risk and volatility  Moreover  if a company s growth story is over or nearing its end  betting on it could lead to significant loss 
However  it s pretty easy to find cutting edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects 
Comcast  CMCSA  is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system  In addition to a favorable Growth Score  it carries a top Zacks Rank 
Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market  And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   returns are even better 
Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this cable provider a great growth pick right now 
Earnings Growth
Earnings growth is arguably the most important factor  as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors  For growth investors  double digit earnings growth is highly preferable  as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Comcast is 15   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 19 7  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 9 2  
Impressive Asset Utilization Ratio
Growth investors often overlook asset utilization ratio  also known as sales to total assets  S TA  ratio  but it is an important feature of a real growth stock  This metric exhibits how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales 
Right now  Comcast has an S TA ratio of 0 43  which means that the company gets  0 43 in sales for each dollar in assets  Comparing this to the industry average of 0 35  it can be said that the company is more efficient 
In addition to efficiency in generating sales  sales growth plays an important role  And Comcast is well positioned from a sales growth perspective too  The company s sales are expected to grow 16 7  this year versus the industry average of 0  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Beyond the metrics outlined above  investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is a plus here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
The current year earnings estimates for Comcast have been revising upward  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 1 3  over the past month 
Bottom Line
While the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Comcast a Zacks Rank  2 stock  it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above 
You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
This combination positions Comcast well for outperformance  so growth investors may want to bet on it ",2019-08-01,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-reasons-why-comcast-cmcsa-is-a-great-growth-stock-200449035,200449035

218709,440225,CMCSA,Comcast  CMCSA  Upgraded To Strong Buy  What Does It Mean For The Stock ,opinion,"Comcast  CMCSA  appears an attractive pick  as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   An upward trend in earnings estimates    one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices    has triggered this rating change 
The Zacks rating relies solely on a company s changing earnings picture  It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure    the Zacks Consensus Estimate 
The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors  since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time 
Therefore  the Zacks rating upgrade for Comcast basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  has proven to be strongly correlated with the near term price movement of its stock  The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship  as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock 
For Comcast  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company s underlying business  And investors  appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Comcast
For the fiscal year ending December  2019  this cable provider is expected to earn  3 02 per share  which is a change of 18 4  from the year ago reported number 
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Comcast  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 9 1  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

CMCSA s full year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of  3 per share and revenue of  111 76 billion  These results would represent year over year changes of  17 65  and  18 25   respectively 
Any recent changes to analyst estimates for CMCSA should also be noted by investors  These revisions help to show the ever changing nature of near term business trends  As a result  we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company s business outlook 
Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near term stock prices  We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon  Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear  actionable rating model

218716,440232,CMCSA,3 Reasons Growth Investors Will Love Comcast  CMCSA ,opinion,"Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market s attention and produce exceptional returns  However  it isn t easy to find a great growth stock 
That s because  these stocks usually carry above average risk and volatility  In fact  betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss 
However  the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects  makes it pretty easy to find cutting edge growth stocks 
Comcast  CMCSA  is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends  The company not only has a favorable Growth Score  but also carries a top Zacks Rank 
Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market  And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  
While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this cable provider is a great growth pick right now  we have highlighted three of the most important factors below 
Earnings Growth
Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth  as surging profit levels is what most investors are after  And for growth investors  double digit earnings growth is definitely preferable  and often an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Comcast is 14 3   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 17 5  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 10 3  
Cash Flow Growth
Cash is the lifeblood of any business  but higher than average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for Comcast is 15 3   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 12  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 9 3  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 7  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Superiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is of course favorable here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
There have been upward revisions in current year earnings estimates for Comcast  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0 1  over the past month 
Bottom Line
While the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Comcast a Zacks Rank  2 stock  it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above 
You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

218717,440233,CMCSA,CMCSA  Stock Vs  Option,opinion,"Options are foreign to many investors  And yes  there is a degree of complexity and a necessary learning curve involved  But understanding even a few basic option strategies can open a world of opportunity 
In a nutshell I typically describe options as offering 3 basic avenues 
 Expressing a market opinion  i e   profiting if a security moves in the direction you think it will go   typically at a fraction of the cost of trading shares of stock
 Hedging an existing position or portfolio  i e   the ability to protect yourself without having to sell your stock holdings 
 Taking advantage of unique situations  selling premium to make money in a neutral market  buying a straddle to profit if a move takes place in either direction  and so on  
What follows is NOT a recommended trade or opportunity  It is simply an example that compares buying stock versus buying an option to illustrate the relative pros and cons 
Ticker CMCSA
According to the Elliott Wave count from ProfitSource by HUBB  Comcast  NASDAQ CMCSA  is setting up for a Wave 4 advance in price  Now the caveats  I like and use ProfitSource and I find the built in Elliott Wave count to be useful  That being said  no given  setup  or  Wave count  is EVER guaranteed to pan out  I have no idea whether this latest count for CMCSA will ultimately be a good one or a bad one  In this instance I am simply using it as a potential catalyst for a hypothetical trade for illustrative purposes 

Figure 1  Courtesy ProfitSource by HUBB
This wave count is projecting that CMCSA will rise to somewhere between  45 67 and  48 30 by the end of July 
Let s assume that we believe the wave count in Figure 1 will play out and that we want to speculate on this opportunity  The simplest approach would be to buy 100 shares of CMCSA stock  With the stock trading at  41 40 a share  this would involve spending  4 140 to buy 100 shares  This position appears in Figure 2  Note that for every  1 the stock goes up the position makes  100 and vice versa  A 100 shares of stock position has a  delta  of 100 

Figure 2  Courtesy OptionsAnalysis com
Another possibility  among many  would be to buy the September 37 50 strike price call for  470  This is only about 10  of what the stock trader must put up  This trade appears in Figure 3 

Figure 3  Courtesy OptionsAnalysis com 
A few things to note 
 The worst case loss for the option trade is   470
 The trade has a  delta  of roughly 78  While delta value can and will change over time  for now it means that this position is essentially equivalent to holding 78 shares of stock  In other words  the option buyer in this example buys 78 deltas for  470 versus the stock trader who buys 100 deltas for  4 410 
How will this all play out  It beats me  and remember I am NOT suggesting that CMCSA is bullish nor am I recommending either of these positions  
Figure 4 displays the expected dollar profit or loss from the two positions at various prices for CMCSA stock as of the end of July 

Figure 4
Note that at higher price the call option makes almost as much total   return as the stock position while committing 90  less capital  Likewise  as price sinks progressively lower the stock position just keeps losing more and more  while the option position cannot lose more than  470 
While the number are helpful  still probably the best way to illustrate the relative tradeoffs is to overlay the two position on one chart  See Figure 5 

Figure 5  Courtesy OptionsAnalysis com
Summary
So  is better to buy the call option than the stock shares  That s for each trader to decide in each situation  While in this illustration the option appears to have some advantages  another scenario involves the stock  going nowhere  for a while before making a move higher  In that scenario the stock trader can simply hold the stock shares and wait  The option will expire in September and the option trader will have to make another trading decision 
In any event  remember that the purpose of this article is NOT to prompt you to take action regarding CMCSA  The purpose is simply to illustrate the relative pros and cons of options versus stocks in certain situations ",2019-06-05,Jay Kaeppel,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cmcsa-stock-vs-option-200428754,200428754

218719,440235,CMCSA,Should Value Investors Buy Comcast  CMCSA  Stock ,opinion,"While the proven Zacks Rank places an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find strong stocks  we also know that investors tend to develop their own individual strategies  With this in mind  we are always looking at value  growth  and momentum trends to discover great companies 
Of these  value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  Value investors use fundamental analysis and traditional valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are being undervalued by the market at large 
On top of the Zacks Rank  investors can also look at our innovative Style Scores system to find stocks with specific traits  For example  value investors will want to focus on the  Value  category  Stocks with high Zacks Ranks and  A  grades for Value will be some of the highest quality value stocks on the market today 
One stock to keep an eye on is Comcast  CMCSA   CMCSA is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   as well as a Value grade of A  The stock is trading with a P E ratio of 13 23  which compares to its industry s average of 18 34  Over the past 52 weeks  CMCSA s Forward P E has been as high as 14 59 and as low as 11 94  with a median of 13 35 
We also note that CMCSA holds a PEG ratio of 1 12  This metric is used similarly to the famous P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock s expected earnings growth rate  CMCSA s industry currently sports an average PEG of 1 55  Over the past 52 weeks  CMCSA s PEG has been as high as 1 19 and as low as 0 93  with a median of 1 11 
We should also highlight that CMCSA has a P B ratio of 2 49  Investors use the P B ratio to look at a stock s market value versus its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  This stock s P B looks attractive against its industry s average P B of 3 03  Within the past 52 weeks  CMCSA s P B has been as high as 2 60 and as low as 2 08  with a median of 2 32 
Value investors also frequently use the P S ratio  This metric is found by dividing a stock s price with the company s revenue  Some people prefer this metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement  This means it could be a truer performance indicator  CMCSA has a P S ratio of 1 95  This compares to its industry s average P S of 2 11 
Finally  we should also recognize that CMCSA has a P CF ratio of 8 13  This metric focuses on a firm s operating cash flow and is often used to find stocks that are undervalued based on the strength of their cash outlook  CMCSA s current P CF looks attractive when compared to its industry s average P CF of 9 48  Over the past 52 weeks  CMCSA s P CF has been as high as 8 49 and as low as 4 45  with a median of 5 15 
These figures are just a handful of the metrics value investors tend to look at  but they help show that Comcast is likely being undervalued right now  Considering this  as well as the strength of its earnings outlook  CMCSA feels like a great value stock at the moment ",2019-06-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/should-value-investors-buy-comcast-cmcsa-stock-200432214,200432214

Prior to today s trading  shares of the cable provider had lost 0 51  over the past month  This has lagged the Consumer Discretionary sector s gain of 0 28  and the S P 500 s gain of 0 64  in that time

CMCSA s full year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of  3 02 per share and revenue of  111 67 billion  These results would represent year over year changes of  18 43  and  18 16   respectively 
Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for CMCSA  These revisions help to show the ever changing nature of near term business trends  As a result  we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company s business outlook 
Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near term share price momentum  Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank  This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple  actionable rating system

Buy These Low Price to Sales Stocks with Growth Potential
A stock s price to sales ratio reflects how much investors are paying for each dollar of revenues generated by the company 
If the price to sales ratio is 1  it means that investors are paying  1 for every  1 of revenues generated by the company  So  it goes without saying  that a stock with a price to sales below 1 is a good bargain  as investors need to pay less than a dollar for a dollar s worth   
Thus  a stock with a lower price to sales ratio is a more suitable investment than a stock with a high price to sales ratio 
When considering valuation metrics  price to earnings ratio has always been the obvious choice  This is because calculations based on earnings are easy and come in handy  However  price to sales has emerged as a convenient tool to determine the value of stocks that are incurring losses or are in an early cycle of development  generating meager or no profits 
While a loss making company with a negative price to earnings ratio falls out of investor favor  its price to sales could indicate the hidden strength of its business  This underrated ratio is also used to identify a recovery situation or ensure that a company s growth is not overvalued 
Price to sales is often preferred over price to earnings as companies can manipulate their earnings using various accounting measures  However  sales are harder to manipulate and are relatively reliable 
However  one should keep in mind that a company with high debt and low price to sales is not an ideal choice  The high debt level will have to be paid off at some point  leading to further share issuance  rise in market cap and ultimately a higher price to sales ratio 
In any case  the price to sales ratio used in isolation cannot do the trick  One should also analyze other ratios like Price Earnings  Price Book and Debt Equity before arriving at any investment decision

218727,440243,CMCSA,What Makes Comcast  CMCSA  A Strong Momentum Stock  Buy Now ,opinion,"Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock s recent trend  which can be in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   And for investors following this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks  this can be very tough to define  There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance  The Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Comcast  CMCSA   a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of A  We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions  two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Comcast currently has a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
In order to see if CMCSA is a promising momentum pick  let s examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this cable provider holds up 
Looking at a stock s short term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum  since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment  It is also useful to compare a security to its industry  as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area 
For CMCSA  shares are up 0 9  over the past week while the Zacks Cable Television industry is down 1 2  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 3 1  compares favorably with the industry s 1 38  performance as well 
While any stock can see its price increase  it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market  That is why looking at longer term price metrics    such as performance over the past three months or year    can be useful as well  Over the past quarter  shares of Comcast have risen 11 57   and are up 33 16  in the last year  On the other hand  the S P 500 has only moved 3 72  and 6 92   respectively 
Investors should also pay attention to CMCSA s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  CMCSA is currently averaging 17 197 116 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions  in addition to price changes  Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well  A nice path here can help show promise  and we have recently been seeing that with CMCSA 
Over the past two months  12 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost CMCSA s consensus estimate  increasing from  2 75 to  2 93 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  11 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Given these factors  it shouldn t be surprising that CMCSA is a  1  Strong Buy  stock and boasts a Momentum Score of A  If you re looking for a fresh pick that s set to soar in the near term  make sure to keep Comcast on your short list ",2019-05-21,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/what-makes-comcast-cmcsa-a-strong-momentum-stock-buy-now-200423951,200423951

5 High Flying Stocks Near 52 Week Highs that Can Scale Higher
A 52 week high level generally works as an indicator for investors as stocks near that level are perceived to be winners

Chicago  IL   May 23  2019   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  Comcast Corp    NASDAQ CMCSA    CommScope Holding Co  Inc    NASDAQ COMM    j2 Global Inc    NASDAQ JCOM    Molina Healthcare Inc    NYSE MOH   and Lithia Motors Inc    NYSE LAD   
Here are highlights from Wednesday s Analyst Blog  
Shrug Off Market Gyrations with These Top 5 Value Picks
After an exponential rise in the first four months of the year  Wall Street has entered into a correction mode in May after trade related negotiations between the United States and China stalled abruptly  However  markets returned to their winning streak on May 21 despite the fact that major stock indexes are yet to recover the losses that they suffered in this month 
Meanwhile  the strong economic fundamentals of the United States have raised the possibility that recent stock market volatility may be a transitory phase and markets will continue their long term uptrends once trade issues are solved 
Markets are likely to remain range bound in the near term  A strong rally is unlikely for as long as this trade conflict continues  However  downside potential will be limited owing to solid U S  economic fundamentals  Meanwhile  volatile trading may become a regular phenomenon in Wall Street  At this stage  it makes good sense to buy those stocks on the dip that could prove to be valuable once the rally resumes 
Wall Street Tumbles as Trade War Resurfaces
On May 10  the U S  government hiked existing tariff rates to 25  from 10  on  200 billion of Chinese exports  In 2018  the Trump administration imposed 25  tariff on  50 billion of Chinese goods  Moreover  President Trump threatened to levy 25  tariff on another  325 billion of Chinese goods 
China had imposed  110 billion tariffs on U S  exports in 2018  Following the hike of U S  tariff  the Chinese authority imposed 25  tariff on an additional  60 billion U S  goods effective Jun 1  2019 
If negotiations continue  there is no timeline specified on when the parties should reach an agreement  However  a consensus will certainly bode well for both economies  On the other hand  if no progress is made at all and a full fledged trade war rages  the global economy too will see a slowdown along with the warring nations 
Trump Declares National Emergency in Telecom
On May 15  President Donald Trump issued an executive order declaring a national emergency  preventing U S  corporates from using information and communications technology equipment from sources as this  poses an unacceptable risk to the national security of the United States  
Following the order  the Department of Commerce added Chinese telecom behemoth Huawei Technologies and its affiliates to the Bureau of Industry and Security  BIS  Entity List  Another Chinese telecom giant ZTE  HK 0763  may also face the same fate  The latest move by the U S  government further jeopardized the trade relations between the two countries 
However  on May 21  the U S  government said that it will provide a 90 day reprieve to Huawei before taking tough trade measures  During these 90 days  the U S  government will issue temporary license to the U S  suppliers of the Chinese telecom behemoth so that Huawei dose not face any immediate supply chain management issue 
Several economists and market watchers are considering a decision on the part of the Trump administration to open a channel to find a meaningful solution to the year old trade spat between the two largest trading countries of the world

At this stage  investors should be prepared to minimize fluctuations in their portfolio and consequently rebalance it with suitable financial assets to maintain stability  Thus  it would be prudent to pick up value stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank

Comcast is one of 244 companies in the Consumer Discretionary group  The Consumer Discretionary group currently sits at  8 within the Zacks Sector Rank  The Zacks Sector Rank considers 16 different groups  measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the sector to gauge the strength of each group 
The Zacks Rank emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find stocks with improving earnings outlooks  This system has a long record of success  and these stocks tend to be on track to beat the market over the next one to three months  CMCSA is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy  
Over the past 90 days  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for CMCSA s full year earnings has moved 8 66  higher  This signals that analyst sentiment is improving and the stock s earnings outlook is more positive 
Our latest available data shows that CMCSA has returned about 25 32  since the start of the calendar year  In comparison  Consumer Discretionary companies have returned an average of 16 75   As we can see  Comcast is performing better than its sector in the calendar year

218732,440248,CMCSA,Is Comcast  CMCSA  Stock Undervalued Right Now ,opinion,"The proven Zacks Rank system focuses on earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find winning stocks  Nevertheless  we know that our readers all have their own perspectives  so we are always looking at the latest trends in value  growth  and momentum to find strong picks 
Of these  perhaps no stock market trend is more popular than value investing  which is a strategy that has proven to be successful in all sorts of market environments  Value investors rely on traditional forms of analysis on key valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are undervalued  leaving room for profits 
In addition to the Zacks Rank  investors looking for stocks with specific traits can utilize our Style Scores system  Of course  value investors will be most interested in the system s  Value  category  Stocks with  A  grades for Value and high Zacks Ranks are among the best value stocks available at any given moment 
One company to watch right now is Comcast  CMCSA   CMCSA is currently holding a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  and a Value grade of A  The stock is trading with a P E ratio of 13 67  which compares to its industry s average of 18 08  Over the past year  CMCSA s Forward P E has been as high as 14 59 and as low as 11 94  with a median of 13 33 
Investors should also note that CMCSA holds a PEG ratio of 1 15  This metric is used similarly to the famous P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock s expected earnings growth rate  CMCSA s industry currently sports an average PEG of 1 53  CMCSA s PEG has been as high as 1 19 and as low as 0 93  with a median of 1 11  all within the past year 
Another notable valuation metric for CMCSA is its P B ratio of 2 61  The P B ratio is used to compare a stock s market value with its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  This company s current P B looks solid when compared to its industry s average P B of 3 06  CMCSA s P B has been as high as 2 67 and as low as 2 04  with a median of 2 35  over the past year 
Value investors also use the P S ratio  The P S ratio is is calculated as price divided by sales  This is a prefered metric because revenue can t really be manipulated  so sales are often a truer performance indicator  CMCSA has a P S ratio of 1 98  This compares to its industry s average P S of 2 04 
Finally  investors will want to recognize that CMCSA has a P CF ratio of 8 32  This figure highlights a company s operating cash flow and can be used to find firms that are undervalued when considering their impressive cash outlook  This company s current P CF looks solid when compared to its industry s average P CF of 9 38  CMCSA s P CF has been as high as 8 49 and as low as 4 40  with a median of 5 08  all within the past year 
These figures are just a handful of the metrics value investors tend to look at  but they help show that Comcast is likely being undervalued right now  Considering this  as well as the strength of its earnings outlook  CMCSA feels like a great value stock at the moment ",2019-05-29,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-comcast-cmcsa-stock-undervalued-right-now-200426661,200426661
218737,440253,CMCSA,Triumph and controversy  Team Sky s era of domination,news,"By Christian Radnedge LONDON  Reuters    When Team Sky launched in London in 2010 with the ambition of having a British winner of the Tour de France within five years  there was more than a modicum of scepticism at the undoubtedly flashy new boys in the peloton  Not that there was inexperience as British Cycling s Dave Brailsford was installed as team principal and brought with him the  marginal gains  strategy that would underpin the team s successes and controversies over almost a decade of extraordinary success  Six out of seven Tour de France titles  three of which were won by different riders  and Chris Froome holding all three major tour titles at once would be impressive enough in isolation but  coming after more than 100 years of Britain failing to get a man on the Tour podium  the success and the speed with which it was achieved were nothing short of astonishing   The broadcaster  which has announced it will end its association with the team next year  had already enjoyed a fruitful partnership with the national cycling federation and  with Brailsford s persuasion  a team was built to nurture young British talent and win cycling s biggest prizes   At the time  reports said the investment was worth 30 million pounds   37 6 million  over four years but by 2017 their budget for that year alone was 31 1 million pounds   Such figures dwarfed anything the rest of the peloton could muster and soon led to a seething undercurrent of animosity  Bradley Wiggins finished 24th in Team Sky s tentative debut at the Tour de France in 2010 and two years later became the first British winner of cycling s most prestigious event   With Wiggins also leading British domination of the cycling program at the 2012 London Olympics  Brailsford was the toast of the sporting world    The whole principle came from the idea that if you broke down everything you could think of that goes into riding a bike  and then improved it by one percent  you will get a significant increase when you put them all together   Brailsford said that year  expanding on his marginal gains philosophy  At a time when trust in cycling was at an all time low on the back of Lance Armstrong and relentless doping revelations  Sky seemed a shining beacon for their focus on technical improvements and their insistence on  winning clean   But soon the halo began to slip  The team struggled to explain the delivery of a mystery  jiffy bag  for Wiggins at the 2011 Criterium du Dauphine race in France and Brailsford s belated claim that it was a  flu treatment that needed to come from England did not convince many onlookers   A 14 month U K  Anti Doping investigation into its contents eventually hit a dead end due to a lack of accurate medical records being available  In March this year  a damning report by the British government s Digital Culture Media and Sport select committee said that the team had cynically abused the anti doping system by using therapeutic use exemption certificates   PR DAMAGE Froome won the Tour in 2013 and would go on to win another three but he too came under the microscope for an adverse analytical finding for asthma drug salbutamol  He was later cleared of any wrongdoing by the governing UCI  but the PR damage had been done   Despite winning the Giro d Italia  again another milestone for a British rider  Froome endured his worst reception in France  being jostled and spat at on this year s Tour as critics accused Sky of crossing the ethical line  Geraint Thomas won his maiden title in the race to give the team a timely boost  considering the Welshman s lack of connection to any controversies  By then it was clear what a force the Sky machine had become from that flashy but nervous launch in London in 2010  with its huge entourage  clad in black and blue  leading the way wherever they went  Even their buses went out in front  There was no doubting who Wiggins was referring to at his own team s season launch earlier this year   We want to be a team who engages with the public  not hidden in a big  black bus behind screens   he said  after even he fell out with his former employers  It was changes further up the food chain that probably spelt out the end of Sky s association as last year James Murdoch resigned as Sky plc chairman following the majority control takeover by U S  cable group Comcast Corp  NASDAQ CMCSA    Murdoch had been the main driver of Sky s involvement in cycling  He was a keen fan of the sport and the push to make the team the best in the world had not been simply a business decision but one of personal passion  too   With Murdoch gone  so too it seems is the passion as Sky pursues other aspects of its business  As far as shaking up the world of cycling and putting British riders to the fore  the sponsorship has undoubtedly been a spectacular success  
The team hopes to continue beyond next year but any potential new backer is highly unlikely to be able to match Sky s investment levels  suggesting that the end of one of the most dominant eras in the history of the sport is about to draw to a close ",2018-12-12,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/general-news/triumph-and-controversy-team-skys-era-of-domination-1719247,1719247

Team Sky  however  was criticised by UKAD for not keeping accurate medical records and also drew flak from British parliamentarians  who alleged the team had crossed an  ethical line  by using permitted medication to enhance performances ",2018-12-12,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/general-news/cycling-sky-to-end-involvement-in-the-sport-after-2019-season-1718945,1718945

218742,440258,CMCSA,Forget Trade Tensions  Focus On US Economy  4 Top Picks,opinion,On May 13  trade tensions took a heavy toll on U S  stocks once again  The Dow and the S P 500 suffered their worst losses since Jan 3  triggered by China s decision to impose retaliatory tariffs on American goods worth  60 billion  While some conciliatory noises emerged from the White House  China s state sponsored media adopted an abrasive tone on the simmering trade conflict Meanwhile  key members of the Federal Reserve stated that the American economy is much stronger relative to China  And investors should focus on its resilience and ignore medium term turbulence in the equity markets  This is why it makes sense to invest in select consumer discretionary stocks at this time Kashkari  Rosengreen Emphasize US Economy s StrengthAccording to Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari  the United States holds the edge in its trade conflict with China  Despite the continuing slide in equity markets  Kashkari believes major economic metrics remain stable as the trade war intensifies  Speaking to CNBC  he said  the United States  is in a very strong position  compared to China Firstly  the U S  economy is much larger and  is much less sensitive to trade   On the other hand  much of China s prosperity is linked to the export driven nature of its economy  In fact  exports make up a much larger chunk of the economy compared to the United States  This is why the United States has the advantage in a retaliatory battle of escalating tariffs Boston Fed President Eric Rosengreen echoed Kashkari s views on America s economic strength  He said that if the trade conflict was short lived it would have little impact on the U S  economy  Rosengreen also thinks that the domestic economy is robust enough to  withstand the trade issues that are coming up right now  Economic Indicators Remain RobustU S  GDP increased at 3 2  in the first quarter of 2019  exceeding the consensus estimate of 2 1  by a wide margin  The figure is also significantly higher than the pace of 2 2  recorded in the last quarter of 2018  This is also the first time since 2018 that first quarter GDP has breached the 3  barrier   Read   Meanwhile  the unemployment rate declined from 3 8  to 3 6  in April  This is the lowest level registered since December 1969 and significantly better than the estimated rate of 3 8   Also  the economy added 263 000 jobs last month  This marks the 100th consecutive month of job growth for the U S  economy   Read   Factory orders rebounded in March  increasing 1 9   This is the largest increase experienced since August 2018  Strong demand for transportation equipment was the primary reason for the resurgence in factory orders  An increase in orders for electronic equipment and computers also contributed to March s gains Our ChoicesComments from top Fed officials indicate that the U S  economy remains robust in the midst of significant equity market turbulence  This is why it holds the edge in a likely protracted trade war with China  These statements are borne out by recently released data  which serve to underline America s economic strength Investing in consumer discretionary stocks  the powerhouse of the U S  economy remains prudent at this time  However  picking winning stocks may be difficult This is where our  comes

s Analyst Blog Forget Trade Tensions  Focus on the U S  Economy  4 Top StocksOn May 13  trade tensions took a heavy toll on U S  stocks once again  The Dow and the S P 500 suffered their worst losses since Jan 3  triggered by China s decision to impose retaliatory tariffs on American goods worth  60 billion  While some conciliatory noises emerged from the White House  China s state sponsored media adopted an abrasive tone on the simmering trade conflict Meanwhile  key members of the Federal Reserve stated that the American economy is much stronger relative to China  And investors should focus on its resilience and ignore medium term turbulence in the equity markets  This is why it makes sense to invest in select consumer discretionary stocks at this time Kashkari  Rosengreen Emphasize US Economy s StrengthAccording to Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari  the United States holds the edge in its trade conflict with China  Despite the continuing slide in equity markets  Kashkari believes major economic metrics remain stable as the trade war intensifies  Speaking to CNBC  he said  the United States  is in a very strong position  compared to China Firstly  the U S  economy is much larger and  is much less sensitive to trade   On the other hand  much of China s prosperity is linked to the export driven nature of its economy  In fact  exports make up a much larger chunk of the economy compared to the United States  This is why the United States has the advantage in a retaliatory battle of escalating tariffs Boston Fed President Eric Rosengreen echoed Kashkari s views on America s economic strength  He said that if the trade conflict was short lived it would have little impact on the U S  economy  Rosengreen also thinks that the domestic economy is robust enough to  withstand the trade issues that are coming up right now  Economic Indicators Remain RobustU S  GDP increased at 3 2  in the first quarter of 2019  exceeding the consensus estimate of 2 1  by a wide margin  The figure is also significantly higher than the pace of 2 2  recorded in the last quarter of 2018  This is also the first time since 2018 that first quarter GDP has breached the 3  barrier   Read  5 Consumer Discretionary Stocks to Buy as Q1 GDP Surges Meanwhile  the unemployment rate declined from 3 8  to 3 6  in April  This is the lowest level registered since December 1969 and significantly better than the estimated rate of 3 8   Also  the economy added 263 000 jobs last month  This marks the 100th consecutive month of job growth for the U S  economy   Read  Unemployment Hits 50 Year Low  6 Business Services Picks Factory orders rebounded in March  increasing 1 9   This is the largest increase experienced since August 2018  Strong demand for transportation equipment was the primary reason for the resurgence in factory orders  An increase in orders for electronic equipment and computers also contributed to March s gains Our ChoicesComments from top Fed officials indicate that the U S  economy remains robust in the midst of significant equity market turbulence  This is why it holds the edge in a likely protracted trade war with China  These statements are borne out by recently released data  which serve to underline America s economic strength Investing in consumer discretionary stocks  the powerhouse of the U S  economy remains prudent at this time  However  picking winning stocks may be difficult This is where our VGM Score comes in  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three

218744,440260,CMCSA,Here Is Why Growth Investors Should Buy Comcast  CMCSA  Now,opinion,"Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above average financial growth  as this feature helps these securities garner the market s attention and deliver solid returns  However  it isn t easy to find a great growth stock 
By their very nature  these stocks carry above average risk and volatility  Moreover  if a company s growth story is over or nearing its end  betting on it could lead to significant loss 
However  it s pretty easy to find cutting edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects 
Comcast  CMCSA  is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends  The company not only has a favorable Growth Score  but also carries a top Zacks Rank 
Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market  And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   returns are even better 
Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this cable provider a great growth pick right now 
Earnings Growth
Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth  as surging profit levels is what most investors are after  And for growth investors  double digit earnings growth is definitely preferable  and often an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Comcast is 14 3   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 14 7  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 10 3  
Cash Flow Growth
Cash is the lifeblood of any business  but higher than average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for Comcast is 15 3   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 12  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 9 3  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 7  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Beyond the metrics outlined above  investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is a plus here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
The current year earnings estimates for Comcast have been revising upward  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 2 9  over the past month 
Bottom Line
Comcast has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above  but it also carries a Zacks Rank  1 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions

218753,440269,CMCSA,Are You Looking For A Top Momentum Pick  Why Comcast  CMCSA  Is A Great Choice,opinion,"Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock s recent trend in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will be essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   With this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving that way  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic  it can be tough to define  Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy  but the Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Comcast  CMCSA   a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B  We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions  two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Comcast currently has a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
Let s discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for CMCSA that show why this cable provider shows promise as a solid momentum pick 
A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short term price activity  as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand  It is also useful to compare a security to its industry  as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area 
For CMCSA  shares are up 1 53  over the past week while the Zacks Cable Television industry is down 0 56  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 5 54  compares favorably with the industry s 3 98  performance as well 
While any stock can see a spike in price  it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market  Shares of Comcast have increased 13 19  over the past quarter  and have gained 37 54  in the last year  In comparison  the S P 500 has only moved 8 35  and 12 86   respectively 
Investors should also take note of CMCSA s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  Right now  CMCSA is averaging 14 581 611 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things  including estimate revisions and a stock s price movement  Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank  and a nice path here can be promising  We have recently been noticing this with CMCSA 
Over the past two months  13 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost CMCSA s consensus estimate  increasing from  2 73 to  2 92 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  12 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Taking into account all of these elements  it should come as no surprise that CMCSA is a  1  Strong Buy  stock with a Momentum Score of B  If you ve been searching for a fresh pick that s set to rise in the near term  make sure to keep Comcast on your short list ",2019-05-02,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/are-you-looking-for-a-top-momentum-pick-why-comcast-cmcsa-is-a-great-choice-200416582,200416582

Near 52 Week Highs That Can Scale HigherA 52 week high generally works as an indicator for investors as stocks near that level are perceived to be winners Notably  investors often wonder if the stock is overpriced considering the high price level  While the apprehensions are not absolutely baseless  all stocks hitting a 52 week high are not necessarily overvalued In fact  an investor might miss out on top gainers in a bid to avoid the steep prices of stocks that are near the 52 week high mark Also  as a stock keeps scaling new highs with time  one should take a more calculated approach to understand if any further upside is left Here we discuss a strategy to find the right stocks Borrowing from the basics of momentum investing  this technique bets on  buy high  sell higher  52 Week High  A Good IndicatorMany a time  stocks hitting a 52 week high fail to scale higher despite potential  This is because investors fear that the stocks are overvalued and a price crash is impending In fact  overvaluation is quite natural for most of these stocks as investors  focus  or willingness to pay premium  has helped them reach the level  But that does not always mean an imminent decline  Factors such as robust sales  surging profit levels  earnings growth prospects and strategic acquisitions that encouraged investors to bet on these stocks could keep them motivated if there is no tangible negative  In other words  the momentum might continue Also  when a string of positive developments dominate the market  investors find their under reaction unwarranted  even if there are no

218761,440277,CMCSA,Democrats  Republicans make last pitch as campaigns clatter to hectic end,news,"By John Whitesides WASHINGTON  Reuters    Bitter U S  political campaigns thundered to a hectic  unpredictable finish on election eve on Monday  as candidates scoured the country for votes in dozens of crucial races that opinion polls showed were still razor close  Control of both chambers of the U S  Congress and 36 governor s offices are up for grabs on Tuesday in an election widely seen as a referendum on the first two years of Republican President Donald Trump s leadership  In the final stretch  Trump has ramped up his hard line rhetoric on immigration and cultural issues  including warnings about a caravan of migrants headed to the border with Mexico and  liberal  mobs  and touted a growing U S  economy that he said would be threatened by Democrats  He amplified that message with an advertisement linking Democrats and immigrants to violent crime  which aired on NBC on Sunday night  Even fellow Republicans had criticized the spot as racially divisive when it first debuted online last week  NBC Universal  a unit of Comcast Corp  NASDAQ CMCSA  on Monday said it would no longer run the 30 second spot  CNN had earlier refused to run it  calling it  racist    After further review we recognize the insensitive nature of the ad and have decided to cease airing it across our properties as soon as possible   a spokesperson for the network said in a email  Trump planned to spend a final day on the campaign trail on Monday  hitting the Midwestern states of Ohio  Indiana and Missouri at the end of a six day pre election sweep focused mostly on competitive U S  Senate races   It s all fragile  Everything I told you about  it can be undone and changed by the Democrats if they get in   Trump told supporters in a conference call on Monday aimed at getting out the vote  Opinion polls and election forecasters favor Democrats to pick up the minimum of 23 seats they need on Tuesday to capture a majority in the U S  House of Representatives  which would enable them to stymie Trump s legislative agenda and investigate his administration      But Republicans are favored to retain their slight majority in the U S  Senate  currently at two seats  which would let them retain the power to approve U S  Supreme Court and other judicial nominations on straight party line votes  But 75 or more of the 435 House races remain competitive  forecasters said  and control of the Senate is likely to come down to a half dozen close contests in Arizona  Nevada  Missouri  North Dakota  Indiana and Florida  Democrats also are threatening to recapture governor s offices in several key battleground states such as Michigan  Wisconsin  Ohio and Pennsylvania  a potential help for the party in those states in the 2020 presidential race  Trump  who frequently warns of voter fraud and has claimed without evidence that millions of fraudulent votes were cast in 2016  said on Twitter on Monday that law enforcement should be on the lookout for  illegal voting   Democratic former President Barack Obama delivered donuts to campaign volunteers in a House district in suburban Virginia  where Democrat Jennifer Wexton  a state senator  is challenging Republican incumbent Barbara Comstock in a fiercely contested race  Obama said the country s character and its commitment to decency and equality are on the ballot on Tuesday   All across the country  what I m seeing is a great awakening   he said   People woke up and said  Oh  we can t take this for granted  We ve got to fight for this    Trump s polarizing style has spurred record turnout  cranking up enthusiasm in both parties as voters cast ballots to oppose or support the president  Approximately 40 million early votes   including absentee  vote by mail and in person ballots   will likely be cast by Election Day  according to Michael McDonald  a professor at the University of Florida who tracks the figures  In the last such congressional elections in 2014  there were 27 5 million early votes  The numbers suggest turnout will be very high for a non presidential election  McDonald wrote on his U S  Elections Project website  He estimated turnout would reach 45 percent  that would be the highest for a midterm election in 50 years

There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks  but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns  The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits 
Comcast and Rogers Communication are sporting Zacks Ranks of  2  Buy  and  3  Hold   respectively  right now  The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates  so investors should rest assured that CMCSA has an improving earnings outlook  But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors 
Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics  These include the long favored P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company s fair value 
CMCSA currently has a forward P E ratio of 14 53  while RCI has a forward P E of 15 07  We also note that CMCSA has a PEG ratio of 1 15  This metric is used similarly to the famous P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock s expected earnings growth rate  RCI currently has a PEG ratio of 3 01 
Another notable valuation metric for CMCSA is its P B ratio of 2 65  The P B ratio pits a stock s market value against its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  RCI has a P B of 4 35 
Based on these metrics and many more  CMCSA holds a Value grade of B  while RCI has a Value grade of C 
CMCSA sticks out from RCI in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models  so value investors will likely feel that CMCSA is the better option right now ",2019-04-14,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cmcsa-or-rci-which-is-the-better-value-stock-right-now-200406732,200406732
218792,440308,CMCSA,Comcast  CMCSA  Is Up 2 18  In One Week  What You Should Know,opinion,"Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock s recent trend  which can be in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   And for investors following this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic  it can be tough to define  Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy  but the Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Comcast  CMCSA   a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of A  We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions  two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Comcast currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
Let s discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for CMCSA that show why this cable provider shows promise as a solid momentum pick 
A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short term price activity  as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand  It is also useful to compare a security to its industry  as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area 
For CMCSA  shares are up 2 18  over the past week while the Zacks Cable Television industry is up 0 84  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 4 66  compares favorably with the industry s 1 86  performance as well 
While any stock can see its price increase  it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market  That is why looking at longer term price metrics    such as performance over the past three months or year    can be useful as well  Over the past quarter  shares of Comcast have risen 15 38   and are up 24 6  in the last year  In comparison  the S P 500 has only moved 11 89  and 11 51   respectively 
Investors should also pay attention to CMCSA s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  CMCSA is currently averaging 15 453 720 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions  in addition to price changes  Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well  A nice path here can help show promise  and we have recently been seeing that with CMCSA 
Over the past two months  9 earnings estimates moved higher compared to 1 lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost CMCSA s consensus estimate  increasing from  2 73 to  2 84 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  9 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 1 downward revision in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Given these factors  it shouldn t be surprising that CMCSA is a  2  Buy  stock and boasts a Momentum Score of A  If you re looking for a fresh pick that s set to soar in the near term  make sure to keep Comcast on your short list ",2019-04-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/comcast-cmcsa-is-up-218-in-one-week-what-you-should-know-200407384,200407384

218802,440318,CMCSA,Why The Earnings Surprise Streak Could Continue For Comcast  CMCSA ,opinion,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well positioned to maintain its earnings beat streak in its upcoming report  It is worth considering Comcast  CMCSA   which belongs to the Zacks Cable Television industry 
This cable provider has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 4 89  
For the last reported quarter  Comcast came out with earnings of  0 64 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 62 per share  representing a surprise of 3 23   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  0 61 per share and it actually produced earnings of  0 65 per share  delivering a surprise of 6 56  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Comcast lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Comcast currently has an Earnings ESP of  4 53   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on April 25  2019 
With the Earnings ESP metric  it s important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power  however  a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-03-31,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-the-earnings-surprise-streak-could-continue-for-comcast-cmcsa-200402755,200402755

218804,440320,CMCSA,Comcast  CMCSA  Hits Fresh High  Is There Still Room To Run ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Comcast  CMCSA   Shares have been on the move with the stock up 4 3  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  40 58 in the previous session  Comcast has gained 18 3  since the start of the year compared to the 16 9  move for the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector and the 19 9  return for the Zacks Cable Television industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on January 23  2019  Comcast reported EPS of  0 64 versus consensus estimate of  0 62 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 8 19  
For the current fiscal year  Comcast is expected to post earnings of  2 77 per share on  112 42 billion in revenues  This represents an 8 63  change in EPS on a 18 95  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  3 08 per share on  118 25 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 11 09  and 5 19   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Comcast may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Comcast has a Value Score of C  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are B and A  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of A 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 14 6X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 8 3X versus its peer group s average of 8 3X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 1 19  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Comcast currently has a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Comcast passes the test  Thus  it seems as though Comcast shares could still be poised for more gains ahead ",2019-04-03,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/comcast-cmcsa-hits-fresh-high-is-there-still-room-to-run-200403997,200403997

Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is Twenty First Century Fox due for a pullback  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts  Fox Q2 Earnings Top  Revenues LagTwenty First Century Fox delivered second quarter fiscal 2019 adjusted earnings of 37 cents per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 7 cents  However  the figure decreased 11 9  on a year over year basis owing to lack of contribution from stake in Sky following its sale to Comcast  NASDAQ CMCSA  Revenues of  8 49 billion increased 5 7  from the year ago quarter  However  the figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  8 58 billion The top line growth can primarily be attributed to increasing affiliate revenues from the Cable Network Programming  and growth in affiliate and advertising revenues in the Television segments  offset by lower home entertainment revenues at the Filmed Entertainment segment  Notably  foreign currency had a negative impact of about  195 million on revenue growth Quarter DetailsSegment wise  Cable Network Programming revenues  53 7  of total revenues  increased 3 6  to about  4 56 billion  Television segment net revenues  25 3   increased 18 9  on a year over year basis to about  2 15 billion  However  Filmed Entertainment revenues  25 4   declined 3 9  to  2 16 billion On the basis of components  affiliate revenues  41  of total revenues  increased 7 1  from

9   declined 1  year over year to  2 12 billion The Cable Network Programming segment gained from higher affiliate and advertising revenue growth  partially offset by increase in programming and contractual expenses  Increase in contractual rates of all domestic cable brands led to year over year increase of 8  in domestic affiliate revenues  Domestic advertising revenues increased 6  year over year primarily due to higher pricing at Fox News However  international affiliate revenues declined 4  owing to unfavorable impact of a stronger U S  dollar  which was offset by local currency growth at FNG International and STAR  International advertising revenues decreased 9  on account of unfavorable impact of a stronger U S  dollar and  lower local currency advertising revenue at FNG International more than offset local currency advertising growth at STAR  Filmed Entertainment revenues declined due to lower syndication revenues at television production studio and lower home entertainment revenues from film studio The Television segment gained from higher advertising and affiliate revenues  Advertising revenues increased 15  year over year due to increased number of sports broadcast and higher political advertising revenues generated from the mid term U S  elections  Increase in contractual retransmission consent fee and higher content revenues from FOX Broadcast Network s on demand streaming service led to year over year increase of 21  in affiliate revenues Operating DetailsThe company s total segment operating income before depreciation and amortization  OIBDA  came in at  1 57 billion  up 8 8  year over year on the back of higher contributions of the Filmed Entertainment and Cable Network Programming segments  partially offset by lower contribution at Television segment  Notably  foreign currency had a negative impact of about  94 million on OIBDA growth OIBDA as percentage of revenues expanded 50 basis points  bps  on a year over year basis to 18 4  OIBDA at Cable Network Programming rose 7  to  1 45 billion on higher affiliate revenues  4    The increase was partially offset by 2  rise in expenses  Higher sports rights costs at both FS1 and the Regional Sports Networks  RSNs   and increase in FX entertainment costs resulted in increased expenses  This was modestly offset by lower cricket rights costs at STAR OIBDA contribution from domestic market rose 10  year over year due to increase in contributions from FOX News and RSNs  OIBDA contribution from International cable channels declined 8  year over year owing to unfavorable impact of a stronger U S  dollar  partially offset by local currency growth at both FNG International and STAR Filmed Entertainment s OIBDA increased to  193 million up 47  from the year ago quarter  The increase can be attributed to higher contribution from film studios due to the global release of Bohemian Rhapsody  lower theatrical costs on account of less number of films released in second quarter fiscal 2019 and strong performance of The Greatest Showman across home entertainment and pay television  This was partially offset by  lower domestic syndication contribution and higher new series deficits  Notably  Bohemian Rhapsody  the biopic about Queen lead singer Freddie Mercury  won the award for best picture   drama this year s Golden Globes  Moreover  Rami Malek  portraying the legendary singer  won the trophy for best actor in a motion picture   drama Television segment reported OIBDA loss of  22 million  declining  78 million from the year ago quarter  Growth in affiliate  advertising and content revenues  19   was more than offset by increase in expenses  24    The rise in expenses was due to higher sports programming costs on account of the inaugural season of Thursday Night Football  offset by lower expenses of entertainment programming Operating and selling  general and administrative expenses increased 4 8  year over year to  6 94 billion Balance Sheet and Cash FlowAs of Dec 31  2018  cash   cash equivalents were  21 28 billion compared with  7 08 billion as of Sep 30  2018 due to cash inflow from Sky stake sold to Comcast Cash flow from operations

What s Next for Comcast 
While Comcast has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock

218890,440406,CMCSA,U S  mergers help bank fees spike to record highs,news,"By Lynn Adler
NEW YORK  LPC    A record  1 45 trillion of US syndicated lending to companies for acquisitions  leveraged buyouts  dividends and refinancing in the first half of the year has propelled bank fees from arranging the loans to all time highs 
The  8 1 billion earned in the first half of this year slightly topped the prior record  8 billion taken in during the second half of last year  setting a new peak  according to Freeman Consulting Services 
The lending pace escalated in the second quarter and is seen staying heated through year end  encouraged by lower US corporate tax rates and a federal judge s June endorsement of the long pursued mega merger between AT T  NYSE T  and Time Warner 
Bankers eagerly awaited the outcome of the AT T Time Warner ruling  long after the deal was first announced in October 2016  and now expect the decision to keep the chute wide open for similar mergers and acquisitions  M A  in coming months 
For lower rated borrowers  there is less onerous enforcement under this administration of leveraged lending guidelines put in place five years ago to rein in high risk practices   
 The market was firing on all cylinders in the second quarter   said Jeff Nassof  a director at Freeman Consulting   There were plenty of new money loans from both corporate M A and leveraged buyouts  and it looks like more to come given the relaxed regulatory environment and strong stock market  
At the current pace  fees will reach an annual record for banks lending to blue chip as well as to highly indebted companies  according to Freeman  which estimates fees based on Thomson Reuters data 
Fees of nearly  6 6 billion earned by banks in the first half for extending leveraged loans to lower rated borrowers topped  5 8 billion in the same half last year by more than 14 percent  roughly matching the all time high for any six month period set in the second half of last year 
The mix of deals  which has increasingly shifted to new funding rather than lower margin refinancing loans  is also propping up fee income 
Among the loans boosting the leveraged fee pool were those made to back auto parts maker Tenneco s purchase of Federal Mogul from Icahn Enterprises  Amneal Pharmaceuticals  merger with fellow generics drug maker Impax Laboratories  and building products manufacturer Ply Gem Holdings  take private by buyout firm Clayton  Dubilier   Rice 
ALL CLEAR
For extending loans to high quality companies  banks earned about  1 5 billion in the first half of the year  a 44 percent spike from a year earlier and the highest half year tally on record 
 For investment grade companies  it s still a very strong M A environment   stock prices are high  so sellers are willing to sell  and buyers are willing to bid their stock to get assets   Nassof said 
At the same time  interest rates have risen but remain low historically  while the economy and corporate profits are growing 
 Debt financing is cheap  so that s not really any inhibitor to financing a big deal   Nassof said  The AT T Time Warner decision  he added   is going to be a boost for deals  giving potential buyers the all clear signal  
Among the fee drivers in the first half in the high grade sector were loans backing Comcast  NASDAQ CMCSA  Corp s bid to buy Sky Plc  LON SKYB   Walt Disney s offer to buy Fox media assets and Conagra Brands  purchase of Pinnacle Foods 
Rising first half syndicated lending helped to boost the total US investment banking fee pool to an all time high for any six month period 

When adding bank earnings from equity and bond underwriting  as well as M A advisory to the syndicated loan arrangement fees  the total US investment banking fee pool jumped  26 7 billion in the first half  slightly edging out the second half of last year ",2018-07-09,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/us-mergers-help-bank-fees-spike-to-record-highs-1522401,1522401

218893,440409,CMCSA,Comcast  CMCSA  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"The market expects Comcast  NASDAQ CMCSA  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 23  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This cable provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 62 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  26 5  
Revenues are expected to be  25 74 billion  up 17 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 29  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Comcast 
For Comcast  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 08  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Comcast will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Comcast would post earnings of  0 61 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 65  delivering a surprise of  6 56  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Comcast doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/comcast-cmcsa-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200376234,200376234
218903,440419,CMCSA,Online betting firms gamble on soccer mad Nigeria,news,By Alexis Akwagyiram and Didi Akinyelure LAGOS  Reuters    Online sports betting is booming in soccer mad Nigeria largely thanks to payment systems developed by homegrown technology firms that are starting to make online businesses more viable  For years  mobile payments failed to take off in Nigeria as they have in countries such as Kenya  where Safaricom s M Pesa money transfers have fostered a culture of cashless payments  Fear of electronic fraud and slow internet speeds have held Nigerian online consumers back but betting firms says the new  fast digital payment systems underpinning their websites are changing attitudes towards online transactions   We have seen significant growth in the number of payment solutions that are available  All that is definitely changing the gaming space   said Seun Anibaba  CEO of Lagos State Lotteries Board  gaming regulator in Nigeria s commercial capital   The operators will go with whoever is faster  whoever can connect to their platform with less issues and glitches   he said  adding that taxes from sports betting in Lagos State rose 30 percent to 40 percent in 2017 from 2016  That growth has been matched by a rise in web payments  according to data from the Nigeria Inter Bank Settlement System  NIBSS   which is owned by the central bank and licensed banks  In 2016  there were 14 million web payments worth a total 132 billion naira   420 million   Transactions leapt to 29 million worth 185 billion in 2017 and in the first quarter of 2018 there were nearly 10 million worth 61 billion  With a young population of nearly 190 million  rising mobile phone use and falling data costs  Nigeria has long been seen as a great opportunity for online businesses   once consumers feel comfortable with electronic payments  Online gambling firms say that is happening  though reaching the tens of millions of Nigerians without access to banking services remains a challenge for pure online retailers  British online betting firm Betway opened its first African business in Kenya in 2015  followed by Uganda  Ghana and South Africa  It launched in Nigeria in January   There is a gradual shift to online now  that is where the industry is going   Betway s Nigeria manager Lere Awokoya said    The growth in the number of fintechs  and the government as an enabler  has helped the business to thrive  These technological shifts encouraged Betway to start operating in Nigeria   he said  FINTECH COMPETITION Betting firms cashing in on the soccer frenzy whipped up by Nigeria s participation in the World Cup say they are finding the payment systems created by local startups such as Paystack are proving popular online  Paystack and another local startup Flutterwave  both founded in 2016  are providing competition for Nigeria s Interswitch which was set up in 2002 and was the main platform used by businesses operating in Nigeria   We added Paystack as one of our payment options without any fanfare  without announcing to our customers  and within a month it shot up to the number one most used payment option on the website   said Akin Alabi  founder of NairabBET  He said NairaBET  the country s second biggest betting firm  now had 2 million regular customers on its website  up from 500 000 in 2013  and Paystack remained the most popular payment option since it was added in late 2017  Paystack was set up by two Nigerian computer science graduates  Shola Akinlade and Ezra Olubi  who received early stage funding in Silicon Valley s Y Combinator programme  In December 2016  it raised  1 3 million from investors including China s Tencent and Comcast  NASDAQ CMCSA  Ventures in the United States  Paystack  based in the frenetic Ikeja district of Lagos  said the number of monthly transactions it processed rose from about 8 000 in early 2016 to more than 900 000 as of June 2018   In early 2016 we were processing about  3 000 a month  Today we process well over  11 million every single month   said Emmanuel Quartey  Paystack s head of growth   He said an ecosystem of developers had emerged around Paystack  creating software to integrate the platform into websites   We have seen a growth in that community and they have carried us along   said Quartey  Paystack said it enables payments for a number of betting firms but also a wide range of businesses  from utility services to transport companies to insurer Axa Mansard  Flutterwave  co founded by Nigerian entrepreneur Iyinoluwa Aboyeji  is also backed by the Y Combinator program as well as venture capitalists Greycroft Partners and Green Visor Capital and the Omidyar Network  It raised  10 million last year  FOREIGN INVESTMENT Shifts in Nigeria s payment culture have coincided with the arrival of foreign investors hoping to tap into sports betting  Industry experts say the sector generates about  1 billion a year and is likely to grow faster than in South Africa and Kenya where the business is more developed  Russia s 1XBet and Slovakia s DOXXbet have both set up in Nigeria in the last two years while Italy s Goldbet was ahead of the trend  taking a 50 percent stake in market leader Bet9ja when the Nigerian firm launched in 2015  NairaBET s Alabi said its sales were split between shops and online but the ease of electronic

218907,440423,CMCSA,Why Comcast  CMCSA  Is Poised To Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well positioned to maintain its earnings beat streak in its upcoming report  It is worth considering Comcast  CMCSA   which belongs to the Zacks Cable Television industry 
When looking at the last two reports  this cable provider has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates  The company has topped estimates by 6 56   on average  in the last two quarters 
For the most recent quarter  Comcast was expected to post earnings of  0 61 per share  but it reported  0 65 per share instead  representing a surprise of 6 56   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  0 61 per share  while it actually produced  0 65 per share  a surprise of 6 56  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for Comcast  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Comcast has an Earnings ESP of  0 36  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on January 23  2019 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-01-08,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-comcast-cmcsa-is-poised-to-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200374078,200374078

218966,440482,CMCSA,Is Away The Luggage Startup Of Investors  Dreams ,opinion,"A company that started out with a storybook and preorder code because their product wasn t ready has just landed a  50 million investment into their already growing and successful brand  Stephanie Korey and Jen Rubio founded a company called Away in 2015 
Prior to launching this startup  Korey and Rubio both worked at D2C store Warby Parker  They thought they could use the same direct to consumer approach with their own company  When they first started Away  the main idea behind it was to minimize any headaches that a flier may have and maximize a carry on s potential 
When travelling  people pay most attention to what they wear or where they are going  What s lacking is the need for a good piece of luggage  In an interview with Bond Street  Rubio mentioned that there isn t a luggage brand out there that talks about the way we travel or wants to connect with people about their experiences  That s why they wanted to create a product that was more than just a suitcase 
So What Exactly is Away  
Away is a NYC based startup company that sells luggage through the direct to consumer approach  The brand launched its first and only product in February 2016  a  225 hard shell carry on   Since then  due to customer demand and continued success  the company has expanded its line to different sized carry ons  kids  suitcases and even travels bags  Much like Warby Parker s idea of try at home glasses  customers can try out the suitcases for 100 days and if they are not satisfied  they can easily return them  Not only are these suitcases guaranteed for life  but they come with cool features like built in USB ports  combination locks and a built in laundry bag  
Today the company has sold more than half a million suitcases and just landed a multi million dollar investment from existing investors Forerunner Ventures  Global Founders Capital and Comcast  NASDAQ CMCSA  Ventures to continue its growth trajectory  According to   with this new money  Away may potentially be able to open six new stores by the end of the year  As well as opening new stores and landing an investment  the company will move into a 56 000 square foot office in New York and plans to add 249 jobs in the next five years 
Even though most of Away s products are sold online  they have started to open physical stores in New York  Los Angeles  and Austin  while also making its debut in foreign markets like London  Berlin and Milan  By opening these physical stores  Away has the opportunity to give its customers the real experience as they get to try their products in stores and potentially create a connection with them  which is what they strive to do 
One big part of Away is that they focus on storytelling as part of their marketing strategy  By finding stories they can feed to the press and social media  not only are they enhancing their brand image  but they are creating a storyline for their company  Consumers pay attention to what a company posts on its social media or what the media has to say about it  so by creating an experience that is worthwhile  consumers are bound to buy a suitcase that is more personalized to them and their story 
Looking into the Future 
With its recent  50 million investment  Away is on the right track to a successful business  Being in the market for more than two years now  it has the potential to keep growing and attracting more and more consumers  Not only has this woman led startup sparked creativity and ingenuity in the market  but it is creating experiences for their consumers to keep coming back to them

219205,440721,CMCSA,Snap Stock Dips To New All Time Low    Again,opinion,"Shares of Snap Inc    NYSE SNAP   slumped again on Friday  closing about 2 75  lower and touching a new all time low during afternoon trading hours  The struggling social media stock is now nearly 15  below its IPO price 
After closing at  14 89 per share on Thursday  Snap slipped as low as  14 34 a new all time bottom on Friday afternoon 
It s been a light news week for Snap  which felt the full force of several critical analyst reports last week  but the stock has been heading lower regardless  In fact  one of the few major stories we saw from the company this week is probably a good thing for the company 
Earlier this week  we learned that Snap partnered with NBC News to produce a twice daily headline news show  called  Stay Tuned   for the Snapchat app   Stay Tuned  began airing on Wednesday and is the first ever daily news show on Snapchat 
The show is supported by sponsorships and advertising  and NBC will reportedly share a portion of its ads revenue with Snap  Comcast  NASDAQ CMCSA  owned NBCUniversal invested  500 million in Snap during the company s IPO 
Nevertheless  Snap shares lost about more than 5  of their value during the week  This weak momentum comes as investors are starting to eye the company s post IPO lockup expiration date 
When a company goes public  its employees are temporarily barred from selling their equity for a certain period of time  For Snap  this window is set to close on July 31  and that means new shares could flood the market and send the stock even lower 
Holding SNAP over the next few weeks will not be an activity that I recommend for the faint of heart  There is even more volatility on the horizon  and if you re an investor that likes to avoid risk  this Zacks Rank  4  Sell  stock is probably not your best bet

3 Top Picks to Ride the Hottest Tech Trend
Zacks just released a Special Report to guide you through a space that has already begun to transform our entire economy   
Last year  it was generating  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  47 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce  the world s first trillionaires   but that should still leave plenty of money for those who make the right trades early ",2017-07-21,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/snap-stock-dips-to-new-all-time-low...-again-200202742,200202742
219206,440722,CMCSA,3 Reasons Why Comcast Corporation  CMCSA  Could Beat Earnings Estimates,opinion,"Comcast Corporation   NASDAQ CMCSA   is among the world s leading communication companies  providing basic cable  digital cable  and high speed internet services that connect people to what s important in their lives  More importantly  the company is prepared to release its quarterly earnings report before the market opens on July 27 
Comcast currently sports a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  has defeated its earnings projections in twelve of its past thirteen operational quarters  including an impressive beat last quarter of 20 45   Furthermore  Comcast operates in the Cable Television industry  which ranks in the top 48  of the Zacks Industry Rank 
Due to Comcast s adequate Zacks Rank  impressive earnings results history  and Earnings ESP of 2 08   investors should possess optimism heading toward the company s report date 
If that isn t enough  here are 3 additional reasons to be confident about Comcast as we approach July 27 
1        Impressive Style Scores
Comcast currently holds impressive Style Score ratings  including  A  grades for Growth and Momentum  as well as a  B  grade for Value  Comcast s  B  grade in Value is driven by a 5 04  earnings yield  as well as a PEG ratio of 2 20  both of which defeat the industry averages of 3 52  and 3 17  respectively 
Comcast s  A  grade in Growth is driven by a net margin of 11 12  and projected sales growth of 5 15   both of which beat industry averages  Additionally  Comcast s strong Momentum grade is partially due to its share price increase of 18 34  over the past year  which crushes the modest 7 79  gain of its industry peers 
2        Expansion to New Customers
In late March 2017  Comcast announced that it gained the rights to offer online TV services nationwide from several unnamed cable networks due to the  most favored nation  clause in its contract  This allows Comcast to sell its video services outside its regional territories  to new cities like New York and Los Angeles  for the first time  This marks Comcast s foray into online streaming TV services  thus diversifying its range of offerings  Also  Comcast is working on renegotiating long term deals with some its major partners  including CBS and ESPN 
3        Growth in Key Divisions
Comcast is projected to report revenue growth in several of its key divisions  According to our consensus estimates  Comcast s NBCUniversal division is expected to post 12 3  year over year revenue increase  bringing its quarterly total to around  7 9 billion  Furthermore  our consensus estimates call for Comcast to post 40  growth in its Filmed Entertainment division and 13  growth Theme Parks division  bringing these totals to around  1 9 billion and  1 3 billion  respectively 
These consensus estimates are from our exclusive non financial metrics estimate file  These estimates are updated daily and are based on the independent research of expert stock analysts  
Currently  the Zacks Consensus Estimates call for revenues of  20 82 billion and earnings of  0 48 per share  which would represent year over year growth of 8 03  and 16 27   respectively

219233,440749,CMCSA,Cord Cutters Stunned by TV Company s Comeback,opinion,"Cable s once rapt audience has been cutting the cord in droves 
But one left for dead company is making a shocking recovery 
Shares won t stay this cheap for long 
Thirty years ago  cable television was one of the most powerful forces in the world 
Through its walled garden  a person could get their news  movies and sports   all without leaving the comfort of their home 
Advertisers shelled out the biggest premiums to have their ads beamed directly to these rapt audiences 
Fast forward to today   after 20 years of high speed internet and 10 years of smartphone expansion   the game has changed completely 
Cable customers are cutting the cord in droves and advertisers  fat ad dollars have shifted dramatically in favor of mobile devices 
But as senior analyst Jonathan Rodriguez notes below  one left for dead cable services firm has made a shocking reversal  And it stands to make investors a killing 
Pause  rewind  fast forward 
It s been nearly two decades since cable watchers were given the power to perform these actions on a live TV program 
Sure  the VCR allowed viewers to tape their favorite shows or sporting events 
But you could only zip through this content after it was recorded   and audio visual quality wasn t nearly as good as it was on TV 
That all changed in the late 1990s  when TiVo  NASDAQ TIVO  Corp  s first digital recording device hit the market 
For the first time ever  users could record their cable or high quality satellite feeds and hit the pause button 
And while the recorded content was compressed from its original state  it was practically indistinguishable 
I was teenager then  but I ll never forget how profound the invention was   or still is 
Unfortunately  the idea of TV watchers fast forwarding through carefully curated ads didn t sit well with marketers 
TiVo waged a decade long war with advertisers   and cable providers  too  which came to market with competing recording devices in the 2000s 
To be sure  the company still faces the same pressures today 
But after years of unprofitability  the company finally saw positive earnings growth in 2011 
And several major developments have put profits on the horizon for TiVo and its shareholders 
If You Can t Beat  Em  Sell Out
After proving themselves profitable  TiVo was acquired by rival tech firm Rovi Corp  for  1 1 billion last year 
In September 2016  Rovi assumed TiVo s name and began trading under the ticker TIVO 
It s a little confusing  I know  But TiVo now represents the combined companies Rovi and the former TiVo 
Rovi not only acquired TiVo s existing customer base but also its portfolio of more than 280 patents  The combined company now holds more than 6 000 issued and pending tech patents 
In addition to subscription revenue  TiVo also licenses its patents out to firms building their own DVR tech 
Recently  subscription revenue has declined in tandem with a drop in cable viewership  But TiVo still commands a base of more than 20 million subscribers 
And the company has made up for the shortfalls through licensing   which now makes up 54  of total revenue 
In fact  TiVo just signed a multiyear licensing deal with Roku   the company that developed the wildly popular streaming TV device for cord cutters 
TiVo trades at just 10 times forward earnings   well below the industry average  25  and the S P 500  20   Earnings are also projected to rise 48  next year 
It also trades at 2 6 times trailing sales  compared with 5 7 for its peers 
And stock has a price to book value of 1 2   an 82  discount to the industry  6 8  
Better still  the company sports a 4  yield   nearly double the yield of the S P 500 
The company also received a favorable ruling against Comcast  NASDAQ CMCSA  over copyright infringement last week  which resulted in a 15  pop in shares 
And at a market cap of  2 billion  the company has plenty of room to grow   or be acquired itself 
Either way  with double digit earnings growth on deck for TiVo over the next two years  shares won t remain this cheap for long ",2017-06-07,Wall Street Daily,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cord-cutters-stunned-by-tv-company’s-comeback-200193679,200193679
219241,440757,CMCSA,Hulu to launch non stop customer service as it readies live TV,news," Reuters    Hulu will provide customer help 24 hours a day  seven days a week ahead of the upcoming launch of its live TV streaming service  and plans to open a service center by the fall  doubling investment in customer service over the next year so it can cope better with any glitches that arise  the company told Reuters this week 
The TV streaming service provider  which is owned by Walt Disney Co  Comcast Corp  NASDAQ CMCSA   21st Century Fox  and  Time Warner  Inc  NYSE TWX   will set up a new center in New Mexico or Texas by this fall and will hire 100 representatives this year  bringing its total to 300 
The increased spending on customer service comes as Hulu is about to go head to head with internet channels that offer live TV from AT T  NYSE T  s DirecTVNow and Dish Network Corp s Sling TV 
The services have had hiccups   like shows freezing  viewers getting error messages and system crashes  Their owners also have large customer service staffs already handling calls from their traditional pay TV customers  said Brett Sappington  senior director of research at Parks Associates 
The stakes are high for Hulu  which has a customer defection rate of 50 percent  according to Parks Associates  a Dallas based market research firm 
 Live TV is a challenge particularly for events like the Super Bowl and the Oscars which draw millions of subscribers all at the same time   Sappington said   You are never sure what s going to break until you have a few million people watching at the same time  
Social media has amplified the need for good service because upset customers are more likely to go to Twitter with their complaints rather than call the company itself  said Bernard Gershon  president of media and technology consulting firm Gershon Media 
Hulu will have staff available by phone 24 hours a day  seven days a week starting March 12  a change from the current hours of 5 a m  to 10 p m  Pacific Time  the company said  It will eventually add email and chat as well as social media 
Hulu  which currently has most of its reps working remotely  will open a customer service center by the fall  and plans to have a staff of 500 by 2018  The company would not disclose how much it is investing in customer service 
Currently  Hulu is running practice drills of potential glitches  said Ben Smith  a senior vice president at Hulu  In the next few weeks  Hulu will start running these drills on an unscheduled basis  he said 
 Everyone s plan is great until the emergency actually happens  he said ",2017-03-01,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/hulu-to-launch-non-stop-customer-service-as-it-readies-live-tv-463186,463186

219301,440817,CMCSA,AT T  Time Warner shares dip with worries about deal clearance,news,"By Jessica Toonkel and Supantha Mukherjee  Reuters    Wall Street signaled skepticism on Monday that AT T Inc  NYSE T  would secure the government approvals needed to carry out its planned  85 4 billion acquisition of  Time Warner  Inc  NYSE TWX   with shares of both companies falling as analysts scrutinized the deal   Time Warner shares were trading some 20 percent below the implied value of AT T s  107 50 per share cash and stock offer  indicating investors doubt that the companies would be able to complete the transaction  The deal  announced on Saturday  would give AT T control of cable TV channels HBO and CNN  film studio Warner Bros and other coveted assets and reshape the media landscape  Dallas based AT T said on Saturday it would need approval of the U S  Department of Justice and the companies were determining which Time Warner U S  Federal Communications Commission licenses  if any  would need to transfer to AT T  Any such transfers would require FCC approval   AT T Chief Executive Randall Stephenson said on Monday he expects government clearances for the deal because it is a so called vertical integration that will not eliminate a competitor  a situation that is viewed more favorably by antitrust enforcers    While regulators will often times have concerns with vertical integrations  those are always remedied by conditions imposed on the merger  so that s how we envision this one to play out   Stephenson told CNBC  Despite its big media footprint  Time Warner has only one FCC regulated broadcast station  WPCH TV in Atlanta  Time Warner could sell the license to try to avoid a formal FCC review  several analysts said  Any decision to review the deal would be made by regulatory officials at the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission  White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters on Monday   The president would hope and expect that regulators would carefully consider the potential impact of this deal on consumers   Earnest added  Shares of AT T closed down 1 7 percent at  36 86 and shares of Time Warner fell 3 percent to  86 78   FOCUS ON APPROVALS Investors  Wall Street analysts and traders on Monday expressed concerns about the implications of the antitrust and regulatory challenges    I don t know how favorably regulators will look upon this   said media investor Sanjay Sen  chief investment officer of BloombergSen Investment Partners of Toronto   The total value of broken deals is nearly  700 billion so far this year  a fact that has sidelined some investors    The regulatory environment has been unbelievable this year and I think everyone is on edge   said an arbitrage investor considering buying exposure to the deal who did not want to be identified because they were not authorized to speak to the press   The biggest deals to fall apart in 2016 include Office Depot Staples  Baker Hughes Halliburton  Allergan Pfizer and Norfolk Southern Canadian Pacific Railways  Many of the deals drew objections from the Department of Justice and U S  Treasury   We are unprepared at this point to assign anything higher than a 50 50 probability of deal approval   wrote MoffettNathanson Research in a report  downgrading Time Warner to  neutral  but raising its target price by  8 to  100  The deal s arbitrage spread of more than 20 percent is wider than five other recent deals that regulators subsequently shot down or were withdrawn  including Comcast  NASDAQ CMCSA  Corp s planned takeover of Time Warner Cable  That deal had a spread of only 5 percent   The deal  announced just over two weeks before the Nov  8 U S  election  was also generating skepticism among both Republicans and Democrats  OTHER QUESTIONS Others were unnerved by the rationale for the deal and the massive  170 billion debt balance the combined company may hold after the deal closes   The CEOs couldn t easily explain the synergies and I can t clearly understand them   said Sen  who also expressed concern about AT T embarking on a new deal so shortly after buying DirecTV last year for  48 5 billion   How successfully will it integrate these three large and different businesses   he asked   Analysts at Cowen   Co said it was a  struggle  to understand why the acquisition made sense    If it is simply differentiated content AT T is interested in we don t understand why this couldn t have been solved by some form of partnership   the firm wrote in a note to downgrade the company s investment rating to  market perform  from  outperform   Analysts at Moody s  which put AT T on review for a downgrade after the acquisition was announced  said regulators could include conditions that limit the wireless provider s ability to use Time Warner content as a competitive advantage  ultimately undermining its objective to differentiate its mobile and pay TV platforms with exclusive content  John Traynor  chief investment officer of People s United Wealth Management  which owns shares of both AT T and Time Warner  said his firm would vote for the deal as it looked like a good marriage of content and distribution   In the 1980s and 1990s it was all about hardware  For the last 10 years it s been all about connectivity and content   Traynor said   He expects the deal to face lengthy scrutiny by regulators but eventually to be completed   We ll be talking about this a year from now  but Comcast NBC got through   he said  referring to the  30 billion purchase of NBCUniversal by cable company Comcast

purchase of movie studio DreamWorks Animation  The scrutiny  announced the day before world leaders descend on China s eastern city of Hangzhou for a meeting of the Group of 20  underscores the

country s 1 4 billion people  even though there are signs that stellar box office growth may be starting to slow  Comcast announced the completion of the DreamWorks deal last week  The ministry has the power to fine companies it believes should have sought clearance  and can also force them to sell assets to get approval  or even to unwind transactions  If  Comcast  didn t file and they should have filed  this will be resolved with a fine and a press release   said Bruce McDonald  a veteran of the U S  Department of Justice  now at law firm Jones Day   Is this China just being tough on a U S  company  I don t think so  it might be them being sticklers for following Chinese filing rules   CONSUMER ANGER Lawyers said that the Didi deal to buy Uber s China unit had caused a stir among local consumers and rivals  The two ride hailing firms were already the number one and two top players together controlling around 90 percent of the market  The ministry had signaled its discontent with the two companies last month because they had not filed a merger application to the regulator   A representative for Uber referred questions to Didi  A Didi spokeswoman said   We are in communication with the authorities   Consumer groups and rivals have warned that fares could rise steeply if the two companies join forces  Both Uber and Didi had spent billions of dollars subsidizing fares in a price war to lure riders and drivers  Marc Waha  head of the antitrust practice at Norton Rose Fulbright in Hong Kong  said a key concern for the ministry would be the elimination of Uber as a competitor to Didi   If the market is considered to only comprise those two car hailing services  the transaction could be seen as a merger from two to one  which is likely to be problematic  however small the target is    Very often a small target acts as a maverick on the market  leading to low prices   he added  The ministry has developed a reputation globally as a tough regulator  but it has only blocked two transactions since China s antimonopoly law came into force in 2008  compared with 1 447 unconditional clearances  Norton Rose data shows  Faegre Baker Daniels s Yan added  however  Chinese regulators could end up with a deluge of new deals to work through if the latest probes were a sign of things to come

219400,440916,CMCSA,Will The FCC s Proposed Price Regulation Affect BDS Market ,opinion,"The Business Data Services  BDS  market  where telecom and cable multi service operators  MSO  provide a host of different network related services to business entities of different sizes  have been a lucrative source of revenues in the recent years for telecoms and cable MSO s  Notably  these service providers have been gaining generous revenues from the small and medium businesses  SMB  by often charging high prices 
As per the Consumer Federation of America  the trend has led to overcharging of services to the tune of  75 billion in the past five years  Consequently  the Federal Communications Commission  FCC  has proposed rules to regulate pricing in the market  citing low competition  However  such proposals have been criticized by the industry players except for certain smaller companies like Sprint Corp    NYSE S   and T Mobile US Inc    NYSE T   
Recent Trend
BDS market was dominated by telecom players like AT T Inc    NYSE T   and CenturyLink Inc    NYSE T    However  lucrative revenues and growth prospects of this particular industry has attracted many cable MSO s of late  with Charter Communications Inc    NYSE T   and Comcast  NASDAQ CMCSA  Corporation   NYSE S   jumping on the bandwagon to provide data related services to the SMB s  This has resulted in significant fiber investments across the country  even in the rural regions to reach out to businesses 
Notably  the cable MSO s have been focusing in this particular segment after facing depressing revenues in their video service offering  Thus  both the cable MSO s and telecom operators now have a substantial exposure to this segment 
Reaction to the Proposal
Industry response of this FCC proposal has been outright negative  Telecom players contend that after the influx of cable MSO s in the market  the competition has increased  Additionally  it highlighted that lower pricing would restrain them from deploying future technologies such as 5G wireless services  The cable MSO s too share a similar view  as they pointed out that regulating prices would lower return on investment  acting as a deterrent for future fiber investment 
The Bottom Line
While the whole industry lobbies to stop the regulation coming into effect  we must note that a price regulation will certainly help the small businesses which often face high charges for using data services  However  if FCC does go in favor of a regulation  the network footprint expansion across the country will be impacted  especially in rural areas  This can affect the smooth functioning of their business operations ",2016-08-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-the-fcc's-proposed-price-regulation-affect-bds-market-200149637,200149637

219421,440937,CMCSA,Trump pokes fun at his presidential style as  Saturday Night Live  host,news,"By Erin McPike and Alice Popovici
NEW YORK  Reuters    Candidate Donald Trump on Saturday satirized his imaginary presidency with a Washington Monument covered in gold mirrors and policy agenda made of magic in his turn as host of comedy show  Saturday Night Live  
The Republican front runner steered clear of making fun of an immigration plan that has angered Latinos but the show s writers did make sure he was called a  racist  during his opening monologue 
Actor Larry David stood to the side of the stage and yelled  racist  as Trump spoke  saying he heard he would make  5 000 for doing so    a reference to one group s offer to anyone who yelled that at Trump during the live NBC show 
During a sketch depicting Trump s cabinet two years into his term  Trump told his team  I don t have to get specific  about policy 
 With me  it s just magic   he said  a reference to his campaign trail promises that a Trump led United States would be so great  Americans would  get tired of winning  
Trump s appearance made light of his campaign s tendency to exaggerate and promise to improve the U S  economy without offering details  as well as his history of denigrating perceived weaknesses 
His daughter  Ivanka Trump  appeared as his interior secretary  saying the Washington Monument was now covered in gold mirrored glass  a mocking reference to Trump s preference for opulence and suggesting that Washington  D C   is not flashy enough for his taste 
Trump joked he was too tired to rehearse for one skit  and would instead live tweet  Graphics of Trump s comments then appeared on screen as he took aim at cast members for being low class or losers  referencing the manner in which he has slammed rivals on the campaign trail 
Trump s hosting gig  his second with the show  has been controversial since NBC announced it last month for giving the candidate the enviable exposure of one TV s most popular and long running shows 
The harshest criticism has come from Latino activists  who protested outside NBC s  O CMCSA  Manhattan studios on Saturday  saying the network was legitimizing the Republican presidential hopeful s  racist  views on immigration 
The former star of NBC reality show   The Apprentice  outraged many in June when he described Mexican immigrants as rapists and drug smugglers in announcing his candidacy  While making illegal immigration a main campaign theme  Trump has also said many of his employees are Hispanics and that they love him 
 Immigrants are not the enemy   Karina Garcia  a volunteer with activist group The Answer Coalition who was draped with the Mexican flag  told chanting protesters 
The show made a passing reference to the protest during its weekly  Weekend Update  segment 
Hispanic American groups and others say SNL s producers gave Trump a platform to try to take the sting out of what they say are his hateful views 
An NBC representative has said SNL would not comment on the Trump controversy  A spokeswoman for the Republican candidate said the campaign was not commenting either 
An estimated 53 million Hispanics make up about 17 percent of the U S  population and accounted for about 10 percent of the presidential vote in 2012 

The bloc has favored Democratic candidates in greater numbers in each election since 2004  and Republican officials have been trying to appeal to Latino voters  Party officials have told Trump his rhetoric is compromising their efforts ",2015-11-08,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/trump-pokes-fun-at-his-presidential-style-as-'saturday-night-live'-host-370212,370212

219473,440989,CMCSA,The Trump backlash  Latino consumers wield new clout,news,"By Herbert Lash and Nandita Bose NEW YORK CHICAGO  Reuters    When Donald Trump described Mexican immigrants as rapists and drug smugglers last month  Latinos took to social media to express their outrage and urge businesses to sever ties with the billionaire presidential candidate  In short order  more than 10 organizations canceled their deals with Trump  in what Latino activists are calling an unprecedented recognition of their economic clout  Latino spending power will hit  1 5 trillion this year  up 50 percent from 2010  according to the Nielsen Co  which analyzes consumer spending trends   At an average age of 27  the Hispanic population is a decade younger than the U S  average and just entering the prime of its earning power  market researchers said   Latino millennials have purchasing power and they re not going to tolerate Trump s comments   said Luis Fitch  a Mexican American co founder of UNO Branding  a marketing consultancy in Minneapolis   Corporations understand the numbers  they don t want to risk this   Hispanics under 30 were the single largest group behind a high profile  Dump Trump  petition to Macy s Inc  which got more than 730 000 signatures  according to Angelo Carusone  organizer of the petition by liberal activists Moveon org  Carusone said he was in close contact with Macy s for days before the department store chain said in a July 1 statement that it would phase out Trump s menswear collection because it had  no tolerance for discrimination    Continuing with a brand association that alienates a rising customer base and makes them think negatively about the company just doesn t make good business sense   said a Macy s official  who spoke on condition of anonymity   You just cannot ignore the buying power the community has and no retailer in their right mind would want to turn them away   Trump has stuck to his stance that many illegal immigrants coming across the Mexican border are criminals  but said that some of his criticism has been distorted    Many fabulous people come in from Mexico and our country is better for it   Trump said on Monday  SOCIAL MEDIA BOOM The backlash on social media was initially slow  On June 22  Univision s lead anchor  Jorge Ramos  challenged Trump to run his businesses without Mexican labor   A day without Mexicans would stop the Trump empire   Ramos wrote in an article published on Univision s website and his own blog  That same day  Adriana Almanza  a 28 year old admissions counsellor at Grand Valley State University in Grand Rapids  Michigan  posted a letter on Facebook  NASDAQ FB  addressed to Trump about her immigrant father  Raul  She said her father towers over Trump and represents the best of Mexico  humble and hard working   In two days  Almanza s letter had been shared more than 88 000 times  The buzz on social media increased as celebrities jumped in  including Colombian singer J Balvin   There is much hate and ignorance in your heart   wrote Ricky Martin  in Spanish  using the  latinosunidos  or Latinos united  Twitter  NYSE TWTR  hashtag  More than 11 000 tweets and retweets with that tag were sent in the past month  More tweets flooded in under the  yourefired and other hashtags  many from non Latinos   On June 25  Spanish language broadcaster Univision said it would not broadcast the Miss USA pageant and would cut ties to the Miss Universe Organization  a joint venture between Trump and Comcast  NASDAQ CMCSA  Corp s NBC Universal  In the following days and weeks  NBC Universal  NASCAR  ESPN  mattress maker Serta  clothing maker PVH Corp  NYSE PVH   hair products manufacturer Farouk Systems  perfume maker Parlux Fragrances  the Professional Golfers  Association and several restaurants and chefs all ended deals Trump  ECONOMIC MUSCLES A decade ago  Latinos flexed their political muscles with nationwide demonstrations over immigration reform  This is the first time corporations have responded broadly to Latino pressure  said Jorge Chapa  a professor of Latino Studies and government affairs at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign   What I think is unique about the response to Trump was the fact that major corporates also took action   Chapa said  Trump s general counsel  Alan Garten  said his boss s comments had been taken out of context by the media   To say  Trump  is anti Mexico or anti the Mexican people would be completely inaccurate   he said  Garten said Trump s political campaign is thriving  pointing to recent polling that shows him in second place in the race to be the Republican Party s nominee for the 2016 election   Garten also pointed out that Univision and NBC Universal had not formally pulled Trump s Miss USA pageant  while ESPN s decision to pull a golf tournament from a Trump course was a one off event with no significant financial impact  Still  Trump argued in a  500 million lawsuit against Univision that with no Spanish language broadcast  his pageants will likely lose  tens if not hundreds of millions  of dollars in revenue from advertising  promotions  sponsorship  licensing and merchandising  Univision has called Trump s complaint  factually false and legally ridiculous   A new five year contract for exclusive Spanish language broadcast rights  signed in January  was worth  13 5 million to Trump  according to the suit filed last month

219482,440998,CMCSA,Regional Feds  head hunting under scrutiny over insider bias  delays,news,By Jonathan Spicer and Michael Flaherty NEW YORK WASHINGTON  Reuters    Efforts to fill top positions at some U S  Federal Reserve regional branches are casting a spotlight on a decades old process that critics say is opaque  favors insiders  and is ripe for reform   Patrick Harker took the reins as president of the Philadelphia Fed this week  in an appointment that attracted scrutiny because he served on the committee of directors that interviewed other prospective candidates for the job he ultimately took   The Dallas Fed has been without a permanent president for more than three months as that search process stretches well into its eighth month  And the Fed s Minneapolis branch abruptly announced the departure of its leader  Narayana Kocherlakota  more than a year before he was due to go  with no replacement named to date  The delays and reliance on Fed employees in picking regional Fed presidents can only embolden Republican Senator Richard Shelby to push harder for a makeover of the central bank s structure  which has changed little in its 101 years  A bill passed in May by the Senate Banking Committee that Shelby chairs would strip the New York Fed s board of its power to appoint its presidents  And it could go further  given the bill would form a committee to consider a wholesale overhaul of the Fed s structure of 12 districts  which has not changed through the decades of shifting U S  populations and an evolving economy  The bill is part of a broader conservative effort to expose the central bank to more oversight  and some analysts saw the Philadelphia Fed s choice as reinforcing the view that the Fed needs to open up more to outsiders  Nine of 11 current regional presidents came from within the Fed  a proportion that has edged up over time  Twenty years ago  seven of 12 were insiders    The process seems to create a diverse set of candidates in which the insider is almost always accepted   said Aaron Klein  director of a financial regulatory reform effort at the Bipartisan Policy Center  Since it was created in 1913  the central bank s decentralized structure was meant to check the power of Washington  where seven Fed governors with permanent votes on policy are appointed by the White House and approved by the Senate   The 12 Fed presidents who are picked by their regional boards usually vote on policy every two or three years  and they tend to hold more diverse views  Former Richmond Fed President Alfred Broaddus told Reuters the regional Fed chiefs have more freedom  to do and say things that may not be politically popular  because they are not politically appointed   On the other hand  there is the question of legitimacy since they are appointed by local boards who are not elected     TONE DEAF  Two thirds of regional Fed directors are selected by local bankers  while the rest are appointed by the Fed s Board of Governors in Washington  Critics question how well those regional boards   mostly made of the heads of corporations and industry groups meant to represent the public   fulfill their mission  Last year  a non profit group representing labor unions and community leaders organized by the Center for Popular Democracy  urged the Fed s Philadelphia and Dallas branches to make the selection of their presidents more transparent and to include a member of the public in the effort  Philadelphia s Fed in particular proved  tone deaf  in its head hunting effort  said Lou Crandall  chief economist at Wrightson ICAP  LONDON IAP  in Jersey City  New Jersey  Harker was a Philadelphia Fed director when the board started looking to replace president Charles Plosser  who left on March 1  and he was among the six directors who interviewed more than a dozen short listed candidates for the job  according to the Philadelphia Fed   But on Feb  18  Harker floated his own name  recused himself from the process and a week later his colleagues on the board unanimously appointed him as the new president   While the selection follows Fed guidelines and was approved by its Board of Governors  it raised questions of transparency and fairness    The Philadelphia Fed s search process might have made perfect sense in a corporate environment  but is obviously problematic for an official institution   said Crandall   The board s chair and vice chair  Swathmore Group founder James Nevels and Michael Angelakis of Comcast Corp  NASDAQ CMCSA   respectively  declined to comment  as did Harker  Peter Conti Brown  an academic fellow at Stanford Law School s Rock Center for Corporate Governance  and an expert witness at a Senate Banking Committee hearing this year  proposed to let the Fed Board appoint and fire regional Fed presidents or at least have a say in the selection process   In the past  reform proposals for the 12 regional Fed banks have focused on decreasing or increasing their number and their governance  Changes to the way the regional Fed bosses are chosen could strengthen the influence of lawmakers at the expense of regional interests   For now  delays in appointments of new chiefs force regional banks to send relatively unknown deputies to debate monetary policy at meetings in Washington  as Dallas and Philadelphia did last month when the Fed considered raising interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade  The Minneapolis Fed still has time to find a new president before Kocherlakota steps down at year end   For now the Fed criticism is just noise  mostly from Republicans   said Greg Valliere  chief political strategist at Potomac Research Group   But once the Fed begins to raise interest rates     then the left will weigh in as well     Additional reporting Ann Saphir in San Francisco  Editing by Tomasz Janowski  OLUSPOLITIC Reuters US Online Report Politics News 20150702T163032

All day you ll be able to flip back and forth between a creepy old guy and a fat a guy hiding behind a mask  If you flip fast enough  the images will melt together to form Gene Simmons  
Who wins in a Freddy versus Jason fight  You d think it s Freddy because he can get you in your sleep  but look at how many tricky teens have pulled Freddy out of dreamland  I gotta go with Jason because he s a madman that will kill you with anything he can get his hands on  He can get you with knives  throw you out of windows or slam you against trees  Little Freddy wouldn t stand a chance  
But who wins the battle of the parent companies  Comcast is a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  but has a VGM score of A  The Cable TV industry  surprisingly is in the Top 6  of our Zacks Industry Rank  Viacom is a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  right now  in a Media Conglomerates industry that ranks in the Bottom 10  of our Zacks Industry Rank  So if you re looking for a winner between the two  I d have to say Comcast is the hands down winner here  
Shares of Comcast have been trading sideways for the last month along with the rest of the market  We are near the top end of its trading range above  60  The 200 day moving average sits in the middle of that range and is virtually horizontal  That tells me this stock is range bound and will likely remain that way over the intermediate term ",2016-05-13,Zacks Investment Research,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/friday-the-13th-freddy-vs-jason,-comcast-vs-viacom-200129891",200129891

219506,441022,CMCSA,Frontier Communications  FTR   What s Up In Q1 Earnings ,opinion,"Frontier Communications Corporation   NASDAQ FTR   is slated to release first quarter 2016 results on May 3  before the market opens 
In the last reported quarter  the company s earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a huge 266 67   However  the company has delivered positive earnings surprises in three of the four trailing quarters  with an average beat of 164 27   Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors Likely to Influence this Quarter
Frontier s security solutions division  Frontier Secure  has been a solid source of growth for the company  The division witnessed 141  growth in operating income at the end of the fourth quarter of 2015 and its subscriptions made a significant contribution to the Average Revenue per Customer  ARPC  for the company  Moreover  it has partnered with DistiNow to distribute its security solutions  which we believe can generate further revenues for Frontier 
Recently  Frontier launched its latest line of services branded as  Vantage    a premium digital platform to deliver HD TV  ultra fast broadband and enhanced Voice over Internet Protocol  VoIP  services  The services will be made available to customers as Vantage TV  Vantage Internet  and Vantage Voice  respectively  With the launch of the Vantage brand  Frontier will join the likes of AT T Inc  NYSE T  and Comcast Corp   NASDAQ CMCSA   which have witnessed success with their respective U Verse and Xfinity brands  We believe that with the introduction of a premium brand  the company can maintain sustainable broadband subscriber growth 
Also  Frontier is leaving no stones unturned in deriving benefits from the growing Business Service Segment  In particular  Frontier has been targeting the Small and Medium Businesses  SMBs   It has been enhancing its Ethernet capabilities lately and eyeing the retention of SMB customers with attractive plans  However  the persistent decline in the residential voice segment is a major headwind 
Earnings Whispers 
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Frontier Communications is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  Unfortunately  that is not the case here  as elaborated below 
Zacks ESP Frontier Communications has an Earnings ESP of 0 00   This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at a loss of 9 cents 
Zacks Rank Frontier Communications has a Zacks Rank  3 which increases the predictive power of ESP  However  we need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings surprise 
Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or  5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
A Stock to Consider
Here is a company you may consider  as our model shows it has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter

219507,441023,CMCSA,AT T Greatly Increases The Cost Of Cutting The Cord,opinion,"AT T  NYSE T  has apparently lost patience with customers who forgo TV packages to stream content with internet only service  The company s newest pricing model greatly increases costs for these  cord cutters  
On April 29  2016  I received an email from AT T announcing a dramatic change to the company s internet service  No longer will AT T tolerate unlimited use of internet bandwidth at current prices  AT T has decided to implement a pricing model for its internet service that is very similar to the model it uses for data plans on smartphones 
Starting May 23  2016  AT T will establish a usage limit on internet service  If customers exceed that limit  AT T will charge them  10 for each 50GB in excess of the limit  At least AT T will cap the overage charge at  100 per month  I imagine heavy users of streaming services like Netflix  Hulu  and YouTube can easily hit the allowance every month  Cord cutters  like myself  are exactly the customers most likely to fall into this category of heavy user  For this reason  I feel AT T s policy directly targets cord cutters 
At the time of writing  AT T does not provide specifics on the allowance or offer a way to review past internet usage  Customers may not be able to gauge their risk for exceeding AT T s internet allowance until after May 23rd 
There are two things customers can do to reduce the cost of heavy internet use  My preferred option is to pay an additional  30 month to retain the  privilege  of unlimited internet use  This represents a VERY painful 67  price increase  AT T also offers a bundling option  If customers subscribe to DIRECTV or U verse TV  AT T will provide unlimited internet service  The bundle option is more expensive because of the leasing charge for a cable box and the minimum  100  110  DIRECTV U Verse  customers must spend on the bundle with internet service minimally good enough for streaming  Separately  the lowest option for TV  DIRECTV or U Verse  is  50 and for minimal internet is  40  AT T no longer offers a bargain basement option that only provides local TV channels 
Here is the message AT T sent to customers 

 Beginning on May 23  2016  we will be increasing the U verse  Internet data allowance for many customers  After a grace period  and as our agreement provides  there s a  10 charge for each 50GB of data you use over the allowance amount  The maximum overage charge will be  100 mo  If you choose to bundle your U verse Internet with DIRECTV  or U verse TV you will be provided an unlimited Internet data allowance with a  30 value at no additional charge  as a benefit of bundling  Or if you choose  an unlimited allowance is available for purchase as an optional bolt on to your Internet service for an additional  30 mo  

Notice how AT T cleverly attempts to use marketing to ease the pain of this message  AT T starts by giving the  good news  that data allowances have increased  Of course  customers had no idea AT T had a data allowance in the first place  Next  AT T positions the  30 price increase for unlimited internet as an added value of choosing a bundled option  Bottom line  cord cutting just got a lot more expensive 
I will very likely abandon ship and cut over to Comcast  aka Xfinity  for internet service  However  I strongly suspect Comcast will one day adopt AT T s anti cord cutting pricing model  For now  cord cutters can get Comcast s internet service minimally good enough for streaming for  50  For another  10  customers can get 10 local TV channels  For a limited time  customers who order this package online will also get HBO streaming through the Xfinity app  Given   I just MIGHT consider spending the extra  10 bucks  but I doubt I will go there anytime soon 
UPDATE  In certain areas of the country  Comcast implements what it calls    for certain customers    Customers can get unlimited internet by paying an extra  30 35 per month or by signing up for some other bundled plan  This is exactly the same pricing model as AT T  I was just not aware of it since I have not had Comcast internet in a long time  In other areas of the country  Comcast gave up on caps  Here is Comcast s explanation 

 Effective May 17  2012  we suspended enforcement of our previous 250 GB static cap while we trialed more flexible data usage plans  Our goal is to provide options that benefit consumers while also ensuring that all of our customers enjoy the best possible Internet experience over our high speed Internet service  To accomplish this  we have been trialing improved data usage management approaches that are in step with plans that other Internet service providers in the market are using and will provide our customers with more choice and flexibility than our previous static cap  

Comcast s plans and rules and limitations are numerous and a bit involved  So before signing up for Comcast internet  I am definitely going to call and the details that apply to my specific locale

219513,441029,CMCSA,Why Has RGR Returned 5X The S P 500 ,opinion,"Quick  how many Comcast Corp  NASDAQ CMCSA  technicians does it take to fix a DVR 
Eight  evidently  and my DVR is still not working after five weeks of calling offshore customer service centers  visiting technicians who are guaranteed to arrive within a  two hour window   and even the company s executive resolution team 
Sadly  my predicament isn t unusual  and there s no way I d recommend investing in the company as a result  There are thousands of companies who claim to be all about their customers when  in fact  their customers might as well be an inconvenience based on how they re treated 
I m sharing my predicament with you for a reason   buying  what you know  used to be a fundamental underpinning of investment success  Now  it s a recipe for disaster 
We re going to talk about that today and  as always  I m going to highlight a company where customers are truly the most important part of their business 
It s a distinction that s helped this company outperform the S P 500 by 5 to 1 and led to returns 100 times greater than those achieved by Comcast   a popular investment choice   over roughly the same time frame 
What I Really Meant Was 
Investing icon and onetime mutual fund manager Peter Lynch ran the Fidelity Magellan Fund from 1977 to 1990  In the process  he achieved a remarkable 29 2  average annual return that more than doubled the S P 500 over the same time frame  He was so successful that an estimated 1 in every 100 Americans invested with him for reasons that are easily understandable even today   it was the world s best performing mutual fund 
Lynch achieved near rock star status and coined a number of modern investing mantras  the most famous of which is  invest in what you know  
It was an ode to the common man at a time when there weren t many  common  men on Wall Street  and one I took to heart early in my career 
Lynch believed that individual investors are far more capable of making money when it comes to stocks than fund managers because they have the luxury of spotting unique trends in their day to day lives 
He noted in his books and frequently during interviews at the time that he came across many great profit opportunities while driving around with his family  visiting the mall  or simply buying something at the store 
I don t disagree 
Personal knowledge can be a very powerful driver when it comes to your money  However  that s also where Lynch and I parted company 
You see  buying what you know can also work against you  especially lately 
Take Weight Watchers International Inc  NYSE WTW   for example 
The dietary company got a huge boost when uber celebrity Oprah Winfrey jumped on board as an investor last October  Millions of investors piled on  simplistically reasoning that if  I know Oprah like I think I know Oprah  I should buy in  too  
Unfortunately  that never ends well 
Doing so is really an emotional judgement  nothing more 
And  as we have talked about many times  making investment decisions based on emotions is  with your money 
Success is always about real numbers 
Weight Watchers recently reported a loss of  0 03 per share  Analysts expected a profit of  0 03 per share  so we re talking about a  0 06 swing  Worse  the number of active users dropped by 4 8  to 2 39 million people 
The company still has some terribly difficult challenges ahead  including competition from other more successful programs  wearable technology  and the emergence of healthy grocers 
No doubt that millions of investors who have watched their wallets get thinner as the stock has tumbled from a high of  26 56 a share last December to around  15 a share today are probably wishing they didn t  know  Oprah right about now and  instead   knew  the numbers 
Interestingly  after years of quietly remaining in the shadows  Lynch surfaced and dropped a bombshell during a Wall Street Journal interview published last December  saying effectively that  buying what you know  hadn t been what he meant 
And what exactly did Lynch mean 
Precisely what I ve just shared with you  that you ve got to  know  the numbers 
Why You Know a Company Matters When It Comes to Profits
There s a big difference between investing in what you know and why you know it 
Take Sturm Ruger   Company Inc  NYSE RGR   for example 
Most people are acutely aware of the gun debate raging in this country  And  whether they love the idea of investing in a gun stock or hate the idea of investing in a gun stock  they  know  most of the companies involved at least anecdotally  including Ruger 
The fabled firearms maker doesn t need much to lure in legions of new customers and keep the ones they have  The Unstoppable Trend  War  Terrorism  and Ugliness  will see to that  albeit very unfortunately 
Gun sales increase every time there s another mass shooting or terrorist event because people want to protect themselves  And it s not just here either  Shotguns and handguns alike are selling out in Europe as the migrant crisis accelerates 
Every time Congress starts talking about gun control  sales rise  And when the president starts in on guns  they skyrocket because people fear that they ll soon be unobtainable 
My point is that there s plenty to  know  about the gun industry and Ruger  in particular because the company offers legendary customer service  strong dealer support  and powerful incentives like a points program to keep customers coming back 
And the numbers bear that out 
As does Ruger s stock chart 

No doubt  that s a powerful draw for investors  especially in choppy markets 
What I want you to understand at the end of the day is this 
There s a big difference between buying a company because you know it   like Ruger   and being stuck with one like I am with Comcast 
So do yourself a favor and look beyond what you think you  know  because the answers may surprise you and your wallet 
Ruger has returned 270  over the past four years while Comcast has eked out only 2 48  over roughly the same time frame   a more than 100 to 1 advantage

219543,441059,CMCSA,New Internet rules set up industry s next battle,news,"By Leila Abboud and Julia Fioretti BARCELONA BRUSSELS  Reuters    New rules that aim to protect the openness of the Internet will allow telecom and cable groups to prioritize and earn potentially vast income from some types of data  setting up likely clashes with regulators in the future  Telecom companies such as AT T  NYSE T  and Vodafone have convinced U S  and European regulators  finalizing so called  net neutrality  rules  to allow them to dedicate network capacity to services such as providing connectivity to driverless cars and facilitating the exchange of medical data between patients and health professionals  Whether this proves to be a loophole or a necessary protection will only be known later  The industry will be able to develop such  specialized services  as long as they do not hurt the delivery of the normal Internet to homes and businesses  The firms expect such services could generate billions in revenue one day as everyday tasks are increasingly connected to the web  Telecom and cable companies argue being able to charge for different services and speeds would help fund network upgrades and develop new industrial uses for the web  such as smart electricity meters  Silicon Valley and net neutrality activists counter that such treatment would lead to a two speed system where telecom and cable groups could prioritize their own content and squeeze out start ups who cannot pay  Antonios Drossos  a net neutrality advocate at consultancy Rewheel Ltd in Finland  said the U S  FCC and European regulators would handle the issue of what was permitted under  specialized services  on a case by case basis    It comes down to whether you trust the network operators  Do you believe they want to do health care and connected cars  or are they just looking for a loophole around the net neutrality   The debate about whether all web traffic should be treated equally has become a hot issue because of disputes between network operators and bandwidth hungry services such as Google s Youtube and Netflix and attempts by some telecom and cable companies to block services like Skype and file sharing software Bit torrent  The issue will be one focus of discussion this week at Mobile World Congress  the telecoms industry s annual conference  where U S  Federal Communications Commission  FCC  head Tom Wheeler will speak on Tuesday  OPPORTUNITY FOR EUROPE Some European telecoms executives believe that the region will take a more accommodating stance on net neutrality in the future than the U S   where the FCC on Thursday expanded its powers to police broadband companies  The new European Commission under President Jean Claude Juncker wants to spur growth by encouraging telecoms firms to invest in faster broadband infrastructure  so is advocating a softer regulatory line on the industry  The FCC voted in the U S  to regulate broadband as a utility like service  ending decades of a light touch approach to companies like Verizon and Comcast  NASDAQ CMCSA O   A high level European telecom executive said European carriers could jump ahead in developing new businesses that use their networks to collect mountains of sensor data from everything to connected cars to factory production  while their U S  peers are mired in regulatory uncertainty  U S  Internet service providers or their trade associations are expected to challenge the new regulations in court  potentially dragging into 2016   There is a real opportunity to re launch European innovation in the so called industrial Internet   said the executive   A window will exist for Europe to take the lead in connected devices if policymakers set the right net neutrality rules   A U S  telecoms lobbyist acknowledged that development of such services could be slowed if companies felt that regulators were looking over their shoulders   I think when we talk about a connected fridge  we don t yet know    lots of future products are unclear   the person said    If there are robust protections for non Internet broadband services  we ll continue to innovate and remain ahead of Europe  If I don t know which bucket my service is going to fall into    that s not a great answer to have   MORE SANGUINE IN EUROPE The political environment on net neutrality in the U S  and Europe is very different  While U S  network operators are up in arms about the FCC taking new regulatory authority on broadband  their European peers are more accustomed to harsher regulation  Europeans also have more choice of broadband providers because of rules forcing former state owned telecom groups to share their line into homes with rivals  while Americans typically only have a choice between a local cable monopoly and a telecom carrier  Tom Phillips  who heads regulatory affairs for telecoms trade group GSMA  said European carriers can live with the coming net neutrality rules because a patchwork of different national laws would be worse  The Netherlands and Slovenia have their own net neutrality rules  Dutch regulators in January fined carriers KPN 250 000 euros and Vodafone 200 000 euros for breaking the rules   The European operators are pragmatic and would prefer to get a European policy done so as not leave a vacuum for member states to fill   said Phillips  A challenge for regulators globally will be policing whether telecom and cable companies are using  specialized services  as a way around the obligation to treat traffic equally   
The European Parliament  which passed net neutrality rules last April now being negotiated with member states  tried to build in protections against this issue  But those are likely to be watered down in the final version of the law  experts say  under pressure from industry ",2015-03-01,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/new-internet-rules-set-up-industry's-next-battle-330268,330268

The idea was that the technology would not only support HBO but potentially other Time Warner offerings  such as Turner Broadcasting and Warner Bros  The platform  which would power a product that doesn t require a cable subscription  would be used globally and was supposed to be ready in 2016  said the sources  who worked on that effort 
But these sources said that much of the plan was changed when Rupert Murdoch s Twenty First Century Fox Inc FOXA O made a surprise takeover bid for Time Warner last summer 
To justify to shareholders why they shouldn t consider the Australian born media tycoon s overtures  Time Warner said that its own strategic plan would deliver more value to shareholders than Murdoch could 
COST CUTTING
In October  at its first investor day in four years  Time Warner outlined a series of measures aimed at bolstering revenue growth and cutting costs  Among those was an announcement by HBO s CEO Richard Plepler that the standalone HBO was going to launch in 2015  news that quickly became the main headline from the event 
 Time Warner needed to show investors that they had a plan that the Murdoch bid was not factoring in   said Michael Nathanson  a media analyst at MoffettNathanson research 
At the time  HBO also decided to cancel the internal technology investment  and to use a third party to provide the new HBO service  a move in sync with a cost efficiency plan driven by Time Warner s Chief Financial Officer Howard Averill 
The more ambitious platform was going to eat up too many dollars and be too slow to come to market  sources familiar with Time Warner s thinking said 
The sources said the decision to speed up the standalone product was not related to the battle with Murdoch  They said this year was viewed as simply the right time for the initiative given that rival media companies were starting to debut online offerings outside of a traditional cable subscription  Dish Network is launching its own  20 per month Internet service later this month and CBS CBS N has said that its Showtime network  the biggest direct competitor to HBO  will sell its own separate offering later this year 
Shortly after the October announcement  HBO told its engineering team about the decision to cancel plans to develop its own technology platform  Instead of being developed internally  technology would be handled by MLB Advanced Media  a subsidiary of Major League Baseball best known for powering the technology that streams live baseball games  Going with this vendor would save millions  one of the sources close to Time Warner said 
A person who had worked on the earlier HBO strategy said that pulling back from building its own platform may come back to haunt the network   HBO and Time Warner lost the appetite for the investment required to go big here   the person said   Old media lost its nerve  
The people who worked on the earlier effort say there are drawbacks to having a third party handle distribution of the product  including having less control over how subscribers experience it  They say HBO could be missing out on the long term potential of owning all of the software behind the standalone service 
An HBO spokesman  in a statement  said  any business strategy undergoes many iterations   and that it was confident in its decision   We believe we landed in exactly the right place with MLB Advanced Media as our partner  and we will deliver a great product later this year that fully lives up to the reputation of the HBO brand   he said 
DEPARTURES
Among the casualties of the decision was Berkes  He left amid tensions with HBO management over his role following the change in strategy  the people who worked on the effort said  Thomas and Angeloff are leaving for similar reasons  these people said 
The 80 or so employees in Seattle still have jobs but HBO is without a CTO and has no immediate plans to hire a new one 
HBO declined to comment on the departures 
As for the big debut  the launch plans are still vague  Company insiders had anticipated an April start date to leverage off the fifth season of the top HBO series Game of Thrones  But a source close to the matter said HBO has other big shows beginning in the summer  such as a new series of True Detective  that any launch could leverage off 
The pricing of the new product and how it will be sold could not be learned  The company is exploring a number of options  including selling the standalone through pay TV providers like Comcast Corp CMCSA O  and through the likes of Apple AAPL O and Amazon  one source close to the company said ",2015-01-29,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/hbo-tech-executives-leave-ahead-of-internet-launch-as-network's-strategy-changes-325590,325590

219573,441089,CMCSA,Buy In May And Tap Dance Away,opinion,"The proverbial Wall Street adage that urges investors to  Sell in May  and go away  in order to avoid a seasonally volatile period from May to October has driven speculative trading strategies for generations  The basic premise behind the plan revolves around the idea that people have better things to do during the spring and summer months  so they sell stocks  Once the weather cools off  the thought process reverses as investors renew their interest in stocks during November  If investing was as easy as selling stocks on May 1 st and then buying them back on November 1st  then we could all caravan in yachts to our private islands while drinking from umbrella filled coconut drinks  Regrettably  successful investing is not that simple and following na ve strategies like these generally don t work over the long run 
Even if you believe in market timing and seasonal investing  the prohibitive transaction costs and tax implications often strip away any potential statistical advantage 
Unfortunately for the bears  who often react to this type of voodoo investing  betting against the stock market from May   October during the last two years has been a money losing strategy  Rather than going away  investors have been better served to  Buy in May  and tap dance away   More specifically  the S P 500 index has increased in each of the last two years  including a  10  surge during the May October period last year 
Nervous  Why Invest Now 

With the weak recent economic GDP figures and stock prices off by less than 1  from their all time record highs  why in the world would investors consider investing now  Well  for starters  one must ask themselves   What options do I have for my savings cash   Cash has been and will continue to be a poor place to hoard funds  especially when interest rates are near historic lows and inflation is eating away the value of your nest egg like a hungry sumo wrestler  Anyone who has completed their income taxes last month knows how pathetic bank rates have been  and if you have pumped gas recently  you can appreciate the gnawing impact of escalating gasoline prices 
While there are selective opportunities to garner attractive yields in the bond market  as exploited in Sidoxia Fusion strategies  strategist and economist Dr  Ed Yardeni points out that equities have approximately  50  higher yields than corporate bonds  As you can see from the chart below  stocks  blue line  are yielding profits of about  6 6  vs  4 2  for corporate bonds  red line   In other words  for every  100 invested in stocks  companies are earning  6 60 in profits on average  which are then either paid out to investors as growing dividends and or reinvested back into their companies for future growth 

Hefty profit streams have resulted in healthy corporate balance sheets  which have served as ammunition for the improving jobs picture  At best  the economic recovery has moved from a snail s pace to a tortoise s pace  but nevertheless  the unemployment rate has returned to a more respectable 6 7  rate  The mended economy has virtually recovered all of the approximately 9 million private jobs lost during the financial crisis  see chart below  and expectations for Friday s jobs report is for another  220 000 jobs added during the month of April 

Wondrous Wing Woman
Investing can be scary for some individuals  but having an accommodative Fed Chair like Janet Yellen on your side makes the challenge more manageable  As I ve pointed out in the past  with the help of    the Fed s stimulative  Quantitative Easing  program counter intuitively raised interest rates during its implementation  What s more  Yellen s spearheading of the unprecedented  40 billion bond buying reduction program  a k a    Taper   has unexpectedly led to declining interest rates in recent months  If all goes well  Yellen will have completed the  85 billion monthly tapering by the end of this year  assuming the economy continues to expand 
In the meantime  investors and the broader financial markets have begun to digest the unwinding of the largest  most unprecedented monetary intervention in financial history  How can we tell this is the case  CEO confidence has improved to the point that  have been announced this year  including offers by Pfizer Inc   NYSE PFE       100 billion   Facebook Inc  NASDAQ FB      19 billion   and Comcast Corporation  NASDAQ CMCSA       45 billion  
Banks are feeling more confident too  and this is evident by the acceleration seen in bank loans  After the financial crisis  gun shy bank CEOs fortified their balance sheets  but with five years of economic expansion under their belts  the banks are beginning to loosen their loan purse strings further  see chart below  

The coast is never completely clear  As always  there are plenty of things to worry about  If it s not Ukraine  it can be slowing growth in China  mid term elections in the fall  and or rising tensions in the Middle East  However  for the vast majority of investors  relying on calendar adages  i e   selling in May  is a complete waste of time  You will be much better off investing in attractively priced  long term opportunities  and then tap dance your way to financial prosperity

219574,441090,CMCSA,AT T s Satellite TV Gambit,opinion,"With so many transformative  mega deals being announced this year  it s not a surprise that AT T  NYSE T  wants a piece of the action  Regulators previously rejected AT T s plan to acquire of T Mobile US  NYSE TMUS  in 2011 for  39 billion  Now  AT T has announced its intention to purchase DIRECTV  NASDAQ DTV  for just under  49 billion 
But the question is  Will this deal even help AT T considering that growth in the satellite TV industry is stagnating 
There s no denying that bundling video  broadband and voice makes for a much stronger competitive service  But Forrester Research s Jim Nail suggests that AT T wants something else 
 This is a way for them to get their hands on some cash to help accelerate the build out that they need to do  to grow their footprint and get the kind of scale where they can compete with those established cable players  
Let s look at what else AT T stands to gain from the merger 
An additional  2 5 billion annual cash flow 
15 million more broadband customers 
A contract to broadcast NFL Sunday Ticket  generating  1 billion annually  
These benefits may seem attractive  but it s uncertain just how large the potential synergies could be  to say the least  And if the NFL deal isn t renewed  AT T has the option to back out of the deal 
Although  the biggest obstacle for AT T may be the regulators  once again  This consolidation in the media industry leave five major players  assuming both the  NASDAQ Comcast   NYSE Time Warner Cable  and AT T DirecTV deals go through 
Consumers would be left with far fewer choices  For this reason  AT T s proposed deal is coming under serious scrutiny 
But that may actually be a blessing in disguise 
Dividend   Income Daily s Editor in Chief  Alan Gula  draws a scary parallel between the  and other mega deals in the past  which ended horribly 
So  perhaps investors should pray that the U S  Department of Justice blocks this deal  and in the process saves AT T from itself so that history doesn t repeat

219575,441091,CMCSA,5 Monthly Dividend Stocks To Consider Now,opinion,"In December I compiled a list of Monthly Dividend Stocks to Snag in 2014  which has proven to be one of my most popular articles of the past year   It s not hard to see the appeal of a monthly dividend  particularly if you are retired and living off your investments   Your expenses including everything from house and car payments to your utilities and mobile phone bill are almost always on a monthly cycle  whereas most income producing investments pay quarterly or semiannually   A monthly dividend makes basic budgeting and planning a whole lot easier 
But let s say that you re still years from retirement   A monthly dividend is still preferable because  if you reinvest your dividends in new shares  your share count will grow faster  speeding up the process of compounding   This matters very little over the course of a single month   But over an investing lifetime  it can have an outsized effect on your returns 
Today  I m going to give you five new monthly dividend stocks   But first  let s quickly review my list from December   In the last article  I recommended monthly payers Realty Income  NYSE O   American Realty Capital Properties  NASDAQ ARCP   Banco Bradesco  NYSE BBD   Banco Ita   NYSE ITUB   Whitestone REIT  NYSE WSR   and Student Transportation Inc   NASDAQ STB  
With the single exception of ARCP  which has been in the doghouse with investors due to some  of late  all of these monthly dividend stocks are positive for the year and beating the total return of the S P 500   I continue to recommend all six of these original picks as part of a diversified dividend portfolio 
Now  with no more ado  let s add some new names to the list 
I ll start with LTC Properties  Inc   NYSE LTC   a real estate investment trust that invests primarily in the long term care sector of the health care industry  including long term care provider properties  skilled nursing properties  assisted living properties  independent living properties and memory care properties   LTC also invests in first lien mortgages secured by long term care properties 
A little over 80  of LTC s portfolio is invested in properties with the remainder in mortgages   And among properties  skilled nursing is the biggest single segment  at 55    Assisted living comes in second at 37  
LTC is backed by absolutely fantastic macro trends   As the Baby Boomers age  there will be unprecedented demand for long term services and thus unprecedented demand for long term care facilities 
The elephant in the room when discussion long term care is  of course  Medicare   It s no secret that the U S  government is short of funds these days  and Medicare cutbacks have been an unfortunate outcome  But that is what makes LTC such an attractive way to play the trend of Boomer aging   LTC is a landlord  not a care provider  so Medicare cutbacks will have little impact on revenues   And even better  as with Realty Income and American Capital Realty Properties  most of LTC s properties are leased under triple net leases  meaning the tenant covers taxes  insurance and maintenance 
LTC s monthly dividend works out to a current yield of 5 2  
Next on the list is Canadian entertainment and media company Corus Entertainment  OTC CJREF   Corus has an extensive presence in both TV and radio   Corus  television operations include the children s brands YTV  Treehouse  Nickelodeon  Canada   TELETOON  Cartoon Network  Canada    They also include networks geared towards women  including W Network  Cosmopolitan TV  OWN  Oprah Winfrey Network  Canada  and W Movies   Additional assets include Quebec s French language channels Historia and S ries   HBO Canada  and three local over the air television stations  Corus also owns 39 radio stations that are among the most popular in Canada 
Corus recently reported earnings that were a little less than the Street expected  sending the shares down sharply   But revenues were up a not too shabby 14  for the quarter  and earnings per share were up 20  in the quarter 
If you buy Corus s U S  traded ADR  be careful   While Corus has a  2 billion market cap  the ADR is traded over the counter and has low trading volume   Be sure to use a limit order to avoid moving the market 
Corus s monthly dividend works out to a current yield of 4 5  
Next on the list is another Canadian stock  Shaw Communications  NYSE SJR    Shaw can be thought of as Canada s Comcast  NASDAQ CMCSA    It s one of Canada s largest cable companies and is particularly dominant in Western Canada   Shaw provides internet service  cable TV and home phone service to more than 3 million Canadian households 
Paid TV is no longer a growth business  of course   Cord cutting is a long term problem that won t be going away any time soon   But a home internet connection is more important than ever in the age of streaming media  and Shaw s overall business looks to remain stable for the foreseeable future 
Unlike Corus  Shaw s ADR trades on the NYSE and is far more liquid  with average volume of over 200 000 shares per day 
Shaw s monthly dividend currently yields 4 1  
Investor who have grown to love MLPs over the years should also love this next monthly dividend payer  The Tortoise Power   Energy Infrastructure Fund  TPZ    TPZ is a closed end fund  which means that  unlike ETFs or mutual funds  its share price can vary wildly from the value of its underlying holdings   As of this writing  TPZ traded at a discount to its net asset value of 10  
TPZ s portfolio is an interesting mix   It s currently invested about 50  in stocks and 68  in bonds    And yes  I realize that this adds up to well over 100    TPZ  like many closed end funds  can use leverage to juice returns 
TPZ s biggest holdings include some of the most familiar names in the MLP space  including Kinder Morgan Management  NYSE KMR   Enbridge Energy Management  EEQ  and Enterprise Products Partners  NYSE EPD  
At current prices  TPZ s monthly dividend works out to a yield of 5 3  
Most of my recommendations in this article and in the previous article on monthly dividends have been pretty conservative   If you want to add something with a little sizzle to your portfolio  consider the PIMCO Global StockPLUS   Income Fund  PGP   managed by Bill Gross prot g  Dan Ivascyn 
Like TPZ  this PIMCO fund is a closed end fund  meaning it can trade for above or below its net asset value   PGP currently trades at a massive premium to NAV of about 73   though this is within normal ranges for this fund   Part of the reason for the inflated premium is Ivascyn s use of derivatives  but a big factor as well has been the consistently high income that the fund throws off 
At current prices  PGP s monthly dividend yields 8 5 
If you decide to buy PGP  be prepared for a wild ride   Its share price is known to fluctuate wildly    But investors have been more than compensated for the volatility by the fund s returns of recent years   PGP has enjoyed  over the past five years

219591,441107,CMCSA,U S  regulator wants faster speeds for Internet broadband,news,"WASHINGTON  Reuters    The head of the U S  FCC on Wednesday proposed raising the definition of the high speed Internet to downloads at 25 megabits per second  Mbps   a more than a six fold increase from the current standard 
Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler s proposal would also require a minimum 3 Mbps upload speed to qualify as broadband  according to a fact sheet shared with Reuters 
U S  telecommunications law gives the FCC the authority to regulate Internet service providers  ISPs  such as Verizon Communications Inc  Comcast Corp  NASDAQ CMCSA O  and AT T Inc  NYSE T  as the agency oversees the roll out of broadband services to all Americans  in a reasonable and timely fashion  
If the proposed changes are taken into account  the current access to broadband is not meeting that standard  the document showed  opening the door to potential FCC intervention 
Wheeler on Wednesday also circulated to fellow commissioners a so called  notice of inquiry  asking what actions the FCC could take to accelerate broadband deployment 
The FCC currently defines broadband  or high speed Internet  as 4 Mbps download speed and 1 Mbps upload speed  which Wheeler has decried as too slow for the modern needs of U S  consumers

219605,441121,CMCSA,Comcast says Time Warner deal going  full steam ahead ,news,"By Christina Farr SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters    Comcast Corp s  O CMCSA  merger with Time Warner Cable Inc  N TWC  is going  full steam ahead  despite uncertainty around new rules governing net neutrality  Comcast Chief Executive Officer Brian Roberts told reporters on Wednesday 
The deal  which would create the largest U S  cable Internet provider  is in its final phases and remains on track to close  he said at a Comcast press event in San Francisco 
Shares of both companies fell sharply on Monday  after President Barack Obama declared that Internet service providers should be regulated like public utilities  touching off protests from cable and telecoms companies 
Some analysts thought his comments cast uncertainty over how regulators intended to implement the principle of net neutrality  and in turn cast doubt on the merger deal 
 We are in the final stages of public comment  Sometimes things get slowed down in that phase   Roberts said   We are full steam ahead  
Opponents to the deal have raised concerns that the sheer size of the eventually merged company would give it too much control over what Americans can watch on television and do online  as Comcast boosts its power as a buyer of web and pay TV content 

If approved by regulators  the merger would result in a company that would serve just under 30 percent of the U S  pay television video market  The merged provider would also serve between 20 percent and 40 percent of U S  broadband subscribers  depending on whether wireless broadband offered by telecom companies is included  Comcast has said

Some two dozen states were already coordinating with the U S  Justice Department to interview critics and proponents of the Comcast merger  which some lawmakers and public interest groups fear will result in higher costs and less competition 
The states have now broadened their focus to include AT T s  48 5 billion proposed deal for DirecTV  the No  1 U S  satellite TV provider  according to sources close to the probe  asking not to be named because the matter is not public 
New York and California are part of the multi state review  the sources said 
Florida acknowledged that it was part of the group  Indiana said it was looking at the deal but declined to say if it was working with the group of state attorneys general 
It is not unusual for attorneys general to join a Justice Department investigation of a major merger that potentially affects consumers in their state 
Asked about the expanded investigation  AT T spokesman Michael Balmoris said   We look forward to discussions with these state attorneys generals on the significant consumer benefits created by this merger  
While antitrust experts have said they expect the AT T deal to be approved  the proposed transaction has raised hackles for several reasons 
One is because of lost competition in the estimated quarter of U S  homes where AT T  the No  2 wireless carrier  offers U Verse  fiber optic delivery of television programming  high speed Internet and home phone service  DirecTV  a satellite alternative to local cable providers  is present in those markets 
The attorneys general also are looking at programming issues  one source said  Content producers and smaller cable operators worry that the combined company might wield too much power over the creation  distribution and costs of programming 
They also are asking questions about the merger s effects on the development of high speed broadband  As part of the deal  AT T pledged to expand broadband to 70 million consumer locations 

The Justice Department and Federal Communications Commission must sign off on both deals before they can close

219630,441146,CMCSA,Why One Congresswoman Wants To Block Fast  Cheap Internet,news,"By    A senior congressional Republican this week introduced legislation that would bar the federal government from using its powers to help community owned internet service providers compete with private telecommunications companies 
The move comes just as a Chattanooga based community owned Internet provider that delivers some of the fastest connections in the nation  EPB  is girding up for an expansion plan that would take on major telecommunications firms far beyond its home region 
In many states major providers of high speed internet connections have successfully lobbied state lawmakers to deliver legislation that bars community owned internet providers from expanding beyond their home territories  The FCC has the authority to intervene and preempt such state laws to enable smaller Internet providers to compete with larger national firms 
The legislation introduced by Rep  Marsha Blackburn  R TN  as an amendment to an annual spending bill  would strip the FCC of this power 
Blackburn s  R TN  top donors include private telecommunications firms that do not want to have to compete with publicly owned ISPs  Her state is home to EPB  a taxpayer owned power company in Chattanooga that also provides local residents some of the fastest Internet speeds in the world at market competitive rates  EPB is now aiming to expand its services beyond Chattanooga 
However  to go forward with its expansion plan  EPB needs the Federal Communications Commission to enter the fray  applying its authority to preempt a Tennessee law backed by the private telecom industry that restricts the utility s ability to move into new geographic regions  According to data from the Center for Public Integrity  Tennessee is one of 20 states with such laws on its books 
The chairman of the FCC  Tom Wheeler  has recently voiced support for using his agency s preemption authority to override state laws preventing community owned ISPs from competing with private telecom firms  That stance represents a break from his past  Wheeler previously worked as a lobbyist representing the cable industry  the principal channel for broadband Internet service 
Last month  Wheeler met with Chattanooga Mayor Andy Berke and a day later published a statement on the FCC s website declaring  that it is in the best interests of consumers and competition that the FCC exercises its power to preempt state laws that ban or restrict competition from community broadband  
If passed by Congress  Blackburn s amendment could effectively strip the FCC of its preemption power  at least for the year that the underlying annual appropriations measure is in force  That would halt EPB s new expansion proposal  and send a larger message to other community owned utilities that they may not get federal relief from state statutes 
That would be a big win for the private telecom industry  which might explain Blackburn s central role in the fight  According to campaign finance data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics  two of Blackburn s largest career donors are employees and PAC s affiliated with AT T Inc  NYSE T    66 750  and Comcast Corporation  NASDAQ CMCSA    36 600   Those are two of EPB s private sector competitors in Chattanooga  Blackburn has also taken  56 000 from the National Cable   Telecommunications Association  which is the lobbying group representing major private telecom firms 

Comcast has described community owned Internet service providers as a waste of taxpayer money while seeking to limit their expansion  A Comcast spokesperson told International Business Times that   Comcast operates in 39 states and has 130 000 employees across the country  It is important for our customers  our employees and our shareholders that we participate in the political process   The majority of our PAC contributions are to the Senators and Members who represent our employees and customers   
AT T did not respond to a request for comment by press time 
As the Chattanooga Times Free Press noted a few years back   EPB offers faster Internet speeds for the money  and shows equal pep in both uploading and downloading content  with Comcast and AT T trailing on quickness   The New York Times notes that  for less than  70 a month  consumers enjoy an ultrahigh speed fiber optic connection that transfers data at one gigabit per second    a rate  that is 50 times the average speed for homes in the rest of the country  
That success has been so rapid that the private telecom industry has abandoned the business lobby s traditional arguments  Whereas corporations typically argue that the private sector has inherent and obvious advantages over the public sector  the Chattanooga Times Free Press reports that telecom firms have gone to court insisting  that EPB  as a public entity  would have an edge when competing against private companies  which would be at a disadvantage when facing an entity owned by taxpayers   Similarly  whereas corporations typically push for government to stay out of the marketplace  private telecom firms have pushed for state legislatures to use government power to intervene in the marketplace by prohibiting community owned utilities from competing for Internet customers 
Blackburn defends her bill to preserve those state laws by presenting it as a measure to protect local sovereignty 
 We don t need unelected Federal agency bureaucrats in Washington telling our States what they can and can t do with respect to protecting their limited taxpayer dollars in private enterprises   Blackburn said Tuesday during a congressional debate about her amendment   We should be careful and deliberate in how we allow public entry into our vibrant communications marketplace   This is an issue that should be left to our states  
The consumer watchdog group Free Press has made the opposite argument  Citing data from the public private partnership Connected Tennessee  the organization reports that  constituents back in Hickman County in the center of Blackburn s Tennessee district struggle to get fast and affordable Internet services  as  only 38 percent of Hickman residents have access to broadband services  far below the Tennessee statewide average of 58 percent   The group argues that if the FCC preempts the 20 state laws limiting municipal broadband  it would help address some of those access shortfalls through entities like EPB 
EPB s much vaunted move into Internet services began in 2008 after utility officials realized cost saving smart grid infrastructure for energy transmission could also serve as a conduit for super fast broadband speeds  Like corporations  the utility issued bonds to raise resources to invest in building out its broadband capacity  Similarly  just as many private corporations ended up receiving federal stimulus dollars  so too did EPB  which put those monies into the broadband network 
Earlier this year  EPB officials have told the Washington Post that the telecom services have become  a great profit center    an assertion that appears to be confirmed by a 2012 Standard   Poor credit upgrade notice pointing out that the utility  is now covering all costs from telephone  video and Internet revenue  as well as providing significant financial benefit to the electric system  ",2014-07-16,International Business Times,"https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/why-one-congresswoman-wants-to-block-fast,-cheap-internet-295499",295499

Time Warner Cable was  in fact  acquired by Comcast in a deal reached in February slated to combine the largest cable and Internet provider in the United States  Comcast  with the second largest  Time Warner Cable   The proposed merger still needs approval from both the Federal Communication Commission and the U S  Department of Justice before it s finalized  but the issue has been a point of contention for customers and smaller businesses who argue that service will get worse as prices increase

The outlook is rosy given the company s tumultuous 2013    a year marred by subscription losses and a high profile battle over retransmission fees with CBS Corporation NYSE CBS  which resulted in a month long blackout of the network  According to Bloomberg  Time Warner Cable lost 215 000 customers in the three month period ended December 31

Analysts are somewhat more optimistic  Vikash Harlalka  an analyst with International Strategy   Investment Group  wrote in an April 15 research note that if you re planning on buying TWC shares  now is the time   The deal spread with Comcast remains tight  suggesting the market is confident in the merger getting approved   Harlalka wrote   We prefer playing the transaction by buying TWC  as you get the assets at a 4 percent discount  

Amy Yong  an analyst with Macquarie Capital Inc   wrote in a March 4 research note that regulatory scrutiny could delay the merger until early 2015  In the meantime  she wrote  Time Warner Cable is doing the right things by focusing on improved products like TWC Maxx  a service to increase bandwidth  and a new TWC app for the Roku streaming player  Wong expects Time Warner Cable s average revenue per user  ARPU  is expected to rise 3 6 percent in the first quarter   In the interim  it s business as usual   Wong wrote   Time Warner management has a path to revitalize the business with better service  next gen products like Roku and Samsung Smart TVs  and a market by market approach in its rollout of TWC Maxx  
The wait and see approach appears to be the consensus  Out of 26 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters  14 rated Time Warner Cable stock Hold  Time Warner Cable shares rose 1 83 percent Tuesday to  183 43

219647,441163,CMCSA,Comcast Offers To Shed Customers For Time Warner Deal,news,"By     Reuters    Comcast Corp  NASDAQ CMCSA  offered to sell 1 4 million pay TV subscribers to Charter Communications Inc for  7 3 billion  as part of a wider transaction aimed at winning regulatory approval for its proposed  45 billion takeover of Time Warner Cable 
Comcast also said it would divest another 2 5 million subscribers into a new publicly traded company  dubbed SpinCo for now  to be one third owned by Charter and two thirds owned by Comcastshareholders 
The deal will make Charter   whose own bid for Time Warner Cable Inc  NYSE TWC  was thwarted by Comcast s higher offer   the second biggest U S  pay TV company with 5 7 million customers  overtaking Cox Communications Inc 
Comcast will have less than 30 percent of the U S  residential cable or satellite TV market after the deal  the company said in a statement 
SpinCo would have an estimated enterprise value of  14 3 billion and an equity value of  5 8 billion  Charter and Comcast said in an investor presentation    
The agreement is contingent on Comcast s Time Warner Cable deal being approved by the Justice Department and the U S  Federal Communications Commission  a process that could take many months 
 Comcast wanted to do this deal now with Charter so it could get in front of regulators at the Justice Department and the FCC at the same time as the Time Warner Cable deal   a source familiar with the matter said 
The source said there was a standstill agreement with Charter that stipulates that it cannot gain full control of SpinCo for four years 
Comcast will have no ownership in SpinCo if the divestment plan goes ahead  The companies said the divestments would deliver about  19 5 billion in value to Comcast shareholders 
Time Warner Cable had 11 2 million residential video subscribers as of March 31  while Comcast had 22 6 million 
 For Charter this deal is a transformative event and sets them up over time to consolidate the balance of the rest of the cable industry   Pivotal Research Group analyst Jeff Wlodarczak told Reuters  adding that the deal was good for both parties 
Charter s deal with Comcast marks an acceleration of John Malone s effective return to cable through his investment vehicle Liberty Media Corp  which owns about 27 percent of Charter  Wlodarczak said 
In addition to the divestments  Charter and Comcast will swap about 1 6 million customers 
Comcast will get parts of Los Angeles  New York state  western Massachusetts  North and South Carolina and parts of Texas and Georgia  Charter will get Detroit and Minneapolis St  Paul in Minnesota  the companies said in the presentation 
Charter said it expected to fund the purchase of 1 4 million customers through debt
