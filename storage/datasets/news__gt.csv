172093,393609,GT,Democrat calls for  good faith  talks with USTR on trade deal,news,"By Jonas Ekblom and Andrea Shalal WASHINGTON  Reuters    The Democratic head of the U S  House Ways and Means Committee on Friday called for  good faith  negotiations with the Trump administration to address concerns about the new U S  Mexico Canada trade agreement and pave the way for its passage  U S  Representative Richard Neal  chairman of the powerful committee  said Democrats had clearly explained what improvements they were seeking  but it was time for the Trump administration to respond with concrete proposals of its own   We remain committed to working diligently with Ambassador Lighthizer on this agreement  The timeline for consideration of the revised deal depends on the administration s willingness to negotiate with us in good faith to address House Democrats  concerns   Neal said in a statement after a Democratic working group met for a fourth time with U S  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer on Friday  The nine lawmaker group told House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in a report on Friday that they had made  substantial progress  over the past few weeks  and would present USTR with a text next week memorializing the concrete and detailed proposals they had made   We have laid out clear and specific objectives and proposals designed to fix flaws in the new agreement affecting all stakeholders  especially American workers and regular people who need affordable access to healthcare and medicines   the report said   It is now USTR s turn to respond   Both sides were ready to work through the August recess to build on the progress made  the report said  USTR declined to comment on the latest meeting with Democrats about the agreement that will replace the current North American Free Trade Agreement  NAFTA   TOP PRIORITY Republican President Donald Trump views ratification of the trade deal as a top priority  but Democrats say they will not move forward until their concerns over labor  environmental issues and access to medicine have been addressed  Officials on both sides now say the deal could move forward in September after lawmakers return from the August recess  Earl Blumenauer  the Oregon Democrat who leads the trade subcommittee of the House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee and is a member of the working group  told reporters that debate about the trade pact was far less contentious than it had been in earlier negotiations   It has been a productive three months   Blumenauer said  But he said Pelosi had made clear that she would not allow consideration of the agreement on the House floor until Democrats were satisfied with the revised deal   The charge we all share is to make sure that every Democrat feels that his or her interests have been heard  They may not all be satisfied   Blumenauer said  Nearly 600 trade and commerce groups sent a letter to lawmakers this week urging quick approval of a deal they said would be a boon to the U S  economy  Leaders from the United States  Mexico and Canada signed the agreement in November  but it must be ratified by lawmakers in all three countries  Mexico has already ratified the deal  Blumenauer said he was encouraged by Lighthizer s past record on enforcement and welcomed USTR s decision to direct U S  Customs and Border Protection to block future timber imports from Inversiones WCA E I R L   a Peruvian exporter  given its use of illegally harvested timber  The Oregon Democrat said he was open to a range of options to revise the USCMA  but said he remained skeptical about using so called side agreements  which he said had proven problematic in the current trade agreement among the three nations  The congressman said he returned from a bipartisan congressional visit to Mexico  very impressed  by the Mexican government and its ambitions  adding   It is clear that it is sincere   Members of the delegation also met with workers at a Goodyear  O GT  plant in Mexico who were terminated a year ago for exercising their right to organize and seek better working conditions  but they were refused entry to the plant  he said  Goodyear s decision to block the visit reinforced concerns that lawmakers have heard voiced by workers at the plant  he said  adding   I think it was a mistake on their part   In a statement  Goodyear said it was surprised to learn of the congressional delegation s visit to the plant

172094,393610,GT,Goodyear plant conditions raise concerns about Mexican labor reforms   U S  lawmakers,news,"By Andrea Shalal
WASHINGTON  Reuters    A group of U S  Democratic lawmakers on Monday criticized  Goodyear Tire    Rubber Co  O GT  for refusing to let them visit its Mexican plant  and said poor conditions there raised questions about Mexican labor reforms seen as key to ensuring passage of a new U S  Mexico Canada trade agreement 
Four of the nine House of Representatives Democrats who are negotiating with the Trump administration about the trade deal spelled out their concerns in a letter to Goodyear s chief executive  Richard Kramer 
 We are     disappointed that an iconic American company like Goodyear      is failing to provide its workers in Mexico with basic labor rights that are recognized internationally and under Mexican law   Representative Earl Blumenauer  chairman of the trade subcommittee of the House Ways and Means Committee  and three other Democrats wrote in the letter 
 While we are told that Mexico s labor reforms and a renewed NAFTA will lead to positive change in Mexico and in America  what we saw at Goodyear clearly illustrates the entrenched way of doing business in Mexico that is based on exploiting a powerless workforce   they said 
The Trump administration wants Congress to approve the trade deal to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement   but House Democrats say they will not proceed until their labor  climate  enforcement and pharmaceutical concerns are met 
No immediate comment was available from Goodyear on the letter  On Friday it said the need to train and certify workers  and pressure to achieve full production capacity by the end of year  meant it was able to host only  limited outside visits  
Blumenauer led a bipartisan congressional visit to Mexico from July 18 22  Democratic Representatives Rosa DeLauro  Terri Sewell and Jimmy Gomez were also on the trip and signed the letter 
They said they met with workers who were fired from the Goodyear plant and with Goodyear executives offsite  but were not permitted to visit the plant 
They asked the company to respond within two weeks to reports of  poor working conditions  inadequate wages  illegal termination and discrimination  at the facility  and to say how much of the output from the plant was sent to the United States 
Goodyear s San Luis Potosi plant opened in 2017  with wages ranging from  2 to  6 an hour  while most of Goodyear s U S  workers receive a base rate of  23 per hour  the lawmakers said 
A wildcat strike at the Mexican plant in April 2018 included 600 of the 800 workers  the lawmakers said  adding that 57 of those who participated were later systematically fired ",2019-07-29,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/goodyear-plant-conditions-raise-concerns-about-mexican-labor-reforms--us-lawmakers-1938340,1938340

that hasn t always been the case  From 1915 1920 the cost of living nearly doubled The US also saw its worst decade of inflation in the last 100 years in the 1970s as inflation had an annualized rate from 1973 to 1982 of nearly 9  How can Investors Protect Their Portfolios from Inflation  Gold is back in vogue  Back in the 1970s  you literally had to buy gold coins or bars and stack them in the

yielding 3 4   It s invested in 189 different real estate stocks Can the Stock Market s Past Predict the Future Graham cautions about looking to the past to try and figure out the future  No two market cycles are the same  And an overvalued market may stay that way for far longer than you think For example  stocks were already considered expensive in 1995 when they went on their 20  annualized a year hot streak that ended in 2000 Remember Chairman Greenspan s speech talking about irrational exuberance  That was in 1996 Graham s Question of  How Much  How much are you willing to pay for shares in that company That s the question Graham says investors must ask Right now  many stocks have plunged to new 52 week lows  Some are at multiyear lows  It s time for value investors to

Overall  the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B  If you aren t focused on one strategy  this score is the one you should be interested in 
Outlook

172397,393913,GT,Earnings Preview  Goodyear  GT  Q3 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Goodyear  GT  reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This tire maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 50 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  26 5  
Revenues are expected to be  3 87 billion  down 1 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Goodyear 
For Goodyear  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  11 56  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Goodyear will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Goodyear would post earnings of  0 31 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 25  delivering a surprise of  19 35  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Goodyear doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-10-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-goodyear-gt-q3-earnings-expected-to-decline-200475136,200475136
172398,393914,GT,Goodyear  GT  Q3 Earnings And Revenues Lag Estimates,opinion,"Goodyear  GT  came out with quarterly earnings of  0 45 per share  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 50 per share  This compares to earnings of  0 68 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of  10   A quarter ago  it was expected that this tire maker would post earnings of  0 31 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 25  delivering a surprise of  19 35  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates just once 
Goodyear  which belongs to the Zacks Rubber   Tires industry  posted revenues of  3 80 billion for the quarter ended September 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1 82   This compares to year ago revenues of  3 93 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Goodyear shares have lost about 25 8  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 20 1  
What s Next for Goodyear 
While Goodyear has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately

Yesterday s price action was also significant as the price broke away from the congestion at  12 50 and which now presents a barrier of resistance to any recovery  In addition  and to add further to the bearish sentiment  a low volume node is immediately ahead at  11 50 with the trend monitor indicator confirming the bearish picture

For longer term investors looking for an opportunity this stock will require patience  as GT is set to fall further before an extended consolidation phase develops in the  8    9 price region and provided we see active buying by the market makers at these levels followed by a successful low volume test recovery should follow  All of which is likely to take months  and as always Wykoff s second law of cause and effect will dictate the extent of any recovery  In other words  the longer GT is in consolidation  the more sustained will be the recovery ",2019-08-13,Anna Coulling,https://www.investing.com/analysis/goodyear-tire-set-for-further-falls-200454489,200454489

Every week  Tracey Ryniec  the editor of Zacks   shares some of her top value investing tips and stock picks 
This week  Tracey continues with her series looking at Benjamin Graham s best selling book for value investors called    
First published in 1949  the last edition by Graham was published in 1973  But in 2003  Jason Zweig  along with a preface by Warren Buffett  updated the book to account for the events of the last 40 years 
Investing and Inflation
Graham covers inflation and the history of the stock market in chapters 2 and 3 of the book 
While there isn t much inflation to speak of in 2019  that hasn t always been the case  From 1915 1920 the cost of living nearly doubled 
The US also saw its worst decade of inflation in the last 100 years in the 1970s as inflation had an annualized rate from 1973 to 1982 of nearly 9  
How can Investors Protect Their Portfolios from Inflation  Gold is back in vogue  Back in the 1970s  you literally had to buy gold coins or bars and stack them in the closet  But in 2019  there s the Gold ETF   TSXV GLD   which trades on the physical gold  Year to date it s up 17 7   outpacing the S P 500 which is up just 13 3  Graham also talks about real estate investment trusts  REITs   ETFs are also a good way to get diversity in real estate investments  The Vanguard Real Estate ETF   for instance  has an expense ratio of just 0 12  and pays a dividend yielding 3 4   It s invested in 189 different real estate stocks Can the Stock Market s Past Predict the Future 
Graham cautions about looking to the past to try and figure out the future  No two market cycles are the same  And an overvalued market may stay that way for far longer than you think 
For example  stocks were already considered expensive in 1995 when they went on their 20  annualized a year hot streak that ended in 2000 
Remember Chairman Greenspan s speech talking about irrational exuberance  That was in 1996 
Graham s Question of  How Much  
How much are you willing to pay for shares in that company 
That s the question Graham says investors must ask 
Right now  many stocks have plunged to new 52 week lows  Some are at multiyear lows  It s time for value investors to start looking underneath the rubble and asking Graham s question  how much 
Value investors buy when everyone else flees  No one says it s easy

172438,393954,GT,Earnings Preview  Goodyear  GT  Q1 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"The market expects Goodyear  GT  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This tire maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 05 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  90  
Revenues are expected to be  3 54 billion  down 7 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 18 8  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Goodyear 
For Goodyear  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  92 86  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  5 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Goodyear will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Goodyear would post earnings of  0 60 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 51  delivering a surprise of  15  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Goodyear doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-goodyear-gt-q1-earnings-expected-to-decline-200407760,200407760

Overall  the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of F  If you aren t focused on one strategy  this score is the one you should be interested in

 Moreover  with a low volume node now waiting below  the trapdoor could open once the move through  17 is completed  

And as we can see from the price action over the last few weeks  this has certainly been the case with the stock falling from the price back then of  17 67 to currently trade at  14 51  and despite the compression of the volume bars owing to the spike of early March  selling volumes continued to rise with falling prices on widespread candles thereby confirming two things  First  sellers remain in control so further downside momentum is likely to follow  Second  there is no evidence of buying by the market makers on the weekly chart which is now approaching a further low volume node in the  14 00 per share region  The monthly chart for the stock has some minor support in this area  but given the strength of selling now in evidence  we could see this stock move to single figures in the medium term  and much also depends on the EPS figure delivered at the next quarterly earnings cycle  which will hopefully improve on last quarter s dire results ",2019-05-29,Anna Coulling,https://www.investing.com/analysis/goodyear-continues-sliding-ever-lower-200425849,200425849

While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Goodyear would post earnings of  0 05 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 19  delivering a surprise of  280  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Goodyear doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-18,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analysts-estimate-goodyear-gt-to-report-a-decline-in-earnings-what-to-look-out-for-200441947,200441947

172512,394028,GT,Should Value Investors Pick Goodyear Tire  GT  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put The Goodyear Tire   Rubber Company   NASDAQ GT   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Goodyear Tire has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 8 4  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 2  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Goodyear Tire s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the  s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 8 7  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Goodyear Tire has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 7 5  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Goodyear Tire stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Goodyear Tire has a P S ratio of about 0 4  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 2x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  GT is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Goodyear Tire currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Goodyear Tire a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Goodyear Tire is just 0 6  a level that is far lower than the industry average of 1 3  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Additionally  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 4 1  which is far better than the industry average of 7 1  Clearly  GT is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Goodyear Tire might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of B and a Momentum Score of F  This gives GT a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been pretty discouraging  The current quarter has seen no estimate go higher in the past sixty days compared to three lower  while the full year estimate has seen two up and three down in the same time period This has had a significant impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen by 41  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has gone down by 6 8   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below The Goodyear Tire   Rubber Company Price and Consensus   This bearish trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineGoodyear Tire is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  Bottom 18  out of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates  analyst sentiment and broader factors to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Investor Alert  Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization  Billions of dollars in research have poured into it  Companies are already generating substantial revenue  and even more wondrous products are in the pipeline Cures for a variety of deadly diseases are in sight  and so are big potential profits for early investors  Zacks names 5 stocks to buy now

172571,394087,GT,Should The Goodyear Tire   Rubber  GT  Impress The Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put The Goodyear Tire   Rubber Company   NASDAQ GT   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  The Goodyear Tire   Rubber has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 8 37  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 34  If we focus on the long term PE trend  The Goodyear Tire   Rubber s current PE level puts it above its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified Auto Tires Trucks industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 11 16  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that The Goodyear Tire   Rubber has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 8 50  so it is fair to say that the stock price might appreciate in near future P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  The Goodyear Tire   Rubber has a P S ratio of about 0 57  This is far lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 15 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  The Goodyear Tire   Rubber currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  A   putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes The Goodyear Tire   Rubber a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for The Goodyear Tire   Rubber is just 0 59  a level that is lower than the industry average of 1 04  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Clearly  GT is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though The Goodyear Tire   Rubber might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  F  and a Momentum score of  F   This gives GT a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  C    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been unfavorable  The current quarter has seen one estimate going higher in the past sixty days compared to three lower  while the full year estimate has seen three upward and two downward movements in the same time period This has had a significant impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen by 9 9  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has also inched lower by 0 5   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below The Goodyear Tire   Rubber Company Price and Consensus   This bearish trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineThe Goodyear Tire   Rubber is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the Zacks Auto Tires Trucks industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Looking for Ideas with Even Greater Upside Today s investment ideas are short term  directly based on our proven 1 to 3 month indicator  In addition  I invite you to consider our long term opportunities  These rare trades look to start fast with strong Zacks Ranks

However  the overall projections for the auto sector s Q3 earnings are still weak  By the end of the earnings season  auto sector earnings and revenues are expected to be down 12 4  and 4 7   respectively  This will place it among the worst performers in the 16 Zacks sectors  In comparison  total S P 500 earnings are projected to improve 1 4   with revenues also rising 1 4  year over year 
A large part of the projected earnings decline in the auto sector is expected due to Ford Motor Company   NYSE F    which will record a  640 million recall related expense in the quarter  Moreover  the fall in U S  auto sales over the last two months is expected to weigh on the results of many automakers  The pressure to maintain attractive incentives and deals may also strain their margins  Further  expenses related to safety recalls as well as the negative impact of foreign currency translation remain headwinds for the sector 
However  there are a few positives as well  Strong sales growth in China and Europe is the primary driving factor for the auto sector in Q3  Moreover  low fuel prices are driving the sales of higher margin vehicle segments  such as SUVs and light trucks 
With all these factors in mind  let s see what awaits these two auto stocks that are slated to release their third quarter 2016 results on Oct 28

172585,394101,GT,These Two Tire Distributors Have 20  Upside,opinion,"Goodyear Tracking Its Fundamental Value
In July of last year  The Goodyear Tire   Rubber Company  NASDAQ GT  was originally one of our  when shares were trading at  26 50 and had a finbox io fair value estimate of  33 50 
The stock has since jumped 35  and is now trading at nearly  36 per share while finbox io s fair value estimate has also risen to roughly  44 per share as illustrated below  
Goodyear is expected to report earnings on Friday before the market opens  The stock is currently trading near its 52 week high as management has successfully focused on profits ahead of volume  As a result  revenues have continuously fallen since 2011 but have been offset by increasing EBITDA margins which have doubled from 8 2  to 16 7  
Even after the stock s recent increase  eight separate valuation analyses imply that Goodyear still has over 20  upside  In addition to the company s attractive fundamentals  the tire market s positive industry tailwinds make GT an attractive investment opportunity 
The Tire Market s Picking Up Steam
Goodyear currently holds about a  of the worldwide tire market which puts it third behind overseas rivals Michelin  PA MICP  and Bridgestone Corp   T 5108   On April 18th   highlighted in its Global Automotive Tires Market report that this segment is expected to grow at a CAGR of 7 5  until 2022  This is well above the nearly flat growth that this segment saw in 2016 according to estimates by  
Goodyear also generates roughly 70  of its revenue from replacement tires and is also the main driver of the tire market s expected growth  CFRA s Automobiles Industry Survey  which was released in March  highlighted that it expects improved demand for replacement parts because vehicle longevity has crossed 11 5 years as thrifty consumers continue to hold on to and repair their aging vehicles 
Additionally  the increased popularity of speed rated radial tires  which wear out much faster than conventional radials  is also expected to boost tire replacement frequency 
Generally  these replacement tires are also much more profitable than tires sold to automobile producers as original equipment  These positive industry tailwinds will likely contribute to Goodyear s financial performance going forward 
Another Undervalued Tire Manufacturer
In addition to Goodyear Cooper Tire   Rubber Company  NYSE CTB  also appears fundamentally undervalued and poised to benefit from the aforementioned tire industry tailwinds  The company is also expected to report earnings this week  Thursday  
Cooper Tire originally came on our radar whenKeyCorp  NYSE KEY  on the stock at Overweight in November of last year  At that time  shares were trading at  37 90 while finbox io calculated a fair value estimate of approximately  50 per share 
The stock has since moved 15  higher and is now trading at almost  44 per share while its fair value estimate has also increased to just over  55 per share as shown below  
Similar to Goodyear  Cooper Tire has also offset its declining revenues by increasing profitability as shown in the chart below 
However  one factor to note as it relates to Cooper Tire s future growth potential is its focus on expanding operations in Latin America  According to the CFRA Industry Survey  the Latin American   Hispanic automotive market growth outpaced the general market by 3 to 1 in 2016  With a new sales office that was recently opened in Sao Paulo  Brazil  the company is well positioned to capitalize on this higher growth region 
Two Tire Distributors To Consider Before Earnings
The tire market is expected to grow at a faster pace than what has been seen over the last few years due to positive consumer trends  Both Goodyear and Cooper Tire are well positioned to directly benefit from these trends which may push each company s stock to new highs 
Both tire manufactures have offset declining revenues by focusing on increasing margins  However  Wall Street expects this trend to stop in 2017 and projects that both companies will grow their top line by over 7   Do not be surprised if shares continue their rise if either tire company is able to show signs of revenue growth in their upcoming earnings release ",2017-04-25,Finbox io,https://www.investing.com/analysis/these-two-tire-distributors-have-20-upside-200185067,200185067

Investors should note that September is historically the worst month of the year for stocks  According to   a consensus carried out from 1950 to 2015 has revealed that September ended up offering positive returns in 29 years and negative returns in 37 years  with an average return of negative 0 68   which is worse than any month 
Agreed  dovish comments by Fed Governor  on the policy tightening issue on September 12  showered gains on equities and lowered chances a Fed rate hike in the near term  But the U S  stock market is expected to remain rocky in the coming days given the uncertainty surrounding the FOMC meeting scheduled during September 20 21  After all  a group of  is still in favor of a rate hike in September 
Also  the upheaval in the oil patch will likely make equities vulnerable going forward  The International Energy Agency s  IEA  latest forecast that a global oil supply glut will remain  and the awaited outcome of the OPEC meeting during September 26 28 will likely keep oil prices unsteady in the near term  read    
Volatility to Flex Muscle Ahead  
Investors should note that overvaluation concerns in the equity as well as bond market are rife at present  Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  expects the S P 500 to close out the year at 2 100  which means a 2 73  decline is waiting ahead of the September 12 close  read    
Deutsche Bank  DE DBKGn  is also apprehensive of the same downside risks down the line  The bank now sees an 8 10  fall impending for the S P 500 and stated that lower volatility in the past six weeks in that key U S  equity gauge was  the  the storm  
Deutsche Bank particularly stressed that  low bond yields  are  distorting valuations in various stock market sectors    also cautioned about imminent volatility in the market 
In any case  U S  stocks were recently held guilty of rich valuations  Jeffrey Gundlach  the chief executive of  also did not seem convinced about stock valuation as U S  economic growth is still tepid and corporate earnings are far from steady  Billionaire investor George Soros recently   on a bearish bet against the U S  stock market

172675,394191,GT,Goodyear  GT  To Report Q2 Earnings  What s In The Cards 	,opinion,"The Goodyear Tire   Rubber Company   NASDAQ GT   is set to report second quarter 2016 results on Jul 27  In the last quarter  this tire manufacturer had posted a positive earnings surprise of 2 86   Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors Influencing this Quarter
Goodyear regularly launches innovative products and services to boost sales  The company is benefiting from lower raw material costs  strong economic trends in North America and continued cost savings  Further  Goodyear has been redeeming some of its outstanding senior notes using the proceeds from the offering of new senior notes with lower interest rate  These transactions will reduce the interest expense of the company  The removal of Sumitomo Rubber s minority interest in Goodyear Dunlop Tires Europe B V  is also expected to increase Goodyear s earnings 
Goodyear attained record high segment operating income in 2013  2014  2015 and the first quarter of 2016  However  the company s revenue has been declining over the years due to unfavorable foreign currency translation as well as other factors  These trends are expected to continue this quarter as well 
In Latin America  Goodyear is facing challenges in terms of a volatile political and economic environment  lower production volume in Venezuela and Brazil  and high currency fluctuations 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Goodyear is likely to beat earnings this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  2 or 3 for this to happen  This is not the case here  as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Goodyear has an Earnings ESP of  8 65  because the Most Accurate estimate of 95 cents stands below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 04 
Zacks Rank  Goodyear s Zacks Rank  2  Buy  increases the predictive power of ESP  However  we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise 
We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
Stocks that Warrant a Look
Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter 
Westport Fuel Systems Inc    NASDAQ WPRT   has an Earnings ESP of  9 09  and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   The company s second quarter 2016 financial results are expected to release on Aug 3

172676,394192,GT,Auto Stocks Q2 Earnings On Jul 27  FCAU  ALSN  GT  SUP  FDML,opinion,"The auto sector has been performing well so far in the Q2 earnings season  Nearly 27 3  of the sector s companies have posted results as of Jul 22  These companies recorded 30 4  year over year growth in earnings and 7 8  in revenues  per our   In comparison  total S P 500 companies that had reported through Jul 22 posted a 1 1  decline in earnings and a 2 6  rise in revenues 
By the end of Q2  auto sector earnings and revenue growth is projected to be around 18 4  and 2 1   respectively  Meanwhile  total S P 500 earnings and revenues are expected to decline 3 4  and 0 5  year over year  respectively 
Revenues of auto companies are being driven by strong sales in major markets like the U S   Europe and China  in the first half of 2016  Meanwhile  the bottom line is benefiting from an increase in the sales of higher margin vehicle segments  such as SUVs and light trucks  due to low fuel prices  Nonetheless  the pressure to maintain the attractive incentives and deals may weigh upon margins for automakers  Sluggishness in some markets and expenses related to safety recalls are other hurdles  The negative impact of foreign currency translation also remains a headwind for the auto sector

172701,394217,GT,Myth Busting  Stocks Are In Trouble When Commodities Tank,opinion,"What Does History Say About Weak Commodities And Bull Markets 
You have probably heard the following argument somewhere in recent weeks 

Weakness in commodities  especially copper  is telling us the global economy is weak and another horrible bear market in stocks is just around the corner 

The argument seems rational  commodity prices are falling because demand is weak  which is a reflection of economic weakness  That may be true  but the price of any commodity is determined by supply and demand  Therefore  if there is a supply glut in a commodity  prices can fall even in non recessionary periods 
The other bearish argument is also rational 

Weakness in commodities  especially copper  is telling us the global economy is weak and commodity producers are in big trouble 

There are always two sides to every story  According to the Rubber Manufacturers Association  it takes approximately seven gallons of oil to produce a tire  Do you think falling oil prices are hurting tire manufacturers  such as Goodyear  O GT   When input costs fall  profit margins go up  Thus  while commodity producers are not happy about weak commodity prices  there are countless businesses that benefit when raw material prices drop 
What Does History Have To Say 
Our purpose here is not to say weakness in commodities is bullish for stocks  but rather to demonstrate with facts that weakness in commodities is not a showstopper for stocks  Said another way  is it possible for stocks to  kill it  for many years when commodity prices are dropping significantly  The chart below shows the S P 500 gaining 68  during a period when the CRB Index dropped 32  
Was the economy in the gutter during the period when commodities dropped 32   No  the average annual increase in GDP for 1984  1985  and 1986 was 5 0  

The CRB Index
The CRB Index is a basket of commodities comprised of the nineteen components listed in the table below 

1988 1993  Positive GDP And Gains In Stocks
During the period highlighted below  1988 1993   commodity prices dropped 28   Over the same period  the S P 500 gained 66   The average annual increase in GDP for 1988  1989  1990  1991  1992  and 1993 was 2 7  

1996 1999  Commodities Drop And Stocks Skyrocket
During the period highlighted below  1996 1999   commodity prices dropped 31   Over the same period  the S P 500 gained 118   The average annual increase in GDP for 1996  1997  1998  1999 was 4 4  

How About Dr  Copper 
On Wall Street you often hear the term  Dr  Copper  and that  copper has a PhD in economics since weak copper prices mean the economy and stock markets are about to roll over into a period of recessionary bear market misery  
Dr  Copper is another myth  In fact  after the period below  Dr  Copper was stripped of his tenure and asked to clean out his desk  In the period shown  1985 1993  copper prices tanked 52   Over the same period  the S P 500 gained 63   The average annual increase in GDP for 1989  1990  1991  1992  1993 was 2 4  

Dr  Copper Didn t Win A Nobel Prize
In the period shown below  1995 1999  copper prices plummeted 58   Over the same period  the S P 500 gained 183   The average annual increase in GDP for 1995  1996  1997  1998  and 1999 was 4 0   rather than the economic contraction forecasted by the  nutty professor  Dr  Copper 

How Long Can Stocks And Copper Move In Opposite Directions 
If you were told that from date A to date B copper prices dropped 59  and you subscribed to Dr  Copper s stock market newsletter  you would have expected the S P 500 to have a rough time  In the ten year period below  copper dropped 59  from point to point  over the same period the S P 500 gained an eye popping 351  

A Singular Takeaway
The purpose of this analysis is not to compare any of the periods shown to 2015  nor is it meant to make any commentary on 2015  bullish or bearish   This analysis helps us answer one question and one question only 

Is it possible for the S P 500 to post significant gains over a number of years during a period of weakness in copper and or the CRB Index 

The answer  based on the facts above  is an indisputable and undebatable  yes  it is very possible for stocks to do very well when commodities are weak   You may argue   but 2015 is different    That argument applies to every historical reference made in the history of mankind regarding the economy and markets  Yes  today is different  That is not a new concept  Today is always different ",2015-11-26,Chris Ciovacco,https://www.investing.com/analysis/myth:-stocks-are-in-trouble-when-commodities-tank-272578,272578

Our Most Dangerous Stocks   0 4   underperformed the S P 500   1 1   last month  Most Dangerous Large Cap stock Macquarie Infrastructure  N MIC  fell by 5  and Most Dangerous Small Cap Stock Astrotech Corporation  O ASTC  fell by 13   Overall  15 out of the 40 Most Dangerous stocks outperformed the S P 500 in November 
The successes of the Most Attractive and Most Dangerous stocks highlight the value of our forensic accounting  Being a true value investor is an increasingly difficult  if not impossible  task considering the amount of data contained in the ever longer annual reports  By analyzing key details in these SEC filings  our research protects investors  portfolios and allows our clients to execute value investing strategies with more confidence and integrity 
21 new stocks make our Most Attractive list and 32 new stocks fall onto the Most Dangerous list this month  December s Most Attractive and Most Dangerous stocks were made available to members on December 3  2015 
Our Most Attractive stocks have high and rising return on invested capital  ROIC  and low price to economic book value ratios  Most Dangerous stocks have misleading earnings and long growth appreciation periods implied by their market valuations 
Most Attractive Stock Feature for December  Gentex Corp  O GNTX   16 share 
Gentex Corp  GNTX   automobile parts supplier  is one of the additions to our Most Attractive List for December 
Gentex has built a dominant  90  market share in 2014   and more importantly  highly profitable business supplying automatic dimming rearview mirrors and electronics to the automotive industry  Since the industry crashed in 2008  Gentex has grown after tax profit  NOPAT  by 24  compounded annually  This impressive profit growth can be seen in Figure 1 
Figure 1  Gentex Exhibits Strong NOPAT Growth

Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings
In addition to profit growth  Gentex currently earns a top quintile return on invested capital  ROIC  and has grown NOPAT margins from 12  in 2009 to 20  on a trailing twelve month basis  It s worth noting that the NOPAT margin in 2009 is the lowest achieved by Gentex dating back to 1998  the furthest our model covers  Even in one of the worst recessions in history  especially as it relates to the automobile industry  Gentex remained profitable and achieved a double digit NOPAT margin 
Impact of Footnotes Adjustments and Forensic Accounting
In order to derive the true recurring cash flows  an accurate invested capital  and a real shareholder value  we made the following adjustments to Gentex s 2014 10 K 
Income Statement  we made  19 million of adjustments with a net effect of removing  15 million  1  of revenue  in non operating income  We removed  17 million in non operating income  including  6 million in investment income  and  2 million in non operating expenses  Despite removing this income  Gentex s NOPAT still grew over 30  year over year in 2014 
Balance Sheet  we made  708 million of adjustments to calculate invested capital with a net decrease of  552 million  One notable adjustment was the inclusion of  60 million due to asset write downs  This adjustment represented 3  of reported net assets 
Valuation  we made  931 million of adjustments with a net effect of increasing shareholder value by  327 million  The largest adjustment was the inclusion of  629 million due to excess cash  This adjustment represents 13  of Gentex s market cap 
GNTX Is Undervalued At Current Prices
Despite the strength exhibited by Gentex s operations  GNTX is down 10  year to date  YTD   which has left shares undervalued  At its current price of  16 share  Gentex has a price to economic book value  PEBV  ratio of 1 2  This ratio means that the market expects Gentex to grow NOPAT by only 20  over its remaining corporate life despite the fact that it has grown profits by over 20  compounded annually each year since 2008 
If Gentex can grow NOPAT by just 10  compounded annually for the next decade  shares are worth  23 share today   a 44  upside 
Most Dangerous Stock Feature  Groupon  Inc   GRPN   3 share 
Groupon  Inc   O GRPN   local deal and coupon retailer  finds itself back on Most Dangerous stocks list in December  We ve previously highlighted the problems with Groupon s business model in our Danger Zone report from June of this year  GRPN is down 48  since this report  and we still see more downside ahead 
Aside from the issues raised in our initial report  the acceleration of Groupon s misleading GAAP net income could pose the biggest risk to unknowing investors  As you can see from Figure 2  Groupon reported GAAP net income of  76 million on a TTM basis while economic earnings  the true cash flows available to investors  continued to decline to   64 million 
Figure 2  GAAP Net Income Can Be Misleading

Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings
In addition to rising GAAP net income and falling economic earnings  Groupon s already struggling business has gotten worse  NOPAT margins have fallen from  0 2  in 2014 to  1  on a TTM basis while ROIC is currently a bottom quintile  9   well below the  2  earned in 2014  No matter which way you cut it  Groupon s business model has continued to deteriorate throughout 2015 
Forensic Accounting Reveals Overstated EPS
In order to derive the true recurring cash flows  an accurate invested capital  and a real shareholder value  we made the following adjustments to Groupon s 2014 10 K
Income Statement  we made  76 million of adjustments with a net effect of removing  68 million in non operating expenses  2  of revenue   We removed  72 million related to non operating expenses  including  31 million in foreign currency losses  and  4 million related to non operating income  Despite removing  68 million in non operating expenses  Groupon still earned negative NOPAT in 2014 
Balance Sheet  we made  1 4 billion of adjustments to calculate invested capital with a net decrease of  671 million  The most notable adjustment was the inclusion of  177 million  20  of net assets  due to operating leases 
Valuation  we made  1 2 billion of adjustments with a net effect of increasing shareholder value by  447 million  The largest adjustment was the inclusion of  807 million in   This adjustment represents 44  of Groupon s market cap 
Valuation Is Still Too High
With GRPN down nearly 64  YTD  you may wonder   how much further can it fall   Even at  3 share  Groupon remains significantly overvalued  To justify its current price  Groupon must immediately achieve 3  pre tax margins   1 5  on a TTM basis  and grow revenue by 15  compounded annually for the next 15 years  In this scenario  Groupon would be generating  26 billion in revenue in 15 years  which is nearly equal to food giant McDonalds   N MCD  2014 revenue 
Meanwhile  if we re conservative and assume GRPN can achieve 1  pre tax margins and grow revenue by 11  compounded annually for the next decade  shares are worth just over  1 25 share today   a 58  downside

172747,394263,GT,Are Corporate Investors Ignoring Long Term Stability For Easy Debt ,opinion,"A recent  in the New York Times illustrates a wider issue across the corporate world which has developed in the last 10 to 20 years  not just in the US but increasingly across most western markets 
The story starts fittingly in America s heartland with two businesses run as one under the banner of the family name Timken  NYSE TKR   Old man Henry Timken  a carriage maker  moved his bearing business to Canton  Ohio  from St  Louis in 1901  anticipating the growth of the auto industry  Steel was added with a specialty in the grades needed for the bearing business and later in the oil industry and other specialist applications 
The Timken family are still there 117 years later and their support keeps the city of Canton functioning better than the nearby city of Akron where Goodyear  NASDAQ GT  pulled out after nearly 100 years making tires  Timken is not just about jobs and salaries  crucial as those are 
Over the last 5 years  the Timken family  foundation and company have given hundreds of thousands of dollars to the city s biggest hospital  and at least  3 5 million to ArtsinStark  a private arts council that supports Canton s art museum  ballet  symphony and other cultural institutions  In fact  the Timken Foundation built Timken High School in the late 1930s  the paper reports and the foundation poured  10 million into the school from 1997 to 2002 after graduation rates plunged  The district used the money to pay for new math and science programs as well as to renovate the campus 
The article strikes a balanced stance  it stresses the Timken family have  in turn  earned handsomely out of their ownership of the business over the years  They are certainly not bleeding heart liberals but staunch republicans  but republicans of an older hue maybe with an almost paternalistic sense of responsibility to the community in which they live and work 
The point the Times is trying to make in this article is not the rights or wrongs of Timken s philosophy  more that it  along with much else in corporate America  the firm is at risk from the short termism that has become the prevailing wisdom over the last 10 to 20 years  Shares in Timken were bought up in 2012 by an activist investor called Relational from San Diego 
Relational along with support from the California State Teachers  Retirement System  known as Calstrs  mounted a year long campaign to  unlock value  in Timken s underperforming share price  Timken carried very little debt  partly because the family felt that gave them a cushion during the notoriously cyclical down times in the steel industry  But activist investors like debt  whether to make acquisitions or to increase dividends and finance large scale stock buybacks 
The investor felt the 2 firms would be worth more apart and in fact  Relational s model for a broken up Timken suggested the 2 resulting pieces could afford to take on just over  1 billion in fresh debt the paper said  Debt that could be used for share buybacks and boost the share price   not in the investors  view   for investment 
Bill George  a Harvard Business School professor is quoted as saying   Activists think long term is 12 months and the first thing that goes is the stuff that pays off in 5 or 10 years   adding  America s strength isn t from low labor costs  It s from research and development and capital investment  
You cannot do that stuff on a short term focus and while financing a mountain of debt  As a result of the investor s pressure  Timken duly broke into 2 firms  One was Timkensteel  NYSE TMST  making high end steel  the other Timken bearings  Whilst it has one of the most modern slab casters in North America and operates profitably in it s niche  the steel division is now ripe for a takeover by one of the majors  with the cost cutting and rationalization that will inevitably be part of that process 
Meanwhile  Relational has unloaded its entire position in both Timken and TimkenSteel  Relational acquired its stake at about  40 a share and sold at  70  reaping a 75  gain    188 million   in just over 2 years  The firm hasn t done anything illegal  arguably it hasn t even done anything immoral  it has simply operated within the rules of engagement we have all come to expect and accept as normal in today s world 
Yet  as year end approaches so to does that time to step back from day to day work and reflect on the wider environment in which we work  and maybe ask ourselves  is this the kind of behavior we want to encourage  Could there not be a better way  The people of Canton no doubt think there could be as they look at a new year that holds less job security than at anytime for the last hundred years

172772,394288,GT,Pensions Weigh On Goodyear Stock Potential,opinion,I Recommend Avoiding Goodyear Tire   Rubber  GT  Stock   Goodyear Tire   Rubber  GT  must overcome  3 7 billion in underfunded pensions plus  6 3 billion in debt   1 1 billion of which is off balance sheet  before investors could see any upside    Somewhat aggressive accounting for its  U S   and  Non U S  Pensions  and  Other Postretirement Benefit  plans   pensions   understates the gravity of pensions in their reported earnings  However  Goodyear has been very forthright in discussing the cash flow implications of their underfunded pensions    Contrary to Delta Airlines  DAL  and other firms we contacted  GT s IR department was quite willing to answer my questions about their pensions liabilities    The company s stated plans to pay down its off balance sheet liabilities depend on a fairly positive long term economic outlook    I think management at Goodyear is well aware of their off balance sheet issues and is taking steps to address them  However  if business headwinds persist  they simply may not have the cash flow required to overcome their pension liabilities    If business does not remain buoyant  I think GT s earnings estimates will have to be lowered to reflect the looming pension liabilities  Abnormal Pension Accounting Boosts EPS    GT boosted its 2011 earnings by increasing its expected return on plan assets   EROPA   assumption for its pensions to 7 70 1    down from 7 82  in 2010   has the details    An EROPA of 7 70  is abnormally high  Out of the 1 021 companies with pensions that I cover  63  of them have a lower EROPA  Only 96 of the 1 021 raised their EROPAs in 2012 while 525 lowered and 400 made no changes    The 2012 EROPA looks a bit high compared to my estimates of the company s actual return on plan assets  I estimate 2011 s actual return on plan assets was 3 19   I estimate the average return over the last five years is 4 33   over the past 10 years it is 6 40   since 1998 it is 6 55   These estimates are based on dividing the  Actual return on plan assets  by the  Beginning balance  of plan assets after adjustments suggested by GT s IR contact  Mike McCormick  You can replicate my analysis using data from the company s annual reports as detailed in   which is based on data from the          and  10 Ks  Accounting Lowers Pension Expenses   Has Big Impact On EPS   Since GT s pensions are so large  its pension costs play a prominent role in earnings  much more so than most companies  GT s net periodic benefit cost after tax  the cost attributable to pensions with the current EROPA reported in GAAP earnings  is over 62  of 2011 s net income    Assuming a high EROPA enables GT to lower the costs it must report in earnings for paying into its pensions  In turn  the company s overall expenses are lower and accounting earnings are higher    A 1  decrease in GT s EROPA would wipe away 7  of the company s 2011 net income   35 million increase in pre tax earnings  or  0 088 per basic shares outstanding  A 1  reduction to a 7 43  EROPA would be below the median  7 5   EROPA for the 1 021 pensions we analyzed    I think it is fair to say that GT is stretching the limits of its EROPA  which props up earnings  Pensions Are Already Underfunded by  3 7 billion   One could argue that stretching the limits of EROPA and minimizing the amount of money it pays into its pensions is a fair and good strategy for a company whose pensions were adequately funded  That argument does not hold for GT as its pensions were under funded by  3 7 billion as of 12 31 2011  The sum of the  net funded status  for the U S   Non U S  and Other Postretirement Benefits  on page  shows where I get the  3 7 billion value  which is about 1 5 times the company s market cap  Doubtful That GT Can Grow Its Way Out Of Its Liabilities   If GT were in a high growth industry with excellent prospects for future profits  one could argue that the company could easily earn its way out of the underfunded pensions hole  That is a tough argument for a company in such a competitive and low margin business in a challenging economic environment    Despite reporting profitable GAAP accounting profits  my more comprehensive model suggests that GT is an unprofitable business even if one assumes its EROPA is fair and accurate  Figure 1 compares GT s  to its accounting earnings  In 2011  GT reported  321 million in accounting profit while I believe the company s true cash flows were closer to   341 million    Figure 1  Accounting Profits Are Rosy Too Sustainable  Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings   One of the largest drivers of the differences in reported accounting and  for GT is  1 1 billion in off balance sheet debt from operating leases  about 45  of the company s market cap   In addition  Goodyear is in a very capital intensive business and generates relatively little cash compared to the amount of  in the business    From where I sit  the company is in a tough situation  It is not making much  if any  money and its liabilities are formidable  pensions at  3 7 billion plus total debt of  6 3 billion equals  10 billion  Equity Value Depressed By Growing Pension   Debt Liabilities   Last year  despite a significant increase in EPS compared to the prior year  the underfunded status of GT s pensions grew from  3 1 billion at the end of 2010 to  3 7 billion at the end of 2011    Even if GT s liabilities do not increase  equity investors should be intimidated by the  10 billion in existing liabilities that have a senior claim on Goodyear s future profits  If Goodyear does generate future profits  those profits have to be large enough to cover the  10 billion in senior claims plus the expectations baked into the current stock price before equity investors can make significant money in GT     10 billion is more than 31 times GT s 2011 net income  Equity investors may be at the end of a very long line when it comes to expecting a payout from GT  Stock Valuation Is Oblivious To Looming Liabilities   For those that say all of this information is already baked into the stock price  I suggest you look again  According to my discounted cash flow model  to justify the stock valuation at  10 16 share  the company has to grow its after tax cash flow  NOPAT  by 4  compounded annually for 10 years  I underscore that those are the expectations baked into the current stock price  For investors to believe GT deserves a higher valuation stock price  they must believe that the company s future profit growth will be even greater than that baked into the current stock price  Footnotes Diligence Pays   In summary  using the footnotes to lift the accounting veil on GT s financial situation reveals some earnings and liabilities issues for a stock that is fairly expensive and could suffer downward pressure when investors concerned about these issues  Avoid ETFs and Mutual Funds That Hold GT

1  Sell short  or buy Puts  against a stop at the top of the range looking for a short term move lower to the trend line or lower 
2  Sell Puts with a 26 Strike on anticipation of the trend line  and 100 day SMA holding  for an entry lower  You can do this in 1 3 or half size if less confident of a stop at 26 
3  Buy the stock in 1 2 size and sell a 26 29 strangle against it  This gets you to full size if it reaches 26 and acts as a covered call if it goes up

172784,394300,GT,3 Dirt Cheap Blue Chip Stocks You Should Consider Owning Right Now,opinion,It s noteworthy that the S P 500 has risen 28  since Oct  3  2011  working out to be a nearly 60  annualized gain  What s even more notable is that almost all of the upside  outside of Apple  Nasdaq     has been in the riskiest end of the market  from heavily shorted stocks that saw short covering  to stocks that already sported fairly high price to earnings  P E  ratios    If you ve been focusing on safer stocks with lower P Es  then you may feel like you missed out on the fun  These value stocks have simply not been in focus  But it would be foolhardy to shift gears now  After the very strong run for aggressive growth stocks  the valuation gap when compared with value stocks has rarely been this stark  That s not to say that value stocks are suddenly poised to start appreciating much faster than growth stocks  but it does mean that they should at least hold their own in terms of upside  while offering significantly more downside protection I dug into more than 100 stocks in the S P 500 that are trading for less than 10 times projected 2013 profits  I found three stocks that I think offer an especially compelling combination of low risk and high reward    1  Goodyear Tire   Rubber  NYSE    Making tires is a straightforward business  When input prices  such as rubber  increase  you simply raise the prices that your customers pay  That s why this tire maker s gross profit margins hover around 17  every year  The key factor is volume  When car and truck sales slump  demand for tires weakens and gross profits start to get eroded by overhead costs  Yet it works the other way as well  Rising volume could lead to outsized operating profits  That was surely the case for Goodyear in 2011 as a 20  jump in sales to  22 8 billion pushed operating profits from just  8 million in 2010 up to  618 million  or  1 91 a share  Although sales growth is now moderating  that leverage should remain in effect  so a modest jump in sales in 2013 should boost earnings north of  2 50 per share    Trading at around  11 means this stock trades for less than five times projected 2013 profits  Analysts at Citigroup expect the stock to move up to  21  because  shares are meaningfully undervalued versus the company s present future earnings power and strong global franchise   They expect Goodyear to garner hefty returns on its capital base  return on equity exceeded 70  in 2011  should top 50  this year  and exceed 40  in 2014  That high rate should help boost book value from  3 07 a share this year to  11 a share by 2014  where the stock price sits now   according to Citigroup    2  Hewlett Packard  NYSE    There is no such thing as a quick turnaround  Any company that has been losing its focus for several years needs several quarters    or more    to get back on track  Yet investors are already losing patience with former eBay  Nasdaq    CEO Meg Whitman  who was brought in last summer to lead a turnaround at Hewlett Packard  Investors had been hoping that Whitman s first moves would quickly lead to improving results  So when she recently discussed her turnaround plans and the fact that they will modestly dampen profits in the near term  investors were pretty disappointed  pushing shares down to below where they were when she first came in Yet her strategy looks quite sound  though  She intends to streamline operations by standardizing products  as well as optimize the supply chain and automate more production processes  She also plans to invest the resources to regain market leadership in some segments such as security and enterprisewide IT management  She won t succeed on all fronts  but investors should be heartened by a management team that has a proven track record and a plan to play offense and not defense Even with modestly lowered 2012 and 2013 profit assumptions  this stock is still remarkably cheap  trading at less than eight times fiscal  October  2012 profits and just seven times projected fiscal 2013 profits  This is still a business with a high degree of recurring revenue  thanks to long term contracts  so those forward profit forecasts are unlikely to move much lower  even if Whitman s plans are slow to impact results  Shares have likely found a floor in the low  20s and could easily move into the  30s as signs of the turnaround finally take shape 3  Cliffs Natural Resources  NYSE    It s  back to basics  for this mining firm  which went on a recent acquisition spree that doubled sales in 2010  to  4 7 billion  and boosted them another 45  in 2011  to  6 8 billion   The broadened sales base  along with rising commodity prices  helped boost free cash flow from  37 million in 2009 to a whopping  1 3 billion in 2011    But investors began to overlook this on fears of a rising debt load that now stands at  3 7 billion  Shares have fallen from  100 last summer to a recent  70  This helps explain why management recently met with analysts to announce a new strategy  Forget about more big acquisitions  Instead  look for rising dividends  Shares yield roughly 3 6  right now  after a nice recent boost   and could rise much higher  as the payout ratio now stands at just 27     Moreover  management aims to use the prodigious free cash flow to steadily pay down debt  The de leveraging process should help boost the sagging P E ratio as investors begin to value the company s earnings more   Right now  the stock trades for less than eight times projected 2012 profits  of  9 50 a share  and around six times projected 2013 profits  of  11 50 a share   That s among the lowest forward P E ratios in the S P 500    Risks to Consider  Each of these companies will need at least a slowly improving economy to hit their targets  This appears to be happening  though the economy slipped back last summer after showing similar signs of growth in the early spring  Action to Take     The low P E ratios tell you these stocks are out of favor  Yet they will really start to pop up on investors  radars if and when sentiment shifts into a less bullish mode and value stocks move into focus  Any of these three stocks are good buys in anticipation of that happening by David

172788,394304,GT,This Classic Value Stock Could Nearly Double ,opinion,One of the biggest weaknesses of the Wall Street research model is that it tends to focus on stocks that are able to make the fastest upward move  failing to really look at which stocks could post strong returns over the long haul  As a result  a number of solid long term investment opportunities simply fall through the cracks But it hasn t always been this way  Back in the days of Benjamin Graham and David Dodd    both known as the grandfathers of value investing    an emphasis was placed on stocks as assets  These investors focused on what a company was worth in relation to its assets  the defensibility of its business model  and the level of cash flow that could be sustainably produced throughout the years Every once in a while  I come across what I call a  Graham   Dodd special   These opportunities typically involve large  well established businesses that operate in an industry with deep barriers to entry  They often involve large amounts of capital spending  creating an impediment to new firms looking to crack the market  And they can count on a steady recurring base of customers that need to keep coming back to them    My Graham   Dodd stock for 2012  Goodyear Tire   Rubber  NYSE  GT   which is currently deeply out of favor and remarkably cheap by almost any measure  Assuming we ll be driving vehicles that have tires in the next five or 10 years  this is a company with staying power  Yet you won t find Goodyear on any Wall Street s lists of top stock ideas  Simply put  it s an unsexy business that isn t poised to outperform the market in the next few weeks or months  The stock chart above paints a pretty clear picture  For a moment  forget the financial crisis of 2008 that severely punished all kinds of stocks  That anomalous event is highly unlikely to recur  Excluding that brutal period  this stock is near a four year low  trading for less than half of what it did before the global economy began a multi year slump  Shares of Goodyear remain in a deep funk  even as the North American market gets stronger  Nowadays  it s Europe that weighs heavily  Yet as soon as the continent s economy hits bottom  we may see a fairly solid snapback in European vehicle sales  That market has been depressed for five years  and the average vehicle age creeps ever higher  We re seeing a snapback in the United States now  and will likely see one in Europe in a year or two    Meanwhile  note how cheap this stock has become  At a recent  11  Goodyear trades for 4 5 times projected 2013 profits and sports a price to sales ratio of 0 12  Yet these numbers may not always give an accurate gauge of what a company should be worth  Instead  let s look at how this company is valued in relation to historical and projected EBITDA and free cash flow    Goodyear carries a market value of  2 7 billion and an enterprise value of  5 8 billion  Cash flow generation can be erratic  because it s largely tied to raw materials  rubber  prices and unit volumes  In 2009  EBITDA fell to a decade low of  580 million  but it rebounded to a decade high of  1 67 billion in 2011  During the past eight years  EBITDA has averaged  1 2 billion  This means the company trades for less than five times normal EBITDA and less than four times trailing EBITDA  For a company with such a solid base of recurring revenue  sales bottomed out at a decade low  16 3 billion in 2009 and are already back above  22 billion   and a strong global brand  that s a very low EBITDA multiple    Using free cash flow  FCF  as a measure  Goodyear doesn t look as appealing  The company has only reported positive free cash flow in one of the past three years  or a cumulative  236 million in the past three years  The explanation is simple  Goodyear routinely spent  600 million to  700 million on annual capital spending  2004 through 2009   but management has decided to step on the gas  Goodyear spiked CapEx by  300 million to  400 million above usual levels in each of the past two years so it could modernize plants and lower long term manufacturing costs  This move should set the stage for much more robust free cash flow in coming years    2012  A lost year   Goodyear s stock stood at  15 in early January but is now down about  11  This suggests investors have thrown in the towel on 2012  perhaps noting that unit sales of tires are expected to be down this year  Yet it s important to see the total revenue figure and not just sales volumes    Goodyear has pushed through a series of price hikes in all of its key markets  which will more than offset the sales decline in volume  As a result  sales are expected to rise around 3  this year to  23 5 billion and another 6  in 2013 to nearly  25 billion  That consensus forecast looks too conservative  because it appears to imply that 2013 tire sales will be even worse than 2012  blunting what will likely be high single digit price increases  if recent history is any guide    But even if 2012 is seen as a  lost year  because of weak global demand  it s worth noting the expected earnings of  1 85 per share will still be near record levels  And analysts say the heavy capital spending I noted earlier will lead to firming margins in 2013  which could propel earnings per share  EPS  to  2 50  Merrill Lynch says this figure could exceed  3 by 2014  which isn t bad for an  11 stock  Operating margins could hit a record 6 0  by 2014  thanks to those internal investments I mentioned earlier    Still  investors are unloading this deep value stock right now   A large Q1 beat  confident 2013  affirmation  debt refinancing and improving pension metrics were met with a 5  stock sell off that we  along with many investors  found puzzling   note analysts at Citigroup  who maintained their  21 price target    Risks to Consider  Rubber prices are always a wildcard  so any sort of troubles on that front will impede margins for Goodyear     There s really no reason to load up shares of Goodyear at this moment  Unless  of course  you want to own companies that have a tremendous long term track record and sport very low valuations  What this stock lacks in timeliness it more than makes up for in safety  stability and a path to higher profits within a few years  And if shares reach that  21 price target set by

172789,394305,GT,These Mid Caps Are On Fire,opinion,Pity the poor mid caps  Many investors tend to focus on large cap blue chip stocks  while more aggressive investors often seek out robust potential upside among off the radar small cap stocks  Stuck in the middle  Mid cap stocks    which I define as having market values between  1 billion and  5 billion   often fall into the cracks  And that s a shame because these companies often represent the stability of large caps and the potential for unappreciated value of small caps  as many of them are still not widely known by most investors    I went looking for the most interesting mid cap stocks right now  I focused on companies that exceeded first quarter profit forecasts by at least 30   with earnings of at least  0 25 per share   After a deeper look  a few stocks in the group appear especially appealing right now   Right off the top  we have two stocks that beat the pants off of earnings forecasts  Goodyear Tire  NYSE  GT   which I noted   looks like a deep value play  The other is Diebold  NYSE  DBD   which my colleague Tim Begany nailed back in January  and     Is it sustainable  It s important to remember the old investing maxim  one quarter does not a trend make   Indeed  a company can show real strength in one period  thanks to industry pricing and volume trends  only to see a deep reversal in those factors just three months later    Consider the case of U S  Steel  NYSE  X   The steel maker missed estimates in the second quarter of 2011  blew past forecasts in the third quarter  once again badly lagged the consensus in the final quarter of the year    and just announced a very solid quarter to start the current year  Goldman Sachs analysts say the first quarter results will be the high watermark for the year  and rates shares a  sell  with a  23 price target    roughly 15  below the current stock price   We remain of the view that steel prices will be lower in 2H2012 and thus  steel price sensitive companies like U S  Steel would see a material deterioration in earnings in the latter part of the year   they wrote in an April 24 note to clients    On the other hand  any company that can top estimates while industry conditions remain challenging is likely to produce ever stronger results as that industry starts rebound  As an example  check out Terex  NYSE  TEX   which provides a range of construction equipment  such as cranes  aerial lifts and other gear  that helps build roads  buildings and other infrastructure projects    Terex really took it on the chin during the recent recession  Sales fell from  8 billion in 2007 to just  3 9 billion in 2008  leading to an 80  drop in gross profits to  297 million  The top line has bounced back up to a recent  6 5 billion in 2011  should exceed  8 billion this year and top  9 billion in 2013  according to Merrill Lynch  Meanwhile  after falling from  90 back in 2007 to a recent  23  shares trade for less than six times Merrill s projected 2012 EBITDA  That multiple slips even lower if you anticipate an improving economy in coming years that boosts construction spending    General Cable  NYSE  BGC  is another company geared up for an improving level of construction spending  The company s utility grade cables are used in office parks  submerged power line programs and general construction  General Cable is also a leading provider of communications network wiring that is deployed by phone companies  Shares had been slumping since last summer after a string of earnings disappointments  but industry conditions have now turned up  and a just announced strong first quarter could be the start of a new trend    Analysts anticipate only moderate 5  sales growth in 2012 and 2013  to around  6 7 billion   but they also see a lot of operating leverage in the income statement  As a result  earnings per share  EPS  are expected to rise around 20  this year to around  2 60  and more than 30  in 2013 to around  3 40  Shares trade for less than 10 times that 2013 outlook  which may not even be the top of the cycle  Analysts at DA Davidson see shares rising form a recent  32 to  40  and that target price assumes shares will trade up to just six times projected 2013 EBITDA    Risks to Consider  A slowing U S  economy would make it a lot harder for these companies to exceed a rising level of expectations    A few companies on this list may be poised to put together a string of successful quarters  But as noted  don t assume that a one time profit surge can last  You need to dig into the factors behind the EPS beat to be assured that better than expected profits will be the case throughout the year  by David Sterman,2012-05-06,StreetAuthority,https://www.investing.com/analysis/these-mid-caps-are-on-fire-122330,122330
