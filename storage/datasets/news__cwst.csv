14127,235642,CWST,Here s Why You Should Hold On To AGCO Corp At The Moment,opinion,AGCO Corporation   NYSE AGCO   has been displaying an impressive show  driven by its stellar earnings performance in the September end quarter as well as benefit from margin improvement  investment in products  technology  and a solid capital allocation plan  However  a reduced market outlook  elevated expenses and unfavorable foreign currency are key concerns AGCO s shares have appreciated 34 5  over the past year  outperforming the  s growth of 17 2   The company has an estimated long term earnings growth rate of 13 7  The company currently has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and a of B  Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B combined with a Zacks Rank  1 Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   offer the best investment opportunities Below  we briefly discuss the company s potential growth drivers and possible headwinds What s Working in Favor of AGCO Earnings Beat Consensus Mark in Q3 AGCO s third quarter 2019 adjusted earnings per share of 82 cents surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 78 cents  The company gained from its price realization initiatives  improved productivity and focus on margin expansion amid a challenging market environment in the quarter Positive Earnings Surprise HistoryAGCO outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters  the average positive earnings surprise being 32 7  Upbeat GuidanceIn 2019  AGCO anticipates gross and operating margins to be higher than 2018 levels  as the positive impact of pricing and benefits from cost reduction initiatives are likely to offset the negative impact of foreign currency translation and relatively flat sale volumes  Considering these  AGCO reaffirmed adjusted earnings per share guidance of  5 10 for the current year  up from the previous expectation of  4 90  Furthermore  AGCO is likely to witness growth in its grain and protein business  backed by expectations of an increase in population and higher protein consumption  Healthy Growth Projections For 2019  the Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at  5 06  indicating a year over year jump of 30 1   The same for 2020 is pegged at  5 58  calling for year over year growth of 10 4  Return on AssetsAGCO currently has a Return on Assets  ROA  of 4 8   while the industry recorded ROA of 4 5   An above average ROA denotes that the company is generating earnings by effectively managing assets Cheap ValuationAGCO s trailing 12 month EV EBITDA ratio is 8 3  while the industry s average trailing 12 month EV EBITDA is 10 8  Consequently  the stock is cheaper at this point based on the ratio UnderpricedAGCO s price to earnings ratio suggests that shares are underpriced currently  which seems to be attractive to investors  The company has a trailing P E ratio of 16 6  below the industry s average of 17 9 Growth Drivers in PlaceAGCO is consistently making investments to enhance and expand its product lines  upgrade system capabilities and improve factory productivity  In a bid to execute its product development plan and meet the latest emission requirements in Brazil and Europe  the company intends to increase the investment level in 2019  Consequently  AGCO expects current year capital expenditures of roughly  228 million  up from the  203 million in 2018  AGCO has completed two acquisitions in the past two years  In September 2017  it acquired Precision Planting   a leader in innovative planting technology  In October 2017  AGCO purchased the forage division of Lely Group  which significantly boosted its hay and forage product line in Europe  fueling growth in this market The company is focused on its long term capital allocation plan by returning cash to shareholders  Over the past six years  the company executed share repurchases of  1 3 billion  which reduced share count by more than 25   In the first nine months of 2019  it repurchased shares worth  100 million  The company expects to generate free cash flow of  275  300 million for 2019  Headwinds for AGCOA late harvest and an early winter are keeping corn and soybean harvests in North America under pressure  Consequently  AGCO expects the North American industry retail tractor sales to be relatively flat in 2019 compared to the last year  Additionally  the U S Agriculture industry has been grappling with low commodity prices and sluggish farm incomes  Tariffs imposed by China on U S  agricultural exports last year dealt a severe blow  given that China is the largest export market for U S  agriculture producers  This along with late planting and slow crop development made farmers more cautious about spending on farm equipment  Also  China hiked some tariffs again in September  These factors are likely to affect AGCO s revenues Further  AGCO s results continue to be impacted by higher engineering expenses and foreign currency translation  These will continue to dampen the company s results for the current year Bottom LineInvestors might want to hold on to the stock  at present  as it has ample prospects of outperforming peers in the near future Stock to ConsiderSome better ranked stocks in the

company s global machine sales growth rate chart has been in the single digits so far this year   at levels last witnessed in 2017  Caterpillar has logged an average growth rate of 5 8  during the January October 2019 period  a dismal performance compared with the prior year s 25 6  Though Caterpillar s sales growth rate has been on a decline  it still remains in the positive territory  Notably  the company had earlier gone through an unprecedented 51 month long stretch of declining sales  which thankfully ended in February 2017  Since March 2017  Caterpillar has reported positive sales growth ever since  delivering an average retail sales growth of 10 3  in 2017 and 23 5  thereafter in 2018 Caterpillar reported third quarter 2019 adjusted earnings per share of  2 66  which declined 7  from the prior year quarter  Revenues declined 6  year over year to  12 8 billion  The company missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both counts  The ongoing global economic uncertainty and

guidance reflects lower end user demand and dealers reducing their inventory  Caterpillar expects modestly lower sales for the year  in contrast to its prior expectation of modest sales growth  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in fiscal 2019 is pegged at  10 87  suggesting a decline of 3 1  from the year ago quarter  The estimate for revenues for the fiscal is at  54 3 billion  calling for a year over year drop of 1  The U S  China trade tensions and waning global demand seems to have taken its toll on the U S manufacturing sector  which in turn has impacted Caterpillar s performance  Further  the company has to contend with raw material cost inflation owing to the imposition of tariffs  However  the company plans to mitigate these impacts through price increases  implementation of the Operating   Execution Model to drive operational excellence  and structural cost discipline  Further  additional investments in expanded offerings and services will drive growth

the Bull of the Day  Casella Waste Systems   NASDAQ CWST   as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on IAC InterActiveCorp   NASDAQ IAC    Match com   NASDAQ MTCH   and Expedia   NASDAQ EXPE   Here is a synopsis of all five stocks  Cree is a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and sports the divergence that I love to see in the Zacks Style Scores   I see an A for Growth and a D for value and that tells me right away that I am on the right path   My focus is on aggressive growth  and I know that growth investors are looking for the opposite of what value investors are looking for   When I see that divergence  I know I found what I am looking for Today  CREE is the Bull of the Day   Let s take a look at why I like this stock right here First off  I see that it is in the chip space and while I normally say that chips are for dips    right now they look like a tasty treat   The chip names are likely to move significantly higher when a China deal is announced due to the relationship that so many names have with that region and country specifically  Secondly  a big buyer just put some cards on the table   Artisian Partners filed a 13G with the SEC stating that they control 8 1M shares   That was just announced the other day    and it follows an early January filing that saw Vanguard announced a 10 4M share position When I see big buyers of size on a stock with a great Zacks Rank  I know it is worth a much deeper look Earnings EstimatesWhen a stock is a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  then we know the estimates are moving higher   That is the key part of the Zacks Rank I see the current quarter move higher by 2 cents  and the full year  fiscal 2019  has moved from  0 73 to  0 78 The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2020 has remained at  1 27 over the last 90 days ValuationThe forward PE of 66x is a little rich  but when you look at the other metrics it doesn t look that bad   A see a 2 4x price to book multiple  which is pretty pretty good for a stock with a 12  topline growth rate   I also see a 3 4x price to sales multiple which is a little high but still within an acceptable range  Casella Waste Systemsis a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  and it is the Bear of the Day   I still like this name as I held it in Home Run Investor  a newsletter service that looks for small and mid cap growth stocks   I recall this name being in the portfolio a

Growth and a D for Value  and that tells me right away that I am on the right path   Growth investors and value investors are looking for different things so when I see a big difference between the style scores I know that I am looking at the right thing CWST has a chance to change the story with earnings coming out on 2 21 after the close  Earnings HistoryI see that over the last four quarters there were two misses  a meet and a beat   That isn t the best I have ever seen but it isn t the worst either Earnings EstimatesI see estimates falling and that is what you would expect from a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  stock   The current quarter has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate move from  0 15 to  0 11 over the last 90 days I see the 2018 full year number move to  0 62 from  0 68   That is just a few cents  but the direction is the real issue The 2019 numbers have come in just a little  from  0 90 to  0 85    but that could all change with a strong report later this month IAC  Expedia Beat Q4 Expectations Internet services conglomerate IAC InterActiveCorp reported Q4 earnings results after the closing bell Thursday  with earnings of  2 04 per share way outperforming the expected 99 cents per share  Revenues grew 16  year over year to  1 104 billion  better than the  1 07 billion in the Zacks consensus  The majority investor of several online service brands has now beaten earnings estimates in 4 of the last 5 quarters  with a trailing 4 quarter average beat of 58  Angie s List grew 25  to  279 million in the quarter  while Match com was up 17  to  8 2 million  The company cited increases in Average Revenue per User  ARPU  at Match owned Tinder in the quarter  Yet these numbers were already somewhat baked into the stock s performance  as Match com reported earnings themselves yesterday afternoon Shares are not moving much in late trading  likely because of the Match com numbers already being out as of Wednesday  Also  the stock had already climbed 18  since the first of the year  Further clarification can be expected on the company s conference call  which is scheduled for tomorrow Internet travel site Expedia also topped expectations on both sales and earnings for its Q4 report  bringing  1 18 per share versus  1 07 expected on revenues of  2 56 billion which outpaced the  2 54 billion our analysts were looking for  Revenues grew 10  year over

23039,244554,CWST,Boot Barn  Casella Waste  Under Armour And Amazon Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   February 11 2018    Boot Barn   NYSE BOOT   as the Bull of the Day  Casella Waste Systems   NASDAQ CWST   as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Under Armour   NYSE UAA   and Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN   Here is a synopsis of all four stocks  Boot Barnis a  700 million operator of a lifestyle retail chain devoted to western and work related footwear  apparel and accessories  The company s products include boots  denim  western shirts  cowboy hats  belts and belt buckles  and western style jewelry and accessories They also stock a line up of rugged footwear  outerwear  overalls  denims  and shirts  as well as safety toe boots  and flame resistant and high visibility clothing  BOOT sells its products through 234 stores in 31 states and their website Bootbarn com On December 21  my colleague Ben Rains wrote about BOOT as a Zacks  1 Rank because analysts were busy raising growth estimates  He was scratching his head about the 44  slide in shares since their October 25 fiscal Q2 report and finding no reasons not to buy the stock    Last quarter  Boot Barn saw its revenues surged 17 5  to reach  168 1 million  Maybe more importantly  the company s same store sales jumped 11 3   On top of growth in this vital retail metric  Boot Barn expanded its store count by three  Holiday Quarter Kicks Boots If we had listened to Ben  we would have been buying BOOT at  16 right before Christmas  Because on Feb 5 they delivered the goods once again  From the company press release   Highlights for the quarter ended December 29  2018  were as follows            Net sales increased 13 0  to  254 0 million           Same store sales increased 9 2   with double digit growth in e commerce and high single digit growth in retail stores           Net income was  19 0 million  or  0 66 per diluted share  compared to net income of  20 1 million  or  0 73 per diluted share in the prior year period            The Company opened two new stores during the quarter  We didn t get earnings beats on the top or bottom lines  but the company raised full year EPS guidance and analysts liked the growth trajectory and outlook so much    especially those 9  SSS  comps  and the double digit e commerce growth    that they in turn raised estimates for this fiscal year  ends March  and next year Boot Barn results gained from robust performances in all products  especially in work apparel  work boots  ladies and men s western apparel  Apart from this  solid marketing strategies  robust merchandising initiatives and strong store operations also contributed to the quarterly results Management raised its fiscal 2019 earnings guidance in the range of  1 31  1 33  up from the prior view of  1 16  1 24  representing an astounding 90  advance this year  This prompted analysts to raise FY2020 EPS from  1 47 to  1 51  representing 13 6  growth To visualize the growth trajectory  here s the Zacks proprietary Price   Consensus chart which plots changes in annual EPS estimates  from investment bank analysts  against the stock price  with green arrows representing the magnitude of earnings beats   In addition to opening two new stores last quarter  company plans during the current fiscal year to open 18 new stores are more than halfway there with 11 openings in the nine months ending Dec 29  2018 In all  BOOT offers growth and value with a forward P E under 17X and a price to sales ratio under 1 0 as 2019 will see revenues eclipse  800 million  Casella Waste Systemsis a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  and it is the Bear of the Day   I still like this name as I held it in Home Run Investor

come in just a little  from  0 90 to  0 85    but that could all change with a strong report later this month Should You Buy Under Armour  UAA  Ahead of Q4 Earnings  Under Armour shares popped through late afternoon trading Friday  just a few days before the sportswear firm reports its fourth quarter financial results  This means it s time to see what to expect from Under Armour before the opening bell Tuesday Quick Overview Under Armour has undertaken a huge restructuring plan that could cost the company as much  220 million  The plan has seen it cut its workforce and try to streamline both its go to market strategy and product offerings Unfortunately for investors  Under Amour s revamp has not led to the comeback that many might have hoped  In fact  Under Armour announced at its investors day in December 2018 its first in three years that it  growth annually in North America from 2019 through 2023  This came after Under Armour s overall Q3 revenues climbed just 2  to reach  1 44 billion Plus  UA s vital North American revenues slipped 1 6  in the third quarter and dropped 5 3  in Q3 2017  Overall  North American sales have now fallen in four of the past five quarters Under Armour s performance stands out in comparison to its sportswear peers  who have all experienced far greater revenue growth  The company s biggest rivals have rolled out successful direct to consumer pushes as they shift away from the likes of wholesalers in an Amazon  obsessed age  Under Armour s DTC revenues came in roughly flat last quarter  Meanwhile  its international business has failed to gain the traction Wall Street might have hoped  And the company s inability to roll out enticing athleisure and non performance wear offerings has hurt Under Armour as the category continues to expand As we touched on at the top  UAA stock jumped 1 7  through late afternoon trading on Friday to rest at  18 98 a share  This marked a roughly 19  downturn from Under Armour s 52 week high of  23 28 a share and could set up a solid buying opportunity for those high on Under Armour Q4 Outlook Moving on  Under Armour s Q4 revenues are projected to pop by 0 78  to reach  1 38 billion  based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimate  This would make the vital holiday shopping period UA s slowest top line growth of 2018 after its revenues climbed 2  last quarter  8  in Q2  and 6  in the first quarterAt the bottom end of the income statement  Under Armour s adjusted earnings are projected to jump from neutral  or  0 00 a share in the year ago period  to  0 04 in the fourth quarter Investors should note that the company has seen some mixed earnings estimate revision activity recently  However  the last 30 days have been completely positive  which means at least some analyst are more optimistic about Under Armour s earnings picture Bottom Line Under Armour is currently trading at 61 1X forward 12 month Zacks Consensus EPS estimates  which represents a huge premium compared to its industry s 14 9X average  With that said  Under Armour seems to be more of a trader s stock than an investor s at the moment  This means that UAA could see big post earnings move in either direction Under Armour is scheduled to release its fourth quarter financial results before the opening bell on Tuesday  February 12  Make sure to come back to Zacks for a full breakdown Zacks  Top 10 Stocks for

cents and also doubled from prior year quarter s earnings of 64 cents The better than expected results came on the back of the company s incessant efforts to cut down costs to counter the impact of

Caterpillar reported earnings per share of 32 cents in the quarter  down 3 8  from 46 cents in the prior year quarter  RevenuesRevenues improved 3 8  year over year to  9 8 billion in the quarter  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  9 36 billion  Favorable price realization and higher sales volume  with the most significant increase in Resource Industries mostly owing to higher end user

end user demand for new equipment and the negative impact of changes in dealer inventories resulting from increased inventories in first quarter 2016 than in the first quarter 2017 offset higher

absorption and improved material costs  Operating profit advanced 44  at Construction Industries owing to lower period costs and favorable price realization  The Resource Industries returned to profit in the quarter compared with the loss incurred in the prior year quarter thanks to higher sales volume and lower period costs Financial Products  revenues went up 2  to  760 million primarily due to higher average financing rates in North America  partially offset by lower average earning assets in North America  Latin America and Asia Pacific and lower average financing rates in Asia Pacific  Financial Products  profit was  183 million in the quarter up from  168 million in the prior year quarter owing to a decrease in the provision for credit losses at Cat Financial Financial

23283,244798,CWST,Fluor  FLR  Q3 Earnings  What s In Store For The Stock ,opinion,"Fluor Corporation   NYSE FLR   is set to report third quarter 2016 results  after the closing bell on Nov 3 
In the preceding quarter  the company had let down investors by posting a negative earnings surprise of around 17 2   marking a hat trick of negative surprises  The company has had a dismal earnings history  registering positive earnings surprise in just one of the last four quarters  resulting in a negative average surprise of 9 6  
Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors to Consider
Fluor s tepid financial performance over the past few quarters is largely attributable to the volatile commodity prices  which has been hurting companies operating in the energy domain  particularly the oil and gas sector  Precipitous decline in the prices of crude oil and certain metals have impacted the ability of Fluor s clients to fund new projects  This has affected the company s profitability 
A major portion of Fluor s revenues comes from its Industrial   Infrastructure segment  The segment has been witnessing weakness for the past few quarters  owing to a decline in contributions from its mining and metals business line  Prevailing softness in the mining and metals business continue to dampen lucrative commercial opportunities for the company  We believe that this can significantlyhamper revenue growth in the thirdquarter 
We believe that deferrals in investment decisions by major clients will act as major spoilsport  marring Fluor s third quarter financial performance  This apart  sluggish economic growth worldwide and softness in key geographic regions arealso expected to restrict the company s top line growth for the soon to be reported quarter  Such economic conditions are also weighing down on the company s non oil and gas end markets  affecting key financials 
Concurrent with its second quarter earnings release  Fluor had narrowed its full year 2016 guidance  The company had hinted that its revenues will continue to take a beating on account of this bleak macroeconomic scenario  Most of the revenue decline is likely to be in the second half of the year  thus signaling at a weak third quarte  This apart  intense competition in the global engineering  procurement and construction industry is also estimatedto put pressure on its contract prices and profit margins 
Despite these challenges  Fluor s market diversity remains a key strength that helps it mitigate the cyclicality of markets in which it operates  This apart  we perceive thatFluor s proven business model  and its  One Fluor  initiative provides it with a competitive advantage over peers  Also  a leaner operating structure  good capital stewardship  a strong backlog trend and potential for margin upside from new awards are other positives that will likely drive the third quarter results 
Of late  the government and power business lines have proved to be the company s strongest profit churners  offsetting the weakness in mining and petrochemical business  During second quarter 2016  the company s new awards surgeda striking 50 7  to  6 4 million on a year over year basis  mainly attributable to infrastructure and government business lines  We believe that these segments will be the major sales driver for the thirdquarter as well Furthermore  the company s cost optimization efforts and strategic partnerships are also expected to supplement its key financials for the soon to be reported quarter 
Earlier this year  the company revamped its business lines to better reflect the diverse end markets  Also  it completed the acquisition of Dutch engineering and construction company   Stork   to boost its integrated solutions portfolio  Buoyed by the Stork acquisition  during the last reported quarter  Maintenance  Modification   Asset Integrity revenues almost doubled on a year over year basis  We believe that Stork will continue to bolster revenues in the third quarter as well 
Earnings Whispers

Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement 
Existing Scenario
After reporting robust results for the first half of 2016  Xylem believes that consistently rising demand for water infrastructure and wastewater services would improve its revenues and margins in the upcoming quarter  Moreover  the company s strategic approach toward project execution and lately  new inorganic investments  are anticipated to bear fruit in the to be reported quarter  For instance  acquisition of Tideland Signal Corporation in Feb 2016 is expected to supplement Xylems  sales in the coastal and ocean markets  Furthermore  the company believes that the initiatives undertaken to curb operational costs would help in expanding its margins going ahead 
However  our observations indicate that the company might fail to surprise in third quarter earnings due to certain headwinds  For instance  lower investments made by energy and mining companies may hurt the demand for industrial services offered by Xylem  Also  further strengthening of U S  currency might lower foreign revenues and earnings in the upcoming quarterly results 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Xylem is likely to beat earnings this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here as we will see below

23390,244905,CWST,What s In Store For VASCO  VDSI  This Earnings Season ,opinion,"Leading security software firm VASCO Data Security International Inc    NASDAQ VDSI   is set to report second quarter 2016 results after the market closes on Jul 28  2016  In the last reported quarter  earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 10 cents  VASCO also has a solid earnings surprise history  beating estimates in three of the last four quarters with a positive average earnings surprise of 73 91  
Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Key Factors to Consider
VASCO has been working on expanding its customer base  which in turn will have a positive impact on its revenues  VASCO is concentrating both on growing its business organically and making smart acquisitions  In the soon to be reported quarter  VASCO introduced its DIGIPASS for Apps Face Recognition to provide organizations a frictionless authentication option to enhance security and improve the user experience 
This application has simple  secure and user friendly features that utilize multiple facial data points to accurately authenticate end users  and next generation detection tools to overcome hacker spoofing techniques  The adoption of this innovative technology is likely to augment revenues and improve the bottom line 
During the quarter  VASCO s eSignLive launched its Spring  16 Release for the cloud electronic signature software  The Spring  16 Release brings an intuitive sender interface that offers business users the simplest way to prepare and send documents for signature  This release also introduced the eSignLive for Apple Inc   NASDAQ AAPL  iPad application  It offers the simplest way to prepare and send documents for signing on the iPad  In addition to an updated dashboard to monitor transactions  the new app offers offline signing functionality with no or limited connectivity 
The company continues to make investments to build its capabilities in sales  marketing and R D  It remains focused on its goal to return to previous levels of high operating margins  driven by continuous investments and a mix shift to higher gross margin products  However  in the to be reported quarter these investments may lead to higher expenses  in turn curbing its profitability VASCO DATA SEC Price and EPS Surprise
   Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that VASCO is likely to beat on earnings this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy    2  Buy  or  3  Hold  to post an earnings beat  However  this is not the case here  as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is at 0 00  
Zacks Rank  VASCO s Zacks Rank  3 when combined with 0 00  ESP makes an earnings beat uncertain this quarter  We believe that Sell rated stocks   4 and  5  should never be considered going into an earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions

Gross margin  excluding depreciation and amortization   in the reported quarter was 33 9   compared with 37 5  in the year ago quarter  The decline was mainly due to lower volume of higher margin products

Segment Performance
Revenues from the company s core Activated Carbon and Service segment decreased roughly 2  year over year to  121 1 million in the second quarter  Potable water and specialty market sales increased in all geographic regions  These increases were offset by lower sales of powdered activated carbon for treating coal fired power plant mercury emissions in North America  and reduced sales to industrial and food market customers in all geographic regions 
The Equipment division s revenues declined around 8 3  year over year to  8 8 million  Higher sales of carbon adsorption equipment and ion exchange equipment was more than offset by reduced ballast water treatment system sales 
Sales from the Consumer segment jumped 18 2  year over year to  2 6 million in the quarter on the back of an increase in the sale of carbon cloth for defense applications 
Financial Position
Calgon Carbon ended second quarter 2016 with cash and cash equivalents of  51 2 million  up from  50 1 million as of Jun 30  2015  Long term debt was  101 6 million as of Jun 30  2016  up from  87 3 million as of Jun 30  2015

23491,245006,CWST,S P 500 Hits New Highs  ETFs   Stocks To Bet On,opinion,"After striving for long  the key U S  equity gauge  the S P 500  finally hit an all time high on July 11  The index touched an intraday high of 2 143 16  before closing at 2 137 16  representing a stupendous 220  surge since the market hit the  bottom in March  
Not only the S P 500  the Nasdaq hit this year s high of 5002 50 before retreating slightly and the Dow Jones industrial average hit a   Small cap index Russell 2000 also added about 1 1  on July 11  down 6 7  from the 52 week high 
What s Behind the Surge
The rally materialized despite ultra cautious sentiments prevalent in the marketplace since Britain cut ties with the European Union in late June following a referendum  With the negative consequences of Brexit yet to be felt on the global economy  the sheer uncertainty kept investors edgy 
Record Low Bond Yields  Many investors flocked to government bonds in search of safety  thus pushing yields down  Yields on the benchmark U S  10 year Treasury notes slipped to record lows this month before springing 6 bps to 1 43  on July 11 
Such low Treasury bond yields are acting as tailwinds to U S  stocks  Also  the Fed is expected to remain dovish in the coming months  waiting to watch the Brexit fallout and seeking more stabilization in the U S  economy  This ensures cheap money inflows in the days ahead  and enthused investors to turn back to risky assets once again 
Bullish Economic Data Points  Meanwhile  the U S  economy delivered solid job data for the month of June after back to back months of weak job growth  In fact  the June job data   following a shockingly downbeat May   was much eyed and the success of it brought real joy to the market from July 8  read    
If this was not enough  manufacturing data for June also came in stronger  giving investors reasons to go risk friendly while investing  read    
Will the July 11 Rally Last 
With the looming earnings recession and fear of companies slashing guidance more in the Q2 season  this rally does not seem to have legs  The Fed already pointed to the overvaluation of U S  stocks  Even  believes so  The research house expects as much as a 10  slide in the S P 500 this year before it returns to the current level of 2 100 by the end of 2016 
Goldman s 3 month  6 month  and 12 month S P 500 price targets are 1 950  2 100 and 2 150  respectively  Notably  JPMorgan Chase   Co  NYSE JPM   and Bank of America Corp  NYSE BAC    have bearish year end targets of 2 000 for the S P 500 
As per a    a decisive breakout would require consecutive weekly closes above 2135  and until then we would remain cautious   All in all  much depends on how the earnings season shapes up  things go on in foreign shores and the pace at which the U S  economy gains momentum 
Till then  investors who believe that  a trend is your friend  can play this new found optimism via the below mentioned stocks and ETFs
