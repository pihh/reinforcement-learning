6421,227936,BSET,Logitech International  Bassett Furniture  AudioEye  Meet And Telenav Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day,opinion,"For Immediate Release
Chicago  IL   April 10  2019    Logitech International   NASDAQ LOGI   as the Bull of the Day  Bassett Furniture   NASDAQ BSET   asthe Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on AudioEye  Inc    NASDAQ AEYE    The Meet Group  Inc    NASDAQ MEET   and Telenav  Inc    NASDAQ TNAV   
Here is a synopsis of all five stocks 
 
Logitech International is a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and carries a grwoth style score of B along with a value style score of C  I like this stock here as the China trade deal is probably coming in the next month or so and that could be a big tailwind for this company  Today  LOGI is the Bull of the Day 
Description
Logitech designs  manufactures and markets innovative peripherals that provide people with easy access to the digital world  The Company s product family includes Internet video cameras  mice and trackballs  keyboards  audio and telephony products  interactive gaming devices and 3D controllers 
Earnings History
I see a solid earnings history for LOGI  The company has topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters  The most recent quarter saw a beat of 12 cents for an 18  positive earnings surprise 
In fact  the average positive earnings surprise over the last four quarters is right at 18 3  
Estimates Tick HIgher
The key to the Zacks Rank is the move in earnings estimates  With a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  we know that estimates are moving higher  That is the case for LOGI  with the fiscal 2019 number moving from  1 86 90 days ago to  1 95 
The 2020 fiscal number has also bumped higher  moving from  2 07 to  2 12 over the same time horizon 
Valuation
I see a good valuation here too  with a 19x forward PE multiple  Revenue growth on an annual basis is only 6   but with margin improvement that could translate into much higher earnings estimates  A deal with China that provides more leverage for this company could easily help investors boost the multiple for this stock 
 
Bassett Furniture is a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  and today it is the Bear of the Day  The problem is  I like this stock and I think there is a good future here are the homebuilders are starting to look better and better  When people buy new homes  they also buy new furniture  so there could be some good times ahead 
Description
Bassett Furniture Industries  Inc  is a leading manufacturer and marketer of high quality  mid priced home furnishings  With over one hundred and thirty Bassett Furniture Direct stores  Bassett has leveraged its brand name in furniture with a network of licensed and Company owned stores that focus on providing consumers with a friendly and professional environment for buying furniture and accessories  The Company continues to sell its products to other retailers  in addition to the Company s dedicated retail store program  Bassett s retail strategy promotes affordable custom built furniture that is ready for delivery in the home within thirty days  The stores also feature the latest on trend furniture styles  more than one thousand upholstery fabrics  free in home design visits  and coordinated decorating accessories 
Earnings History
I see a fair earnings history  with two beat and two misses over the last four reports  The problem is that the misses are bigger than the beats  so that trend must stop as soon as possible 
Estimate Revisions
As a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  I know the estimates are moving lower  the question is how much lower 
Following the most recent beat  numbers came down and did so by quite a bit  The current fiscal year estimate has moved from  1 34 down to  0 76 over the last 90 days 
That sort of move is the basis of the Zacks Rank falling to the lowest level for this stock 
Valuation
I see a 23x forward earnings multiple  which is a little rich for a stock that is seeing only 10  annual top line growth  The price to book at 1x is very cheap and should keep the value players on the name  The price to sales multiple of 0 4x tells me that the market doesn t value their products that highly or they would trade at a multiple of more than 1x

3 Tech Stocks Under  10 to Buy Now
At Zacks  we try to avoid labeling stocks as  cheap  or  expensive   Instead  we opt to look beyond a stock s face value  and our system puts an emphasis on earnings estimate revisions to find stocks that will hopefully be winners for investors 
With that said  low priced stocks can still be attractive to investors as they present the chance to take a larger position in a company  which they might not be able to in higher priced stocks 
When searching for these low priced stocks  we still look for similar trends in growth  value  and momentum  Then we apply the Zacks Rank to properly analyze the potential that these companies have  We are also aware of the latest sector trends and make sure to cover all of the hottest industries 
Today we ve highlighted three stocks that fall into the broad  technology  sector  Each of these three stocks is currently trading for less than  10 a share and holds a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy  at the moment

The Tucson Arizona based firm s Q4 revenues jumped 103  to a record  1 78 million  Clearly  AudioEye is still an extremely small company  with a market cap of  74 63 million  Nonetheless  our current Zacks Consensus Estimate calls for AEYE s current full year revenue to soar 95  to reach  11 02 million  Meanwhile  AudioEye s adjusted fiscal 2019 earnings are expected to surge roughly 49   Peeking further down the road  the company s 2020 EPS figure is projected to soar 97  above our current year estimate to come right near break even earnings  AEYE is Zacks Rank  2  Buy  at the moment that sports an  A  grade for Growth and a  B  for Momentum in our Style Scores system

Shares of MEET have skyrocketed 124  during the last 12 months  The company also boasts a strong history of quarterly earnings beats  which includes an average surprise of 48 6  over the trailing four periods  Furthermore  MEET s valuation picture is impressive  The is profitable and is trading at just 14 9X forward 12 month Zacks Consensus EPS estimates  which marks a discount compared to its industry s 27X average and the S P s 17 2X  The firm has also experienced some upward earnings estimate revision activity recently that helps it earn a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  
3  Telenav  Inc  
Prior Close   6 35 USD
Telenav creates connected car and location based services and saw 1 3 million vehicles equipped with its technology enter the global market last quarter  The company works with companies such as General Motors  NYSE GM  and Toyota  Investors might also be happy to note that Telenav announced last quarter a partnership with Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  to bring its widely popular Alexa voice assistant technology to Telenav s navigation system offerings  which it showed off in January at CES 2019 
TNAV stock has soared 59  in 2019 to crush the S P 500 s 15  climb and its industry s 6  jump  Telenav is currently a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and rocks an  A  grade for Growth  On top of that  the Santa Clara  California headquartered company s price sales ratio of 2 07 is respectable for a growing tech company and falls below some of its peers  Telenav is expected to see its fiscal Q4 2019 earnings surge 78 3  on the back of a 269  revenue growth  Meanwhile  the connected car tech firm s full year EPS is projected to climb nearly 76   with its top line expected to soar 101 7  to reach  214 17 million

6426,227941,BSET,5 Stocks To Buy As Home Sales Surge To 10 Year High In Q1,opinion,"Further evidence that the housing market has strengthened this year emerged on Monday following the release of home sales data for the first quarter  According to the National Association of Realtors  home sales touched their highest level in 10 years  This is a clear indication that an increase in prices and mortgage rates have failed to deter new buyers 
To add this fresh sign of optimism  homebuilders  confidence increased in May  The level achieved this month was also the highest in a decade  This is why this is a good time as any to benefit from the housing sector s growth by investing in stocks gaining from such trends 
Q1 Existing Home Sales Reach 10 Year Peak
During the first quarter  total existing home sales increased by 1 4  to a seasonally adjusted rate of 5 62 million  This annual pace is the highest recorded since the corresponding period in 2007  when the metric had touched 5 66 million 
Additionally  the figure was higher than the pace of 5 36 million recorded in the same period last year as well as the fourth quarter of last year  In the fourth quarter of 2016  the metric touched 5 36 million  which indicates a 5  improvement has now occurred 
Price Rise Raises Concerns  Homebuilder Sentiment Rises
The increase in home sales was accompanied by a significant rise in prices  The national median home price increased by 6 9  from the year ago quarter to  232 100  This marks the highest gain in home prices in almost two years 
While a section of market watchers believe rising home prices and mortgage rates will deter new home buyers  others feel differently  Optimists have taken the view that millennials entering the housing market have been powering recent gains and will continue to do so 
Such sentiments have been borne out by the latest reading of the National Association of Home Builders Wells Fargo Housing Market Index  This index of homebuilder sentiment increased from 68 in April to 70 in May  The index had hit 71 in March  the highest level witnessed since Jun 2005 
Our Choices
A record increase in home sales over the first quarter suggests that the housing sector is going from strength to strength  Such an improvement is likely to continue over the rest of the year and the fresh homebuilder sentiment reading stands testament to such a view 
Picking stocks which will gain from such trends looks like a smart option at this point  However  picking winning stocks may be difficult 
This is where our  comes in  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners  However  it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM score  
We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and VGM score

6427,227942,BSET,Why La Z Boy Looks Undervalued Ahead of Earnings,opinion,"Macro Tailwinds
The U S  housing market continues to post healthy numbers and the latest consumer data shows sustained optimism about the economy  Investors looking to exploit housing s multiplier effect  or the tendency for home sales to stimulate additional spending  should be encouraged  The combination of these two factors are likely to provide tailwinds for companies tied to housing 
As one of the world s leading residential furniture producers La Z Boy Incorporated  NYSE LZB   NYSE LZB  is one company that stands to benefit  La Z Boy manufacturers and retails reclining chairs  wood furniture  and accessories through its network of company owned and independent dealers 
The furniture retailer is set to report earnings next Tuesday  let s take a closer look at how the company is positioned in this favorable environment 
Targeting Top Line Growth
La Z Boy has consistently posted solid year over year revenue growth since the financial crisis  However  growth has stagnated a bit over the past few quarters  To be fair  let s look at how peer companies Ethan Allen Interiors Inc  NYSE ETH   Bassett Furniture Industries  NASDAQ BSET   and Haverty Furniture Companies  NYSE HVT  have performed over the same period As illustrated above  growth has been mixed for LZB s peers as well  This helps ease concerns over issues specific to La Z Boy  but what is management s plan to return to more normalized growth  As outlined in the recent earnings calls  the company continues to build on several strategic initiatives Marketing FocusManagement is working to scale an improved marketing strategy that has proven to be effective in several markets  It also plans to increase marketing spend as well as improve its advertising channel mix Product ImprovementIn addition  there is a focus on improving the product mix to enhance margins  New product innovations that hold wider appeal across customer segments should also help the top line Expanding Market ShareLa Z Boy should gain market share as well  as it expands its distribution  For example  the company recently invested  20 million to acquire nine retail stores in Pennsylvania 
Operational Efficiency
While it works to boost top line growth  management has shown its effectiveness in improving operational efficiency  The company has increased its productivity and improved its procurement strategy  This has played out in an upward trending EBITDA margin 

Recent Stock Performance and Valuation
While margins have been trending upwards  La Z Boy s stock has been trading mostly side ways over the past several months 
However  the stock may gain clarity after next week s earnings report  Using finbox io s valuation models let s see how our fair value estimate compares to LZB s current trading levels 
Applying Wall Street estimates  our valuation models assumes that revenue takes a slight step back   1   in fiscal 2017 given the recent quarterly declines  But through aggressive marketing  continued demand for housing  and increased consumer optimism  revenue growth jumps back to the mid single digits thereafter  For EBITDA  crediting management s focus on efficiency  margins continue to expand modestly The assumptions above calculate an average fair value estimate of nearly  33 00 per share across twelve valuation models 
 
Compared to La Z Boy s last closing price of approximately  28 00  our fair value estimate implies almost 18  upside  Wall Street s consensus 1 year target is even higher at  34  Furthermore  this doesn t consider the stock s 1 6  dividend yield which provides even more total return potential 
La Z Boy Conclusion
A housing market on strong footing and confident consumers present tailwinds for La Z Boy Incorporated  Quarterly sales growth has stagnated recently  but management is addressing concerns with aggressive marketing  new products  and a more favorable product mix  Assuming these tailwinds and tactics can bring back the company s growth to historical rates  the stock looks to have about 18  upside with additional yield from its dividend 
Value investors looking for tangential exposure to a healthy housing market may want to take a closer look at La Z Boy before earnings next week ",2017-06-13,Finbox io,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-la-z-boy-looks-undervalued-ahead-of-earnings-200194944,200194944

6430,227945,BSET,3 Reasons Momentum Stock Investors Will Love Bassett Furniture  BSET ,opinion,Many investors like to look for momentum in stocks  but this can be very tough to define  There is great debate regarding which metrics are the best to focus on in this regard  and which are not really quality indicators of future performance  Fortunately  with our new  we have identified the key statistics to pay close attention to and thus which stocks might be the best for momentum investors in the near term This method discovered several great candidates for momentum oriented investors  but today let s focus in on Bassett Furniture Industries  Incorporated   NASDAQ BSET   as this stock is looking especially impressive right now  And while there are numerous ways in which this company could be a great choice  we have highlighted three of the most vital reasons for BSET s status as a solid momentum stock below Short Term Price Change for Bassett FurnitureA great place to look for finding momentum stocks is by inspecting short term price activity  This can help to reflect the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand right now  It is especially useful to compare it to the industry as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area With a one week price change of 5 8  compared to an industry average of  0 6   BSET is certainly well positioned in this regard  The stock is also looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the four week price change compares favorably with the industry at large as well Longer Term Price Change for Bassett FurnitureWhile any stock can see a spike in price  it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market  That is why looking at longer term price metrics such as performance over the past three months or year   and comparing these to an industry at large can be very useful And in the case of BSET  the results are quite impressive  The company has beaten out the industry at large over the past 12 weeks by a margin of 44 1  to 7 7  while it has also outperformed when looking at the past year  putting up a gain of 57 5   Clearly  BSET is riding a bit of a hot streak and is worth a closer look by investors   Bassett Furniture Industries  Incorporated Price   BSET Earnings Estimate Revisions Moving in the Right DirectionWhile the great momentum factors outlined in the preceding paragraphs might be enough for some investors  we should also take into account broad earnings estimate revision trends  A nice path here can really help to show us a promising stock  and we have actually been seeing that with BSET as of late too Over the past two months  two earnings estimates have gone higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions have helped to boost the consensus estimate as two months ago BSET was expected to post earnings of  1 47 per share for the full year  though today it looks to have EPS of  1 70 for the full year  representing a solid increase which is something that should definitely be welcomed news to would be investors Bottom LineGiven these factors  investors shouldn t be surprised to note that we have BSET as a security with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and a Momentum Score of  B   You can see  So if you are looking for a fresh pick that has potential to move in the right direction  definitely keep BSET on your short list as this looks be a stock that is very well positioned to soar in the near term Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply  one company stands out as the  1 stock to buy according to Zacks research It s not the one you think ,2017-07-10,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-reasons-momentum-stock-investors-will-love-bassett-furniture-(bset)-200200061,200200061

6462,227977,BSET,Micron Technology  Bassett Furniture Industries  Diamond Offshore Drilling  USA Compression Partners And Gulfport Energy Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day ,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   Feb 12  2018    highlights Micron Technology  Inc    NASDAQ MU   as the Bull of the Day  Bassett Furniture Industries  Inc    NASDAQ BSET   as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Diamond Offshore Drilling  Inc    NYSE DO    USA Compression Partners  LP   NYSE USAC   and Gulfport Energy Corporation   NASDAQ GPOR   Here is a synopsis of all five stocks   Micron Technology  Inc  continues to crush it as it recently raised fiscal second quarter guidance even after giving bullish guidance last year  This Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  is also dirt cheap  with one of the lowest P Es in the technology sector  or any sector for that matter Micron makes memory and storage solutions including DRAM  NAND  NOR Flash and 3d XPoint memory  Its technology is used in artificial intelligence  machine learnings and autonomous vehicles Raised Fiscal Second Quarter GuidanceAfter easily beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its first quarter in December 2017  and providing strong second quarter guidance  Micron surprised the Street by raising that already bullish guidance less than two months later On Feb 5  Micron raised its fiscal second quarter revenue guidance to a range between  7 2 and  7 35 billion  up from  6 8 to  7 2 billion Earnings per share is now expected between  2 70 and  2 75 per share versus the prior guidance of  2 51 to  2 65 It didn t provide any color about why it s so bullish  but clearly the company is still seeing strong demand this quarter Full Year Estimates Leap AgainThe analysts are even more bullish than just 2 months ago after the last earnings report 6 estimates are already higher for fiscal 2018  pushing the Zacks Consensus Estimate up to  10 13 from  9 83 in the last week  But that s a big increase from even just 60 days ago when the Zacks Consensus was a mere  7 66 That s a jump of 104  over fiscal 2017 when the company made a mere  4 96 Analysts are also getting more bullish on fiscal 2019 Investors and analysts had believed that the supply demand cycle would most likely moderate in the second half of calendar 2018  But will it 2 months ago the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2019 was just  5 95  But since the revised Q2 guidance  it has jumped to  8 67 That s still a decline of 14 4  compared with this year  however  so the analysts continue to be cautious Want to Know More On Feb 7  Micron announced that it would present at several upcoming investor conferences Investors might want to tune in on Feb 15 at the Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  Technology and Internet Conference in San Francisco or at the Feb 27 Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS  Technology  Media and Telecom Conference  also in San Francisco The company is set to report its second quarter results on Mar 22  after the bell  wherein it will likely provide some insight into how demand looks for the second half of the calendar year Micron Is Dirt CheapDespite the bullishness by the company and the analysts  the shares have sold off with the rest of the market in the recent stock market correction They re down over 12  year to date and haven t re tested the old highs in 2018  Bassett Furniture Industries  Inc  is working on positioning itself for the digital phase of retail  This Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  missed the Zacks Consensus for the fiscal fourth quarter but business isn t looking too bad Bassett is a well known furniture maker with 92 company  and licensee owned stores and a large wholesale network with more than 700 accounts  It makes both furniture and accessories  including custom built furniture that is ready for delivery within 30 days An Earnings Miss in the Fiscal Fourth QuarterOn Jan 18  Bassett reported its fiscal fourth quarter results and missed on the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6 cents  It reported  0 46 versus the Zacks Consensus of  0 52 However  Zacks has just one estimate for the quarter and the full year Wholesale sales rose 1  to  63 2 million from  62 6 million a year ago Comparable store sales fell 1 7  year over year but some of that was due to flooding from Hurricane Harvey  Four of the company s stores in Houston were closed for almost 2 weeks Excluding those 4 stores  comparable store sales fell just 0 4  in the quarter Bassett also tracks written sales  which is the retail dollar value of sales orders taken  rather than delivered  as a key store performance indicator  Written sales for comparable stores actually rose 2 7  year over year in the quarter In other good news  it intends to open 10 new stores  and reposition 2 to 3  in the next 18 months as it s finding success with both brick and mortar as well as digital New Generation 3 StoresIn the third quarter of 2018  Bassett intends to debut  in Frisco  Texas  its new  Generation 3  prototype store which will showcase Bassett s interior design and customizable home furnishings with the latest technology You ll be able to track  from a mobile device  the item  it s creation and then finally when it s being delivered Estimates Cut for the Fiscal YearAs I mentioned  Zacks only has one estimate for Bassett  but that estimate was cut in the last month which pushed the fiscal 2018 Zacks Consensus Estimate down to  1 72 from  1 98 That s the reason the stock has fallen to a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   even though earnings are still expected to be up 8 9  year over year even with the estimate revision Stock Falls  Is It a Deal Shares have taken a hit during the stock market correction  falling about 15  year to date They now trade with a forward P E of 18 5  however  until the  5  Strong Sell  ranking changes  you probably will want to stay on the sidelines Additional content Upcoming Oil Earnings to Watch  DO  USAC  GPORWe have crossed the half way mark of the Q4 earnings season  with 322 S P 500 members having reported their numbers  This accounts for 78 1  of the index s total market capitalization  Per the latest   total earnings for these companies are up 15 3  from the same period last year on 9 4  higher revenues  with 79 6  companies delivering positive earnings surprises and 76 9  beating revenue estimates Among the 16 Zacks sectors  we expect only energy to witness triple digit earnings growth of 150 1   way ahead of 43 5  growth for basic materials standing next in the que  Partial recovery in crude prices supported this massive improvement Q4 Oil   Gas Prices EncouragingWest Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude increased almost 20  in the fourth quarter of 2017  per   Through most of November and the entire month of December  the commodity traded above the  55 per barrel psychological mark  The extension of the production cut deal by OPEC players supported the rally On Nov 30  2017  OPEC members met non OPEC players to decide on an extension of the crude production cut accord  first signed in late 2016  beyond the first quarter of 2018  More than 20 oil producers  including leading exporters like Russia and Saudi Arabia  attended the meeting  As expected by most analysts  all crude exporters decided to extend the deal through 2018 end  Saudi Arabia  Russia  and their allies have pledged to put 1 8 million barrels a day of crude oil out of the market through the end of this year Like oil  natural gas prices also reflected a gain of  through the fourth quarter of 2017 Which Energy Players Could Benefit The improvement in crude prices is favorable for upstream energy players  During fourth quarter 2017  there was more production of crude and natural gas in the United States as compared to the prior year  per EIA  Higher upstream activities may call for more contracts for drillers and to the companies that provide natural gas compression services Stocks to Watch for Earnings on Feb 12Headquartered in Houston  TX  Diamond Offshore Drilling  Inc  is a leading offshore contract driller with services across the globe Last quarter  the company delivered earnings of 25 cents per share that surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 19 cents  Earnings also increased from 10 cents recorded a year ago  Diamond beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the prior four quarters  the average positive surprise being 208 4  However  our proven model does not conclusively show that the company is likely to beat earnings in the quarter under review  This is because the company has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and an  of  1 387 88   A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3 for a beat USA Compression Partners  LP   headquartered in Austin  TX   is the leading provider of services related to compression works to energy players Last quarter  the partnership reported earnings of 7 cents per unit  in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate and higher than the year ago profit of 6 cents  However  the company s earnings surprise history is not impressive  wherein it delivered an average negative earnings surprise of 6 7  for the last four quarters An earnings beat looks unlikely for USA Compression Partners  For the to be reported quarter  the partnership has a Zacks Rank  3 and an Earnings ESP of 0 00   You

production operations The company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the last four quarters  the average positive surprise being 40 8   Our proven model does not conclusively show a beat for the company this earnings season  This is because the company has a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  and an Earnings ESP of  2 02   Please note that we caution against stocks with a

6476,227991,BSET,DJTA  The Market Sector That s Consistently Outperforming The Rest,opinion,The Dow Jones Transportation Average has been powering ahead since the last week of June  It s risen five percent since  and the percentage gains on up days are handily beating other stock market indices  That s a very powerful signal indicating the appetite that institutional investors have to be buyers  Powering the Dow Jones Transportation Average has been FedEx Corporation  FDX   which has been the subject of activist investor rumors  and Alaska Air Group  Inc   ALK   which announced an 8 1  gain in revenue passenger miles in June and an 8 6  gain in capacity  It has been a very strong performance for an airline  and it s been a major stock market winner  Also helping are surprising earnings results  Bassett Furniture Industries  Incorporated  BSET  has 89 company  and licensee owned mid priced home furniture stores  According to the company  second quarter sales grew a solid 20  to  81 2 million  marking the third consecutive quarter of 20  growth or better  The company cited an improvement in customer spending and increased market share  In large caps  stock market leadership within the Dow Jones Industrials over the last two weeks has been coming from The Walt Disney Company  DIS   3M Company  MMM   The Home Depot  Inc   HD   United Technologies Corporation  UTX   and Johnson   Johnson  JNJ   Without question  I firmly believe that blue chips  including several Dow Jones components  remain the best place to be  The prospects for rising dividends remain strong  and so is the probability that earnings will meet expectations  especially in the Dow Jones components  The broader stock market is displaying incredible resilience and there is a genuine optimism in the trading action among many big investors  Blue chip leadership since the beginning of the year is pronounced with the Dow Jones Industrial Average outperforming the S P 500 and the NASDAQ Composite  And that doesn t include dividends or the downside outperformance either  It s very much a stock market that is sticking with the safest names  It s also a stock market that can push much higher  since Wall Street analysts only expect S P 500 companies to grow their earnings by 2 9  in the second quarter  according to Thomson Reuters  That modest expectation  if beaten  could result in substantial buying on the part of institutional investors having been caught in a marketplace where expectations are too low  Although the stock market has gone up substantially over the last couple of years  corporations have been very conservative with their earnings forecasts  There is a little stock market momentum right now  but we know some companies will beat the Street  In terms of the Dow Jones Transportation Average  it underperformed the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 2012  but has beaten the industrials so far this year  This breakout of transportation companies on the stock market is  of course  a classic bullish signal  But it s up to companies and their earnings results to carry equities  The stock market can go higher still if companies perform the way their stocks indicate Disclaimer  There is no magic formula to getting rich  Success in investment vehicles with the best prospects for price appreciation can only be achieved through proper and rigorous research and analysis  The opinions in this e newsletter are just that  opinions of the authors  Information contained herein  while believed to be correct  is not guaranteed as accurate  Warning  Investing often involves high risks and you can lose a lot of money  Please do not invest with money you cannot afford to lose ,2013-07-12,Mitchell Clark,https://www.investing.com/analysis/djta:-the-market-sector-that’s-consistently-outperforming-the-rest-175077,175077
6477,227992,BSET,Expect Helen Of Troy To Crush Analyst Estimates Next Week,opinion,"Our quantitative earnings model predicts that Helen of Troy s  NASDAQ HELE  Q1 EPS and revenue numbers will dramatically exceed analyst expectations  The company is expected to release earnings after the market close on Wednesday  July 8th We ll start by providing our projections  proceed to an explanation of the rationale behind the projections  and finish with some additional analysis and supplementary charts  Our track record of past quarterly earnings predictions made by the model can  EPS ProjectionsOn average  Wall Street analysts expect Helen to report  1 06 in EPS for the quarter  Our model projects a 65 75  probability that Helen will beat these projections  It expects a large beat  5 10   on consensus estimates  implying Q1 EPS will actually be between  1 11 to  1 16 Revenue ProjectionsOn average  sell side analysts on Wall Street expect Helen to report sales of  347 million for the quarter  Our model projects a 65 75  probability that Helen will beat these projections  It expects a small beat  0 5   on consensus estimates  implying that Q1 revenue will actually be between  347m to  364m 
RationaleAnalyst estimates are consistently too conservative as companies beat earnings estimates over 60  of the time  Analysts may do this to stimulate trading  e g      to obtain access to management  e g     or to confirm a prior sentiment on a stock  e g     Either way  analysts are incentivized to  play nice  with the companies they cover  and this manifests itself in earnings estimates that are consistently lower than they should be 
This pattern of earnings estimate manipulation can be taken to the extreme in certain companies  Thus  the most important factor to analyze when predicting whether a company will beat earnings estimates ahead of time is to look at its past track record of estimate beats  Helen s EPS beat history is shown below Last quarter  Helen beat the analyst consensus EPS estimate by 32   This was the third quarter in a row that the company beat EPS estimates and its seventh beat in the last 10 quarters  see Table 1 1 in Appendix   Helen clearly has a history of crushing analyst EPS expectations Last quarter EPS was also 92  higher than it was the same quarter the year before  This is important  as companies that are growing their EPS at a high rate are more likely to beat future earnings estimates  For whatever reason  analysts tend to be overly conservative when estimating the EPS of fast growing companies 
The same logic applies for revenue estimates  Helen s revenue beat history is shown below Last quarter  Helen beat the analyst revenue consensus estimate by 6 7   This was the third quarter in a row that the company beat revenue estimates but just its fourth beat in the last 10 quarters  see Table 1 2 in Appendix   Last quarter revenue was 21  higher than it was the same quarter the year before  Helen s revenue history is not as strong as its EPS track record  but still solid overall Another factor that plays a big role in our predictive model is the recent performance of Helen s stock price  We ve found through extensive historical back testing that the market tends to anticipate strong earnings ahead of time  and thus stocks are bid up in price ahead of earnings The chart below shows Helen s price performance the last six months  and compares it to the average six month performance of stocks in the household durables industry group  the consumer discretionary sector  and the overall market  It also includes the top five household durables stocks ranked by six month price performance for comparison Over the last six months  Helen s stock price has gained 51 58   This is compared to the industry group average of 11 05   the sector average of 2 95   and the overall market average of 1 94   Only 2  Bassett Furniture Industries  NASDAQ BSET  and Hooker Furniture Corporation  NASDAQ HOFT   out of the 47 stocks that make up the household durable industry group has gained more in price the last six months  having gained 77 17  and 55 12   respectively  The market is clearly optimistic on Helen at the moment  and this type of price momentum heading into earnings is a very good sign ConclusionsWhile we re confident that Helen will beat analyst estimates on July 8th  that does not necessarily mean we advise buying the stock before the release  On average  stocks that beat analyst estimates will rise in stock price by around 1 2   but there is a huge amount of variation around these averages  Many stocks will actually decrease in price after strong earnings releases  because the market can have much higher expectations than Wall St  analysts 
Valuation is the best factor available when determining post earnings announcement price changes  Cheap value stocks increase in price by a larger margin than expensive stocks after beating earnings estimates  e g     The chart below shows how Helen ranks within the market on five crucial valuation ratios Helen falls in the middle of pretty much every valuation metric  implying that the stock is neither expensive nor cheap relative to the market The chart below shows the same metrics  but ranks them within the household durables group to get a more relevant comparison 
Helen s valuation within its industry group is less impressive  Its sales yield of 51   inverse of Price Sales ratio  ranks near bottom of the group  Its price book ratio of 3 12x is high relative to the industry median of 2x It s tough to say that Helen is undervalued at current prices  though the stock does not look particularly expensive either  Short interest is low at less than 3  of the total float  which means there won t be many forced sellers should the stock beat estimates by a wide margin In conclusion  we expect Helen to beat analyst earnings and revenue estimates but for the price reaction to be modest  The stock s relatively fair valuation and low short interest implies that the market s reaction should be mild barring a major revision on projections  We will release a follow up report after the earnings release to detail our long term expectations for the stock
