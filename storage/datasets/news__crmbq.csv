2518,224033,CRMBQ,Asset Bubbles  Google Earnings  Cupcakes  And  70k Potato Salad  Yo ,opinion,"Earlier this week Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen commented that she signs that some asset classes may be overvalued  If she was hinting at the big new tech companies posting incredible earnings such as   NASDAQ FB      NASDAQ GOOGL   and   then she s probably wrong  If she were referring to asset classes like cupcake companies   70 000 potato salad  and the app Yo  Ms  Yellen might have a point 
You may have already heard but the other day some guy created a Kickstarter looking to raise 10 bucks to fund some potato salad he wanted to make  For serious donors   3 or more   he even promised a taste of the finished product  The project creator   Zack Danger Brown  now owes 2 611 people a bite of his potato salad  His project has inadvertently raised in excess of  70 000  That s right  some random dude is making the world s most expensive potato salad thanks to Kickstarter  And for just  3  you can have a bite too 
Sadly  this extravagant behavior isn t just limited to Kickstarter potato salad trolls  Just last month we saw an app called  Yo  go viral  The only thing that Yo lets users do is send a stock message to each other which literally just says  Yo  
Yo may be the ultimate  satirical  manifestation of the theory of unbundling  Mark Zuckerberg has been hard at work unbundling the one big blue app of Facebook into smaller more efficient apps that provide best in class experiences within individual product verticals  Yo is an extremely lean app that provides a top notch 0 charter messaging platform  How useful are 0 character messages  Well  that s another story 
It isn t terribly shocking that a few hundred thousand Silicon Valley cheerleaders downloaded Yo and had fun with it for a few hours  but what is surprising is that investors were willing to back the app for over  1 million 
In other news     OTC CRMBQ  finally called it quits last week  Crumbs set out to build a cupcake empire  selling overpriced concoctions of cake and frosting on expensive real estate  Last quarter appears to have been the final nail in the coffin  Crumbs reported a quarterly loss of 33c per share  a 94  increase of the quarterly loss on a year over year basis  FQ1 revenue also dropped an embarrassing 25  from  12 10M to  9 10M  The latest reports indicate that the star of CNBC small business turnaround reality TV show  The Profit   Marcus Lemonis  might be interested in teaming up with Fischer Enterprises to offer a deal to buy and rescue Crumbs 


Ms  Yellen is right  some asset classes are overvalued  like cupcakes  potato salad  and apps  yo    But if she means to say that tech stocks are overvalued across the board  she is a few months late to the party  Back in March and April  we saw bloodletting among internet names and high flier growth stocks  and Google was one of them  Price to sales and price to earnings ratios came crashing down while earnings growth has for the most part stayed the path  

Thursday after the close  Google reported earnings and showed us that its perfectly capable of keeping up with revenue expectations  even when costs per click suddenly drop 6   

Google did miss EPS expectations Thursday  but occasionally missing a profit target is just part of Google s DNA  The company spends so much money on research and development that it s impossible to know how quarterly EPS will come in each period  but as long the numbers keep going up investors don t seem to mind a miss here and there  Thursday  Google reported  12 67B revenue while the Estimize community had forecast  12 77B and the Street was low like they usually are predicting only  12 35B 

Although Google missed its earnings target  both EPS and revenue made double digit year over year advances  And investors greeted the news favorably ",2014-07-20,Estimize,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/asset-bubbles,-google-earnings,-cupcakes,-and-$70k-potato-salad,-yo!-219947",219947
