morning s conference call  Let s get started on Slide 3 with key highlights for the fourth quarter and the full year of 2019  Q4 revenue declined 1  organically due to a tough revenue comp of    with Q4 of 2018 that we have been highlighting throughout the year  Overall  2019 revenue growth was solid  up 4   at the high end of our initial annual guidance as four of our five segments delivered robust growth despite uncertain industrial macro environment in some of our end markets and operating geographies Bookings in the quarter were approximately flat year over year  posting a solid book to bill of 1 04  We are encouraged with the strength of our backlog  which stands at 8  higher than at the beginning of 2019 and is up in four out of our five segments  which we ll cover later in the presentation  Despite posting lower revenue  our earnings from continuous operations increased with margins in Q4 expanding 140 basis points  giving us confidence about our margin aspirations in 2020  We are forging ahead with our productivity and margin improvement efforts as outlined in our investor presentation in September Adjusted Q4 earnings were up 7  and for the full year our earnings grew 15   Adjusted diluted EPS was  1 54 a share for Q4 and  5 93 for the full year  which represents a 19  increase year over year  Summing up  2019 was another year of strong performance for Dover  We delivered industry leading organic growth rates in the topline  expanded margins materially  improved our cash flow conversion metrics and continued to enhance the quality of the Dover portfolio through organic investments and four bolt on acquisitions  On the back of a solid order backlog and continued momentum and execution of our margin improvement plans  we are announcing full year adjusted EPS guidance of  6 20 to  6 40 a share Let s move on to Slide 4 for more detail on the segment performance  Engineered Products segment had a solid finish to a strong year  Q4 growth was 3  and full year 5   Topline grew in the quarter on continued strong demand for our refuse collection vehicles as well as continued double digit growth in associated software  Our vehicle service business saw improvement in its European and OEM businesses and we also introduced a new ADAS calibration digital offering and we are excited about its growth prospects  Our MPG business grew in high single digits as it began shipping against a strong backlog built earlier in the year  Demand in our industrial winch and industrial automation businesses remained subdued as a result of cyclical weakness in industrial goods and automotive  Segment bookings in the fourth quarter were solid at a book to bill of 1 08 and resulting backlog higher than at the beginning of 2019  Our Q4 adjusted segment margin expanded 200 basis points on solid volume  product mix and productivity measures Fueling Solutions finished strong and delivered a year of exemplary results  Full year growth was broad based at a 11  and the segment delivered 320 basis point margin improvement with the aboveground businesses exiting the year well into the target range of 15  to 17  that we had set for it in 2018  Demand remained healthy in Q4  yielding 5  growth for the segment and was particularly strong in North America  where EMV compliance demand appears to be gaining momentum  Bookings in the segment were up 11  organically in Q4  providing a solid base for 2020  We have completed the integration of Belanger into our vehicle wash platform and the business is on pace to meet or exceed our return on invested capital hurdle Imaging   Identification declined 2  in the quarter and ended the year with 1  organic growth  Marking and coding activity was slow in Asia throughout the year  including in Q4  while other regions performed as expected  As you know  our digital textile printing business can be lumpy on the timing of orders and shipments and impacted by tariffs and financing availability in the Asian textile producing markets  Combination of these factors contributed to a slower Q4 in the textile industry activity  but we continued to work with a solid pipeline of prospective orders  Also  our digital printing workflow software is showing very good momentum with double digit growth  Backlog for the segment is up 7  year over year  The segment expanded margin by 270 basis points in Q4 and by 260 basis points for the full year  despite slower topline  exemplifying our commitment to improve productivity  cost control and pricing discipline Lastly  we recently closed the previously announced acquisition of Systech  a leading provider of traceability and brand protection software solutions  primarily to global pharmaceutical manufacturers  This offering fits logically into our marking and coding portfolio and expands the share of software and service revenue within Markem Imaje to over 15   We are excited about the prospects of driving growth by expanding this offering into our high value  fast moving consumer goods customer portfolio Pumps   Process Solutions posted an 8  decline as the segment faced a tough comparable in Q4 as a result of Maag shipment timing and witnessed a steady slowing during the quarter in the industrial pump market  where distributors were actively managing down inventory levels  Within the biopharma pump and connectors business  revenue continued its strong double digit growth and carries a very strong backlog into the new year  We expect the biopharma business to continue its double digit trajectory into 2020 With respect to DPC  our Precision Components business  activity slowed in what appears to be a temporary lull in the natural gas transportation infrastructure build out  but we remain confident about its long term attractiveness  Despite the aforementioned order timing differences  Maag ended the year well and carries a strong backlog into 2020  Summing up  all the businesses in this segment posted organic growth in 2019  yielding a segment growth rate of 4   The segment delivered an outstanding 310 basis point margin improvement for the full year  The segment is entering 2020 with a backlog that s 12  higher year over year  but we expect to get off to a slower start in industrial pumps and DPC in the first half On Refrigeration   Food Equipment  it s been an unmistakably tough year for the segment with new food retail store construction continuing to lag expectations and negatively impacting our systems and services businesses  This effect was partially offset by strong sales in the case product line that primarily serves store remodels  which continued to expand at a double digit rate year over year  including on revenue  bookings  and backlog  We have not stood still during this period with site consolidations in Unified Brands and factory automation and case set that contributed positively to earnings in 2020  Despite a challenging demand environment in 2019  our can forming and heat exchanger businesses returned to growth in Q4  Belvac s backlog is nearly doubled compared to the start of 2019  Overall  the segment enters 2020 on a positive note with a 19  higher backlog year over year  Our operational productivity initiatives remain on track to start delivering results  primarily in the second half of 2020 I ll pass it on to Brad here Brad M  Cerepak    Senior Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Rich  Good morning  everyone  Let s start going through the details on Slide 5  Rich has provided color on the growth dynamics by segment  I will point out that on top of the 1  organic revenue decline  FX continued to be a headwind in Q4  reducing topline by 1  or  20 million  We expect FX headwinds to subside in 2020  Acquisitions and dispositions  principally Belanger and Finder  contributed a  5 million net increase to revenue in the quarter  Bookings were flat organically and were similarly negative impacted by FX and positively supported by acquisitions From a geographic perspective  the U S   our largest market grew  4  organically for the full year  with all businesses except Refrigeration posting solid growth  Europe was up 6   where all five segments posted organic growth in 2019  All of Asia grew 2  organically for the full year  while China posted 3  growth  Activity in Asia was mixed across our businesses  Strong regulatory and new build demand in the fueling and plastics and polymer markets were offset in part by slower demand in industrial heat exchangers and marketing    marking and coding  Latin America was slightly down for the year  with a strong first half and a slower second half Now to the earnings bridges on Slide 6  Starting at the top  Engineered Products adjusted segment EBITDA improved  9 million  largely driven by volume and mix  more than offsetting headwinds from FX  Fueling Solutions growth of  17 million reflects a combination of robust growth  continued margin improvement in retail fueling and in part the acquisition of Belanger  Imaging   Identification grew  6 million on strong expanded margin despite lower volumes  The  6 million decline at Pumps   Process Solutions was driven by lower comparable volumes and was partially offset by stronger margins  Lastly  the decline of  7 million in Refrigeration   Food Equipment reflects lower volumes in the quarter Going to the bottom of the chart  Adjusted earnings from continuing operations improved  15 million or 7   primarily driven by higher segment earnings and lower interest and tax expenses  partially offset by higher corporate costs  The effective tax rate  excluding discrete tax benefits  is approximately 22  for 2019  Discrete tax benefits in the quarter were approximately  0 06 per share  Rightsizing and other costs were  18 million in the quarter or  14 million after tax  providing confidence on further reducing costs and increasing margins in 2020  In the quarter  we also refinanced debt due to mature in 2020 and in 2021  resulting in a  24 million loss on extinguishment or  18 million after tax  This loss is treated as an adjustment item to EPS in the quarter  The refinancing results in approximately  13 million lower interest expense on long term debt in 2020 Now on Slide 7  We finished the year with very strong cash flow  Free cash flow for the year was  758 million or  140 million over last year  including a  16 million increase in capital expenditures  The free cash flow increase exceeded growth in earnings  reflecting improved working capital discipline and resulting in a more than 500 basis point improvement in cash flow conversion as a percent of adjusted earnings  As a percent of revenue  free cash flow was 10 6  for the year or 11 1  if we exclude cash restructuring expenses  both of which are above the midpoint of our annual guidance of 8  to 12   Capital expenditures were  187 million for the year  slightly increased compared to last year  but below our original plan  While our major expansion projects remain on pace with our plan  timing of payments related to several large projects will spill over into 2020 Lastly  let s review Slide 8 with the EPS bridge  We finished the year with a strong 19  increase in earnings per share  This was driven by revenue growth conversion as well as margin improvement activities  resulting in revenue conversion margin well in excess of 100   As you can see on this    on the chart  the strength of the dollar in 2019 resulted in a negative FX impact of approximately 13      0 13 of EPS  which we do not expect to reoccur in 2020  All in all  we can expect the same dynamic into 2020  a healthy conversion on revenue growth and operational savings driving year over year EPS accretion With that  I ll turn it back to Rich Richard J  Tobin    President   Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Brad  Let s take a look at the outlooks on Slide 9  We are entering the year with encouraging backlog and a constructive demand environment across the majority of our markets  allowing us to forecast organic growth of 2  to 3   which I ll cover in detail on the next slide  Adjusted EPS is forecasted to be  6 20 a share to  6 40 a share as a result of solid revenue conversion and our previously announced cost savings initiatives  We expect earnings growth to modestly levered in the second half as a result of seasonality and timing of productivity measures  We expect another strong year of cash flow conversion of 85  to 90  of adjusted net earnings  despite higher spending on capital investment  Engineered Products is expected to grow 3  to 5  organically on continued strength in waste handling  vehicle services and our aerospace and defense business  Fueling Solutions is expected to have a slower 2020 compared to the strong past couple of years as the underground upgrade cycle in China rolls off  EMV activity in the U S  is picked up  and we expect to gain better visibility in the next couple of quarters about potential upside here  Imaging   Id is expected to grow 2  to 3   with the outlook largely dependent on conditions in Asia for both marking and coding and textile printing  Pumps   Process Solutions enters the year with a very strong backlog  and we expect it to grow 3  to 5   geared toward the second half  And finally in Refrigeration   Food Equipment is expected to grow modestly in 2020  We are entering the year with a very strong backlog  but the trajectory of the past two years calls for caution early in the year  Overall  our multi industrial portfolio with significant share of aftermarket component and service and software revenue is expected to deliver healthy growth in what continues to be an uncertain macro environment Go to Slide 11  Dover strategy is simple  but our aspirations are ambitious  We laid out key priorities in 2018 and are tracking very well delivering against those  We plan to advance the same strategy further in 2020  First  you can see from the result of our rightsizing and operational improvement in our bottom line and our cash flow  We achieved target margin performance in our Fueling business  In 2020  we will continue with the previously announced  50 million cost reduction program as well as our ongoing footprint and productivity programs in Dover Food Retail  Coupled with healthy growth in conversion  these actions will continue providing a margin accretion tailwind  Our business has sustained strong growth  while taking costs out and working on their productivity  all under uncertain macro conditions  And our top priority in capital deployment is organic reinvestment  We initiated several growth and productivity capital projects and are starting investments in our can forming and heat exchanger businesses to capture growing volumes and upgrade competitive capabilities  Part of our SG A reduction program was reinvest in its various growth  R D  and digital initiatives and we will continue investing in world class digital and operational capabilities in 2020 Lastly  we committed to disciplined portfolio enhancing M A  Over the last 12 months  we have consummated four bolt on  high fit  accretive proprietary transactions  In the priority areas of our portfolio  the M A pipeline remains active going into 2020 On a final note  I d like to address the inevitable Coronavirus questions as best I can at this early stage of developments  First and foremost  we have been in regular contact with our in country employees and have issued policy guidance using our experience from the SARS time period  We have also put in appropriate travel policies Companywide  Our production sites had planned to be down from January 24th to 30th for Chinese New Year  but we expect to remain down through February 9th in most sites  as a result of cantonal enacted safety measures  In preparation for Chinese New Year  Dover and our supplier network had built inventory to cover this period as normal practice  but we are working closely with our global supply base on potential mitigation strategies actively I would like to thank everybody at Dover for delivering a strong year and the hard work  setting us up for a good outlook of 2020  And that s it and hand it over to you  Andrey  for Q A Andrey Galiuk    Vice President  Corporate Development and Investor RelationsNicole  let s open the Q A Questions and Answers Operator Operator Instructions  The first question will come from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi Andrew Kaplowitz    Citi    AnalystHey  good morning  guys Richard J  Tobin    President   Chief Executive OfficerHi  Andy Andrew Kaplowitz    Citi    AnalystRich  in RF E  obviously  strong backlog now leaving 2019  I think you said last quarter that good door and case bookings could give you more confidence that you re at the floor of the system side  So  did the bookings plus the return to growth in beverage can and heat exchangers actually mean that you finally have good visibility into organic revenue growth in 2020 Richard J  Tobin    President   Chief Executive OfficerWell  I think on the can forming for sure and on the case side of the Refrigeration business  yes  On the systems and service portion  no  because that tends to be relatively short cycle in terms of    really doesn t carry much of a backlog  So  I think we feel pretty good about the case door backlog that we have going into the year and I think that we feel good about Belvac and I think that we feel reasonably good on SWEP on the heat exchangers Andrew Kaplowitz    Citi    AnalystOkay  that s helpful  And then just follow up on RF E margin  you talked about a 15  margin as the exit run rate for 2020  So the good bookings in Q4 gives you a better shot of hitting that run rate  Is it still on track  And the margin in the quarter  obviously  you ve talked about labor availability and over time is an issue  I assume that s what it was again in the quarter and that mitigates as you get the automation project online Richard J  Tobin    President   Chief Executive OfficerIt wasn t as much labor issues that we ve had  I think those moderated in case door production  I think that if we had any disappointment during the quarter was in Unified Brands  We had the orders  we could have shipped  but we are in the middle of doing a plant consolidation and our performance has been a little bit lumpy there  So  I think that we ve got some of our labor issues behind us in case door leading into automation and I think that from what I ve seen at least at the beginning of this year  the Unified Brands has begun    their shipment rates have gone back up  So  I think we re OK there also Andrew Kaplowitz    Citi    AnalystSo do you think you could hit mid teens as you go out end of the year here  Rich Richard J  Tobin    President   Chief Executive OfficerRight  Yeah  I mean  I think that our expectation is to exit at our target margin  Andy Andrew Kaplowitz    Citi    AnalystExcellent  Nice quarter Richard J  Tobin    President   Chief Executive OfficerThanks OperatorThe next question will come from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Jeff Sprague    Vertical Research Partners    AnalystYeah  thanks  Good morning Richard J  Tobin    President   Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  Jeff Jeff Sprague    Vertical Research Partners    AnalystGood morning  Just on the automation project itself  Rich  can you just update us just kind of what happens here in the next quarter or two  So you re starting to run beta and cut over    like where is kind of the stress point on the organization to get this right Richard J  Tobin    President   Chief Executive OfficerThat organization has been under a lot of stress  but in this particular case  we will be building inventory for the transition through the first six months of the year  So  I think it s going to be a little bit challenge from a working capital point of view  We ll be getting the beta units off with the next month or so and then our target is to    the cutover of manufacturing on a single product line in approximately June  But as we mentioned before  we re not    this automation project is not running inside the existing assembly operations of case door  So we don t expect to have any downtime associated with the start up  it s just the costs associated with the start up  including the working capital build Jeff Sprague    Vertical Research Partners    AnalystAnd just thinking about the profitability in your backlog  right  I mean a lot of that will hinge on the execution in the factory  but as you ve tried to kind of streamline the SKU count and the like  do you feel like you have kind of real visibility on the backlog profitability itself and how much of a part is that to the kind of the exit rate that you re talking about for the year Richard J  Tobin    President   Chief Executive OfficerI think that we ve got better visibility that we have had  I guess  previously  So  part and parcel to reaching our exit margins is some confidence in terms of what we have in the backlog and the margin that we should generate off of it  So it s not predicated completely on cost reduction as a result of labor content and assembly Jeff Sprague    Vertical Research Partners    AnalystOkay  great  I ll leave it there  Thank you OperatorThe next question is from the line of John Inch with Gordon Haskett John Inch    Gordon Haskett    AnalystThank you  Good morning  everybody  Good morning  Rich and Brad Richard J  Tobin    President   Chief Executive OfficerGood morning John Inch    Gordon Haskett    AnalystAnd Andrey  So the 0 to 2  R FE guide  with SWEP and Belvac coming back  and Rich  you called out case and door strength  I mean  does that    that obviously implies that the rest of that business is down  Is that business down getting better  Or are you just assuming it s down the way it s always been down or how should we think about it Richard J  Tobin    President   Chief Executive OfficerI think that we    well  we need to parse some of the pieces  but if you go back and listen or when you read the transcript  I think that we are being cautious with that particular segment because the fact of the matter is  it needs to demonstrate a couple of quarters of getting its feet under it  but I think that the part that we re going to wait and see mode is on the systems and service portion of the portfolio  We re confident that case door should be up year over year  As I mentioned  we feel good about SWEP and we feel good about Belvac and then we ll see John Inch    Gordon Haskett    AnalystThe 5 4  margin this quarter  I mean  if you haven t been running these parallel systems and the automation project  where    is there any way to get a sense of where that margin might have been if you haven t been doing this stuff Richard J  Tobin    President   Chief Executive OfficerI guess there could be  but I don t have it in front of me  right  But there are    there is a bunch of cost that we did take during the quarter that because of both the transitions are largely in UB this time around that we could normalize  but I don t want to give out  That s like  well  if this didn t count  this is what our margin would be  I just can t give you an idea of what we expect it to be in 2020 without recasting the quarter  We re just going to have to take our lumps  we re not happy with the performance and we think we ve got some good line of sight on the non Refrigeration portion of the portfolio and it s up to us to deliver on the Refrigeration piece John Inch    Gordon Haskett    AnalystThat s fair  Just lastly  Rich  I remember conversation we had where you were pretty adamant we re not going to chase industrial  software deals  and pay the big multiples some of these other companies have paid and now you ve done and what appear to be a couple of pretty nice fit bolt on software deals  I m wondering how you re now thinking about this  If you ve been able to find kind of a niche of some higher technology  higher value add without overpaying as you look at the portfolio and look to ramp up M A going forward Richard J  Tobin    President   Chief Executive OfficerI think that software by its nature  the valuations  they re higher than kind of core industrial and so it s not    but I think that my comment was more that we were not going to chase software  damn the torpedoes  right Brad M  Cerepak    Senior Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerIndependent of our business Richard J  Tobin    President   Chief Executive OfficerIndependent of our business  So  the software deals that we ve done are highly complementary to both to MI and to ESG  I think that we paid a fair price  but the fact of the matter is that software commands a higher multiple John Inch    Gordon Haskett    AnalystGot it  Thanks very much  Appreciate it OperatorThe next question is from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays Julian Mitchell    Barclays Capital Inc     AnalystThanks  good morning  Maybe just following up on how you re thinking about the seasonality through the year  I think you had mentioned in Pumps   Process and Refrigeration   Food  in particular  quite a back end loaded year  So just wanted to check if you think Dover as a whole can be in that 2  to 3  organic sales growth range through each quarter  And also  whether that net  50 million of cost save we should just spread out evenly through the year Richard J  Tobin    President   Chief Executive OfficerLet s take the second question first  Yes  on the  50 million to spread it evenly through the year  I think it s the safest bet  It s not incredibly material to the overall earnings  but I get it  it s material to the year over year projected change  I look    I think that I would    I don t think it s going to be disproportionate in terms of the revenue growth  but it clearly    we need to see where we are on pumps    on industrial pumps in Q1  We know that Maag and DPC are going to be levered because those are bigger projects  So there is some caution in those two particular businesses  The upside is EMV  right  So  if we take it    if we go back and take a look at Q4  I think we were a little bit disappointed in the demand  I think we had signaled that industrial pumps were slowing at the end of Q3  it slowed  slowed quite a bit  as you can see in Q4  so that was a kind of a disappointment versus what our forecast were  but we over delivered to such an extent on EMV and kind of net neutralized where we were On DF  I think that the earnings are back end loaded  not necessarily the revenue  because we ve got some pretty healthy backlogs on Refrigeration Julian Mitchell    Barclays Capital Inc     AnalystThank you very much  And just my follow up on capital deployment  in 2019  if I look at the cash you spend on buyback and M A and capex  each of those three items were in that sort of  150 ish million to  200 million range  rounding wise  Just wondered when you re thinking about 2020  can see the share count assumption you ve pegged  can see the capex range you ve provided  but would we be surprised if that spread is broadly similar in 2020 as it was in  19 Richard J  Tobin    President   Chief Executive OfficerI think that the capex is our best estimate at this time  I think that we would prefer the weighting toward inorganic investment to go up and capital return to go down  But if we re not spending it on one side  then it s going to come back on the other side Julian Mitchell    Barclays Capital Inc     AnalystGreat  thank you Richard J  Tobin    President   Chief Executive OfficerYou re welcome OperatorNext we have Andrew Obin with Bank of America David Ridley Lane    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystHi  this is David Ridley Lane on for Andrew  What gives you confidence around the demand improving in Pumps   Process Solutions as you go through 2020  I definitely heard your commentary that it could be softer here in the first half Richard J  Tobin    President   Chief Executive OfficerOur biopharma business  we expect to again grow in double digits  I think that our caution is around industrial pumps  We have good backlogs on a project basis in Maag  So  we feel good about that  And then DPC  we re betting on a little bit of a return to growth largely in the second half  So I think we ve got    it s a glass half full scenario  We ve got some backlogs in our project related businesses that to the extent everything remains firm  we ll deliver on those  We re going to be a little bit cautious on industrial pump demand until we see and interact with our dealers a little bit about where they stand in their stocking levels and the like  So  I think that that gives us some confidence that the only risk that we re taking in terms of the growth is largely on the industrial pumps side David Ridley Lane    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystGot it  And did the tone shift with customers around EMV upgrades  Is there a greater sense of urgency and any updated thoughts on EMV demand after 2020 would be the question Richard J  Tobin    President   Chief Executive OfficerI guess  if we look at Q4  you could make an argument that the phasing of the demand could be pulled into 2020  but we don t have enough data that allows us to say  let s move that number up in terms of how it extrapolates into revenue  But clearly  what s happening is  as you can read the newspaper every day  you re getting now the first instances of credit card fraud at retail operations and once you have that that kind of jolted a lot of people into actions  So I think that s the phenomenon that we see David Ridley Lane    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystUnderstood  Thank you very much Richard J  Tobin    President   Chief Executive OfficerYou re welcome OperatorThe next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research Nigel Coe    Wolfe Research    AnalystThanks  Good morning  So  Rich  I just wanted to kind of follow up on the pumps side  Look  obviously  industrial pumps is the area of concern  How much backlog do you have kind of underwritten already for 2020 in that revenue growth outlook you ve got  And how is that compared to sort of a normal sort of backlog builds into the fiscal year Richard J  Tobin    President   Chief Executive OfficerWell  the absolute value of the new segment in terms of backlog is up  but that is weighted toward DPC and Maag  which tend to be project driven  So we ve got some line of sight on that  The industrial portion of the business outside of biopharma is flat and that s also where the vast majority of the revenue stream goes through distribution  So  as I mentioned earlier  we saw an amount of inventory management going into Q4  We need to see where we stand and we need to get a quarter under our belt to kind of    so I think that we re cautious about industrial    on the industrial pump demand  but I think    we think    we feel good about biopharma and we feel good about Maag just based on the backlog Nigel Coe    Wolfe Research    AnalystOkay  that s helpful  I mean  it would be also helpful if you got any color on in terms of where distributor and channel inventories are right now  but I did want to touch on capex  because I was just wondering at  200 million  which is about 3  of sales  Typically  you ve been running at 3   Phonetic  and I think most of your  Indecipherable   I know    yeah  I know you re investing  You just mentioned you ve got a preference for internal investment  I m just curious how long do you think capex remain at these levels  And when do you see it dialing back Richard J  Tobin    President   Chief Executive OfficerI think we re still spending on the brand new site for our biopharma business that is going to roll off  So  as Brad mentioned before  we underspent our guidance on capex  One of the reasons that we did was  I think  we underestimated how cold it is in Minneapolis to get that building stood up  So  part of the spending is rolled into 2020  That to me is a one timer and we don t have anything like that  So we really have two or three really big projects running through our capex spending now  I think we highlighted in 2018  Using round figures in aggregate that is close to between  90 million and  100 million of capex spend  We probably spent 60     50  to 60  in 2019  We re going to roll forward to 40   Unless we come up with another project that says the brand new building based on growth  I would expect that amount of capex to come down as a percent of revenue Nigel Coe    Wolfe Research    AnalystThanks  Rich OperatorNext we have a question from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley Josh Pokrzywinski    Morgan Stanley    AnalystHi  good morning  guys Richard J  Tobin    President   Chief Executive OfficerHey  Josh Josh Pokrzywinski    Morgan Stanley    AnalystRich  just on Imaging   ID  I think the 2  to 3  seems like it would be similar to what would be in a normal year  I know maybe some persistent weakness in the fourth quarter that doesn t give you all the optimism in the world  But you re coming off some fairly easy comps  the business doesn t seem like it takes a long time to build momentum once it s generated  At what point in time could we start to see more momentum there  Or are we kind of locked into a weak 1Q  just based on your visibility and from there it becomes more of a macro call  Can you just kind of walk us through the phasing of what a better scenario would look like timing wise Richard J  Tobin    President   Chief Executive OfficerIt s very Asia dependent and forget the recent news around Asia  Asia had slowed progressively in that particular sector  I m talking about the Printing   ID portion of the business throughout 2019  So I think we re relatively cautious about expectation there quite frankly going into  20  We didn t make some deliveries that we thought we were going to make in digital printing in Q4 because of financing  letters of credit and the like  So  part and parcel to that growth rate for  20 is somewhat levered onto the textile printing business  because we believe that the orders are there  we just need to sort out some of the financing on it  So  it s hard to say  I mean  I think that s a question that we can probably answer at the end of Q1 once we see what s actually happening in Asia on the Printing   ID side to say whether we re going to have an inflection point  Having said that  we ve just invested in a complementary revenue stream for Markem Imaje  So  let s see what we can do with that going forward Josh Pokrzywinski    Morgan Stanley    AnalystGot it  And then just taking a step back  obviously  a lot of focus the last couple of years on productivity and 2020 certainly has a lot more with some of the investments you re making  capex and otherwise  Is 2020 a year where you can start to shift your gaze toward the portfolio  whether it s on the M A side or examining maybe non core pieces of the business  Or is this still going to be kind of like an eyes down productivity focused year in its entirety Richard J  Tobin    President   Chief Executive OfficerI m sure the management team is not going to like when I say this  but the productivity issue never goes away  right  So  what we are going to grind out in  20 is our expectations to grind down in  21 and going forward  and that s why we re investing quite a bit in our digital efforts and our back office efforts and a variety of other things  So we re taking the P L cost of investing in those areas with the expectation that we can grind out the productivity in the following years  So that really doesn t go away  We actually have spent a considerable amount of time on our portfolio  It hasn t translated into a lot of inorganic activity  but it s not from a lack of trying Josh Pokrzywinski    Morgan Stanley    AnalystGot it  Appreciate it Richard J  Tobin    President   Chief Executive OfficerThanks OperatorThe next question is from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs Joe Ritchie    Goldman Sachs    AnalystThanks  Good morning  everyone Richard J  Tobin    President   Chief Executive OfficerGood morning Brad M  Cerepak    Senior Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerGood morning Joe Ritchie    Goldman Sachs    AnalystJust in your Fueling Solutions organic growth guide  how much of a headwind is baked in for China underground subsiding here in 2020 Richard J  Tobin    President   Chief Executive OfficerIn percentage terms  I don t recall  I think it was  50 million more or less in terms of absolute revenue Joe Ritchie    Goldman Sachs    AnalystOkay  All right  cool  And then specifically on capital deployment  I may have missed this earlier  I know we talked a little bit about M A  but how are you guys thinking about the toggle on buyback and what should we kind of bake in or what is baked into your expectations for 2020 Richard J  Tobin    President   Chief Executive OfficerI kind of    we reset the clock  Joe  back to 2018  We said we weren t going to sit on a cash pile  Our preference is to deploy inorganically  Obviously  we did purchase    what s the total   140 million in total Brad M  Cerepak    Senior Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerYeah   143 million Richard J  Tobin    President   Chief Executive Officer 143 million of equity back this year  just because we haven t been deploying it inorganically  My preference in  20 would be the proportionality of inorganic investment to rise  But if we can t deploy it efficiently with high returns  then you can expect the same Joe Ritchie    Goldman Sachs    AnalystMakes sense  Thanks  guys OperatorNext we have a question from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Andrew Krill    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystHi  thanks  Good morning  This is Andrew Krill on for Deane  Can you comment on the price cost environment you re seeing now  and then what s being assumed for 2020 and if you re still seeing any impacts from tariffs  Thanks Richard J  Tobin    President   Chief Executive OfficerI think that that we re neutral on year over year input costs right now  I think that we ve got    we picked up  I think  the year over year benefit on inputs in the second half of 2019  So our expectation is relatively neutral and we think that pricing should be in excess of inflationary inputs  which includes labor is really our goal Andrew Krill    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystGot it  thanks  And then just a quick follow up on    so we know you have the  50 million takeout    cost takeout target for 2020  Just if the macro were to slow down more than expected  is there any potential to engage in further restructuring  And can you just size maybe what additional savings that you could read from that  Thank you Richard J  Tobin    President   Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I think that what we re taking out of the  50 million has nothing to do with the demand cycle  So that  50 million is just core reduction of costs  If the demand cycle was to turn against us  clearly  we would take action on our cost base Andrew Krill    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystOkay  thank you Richard J  Tobin    President   Chief Executive OfficerYep OperatorAnd the last question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with J P  Morgan Steve Tusa    J P  Morgan    AnalystHey  guys  thanks for fitting me in  Indecipherable  Richard J  Tobin    President   Chief Executive Officer Indecipherable  Steve Steve Tusa    J P  Morgan    AnalystThat s all right  When you guys think about kind of the dynamics around EMV  just    can you just remind us kind of how that plays out beyond  20 and what    how you see that kind of trending in  21 and  22  What we have to keep in mind on that front Richard J  Tobin    President   Chief Executive OfficerYeah  we had    our previous estimates was the peak amount would be 2020 and they would have reduced progressively in  21 and  22 more or less about 30  a year  Based on the exit rate that we saw in the fourth quarter  there is an argument to be made that it may be higher in 2020 and  21  because of adoption rates  but look  we only have one quarter of data point to model it  but I think that  as I mentioned  maybe you heard during the presentation  we know that we ve got a headwind in China demand on the underground side  We may have a tailwind on EMV but we like to get a quarter under our belt to see how that s progressing Steve Tusa    J P  Morgan    AnalystOkay  great  And then just on Refrigeration  at what stage do you kind of reevaluate the strategy with kind of trying to operate that business better  Is that    do you feel better about that today or a little more cautious about it given the kind of the sluggish    stubbornly kind of sluggish performance Richard J  Tobin    President   Chief Executive OfficerLook  I mean  we re committed to intervening on the cost base and this is the year when it takes place  Steve  So  I think that we re going to run it for the year  I think that where we re intervening is where our backlog is the strongest  So that gives us some pause for a success  There were tertiary pieces of the Refrigeration side that we re taking a look at that but not active    not kind of the production of case door  but on the case door side  I think that this is the year that we got to deliver quite frankly Steve Tusa    J P  Morgan    AnalystGot it  Okay  thanks a lot Richard J  Tobin    President   Chief Executive OfficerThanks OperatorThank you  That concludes our question and answer period  I will now turn the call back over to Mr  Galiuk for closing remarks Andrey Galiuk    Vice President  Corporate Development and Investor RelationsThanks  This concludes our conference

105809,327324,DOV,Were Q3 Earnings Estimates Too Low ,opinion,"The popular narrative about the Q3 earnings season is that the actual results look better only relative to the very low levels to which estimates had fallen  In other words  consensus EPS and revenue estimates were too easy to beat 
But had that been the case  the beats percentages should have been a lot higher than what we actually saw  With results from 447 S P 500 members or 89 4  of the index s total membership already out  we have the numbers to speak for themselves  
For the 447 S P 500 members that have reported results through Friday  November 8th  72 5  are beating EPS estimates and 57 9  are beating revenue estimates  The comparison charts below put these Q3 beats percentages in historical context 
 
 
 
 
Over the last 12 quarters  the low EPS beats percentage for these 447 index members was 66 9   2018 Q4  and the high was 79 9   2018 Q2   with an average EPS beats percentage of 75   The EPS beats percentage in Q3 started out very high  but currently remains towards the high end of this 12 quarter range 
On the revenues side  the beats percentage for this group of 347 index members has been as low as 48 3   2015 Q3  and as high as 75 4   2018 Q1  over the preceding 12 quarter period  As is the case with the EPS beats percentage  the Q3 revenue beats percentage remains within this historical range  though admittedly towards the lower end of that range 
The chart below shows the proportion of these 447 index members that beat both EPS and revenue estimates 
 
 
 
 
What this means is that Q3 estimates were likely just about right  neither too low  nor too high 
With only 53 S P 500 members still to report Q3 results  these conclusions about Q3 estimates will likely carry through to the end of this reporting season 
We have almost 450 companies on the docket reporting results this week  including 15 S P 500 members  This week s docket includes Wal Mart  NYSE WMT   WMT   Cisco Systems  NASDAQ CSCO   CSCO   Nvidia  NVDA  and others  
So  what explains the market s favorable reaction to Q3 results  
Many in the market appeared to fear a notable uptick in negative guidance for Q4 and beyond  in the wake of renewed signs of deceleration in the global and U S  economy  Weak guidance from a number of companies like Ford  F   Texas Instruments  TXN   Hasbro  NASDAQ HAS   HAS  and others reflect this reality 
But a preponderance of negative guidance from across all major sectors has failed to materialize  In other words  there is no material deterioration in the earnings picture relative to what was expected earlier  Q3 results and guidance for the current and coming quarters has been better than  feared  
The market s positive reaction to reports from the likes of Fastenal  FAST   United Rentals  URI   Kansas City Southern  NYSE KSU   KSU   Dover  DOV  and a number of the banks likely reflects this  better than feared  aspect of the results 
That said  estimates for the current and coming quarters has been coming down since the Q3 earnings season got underway  The chart below shows how 2019 Q4 earnings growth expectations have evolved since the quarter got underway 
 
 
 
 
Even more significant on the revisions front is how estimates for full year 2020 are shaping up  There has been no growth in 2019  but the market has been banking on growth resuming next year 
The chart below shows how estimates for full year 2020 have evolved 
 
 
 
 
The above negative revisions trend for full year 2020 is still within historical ranges  but a significant acceleration in estimate cuts will likley be a major negative for market expectations 
S P 500 Scorecard  as of Friday  November 1st  2019 
We now have Q3 results from 447 S P 500 members or 89 4  of the index s total membership  Total earnings  or aggregate net income  for these 447 companies are down  1 5  from the same period last year on  4 2  higher revenues  with 72 5  beating EPS estimates and 57 9  beating revenue estimates 
The comparison charts below put the Q3 earnings and revenue growth for these 447 index members in the context of what these same companies had reported in other recent periods 
 
 
 
 
Looking at Q3 as a whole  combining the actual results from the 447 index members with estimates for the still to come companies  total earnings  or aggregate net income  is expected to be down  1 9  from the same period last year on  4 2  higher revenues  The table provides a summary view of Q3 expectations contrasted with actual results for the preceding period 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Tough comparisons to last year when growth was boosted by the tax cut legislation were all along expected to weigh on earnings growth in 2019  Moderating U S  economic growth and notable slowdowns in other major global economic regions are having a further negative impact  Uncertainty about the global trade regime and growing resort to tariffs are not helping matters either 
My sense is that the final Q3 earnings growth rate will be the vicinity of what we saw in the first half of the year 
The chart below shows the earnings and revenue growth picture for the S P 500 index for Q3  contrasted with what was actually reported in the preceding 4 quarters and what is expected in the following 2 periods

105842,327357,DOV,A Reassuring Q3 Earnings Picture,opinion,"With results from more than 70  of S P 500 members already out  we have a representative enough sample to judge the Q3 earnings season  The market has generally been appreciative of the the results  with the median index member up almost three times as much in response to its Q3 earnings report relative to the preceding period 
We look at three metrics in evaluating the aggregate picture emerging out of any reporting cycle  These include the growth rates for earnings and revenue  the beats percentages  and management guidance for the coming periods 
Let s take a look at the Q3 results that have come out already in terms of these three performance metrics  
EPS   Revenue Beats Percentages
For the 357 S P 500 members that have reported results through Friday  November 1st  74 5  are beating EPS estimates and 59 7  are beating revenue estimates  The comparison charts below put these Q3 beats percentages in historical context 
 
 
 
 
Over the last 12 quarters  the low EPS beats percentage for these 357 index members was 65 3   2018 Q4  and the high was 81 8   2018 Q2   with an average EPS beats percentage of 75 5   The EPS beats percentage in Q3 started out very high  but currently remains towards the high end of this 12 quarter range 
On the revenues side  the beats percentage for this group of 357 index members has been as low as 47 3   2015 Q3  and as high as 75 9   2018 Q1  over the preceding 12 quarter period  As is the case with the EPS beats percentage  the Q3 revenue beats percentage remains within this historical range 
In other words  S P 500 members are beating EPS and revenue estimates at a rate that is about in line with historical trends  as you can see in the chart below that tracks the proportion of these 357 index members that have beaten both EPS and revenue estimates 
 
 
 
 
Q3 Earnings   Revenue Growth 
For the 357 index members that have reported Q3 results already  total earnings are down  1 9  while total revenues are up  3 6  
Please note that  total earnings  mean  aggregate net income  for the 357 S P 500 members  not mean  median or market cap weighted EPS  We prefer looking at net income as a measure of earnings and not EPS given the distorting effects of share buybacks on EPS based growth rates 
 
 
 
 
As you can see here  there is not much earnings growth  which is a function of the tough comparisons to the 2018 period when growth was boosted by the tax cut legislation 
The revenue picture is actually pretty good  though the growth pace remains on a decelerating trend  
The Guidance Picture 
Many in the market appeared to fear a notable uptick in negative guidance for Q4 and beyond  in the wake of renewed signs of deceleration in the global and U S  economy  Weak guidance from a number of companies like Ford  F   Texas Instruments  TXN   Hasbro  NASDAQ HAS   HAS  and others reflect this reality  But a preponderance of negative guidance from across all major sectors has failed to materialize  In other words  there is no material deterioration in the earnings picture relative to what was expected earlier  Q3 results and guidance for the current and coming quarters has been better than  feared  
The market s positive reaction to reports from the likes of Fastenal  FAST   United Rentals  URI   Kansas City Southern  NYSE KSU   KSU   Dover  DOV  and a number of the banks likely reflects this  better than feared  aspect of the results 
That said  estimates for the current and coming quarters has been coming down since the Q3 earnings season got underway  The negative revisions trend appears to have accelerated over the last few days  as the chart below shows 
 
 
 
 
The negative revisions trend is still within historical ranges  but a continuation of the accerlated pace of negative revisions that we experienced over the past week will be a big negative 
We have a very busy reporting docket this week  with almost 1200 companies reporting results  including 91 S P 500 members  By the end of this week  we will have seen Q3 results from almost 90  of the index s total membership 
S P 500 Scorecard  as of Friday  November 1st  2019 
We now have Q3 results from 357 S P 500 members that combined account for 80 1  of the index s total market capitalization  Total earnings  or aggregate net income  for these 357 companies are down  1 9  from the same period last year on  3 6  higher revenues  with 74 5  beating EPS estimates and 59 7  beating revenue estimates 
Looking at Q3 as a whole  combining the actual results from the 357 index members with estimates for the still to come companies  total earnings  or aggregate net income  is expected to be down  2 5  from the same period last year on  4 1  higher revenues  The table provides a summary view of Q3 expectations contrasted with actual results for the preceding period 
 
 
 
 
Tough comparisons to last year when growth was boosted by the tax cut legislation were all along expected to weigh on earnings growth in 2019  Moderating U S  economic growth and notable slowdowns in other major global economic regions are having a further negative impact  Uncertainty about the global trade regime and growing resort to tariffs are not helping matters either 
My sense is that the final Q3 earnings growth rate will be the vicinity of what we saw in the first half of the year 
The chart below shows the earnings and revenue growth picture for the S P 500 index for Q3  contrasted with what was actually reported in the preceding 4 quarters and what is expected in the following 2 periods

s take a look at the Q3 results that have come out already in terms of these three performance metrics  EPS   Revenue Beats PercentagesFor the 357 S P 500 members that have reported results through Friday  November 1st  74 5  are beating EPS estimates and 59 7  are beating revenue estimates Over the last 12 quarters  the low EPS beats percentage for these 357 index members was 65 3   2018 Q4  and the high was 81 8   2018 Q2   with an average EPS beats percentage of 75 5   The EPS beats percentage in Q3 started out very high  but currently remains towards the high end of this 12 quarter range On the revenues side  the beats percentage for this group of 357 index members has been as low as 47 3   2015 Q3  and as high as 75 9   2018 Q1  over the preceding 12 quarter period  As is the case with the EPS beats percentage  the Q3 revenue beats percentage remains within this historical range In other words  S P 500 members are beating EPS and revenue estimates at a rate that is about in line with historical trends Q3 Earnings   Revenue Growth For the 357 index members that have reported Q3 results already  total earnings are down  1 9  while total revenues are up  3 6  Please note that  total earnings  mean  aggregate net income  for the 357 S P 500 members  not mean  median or market cap weighted EPS  We prefer looking at net income as a measure of earnings and not EPS given the distorting effects of share buybacks on EPS based growth rates As you can see here  there is not much earnings growth  which is a function of the tough comparisons to the 2018 period when growth was boosted by the tax cut legislation The revenue picture is actually pretty good  though the growth pace remains on a decelerating trend  The Guidance Picture Many in the market appeared to fear a notable uptick in negative guidance for Q4 and beyond  in the wake of renewed signs of deceleration in the global and U S  economy  Weak guidance from a number of companies like Ford  Texas Instruments  Hasbro and others reflect this reality  But a preponderance of negative guidance from across all major sectors has failed to materialize  In other words  there is no material deterioration in the earnings picture relative to what was expected earlier  Q3 results and guidance for the current and coming quarters has been better than  feared  The market s positive reaction to reports from the likes of Fastenal  Dover and a number of the banks likely reflects this  better than feared  aspect of the results That said  estimates for the current and coming quarters has been coming down since the Q3 earnings season got underway  The negative revisions trend appears to have accelerated over the last few daysJoin us on Facebook  NASDAQ FB    Zacks Investment Research is

85 from the prior estimate of  5 65  5 85 for full year 2019  backed by encouraging first half results  This was driven by productivity and cost initiatives  strong demand and solid backlog  Robust order backlog  augmented by customer wins and execution of margin targets  will likely aid third quarter 2019 results Positive Earnings Surprise HistoryDover outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate over the trailing four quarters  the average positive earnings surprise being 6 91  Price PerformanceThe stock has gained around 12 7  over the past year  outperforming the  s growth of 2 3  Strong

indicating a year over year rise of 7 49   The stock also has a long term expected earnings per share growth rate of roughly 11 5  Cheap ValuationDover s trailing 12 month EV EBITDA ratio is 12  while the industry s average trailing 12 month EV EBITDA is 12 6  Consequently  the stock is cheaper at this point based on the ratio UnderpricedLooking at Dover s price to earnings ratio  shares are underpriced at the current level  which seems to be attractive for investors  The company has a trailing P E ratio of 17 8  which is below the industry average of 21 1 Growth Drivers in PlaceThroughout 2019  the Engineered Systems and Fluids segments  impressive performance  benefits from cost containment actions  as well as footprint optimization projects and retail refrigeration will somewhat negate the impact of soft demand in the Refrigeration   Food Equipment segment Dover anticipates to benefit from its targeted cost reduction initiatives in 2019  The company has executed restructuring programs to better align costs and operations with the current market conditions through targeted facility consolidations  headcount reduction and other measures Dover is progressing well with its efforts to simplify the portfolio and focus on markets with growth prospects  In sync with this  it successfully completed the spin off of its upstream energy businesses   Apergy   last May  Following the spin off  the company no longer owns the Energy segment and is aligned into three reportable segments  Thus  the divestment will enable Dover to focus on less volatile core platforms by delivering innovative equipment and components  specialty systems  consumable supplies  software and digital solutions  and support services  It will also provide a robust foundation for reinvestment  long term sustainable revenues  earnings growth and strong free cash flow generation Dover has a tradition of making successful acquisitions in diverse end markets  The company completed the acquisition of All Flo Pump Co during the June end quarter  which is likely to be accretive to the margins in the Fluids segment  Moreover  the buyout is anticipated to generate double digit Return on Invested Capital  ROIC  within three years Few Hurdles to CounterTariffs imposed on steel and aluminum products have led to higher input costs for Dover  Also  Dover s Refrigeration   Food Equipment segment has been bearing the brunt of weak retail refrigeration markets  The segment s margin was affected by lower volumes in the SWEP heat exchanger business  notably in Asia and reduced refrigeration systems demand  Thus  weak refrigeration demand and lower shipments in Asia is likely to hurt margins in the near term  Considering this  Dover s Refrigeration   Food Equipment segment s top line will likely remain weak this year Bottom LineInvestors might want to hold on to the stock  at present  as it has ample prospects for outperforming peers in the near future Dover Corporation

106015,327530,DOV,Dover  DOV  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Dover  DOV  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 18  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This manufacturer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 55 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  19 2  
Revenues are expected to be  1 86 billion  up 3 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Dover 
For Dover  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Dover will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Dover would post earnings of  1 12 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 24  delivering a surprise of  10 71  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Dover doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-10,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/dover-dov-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200438996,200438996

106131,327646,DOV,Dover  DOV  Upgraded To Buy  Here s Why,opinion,"Dover  DOV  could be a solid addition to your portfolio given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   An upward trend in earnings estimates    one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices    has triggered this rating change 
A company s changing earnings picture is at the core of the Zacks rating  The system tracks the Zacks Consensus Estimate    the consensus measure of EPS estimates from the sell side analysts covering the stock    for the current and following years 
Since a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near term stock price movements  the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors  They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time 
Therefore  the Zacks rating upgrade for Dover basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  and the near term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated  The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship  as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock 
Fundamentally speaking  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Dover imply an improvement in the company s underlying business  Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Dover
For the fiscal year ending December  2019  this manufacturer is expected to earn  5 73 per share  which is a change of 15 3  from the year ago reported number 
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Dover  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 1 9  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

with this  it successfully completed the spin off of its upstream energy businesses   Apergy   last May  Following the spin off  the company no longer owns the Energy segment and has three reportable

106135,327650,DOV,Analysts Estimate Dover  DOV  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"Dover  DOV  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 18  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This manufacturer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 13 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  2 6  
Revenues are expected to be  1 69 billion  down 12 2  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 24  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Dover 
For Dover  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  4 05  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Dover will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Dover would post earnings of  1 29 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 43  delivering a surprise of  10 85  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Dover doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-10,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analysts-estimate-dover-dov-to-report-a-decline-in-earnings-what-to-look-out-for-200405966,200405966

106278,327793,DOV,U S  Manufacturing Shrugs Supply Chain Constraints  5 Picks,opinion,Despite starting the year on a positive note  the benchmark stock indexes lost most of their sheen in the last few weeks  thanks to elevated concerns over an impending trade war between the United States and China Given the situation  the U S  manufacturing sector is rife with apprehension regarding the rise in near term prices of major inputs  skilled labor shortage and an increase in transportation costs However  healthy growth drivers like Trump s impetus to foster infrastructure spending  reduced corporate tax rates as well as a rise in new orders and inventories have proved to be the pillars of strength for the industry Although month over month performance has dipped this March  we envision that the U S  manufacturing industry has enough credentials to spring back to its normal activity levels in the next couple of weeks Henceforth  allocating your hard earned money in selective industrial picks should bear fruit         Supply Side Restraints Ailing U S  ManufacturingOverall anxiety regarding the probable impact of tariff had intensified after the Institute for Supply Management  ISM  polled its March manufacturing numbers  Falling shy of market expectations of 60 1   the Purchasing Managers  Index  PMI  touched 59 3   down 1 5 percentage points from the preceding month   U S  manufacturers were worried about a trade war  even before Donald President had formally smacked tariffs on steel and aluminum in late March The price index for March was 78 1   up 3 9 percentage points from the previous month  striking the highest level since 2011       per one third of respondents to the ISM s monthly survey Situations worsened when Trump announced his plan to impose tariffs of 25  on imported steel and 10  on aluminum  on Mar 9 Domestic steelmakers viewed this move as Trump s initiative to revive the steel and aluminum industry that has been declining over the last few decades  However  manufacturing companies that use these metals as raw materials were hit hard with high price volatility Industry players indicated that the tariff notice resulted in panic buying  which in turn raised near term prices and caused a decline in inventories for non contract customers  Especially electronic companies  hurt by one side effect of the tariffs started to hoard steel in the expectation that prices will dramatically increase  going forward Additionally  U S  manufactures are also dealing with other supply chain issues relating to skilled labor paucity  price upsurges in transportation and delivery delays  Notably  backlogs are building up in the American seaports  as cargos are more closely scrutinized for aluminum and steel content Extended lead times and supply constraints have forced some companies to postpone or miss sales deadlines Amid Qualms  U S  Manufacturing Shows PromiseThe March PMI reading of higher than 50  verifies that economic activity is booming in the U S  manufacturing sector  In fact  17 out of the total 18 manufacturing industries that were surveyed  reported growth in March  This clearly shows that the U S  industrial sector is progressing steadily In February  industrial production made a turnaround after a blink and miss activity in January  The Fed s board of governors stated that industrial production inched up 1 1  in February  as against the decline of 0 3  in the prior month  Also  capacity utilization moved up 0 7  to 78 1 in February  touching the record level since January 2015 Manufacturing upturn is currently backed by growth in production activity  new orders and inventories  with struggling supply side conditions Per March data  ISM s New Orders Index and Production Index were both above 60   signifying that production expansion prevailed amid demand supply glut  along with capacity and labor restraints As per an economist at Capital Economics     We note that the  sector  counting the U S  manufacturing stocks  is currently placed at the top 6  out of the 16 Zacks sectors Per the latest   dated Apr 6  2018   earnings and revenues of all the Industrial stocks on the S P 500 group will climb 23 9  and 12 3   respectively  year over year  for the January March quarter Improved spending in non residential construction and residential housing  entry of smarter products and Internet of

106282,327797,DOV,Is Dover Corporation  DOV  Stock A Suitable Value Pick Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Dover Corporation   NYSE DOV   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Dover has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 17 2  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 0  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Dover s current PE level puts it slightly below its midpoint over the past five years  Moreover  the current level is fairly below the highs for this stock  suggesting it might be a good entry point Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 22 3  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Dover has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 13 2  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Dover stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Dover has a P S ratio of about 1 5  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 5 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  DOV is toward the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Dover currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Dover a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Dover is just 1 0  a level that is lower than the industry average of 1 6  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Additionally  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 11 7  which is far better than the industry average of 16 3  Clearly  DOV is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Dover might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of D and a Momentum score of B  This gives DOV a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of C   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current year has seen four estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to five lower  while the next year estimate has seen one upward and six downward revisions in the same time period As a result  the current year consensus estimate has inched lower by 0 5  in the past two months  while the next year estimate has inched up by 0 3   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Dover Corporation Price and Consensus    This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineDover is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  a strong industry rank  Top 12  out of more than 250 industries  further supports the growth potential of the stock  In fact  over the past two years  the industry has outperformed the broader market  as you can see below However  with a Zacks Rank of 3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick  Moreover  broader factors at the industry level support the growth potential of the company as well 5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia  AIDS

Outlook

106284,327799,DOV,10 Dividend Stocks That Will Double Your Money,opinion,"Is it possible to double your money   quickly   buying safe dividend stocks  You bet  Let me explain how 
 Basic  income investors are enamored with higher current yields  These are OK for payouts today  but they re not going to get us 100   gains 
For triple digit profits we must pay attention to the underrated dividend hike  These raises not only increase the yield on your initial investment  but they trigger stock price increases  too 
For example  if a stock pays a 3  current yield and then hikes its payout by 10   it s unlikely that its stock price will stagnate for long  Investors will see the new 3 3  yield and buy more shares  They ll drive the price up  and the yield back down   eventually towards 3  
This is why many Dividend Aristocrats don t pay high current yields  Their prices just rise too fast  Just look at Smith AO Corporation  NYSE AOS   which perpetually yields in the low 1  range  The low yield isn t from a lack of dividend hikes   in fact  AOS keeps hiking its payout more aggressively over time  But investors just keep chasing the stock too high 
A O  Smith  AOS   A Boring Company With a Breathtaking Trajectory 
What a  problem  to have 
If you re looking for a  dividend stock double  to bring you secure gains of 100  or better  consider these ten payers  Don t be fooled by their modest current yields   these dividends will probably always look modest thanks to soaring share prices 
American States Water Company  NYSE AWR  Dividend Yield  1 7 
I ll start off with American States Water  AWR  delivers water up and down California   an absolutely necessary service that its 1 million plus customers can t go without  That results in a steady stream of revenues and income   profits that tick higher over time as American States Water slowly raises rates  It s a well worn utility story 
What s a little less common about AWR is its absurd growth 
American States Water  AWR   Is This a Utility   Or a Chip Stock  
Up next for AWR  The company likely will announce its 64th consecutive dividend increase sometime in very early August 
Dover Corporation  NYSE DOV  Dividend Yield  2 6 
American States Water may have an impressive dividend growth streak  but it s not actually a member of the Dividend Aristocrats given its small cap nature and exclusion from the S P 500  But Dover  DOV  is full fledged dividend royalty  touting an equally impressive streak of 62 consecutive years   the longest streak among Aristocrats and the third longest among all publicly listed companies 
Dover is a widely diversified industrial company whose products range from product tracing technologies to bench tools to chemical dispensing systems to commercial refrigeration units  That kind of product breadth has allowed the company to weather even the worst economic environments with the dividend not only intact  but growing each and every year 
As a note  A look at a Dover chart shows a big dip in May  Don t worry  This wasn t the effect of a nasty earnings surprise  but instead a reflection of the spinoff of Apergy Corp  NYSE APY   its oil and gas equipment and technology business 
Consecutive dividend hike No  63 should be announced sometime during the first full week in August 
First American Corporation  NYSE FAF  Dividend Yield  3 0 
Trying to get decent yield from a financial stock is like trying to wring blood from a monkey wrench  The Financial Select Sector SPDR  NYSE XLF  exchange traded fund of banks  insurers and other financial companies yields a miserable 1 6   That s why it s refreshing to come across companies such as First American Financial Corporation  FAF  
FAF sounds like a bank  but it s actually a top title insurance and settlement services provider used by real estate and mortgage companies  And  like similar companies  it offers a wide array of other products  from home warranties to property and casualty insurance to even investment advice 
First American s dividend increase schedule has been a little variable over the past five years  but it manages to get the job done at some point  The best bet for FAF s next increase announcement is sometime in mid August  with the payout itself coming a month later 
Brinker International Inc  NYSE EAT  Dividend Yield  3 1 
Brinker International  EAT  isn t nearly as recognizable a name as the brands that it owns   specifically  Chili s and Maggiano s Little Italy restaurants  which combine for more than 1 600 locations worldwide 
Brinker had been struggling mightily amid the  restaurant recession  of the past few years that saw giant chain restaurants but together a huge string of monthly same store sales declines  Brinker itself delivered a couple disappointing earnings reports that sent investors fleeing EAT shares 
That said  the company is back on the rebound in 2018 as various changes  including a heavily scaled back menu  are bearing fruit  Brinker scored a beat in its most recent quarterly report  in May   and while same store sales dipped a bit  the company still is tracking a potential growth year in comps 
Brinker also has been upgrading its dividend for several years now  and given a payout ratio of just more than half its profits  chances are EAT investors will enjoy another dividend hike announcement sometime in the middle of August 
Chili s Parent Brinker International  EAT  Tries to Reach Recovery Road 
Federal Realty Investment Trust  NYSE FRT  Dividend Yield  3 2 
Federal Realty Investment Trust  FRT  is a virtual unicorn   a real estate investment trust  REIT  in the Dividend Aristocrats  In fact  at the moment  it s the only real estate play in the whole hallowed group 
Despite what the name would imply  Federal Realty isn t a government real estate play   it s a mixed use retail REIT that focuses on high end properties in Washington  D C   Boston  San Francisco and Los Angeles  To give you an example  FRT is responsible for Pike   Rose   a commercial dining living mixed use development in North Bethesda  Maryland  that includes tenants such as Pinstripes  a bowling and bocce bistro   L L  Bean  REI Co Op and four apartment and condominium communities 
FRT has grown its dividend every year since 1972  from 7 3 cents to its current payout of  1 per share  The next hike should come in either very early August or the tail end of July 
Healthcare Trust of America Inc  NYSE HTA  Dividend Yield  4 5 
Healthcare Trust of America  HTA  is one of many  Boomer  plays   this one dubbing itself the  largest dedicated owner   operator of medical office buildings in the country   Specifically  it owns 432 medical office buildings across 33 states covering just about every region in the U S  minus  Big Sky  country 
I love niches  I love specialties  and HTA has a fairly interesting one  This REIT has specifically targeted between 20 and 25  gateway markets  that have top university and medical institutions  which means they re more likely to be hotbeds of future facility growth  That s smart 
The downside is  so far  while it has led to excellent growth in funds from operations  FFO   it hasn t led to riches for shareholders  who are sitting on essentially flat performance since 2015 
Healthcare Trust of America  HTA   What Is Wall Street Waiting For  
But HTA is among a few stocks that have seen recent insider buying   a promising sign of confidence from people who are in the know and have real skin in the game  Maybe that ll be the kick in the pants the stock needs 
Investors also could use a more robust dividend bump than they re accustomed to  Healthcare Trust s income growth has been glacial   just 6 1  total over the past five years  Look to see if management is any more generous sometime during early August or very early July  when the company is likeliest to announce its next dividend top off 
Verizon Communications Inc  NYSE VZ  Dividend Yield  4 6 
Telecom titan Verizon  VZ  has been a sleepy disappointment in 2018  off 5  year to date against a higher market  You can thank a few things for that   an uber competitive pricing environment for telcos  an earnings disappointment at the beginning of the year  and sluggishness in its Fios video offerings 
It could be worse  AT T  NYSE T  is off by about 15  as Wall Street voices its skepticism over the Time Warner acquisition 
Verizon remains a stable dividend play  however  delivering a yield well north of 4  on a payout growth streak of 11 years  No  12 likely will be announced late in August or in the first couple days of September 
Altria Group  NYSE MO  Dividend Yield  4 8 
We ve been told for years that tobacco stocks would be miserable investments thanks to increasingly strict government bans on cigarette use and dwindling consumers as anti smoking campaigns continue to take root  Yet Marlboro maker Altria Group  MO  mostly managed to swim upstream for many years 
But the stock has seemingly come up against a ceiling  peaking a couple of times in 2017 before succumbing to an eventual downtrend  Altria s earnings report from April tells a lot of the tale   the company still is squeezing out ever higher profits  at  1 9 billion versus  1 4 billion in the year ago period  But sales ticked up just a half a percent  and domestic cigarette shipping volumes actually declined by more than 4  
A 17  decline in 2018 has juiced Altria s dividend to nearly 5   however   but so has a dividend hike announced on March 1  That was actually outside the company s routine  which is to announce any increases in late August  It s very possible that the hike was The company typically
Altria actually hiked the dividend once this year  from 66 cents to 70 cents per share  but it did so away from its normal dividend hike schedule  So Altria is actually a stock to watch here in late August   namely  to see whether the company resumes its routine with a summertime dividend improvement  or simply delivered early 
Main Street Capital Corporation  NYSE MAIN  Dividend Yield  5 9 
I have a love hate relationship with Main Street Capital  MAIN   I love this business development company s ability to execute  but I hate how expensive the stock typically is  Few BDCs are run as well as Main Street Capital  but you really have to pick your spots 
As a reminder  BDCs help finance small  and midsize businesses  In Main Street s case  they provide capital for lower and middle market companies  Their target company has revenues between  10 million and  150 million  and EBITDA between  3 million and  20 million  and Main Street typically will invest anywhere between  5 million and  75 million 
Main Street is one of a few good actors in the space  and its long term performance reflects that  In fact  MAIN has nearly quadrupled the broader VanEck Vectors BDC Income  NYSE BIZD  in total returns over the past five years 
Main Street Capital  MAIN  Is Among the Best in This Brutal Biz  
While many BDCs have stagnant dividends  Main Street Capital s payout keeps ticking higher  even if it s just by a little bit year after year  The company should announce its next set of monthly payouts at the very beginning of August or the end of July   and there should be a slightly higher number attached to them 
Buckeye Partners LP  NYSE BPL  Distribution Yield  14 7 
Buckeye Partners LP  BPL  might have the highest yield of any company on this list  but it s not a product of a hyper aggressive dividend growth problem  BPL is earning its yield the wrong way  hemorrhaging shares  The stock is off nearly 60  since mid 2014  in fact  not rebounding with much of the rest of the energy space 
Buckeye Partners is mostly split into two parts   about half of its profits comes from domestic pipelines and terminals  while most of the rest comes from global marine terminals  Despite this diversified business  BPL keeps running into hurdles  such as losing a large storage customer in 2017 
The company has gone so far as to abandon its practice of increasing dividends every quarter  thanks to extremely tight dividend coverage  That having been said  the company still has a 22 year streak of annual dividend increases it probably wants to extend  so it s entirely possible that Buckeye Partners will offer up a token hike in the first week of August   roughly a year since its last dividend increase 
Lock In 100   Dividend Growth Returns
If you want a healthy retirement portfolio  it s absolutely vital that you stuff it with dividend growth stocks  High yield stocks with stagnant payouts will actually lose value over time  and your regular income checks won t stretch as far as they used to thanks to inflation drag  But dividend growth stocks will not only keep you ahead of inflation   they ll help grow your nest egg  too 
Because  like I showed you with A O  Smith  the very best dividend stocks will rise in line with their increasing payments 
Most people never realize this  But those of us who DO stand to profit handsomely and almost automatically 
It s a simple three step process 
Step 1  You invest a set amount of money into one of these  hidden yield  stocks and immediately start getting regular returns on the order of 3   4   or maybe more 
That alone is better than you can get from just about any other conservative investment right now 
Step 2  Over time  your dividend payments go up so you re eventually earning 8   9   or 10  a year on your original investment 
That should not only keep pace with inflation or rising interest rates  it should stay ahead of them 
Step 3  As your income is rising  other investors are also bidding up the price of your shares to keep pace with the increasing yields 
This combination of rising dividends and capital appreciation is what gives you the potential to earn 12  or more on average with almost no effort or active investing at all 
I ve scoured thousands of stocks out there right now  looking for the very best companies that have both rising dividends and strong buyback programs in place   the kind of stocks that could easily spin off annual total returns of 12   17   even 25  or more   doubling your money in very short order 
Right now  at this very moment  there are 7 in particular that I think you should consider buying 
They stand to do well no matter what the broad market does   regardless of what happens in Washington   and irrespective of interest rate trends

106349,327864,DOV,Zacks com Highlights  Fluor  Best Buy  Accenture  Dover And Evercore,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   March 14  2018   Stocks in this week s article include  Fluor Corp    NYSE FLR    Best Buy   NYSE BBY    Accenture   NYSE ACN    Dover   NYSE DOV   and Evercore   NYSE EVR   Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research Winning Stock Picks  Top 5 Industries with Biggest Job GrowthEvery week the government and other entities release economic reports that cover all areas of the economy   from retail sales to housing  to international trade to consumer sentiment In fact  on virtually any given day there could be anywhere from one to a handful of reports And while the financial media does cover them  they usually focus on headline numbers without doing a deeper dive This is unfortunate because within these reports often exists money making details that can quickly be uncovered with just an extra few minutes of reading For example  in the Employment Situation report  it details what sectors saw the most new jobs or labor force expansion  and which ones contracted I can remember countless times where that report got me into the right sectors and industries at the right time before anybody else was talking about them In fact  I still remember getting into housing in early 2012 while everybody else was staying as far away from it as possible  But  after seeing construction jobs continue to rise in report after report after report  I knew the housing market had turned  And that was one of the first alerts to the housing recovery   for those who knew where to look But the headline number and the obligatory one or two sentence write ups on many news sites missed the best part of the story by not going the extra mile  or paragraph  Well here we are again  with more stock picking insight  straight from last week s Employment Situation report  Last week it showed that some of the biggest job creation came from these five industries 1  Construction   61 000 up 185 000 over the last 12 months 2  Retail   50 0003  Professional   Business Services   50 000 up 495 000 over the last 12 months 4  Manufacturing   31 000 up 224 000 over the last 12 months 5  Finance   28 000 up 143 000 over the last 12 months Once these reports point you in the right direction  you can then plug in the appropriate sectors and industries to capitalize on this information and find the best stocks within those groups This is just one very specific way to do top down analysis  But you can go to any screener  like the one on Zacks com or the Research Wizard  and locate the sector  then industry of interest And that s what we re screening for today For the rest of this Screen of the Week article please visit Zacks com at  Get the remaining stocks

106381,327896,DOV,Keep An Eye On These Market Reports ,opinion,"This week we have several very important economic reports and new Fed Chairman Jerome Powell s first Semiannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress   These top tier reports  will give us key data on future indicators regarding factories  jobs  consumer confidence  and insight to the Fed s policy direction 
The biggest econ report is coming out on Thursday  the ISM Manufacturing Index   This forward looking report has a long track record of accurately gauging the direction of production  employment  new orders  and inventories 

As you can see in the chart  the ISM index has been on an upswing since the end of 2016 and has stayed above the 50 level  which indicates growth in the manufacturing sector  all the way through February of 2018   The index has remained elevated due the expansion of both the domestic and global economies  strong new orders  and positive employment data  
Current expectations are for the index to dip just slightly from its previous reading   In last month s report  new orders hit its highest level in almost 10 years   Another solid report from the ISM would be an overall positive for the industrial  factory  manufacturing  and production segments of the economy  
On Wednesday  we will get a preview of the ISM report as the Chicago Purchasing Managers Index  or PMI is released   The Chicago PMI is the most important of the regional manufacturing reports  as it is seen as having a strong correlation to the national ISM manufacturing index 
You can see the high correlation between the two manufacturing reports  with the Chicago PMI represented by the bars  and the ISM represented by the purple line   Last month the Chicago PMI showed extraordinarily strong growth with a reading of 65 7  and Wednesday s report is expected to come in just barely below that  This would still be very positive news for the manufacturing sector  as last month s reading was near its historic high  If these reports come in as expected  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  Industrial companies like Terex Corp  TEX   Century Aluminum  CENX   Roper Tech  ROP   and Dover Corp  DOV  will benefit from the positive news  
Also on Wednesday  the GDP report will be released at the opening bell   This report is considered an all inclusive measure of domestic economic activity   This report will also be important to bond traders due to its correlation with inflation measures  A bit after the GDP report is released  new Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will make his first major speech where his tone regarding inflationary issues will be very closely monitored  
We will also hear reports regarding the Consumer s view of the economy   On Tuesday  the Consumer Confidence report comes out  and on Friday  we get the Consumer Sentiment report   Of the two  the Consumer Confidence data  is the most closely watched 
The Consumer Confidence report shows the consumer s views on the overall economy  and their expectations for the next six months   This data  is also highly correlated to retail sales as you can see in this chart 
Consumer confidence has historically been a key indicator for the future of both the stock and bond markets   This is due to the fact that consumer spending impacts two thirds of the economy  and a consumer who views the economy in a positive light tends to spend more  
The index has stayed near its 17 year high for the past few months   The February reading is expected to improve slightly from its January levels   A strong repot would be a positive for several sub sectors in the retail segment which include companies like Wal Mart  WMT   Gap Inc   NYSE GPS   and Lowe s Companies  LOW   all of whom currently carry a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  rating      
Overall  this is an important week of reports  and if they come in as expected  it will set a positive tone for the markets for the near term

	Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations    

Here are highlights from Tuesday s Analyst Blog  

Machinery Stocks to Watch for Q3 Earnings Today

	The performance of machinery stocks last year was nothing worth writing home about with adverse currency movements  weakening economic conditions  particularly in China  and multi year low commodity prices plaguing the industry  The Machinery industry  which is broadly grouped under the Industrial Products sector  one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors   suffered a 21  decline in earnings in first quarter 2016 and a 1  dip in the second quarter 

	For the third quarter  a mere 4 3  of the companies in the industrial products sector  one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors  have reported their numbers so far putting up a 16  growth in earnings  Our  for the quarter for the sector reveal 3 4  growth in earnings this quarter  The industrial products sector is one of the eight sectors in our coverage that is anticipated to log positive growth in the quarter 
	Looking at the bigger picture of yet to report 464 companies  total S P 500 earnings are expected to be down 2 2  while revenues will rise 1 5   All indications at the moment point to this quarter being on track to be the 6th quarter in row of earnings declines 
	As per the Federal Reserve  industrial output edged up 0 1  in September after a 0 5  dip in August  The improvement was driven by a 0 2  rise in manufacturing output  which in turn was boosted by the production of goods such as textiles and plastics  In the third quarter  industrial production rose at an annual rate of 1 8    the first quarterly increase since third quarter 2015  Manufacturing output moved up at an annual rate of 0 9  in the third quarter 
	The industrial sector has been affected by a strong dollar and an oil price slump  Further  efforts to reduce an inventory overhang led to fewer orders being placed with factories  However  with the dollar s rally fading and oil prices stabilizing  the worst of the industrial downturn seems to be over 
	It will be interesting to see how some of the machinery stocks fare in when they release their numbers on Oct 19  Apart from beats and misses  focus will also be on their outlook 
	World wide  diversified manufacturer of industrial products  Dover Corporation  NYSE      is set to release third quarter 2016 results before the market opens  Dover reported a year over year decrease in both earnings and sales in the second quarter  Dover has outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters  with an average earnings beat of 1 21  

   

	Our proven model does not conclusively show that Dover is likely to beat on earnings this quarter  The company currently carries a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  and a 0 00  ESP  The right combination for a likely earnings beat is a positive   the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy    2  Buy  or  3  Hold   You can see 
	Lower bookings in the second quarter  weaker capital spending across several industrial end markets  continued weakness in longer cycle oil   gas exposed markets remain the primary concerns  Further  the persistent headwinds in its retail refrigeration business related to production inefficiencies remain a threat for the company   Read more  Graco Inc     NYSE       which manufactures and markets equipment to pump  meter  mix  and dispense various fluids and coatings worldwide  is also slated to release its third quarter results  after the market closes  Graco reported a 15  decline in its top line in the second quarter  In the four trailing quarters  the company reported below expected results in two while surpassing estimates in the rest with an average positive earnings surprise of 1 14     
	The combination of Graco s Zacks Rank  4  Sell  and an Earnings ESP of 0 00  makes an earnings beat unlikely this quarter 
	The company predicts difficult operating conditions in the Process segment in second half of the year  It also anticipates industrial business to remain weak in the Americas Confidential from Zacks

106507,328022,DOV,4 Machinery Stocks Likely To Beat This Earnings Season,opinion,"For quite some time  global macroeconomic headwinds have wreaked havoc on the machinery industry  Factors like fluctuating currency movements  particularly a strong greenback  and softening economic conditions  particularly in formerly fast growing markets like China  have dampened the performance of this space 
Also  the fragile energy industry led to a pullback in demand for steel  heavy equipment and other materials  which again hurt the machinery companies 
Weakness in this space substantiates a deceleration in the economy  while raising concerns about the U S  s ability to generate a sustained growth in the face of a faltering global economy 
Per Federal Reserve data released last month  industrial production   a comprehensive gauge of output across U S  factories  mines and power plants   decreased for the second month in a row in March  falling 2  from the prior year period  Output has declined in six of the last seven months  Within this index  manufacturing output  which accounts for the biggest share  fell 0 3  in March 
Another matter of concern is the weakening export demand for the U S  manufactured machinery  which continues to be hurt by a
lethargic global economy and a robust dollar 
To add insult to injury  the International Monetary Fund   IMF   continued to trim its global economic growth forecast  In a report released last month  the IMF reduced its growth projections for the U S  economy by 20 basis points  bps  to 2 4  for 2016  while cutting global growth forecast by 20 bps to 3 2  for the same year 
However  some trends indicate that it is not all bad  In fact  major headwinds of the space are showing signs of leveling off  Lately  the dollar has weakened against many other currencies  and oil prices have stabilized quite a lot this year 
Also  according to The Institute for Supply Management  for the first time since Aug 2015  economic activity in the manufacturing sector actually expanded in March  The March PMI  Purchasing Managers  Index  came in at 51 8   up 2 3  from 49 5  in February  Readings over 50  indicate that more companies are expanding their businesses  relative to those cutting their operations 
The Machinery industry is broadly grouped under the Industrial Products sector  one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors   For first quarter 2016  our growth estimates paint a grim picture for the space  Overall  the sector is expected to log a 23 4  drop in earnings for the quarter  on 9 4  lower sales  For a detailed account of the earnings outlook for this sector as well as others  please read our latest  report 
In view of these mixed factors  it will be interesting to see how some of the machinery stocks fare in their upcoming releases in the coming fortnight  In addition to beats and misses  investors will also be interested in companies  outlooks and their steps to overcome the headwinds 
Among major industry players  A O  Smith Corp   AOS  registered an earnings beat of 7 8  on strong underlying revenue growth and cost productivity  Other players such as ABB Ltd   ABB   Eaton Corporation plc  ETN  and Illinois Tool Works Inc   NYSE ITW  registered modest earnings beats of 4 6   3 5  and 2 4   respectively 
Companies that posted more impressive beats in their quarterly reports include Ingersoll Rand Plc  IR   Reliance Steel   Aluminum Co   RS  and W W  Grainger  Inc   GWW   topping estimates by 35 1   17 1  and 11 2  respectively 
On the other hand  giants like Ball Corporation  NYSE BLL  and Dover Corporation  NYSE DOV  missed estimates by 14 5  and 11 9   respectively 
At this juncture  we have selected some companies that have the potential to beat earnings in their upcoming releases  An earnings beat should help these stocks gain investor confidence and show a favorable price movement  Picking out and investing in such stocks before they report earnings can substantially boost your portfolio returns Likely Winners This Season
Picking the best stocks from the machinery space that have the potential to beat earnings estimates this season is a fairly simple task  One way to narrow down the list of choices during this earnings season is by looking at stocks that have the combination of a favorable Zacks Rank   Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy    2  Buy  or  3  Hold    and a positive Zacks  
Earnings ESP   the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate   is our proprietary methodology for distinguishing stocks that have a high chance of beating estimates in their next earnings reports  Our research shows that for stocks with this combination  the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70  
For investors seeking to profit from this strategy  we have highlighted four Machinery stocks that are currently equipped with the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat Emerson Electric Co     NYSE EMR    is a Zacks Rank  2 stock with an Earnings ESP of  3 18   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second quarter fiscal 2016 results currently stands at 63 cents  The company has registered positive earnings surprises in two of the last four quarters with a negative average surprise of 1 9   Although the surprise history for the stock has been unimpressive  it is poised for a beat this quarter 
Headquartered in Emeryville  CA  Emerson is a diversified global manufacturing and technology company  Emerson s results are expected to benefit from favorable trends in the U S  construction market as well as positive developments at the company s Commercial   Residential Solutions segment Emerson is slated to report its second quarter fiscal 2016 results before market opens on May 3 SPX FLOW  Inc     NYSE FLOW    is a global supplier of engineered flow components  process equipment and turn key systems  In addition  the company provides after market parts and services to its vast customer base in the food   beverage  power   energy and industrial end markets  The company s earnings growth is supported by the company s geographically diversified business and a large client base 
This Zacks Rank  2 stock holds an Earnings ESP of  50 00   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to be reported quarter currently stands at a loss of 2 cents SPX FLOW is slated to report its first quarter 2016 results before market opens on May 4 Nordson Corporation    NASDAQ NDSN    is a Zacks Rank  3 stock with an Earnings ESP of  3 26   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second quarter fiscal 2016 results currently stands at 92 cents  The company has had a choppy earnings history  registering positive earnings surprises in just one of the last four quarters  with a negative average surprise of 3 8   Although the surprise history for the stock has been unimpressive  the company seems poised for a beat this quarter 
Nordson Corporation is one of the world s leading producers of precision dispensing equipment that applies adhesives  sealants and coatings to a broad range of consumer and industrial products during manufacturing operations Nordson is slated to report its second quarter fiscal 2016 results after market closes on May 17 Regal Beloit Corporation    NYSE RBC    is a Zacks Rank  2 stock with an Earnings ESP of  0 92   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter results currently stands at  1 09  The company has had a fairly decent earnings history  registering positive earnings surprises in three of the last four quarters  with an average beat of 2 7  
Regal Beloit is a leading manufacturer of electrical and mechanical motion control and power generation products serving markets Regal Beloit is slated to report its first quarter 2016 results before market opens on May 9 Bottom Line
While challenges in the form of macroeconomic headwinds and growth concerns remain issues  a number of machinery companies are poised to defy the odds and get back on the growth track  A sneak peek at the space for some outperformers  backed by a solid Zacks Rank and a positive Zacks Earnings ESP  could be a great idea for investors to gain from this earnings season ",2016-05-02,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/4-machinery-stocks-likely-to-beat-this-earnings-season-200127293,200127293

Goldman Sachs  N GS  
Financials   Capital Markets   Reports October 15 before the open
The Estimize consensus calls for EPS of  4 11 vs  Wall Street s  3 36  a 22  delta  The Estimize community is also expecting higher revenues of  8 15B as compared to the Street s prediction of  7 65B

What to watch  Goldman Sachs has had some headwinds to deal with in Q3  Banks continued to be haunted by stubbornly low interest rates  which don t show any sign of tightening this year  meaning meager interest revenues for the rest of the year  Making matters worse is the recent forecast from the Mortgage Bankers Association which is expecting an 8  QoQ decline in home loan originations  Several banks have also signaled that trading revenues will fall  while equities have been strong due to volatile markets  it may not be enough to offset fixed income  currency and commodity  FICC  trading  One bright spot is M A activity which is sure to benefit investment banks such as Goldman  Completed M A deals totaled  867B vs  Q2 s  820B  6  improvement QoQ  40  YoY   making Q3 2015 one of the best quarters since the economic downturn in 2008 
Citigroup  N C  
Financials   Diversified Financial Services   Reports October 15 before the open
The Estimize consensus calls for EPS of  1 40 vs  Wall Street s  1 33  The Estimize community is also expecting higher revenues of  19 3B as compared to the Street s prediction of  18 9B 

What to Watch  Expect Citigroup to mention similar headwinds as Goldman Sachs  without the M A benefit  Despite recent upgrades from Jefferies and Credit Suisse  Citigroup s stock is still down 6  for the year  While volatile equity markets will boost revenues  fixed income trading in particular will evaporate any of those gains  Comments regarding the need for higher interest rates are also likely  Citigroup is expected to see gains particularly in consumer revenue  What the bank does have going for it is the fact that it doesn t owe any large legal fees this quarter  and that fallout from losses related to the Swiss franc revaluation in the first quarter has ceased 
Dover Corporation  N DOV 
Industrials   Machinery   Reports October 15  before the open
The Estimize consensus calls for EPS of  1 26  19 cents higher than Wall Street  a delta of 18   The Estimize community is also expecting higher revenues of  1 95B vs  the Street s expectation for  1 814B 

What to watch  No doubt  industrials is one of the weak spots this quarter  with EPS expected to come in at 1 2   Machinery is one of the detracting sectors  anticipated to decline 10 3   While Dover is not expected to have a great quarter  it seems the Estimize community believes Wall Street has revised estimates too low  The company s energy segment will be the biggest draw on results again this quarter  a business that saw revenues decline by 24  in the most recent quarter  The largest segment  Engineered Systems  which makes up 32  of total revenues  declined 9   and did slightly better on earnings which only declined 5   Fluids  a much smaller business  saw earnings increase 11  in Q2  Despite lackluster results  the company reaffirmed its updated 2015 guidance for adjusted EPS in the range of  3 75    3 90  including a  0 16    0 19 restructuring charge  Currency headwinds remain the biggest challenge  expected to shed 4  off of full year revenue 
Travelzoo Inc  O TZOO 
Information Technology   Internet Software   Services   Reports October 15 before the open
The Estimize and Wall Street consensus on TZOO are in line at  0 07  but it s on the top line that the real disparity can be seen  Estimize is looking for revenue of  35 72  7  below Wall Street s consensus for  38 5B 

What to watch  Despite the large disparity between the Estimize and Wall Street top line expectations for Travelzoo  this might still be one of their best quarters in a while  Even with Estimize s much lower revenue consensus  sales are expected to be up 6 6  YoY after 6 quarters of negative results  Similarly  EPS is expected to grow 250  in Q3 after 8 consecutive quarters in the red  Certainly the year over year comparisons are easier this quarter  After all  three of the company s divisions   travel  search and local deals   hit a wall in 2014  Travelzoo s new hotel booking platform launched in the beginning of 2014 did not receive much traction  however it looks like 2015 is back on track  showing steadier streams of traffic  This is not a huge surprise considering how well many of these travel sites have been doing thanks to US consumers having more discretionary income It s the international travelers and strong US dollar the company still has to worry about 
Mattel  O MAT 
Consumer Discretionary   Leisure Equipment   Products   Reports October 15 after the close
The Estimize community expects EPS of  0 75  well below Wall Street s expectation for  0 80  Revenues are also anticipated to come in lower  with the Estimize consensus calling for  1 891B vs  the Street s  1 897B 

What to watch  For a children s entertainment company Mattel is incredibly far behind the trend in mobile gaming  Kids aren t playing with toys anymore  they are playing apps on their iPad  and on video game consoles  While they have been trying to get into the mobile game space  none of their productions have caught on yet  especially with single game hits being produced from studios such as King Digital Entertainment PLC  N KING  and Zynga Inc  O ZNGA   Perhaps Mattel s most famous toy  Barbie  is now seen as outdated and setting unrealistic expectations for young women  In 2014  Barbie sales were down 16  compared to one year prior  To make matters even more bleak  last September Mattel lost the rights to sell Disney princess dolls to its chief rival Hasbro  O HAS   Mattel can no longer depend on selling Frozen dolls going forward  which was previously a growth area for the company",2015-10-14,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/5-companies-with-the-biggest-estimize-wall-street-deltas-going-into-earn-268032,268032

106532,328047,DOV,Blue Chip Dividend Champions   For Your Retirement Portfolio,opinion,Introduction In a previous article found here I postulated that the S P 500 was currently fairly valued  In this article  I review a specific hand selected list of Dividend Champions that I believe are reasonably priced and therefore capable of generating above average returns at below average risk  In today s low interest rate environment  I believe that high quality blue chip dividend growth stocks represent an attractive asset class that can provide a retirement portfolio with a growing income stream  Retiring Without Being Predestined to a Fixed Income Once we reach retirement  investing becomes all about income and safety  Yet over the years one of the greatest laments of the retiree is the struggle associated with living on a fixed income  Retirees have been conditioned to the notion that once they reach retirement age they must become completely risk averse regarding their investing practices  Therefore  they end up holding portfolios full of fixed income with little or no growth of either income or principal  However  it doesn t have to be that way  I believe that retirees can have their cake and eat it too  If they adhere to sound principles of investing  they can have safety  growth  and an increasing income each year  Perhaps the most important consideration regarding the appropriate investment practices of retirees relates to how you define risk  In my opinion  too much emphasis is being placed on short term price volatility as a primary determinant of risk  and too little on maintaining an appropriate standard of living that can keep up with inflation  A portfolio that provides a fixed rate of return or income stream is continuously decimated by the ravages of inflation  In other words  no matter where it comes from  the loss of purchasing power is a major risk that retirees face  Therefore  I argue that retirees should place great emphasis on building a portfolio capable of producing an increasing income stream  In order to accomplish that goal  it is imperative that a portion of the retiree s retirement fund be allocated to equities in some form or another  Carefully selected equities can provide the growing income stream that fixed income investments cannot  Although price volatility is clearly an unavoidable attribute of equity  there are equity classes that do provide a consistent and ever growing income stream  Therefore  I am suggesting that more emphasis be placed on the income component of the equity portion of the retiree s portfolio  than on the price volatility of the underlying shares  Although price volatility can be unnerving  I plan to show evidence that in the longer run  price volatility is more often than not a paper tiger  Selecting Stocks for Safety and Income Ben Graham s famous book  The Intelligent Investor  is considered by many to be the seminal work and authority on prudent investing  In Chapter 14 titled Stock Selection for the Defensive Investor  Ben Graham laid out seven quality and quantity criteria that he suggested for the selection of common stocks  These include Adequate Size of the EnterpriseA Sufficiently Strong Financial ConditionEarnings StabilityDividend RecordEarnings GrowthModerate Price   Earnings RatioModerate Ratio of Price to AssetsThere is a category of dividend growth stocks where the majority of them possess all seven of Ben Graham s quality and quantity criteria  This category is widely known as either Dividend Champions  as  and or Dividend Aristocrats published and maintained by Standard   Poor s  I have gone through these lists one company at a time utilizing the fundamentals analyzer software tool FAST Graphs   and identified the Champions and Aristocrats that I believe most closely exemplified Ben Graham s stock selection criteria  Choose Companies with the Long Legacy of Paying Dividends Although all seven of Ben Graham s criteria listed above are important  the primary focus of what follows relates to number four   the Dividend Record  Ben Graham believed that the conservative investor should only consider companies that have paid a dividend every year for at least the last 20 consecutive years  He believed that dividends represented a strong proxy for profitability since they are paid from earnings  and he liked the idea that they offered investors a return even when the company s stock price was not cooperating  This last point is a critical element of the thesis behind this article  and will be elaborated on more fully later  However  Dividend Champions and or Dividend Aristocrats go one step better than Mr  Graham s stringent dividend criteria  Not only have they paid a dividend for 20 consecutive years  in order to make these elite lists  they have also had to have increased their dividend each year for at least 25 years consecutively  Moreover  almost by definition  in order to have accomplished these dividend achievements  they for the most part simultaneously and automatically meet the other six criteria as well  Dividend Champions in Value 2013Ben Graham s Criteria 6   Moderate Price   Earnings Ratio  and 7   Moderate Ratio of Price to Assets  primarily relate to valuation  Personally  I believe that valuation is a critically important component of a good common stock investment  No matter how much I like a company  I am never willing to pay more than I believe the stock is worth  I once read that when the venerable Warren Buffett  the most famous of all of Ben Graham s students  was once asked if he was a value or growth investor  he responded  and I paraphrase as follows  I am both  I would never invest in a stock that I didn t believe would grow  and I would never be willing to pay more for it than I thought it was worth  The Dividend Champions  list currently has 105 names on it  and the Dividend Aristocrats currently has 51  All of the Dividend Aristocrats can be found in the Dividend Champions list  Therefore  I have hand screened the Dividend Champions one company at a time looking for those candidates that I believed best exemplified Ben Graham s criteria  while simultaneously could be bought at fair value  It should be noted that my selection process was partially arbitrary where I excluded companies which did not possess the consistent records of earnings that I prefer Through this process I have identified 33 of the 105 Dividend Champions that met Ben Graham s criteria and were simultaneously trading at fair value  Although I believe that each of these Dividend Champions is an extremely high quality company  this list is offered as a precursor to a more comprehensive due diligence process  On the other hand  I strongly believe that each of the 33 companies on this list represent excellent long term dividend growth investments  However  their relative attraction will be a function of the individual investor s own goals  objectives and risk tolerances  In other words  although I think all of these candidates possess attractive total return potential  some will be more appealing for their yield  others for growth  and yet others for a combination of both In order to illustrate the return and income potential of each of these selections  I have broken them down into subsets based on cap size and earnings growth rates  I start with the fastest growing large caps and then progressively move down to slower growth and smaller cap sizes  I believe this is an important way to review these opportunities  because all Dividend Champions are not the same  Some grow faster than others  some are bigger than others  some have higher yields than others  etc  Consequently  even though they are all Dividend Champions  they offer various levels of return  yield  growth  and therefore  risk At this point I believe it s useful to interject that future returns comprising of both capital appreciation and dividend income will be a function of each company s earnings growth rate  and the valuation you pay to invest in it at purchase  But as I have previously alluded to  some Dividend Champions grow fast and some do not  Consequently  and as a general rule  assuming that each is bought at a correct valuation  faster earnings growth should produce the highest long term returns  but do so at higher relative risk levels  Moreover  higher yield may produce greater total income  but perhaps a lower total return  Therefore  each situation should be examined based on its own characteristics and merits For additional clarity  I feature a sample company from each of the subsets  I believe these specific examples will provide greater insight into the opportunities that are currently available from high quality Dividend Champions found in the various subsets presented  Once again  I remind the reader that all Dividend Champions are not the same  Some grow faster  some yield more  some are riskier than the others  etc  Therefore  comprehensive due diligence is suggested on each company based on its own unique qualities and opportunities I have listed these in value Dividend Champions by order of cap size and historical earnings growth rates highest to lowest  This first set of 10 is mostly comprised of well known Dividend Champions  and is presented as a select list of attractive candidates worthy of additional due diligence  Some of the stocks on this list are extremely undervalued  AFL   while others I would classify as fairly valued  As previously mentioned  some are more appropriate for total return  some for a faster growing dividend  and others for yield and or growth of yield Dover Corporation  DOV The sample company I have selected for this first subset is Dover Corp  As with all of my following selections  I chose Dover because I believe it offers important lessons on long term investing  First of all  notice that there is a certain amount of cyclicality depicted by the occasional volatility of the orange earnings justified valuation line  but longer term Dover achieved above average earnings growth  It s important to notice how price tracks earnings very closely throughout this time frame  However  as I will show when we look at performance  Dover s dividend income increased each and every year But most importantly  there is one lesson that this graph and all the subsequent graphs will illustrate  A significant amount of criticism is directed towards common stock ownership as a result of the Great Recession of 2008  However  as I previously indicated  I believe that both recessions and the stock price action that accompanies them is  in truth  a paper tiger for those with clear knowledge supporting the ownership of blue chip stocks  In this Dover example  it is clear that both earnings and stock price fell during the Great Recession However  what is not so clear  or often forgotten  is the fact that Dover s dividend increased each year  including the recession years  Moreover  it should be noted that Dover s stock price and earnings have both recovered and achieved new highs as the recession ended and the economy began to improve  see red circle on graphs   Therefore  the lesson is that temporary stock price and earnings declines associated with blue chip profitable businesses will usually only hurt you if you panic and sell  An experienced and knowledgeable dividend growth investor knows to ignore these temporary bouts of volatility and focus more on the income they are receiving  which is their primary objective   Note that each example company is utilizing a 20 year FAST Graph with 1 year of forecasting  For graphs this long  the graph becomes too busy if I type in every year  Therefore  you will note that even though I only type in every other year  every year s data is plotted on the graph  As I previously noted  the earnings and price correlated graphs do not have every year typed in due to space constraints  Therefore  Dover s dividend growth record is best viewed by looking at the dividend cash flow table on the performance graph with each year s data included  I highlighted the Dividend Share column in dividend blue to show that Dover s dividend increased every year  I highlighted the recessionary years in yellow to illustrate that the dividend continued to grow right through the recession  notwithstanding the fact the both earnings and price had temporarily fallen Our second subset contains Dividend Champions whose future earnings growth is expected to average 10  or less  Once again  this list contains well known blue chip stalwarts that are highly recognizable  As was with our previous subset  all of these companies are represented as being priced at fair value or below  3M Company  MMM With this second subset I chose 3M Co as our sample because it offers an additional investing lesson that our Dover example did not illustrate  Note that 3M Co had a legacy of being historically overvalued by the market  Therefore  when the Great Recession of 2008 occurred  3M Co s stock price was brought back into fair value range before falling into significant undervaluation territory  However  note that earnings and price recovered as they did with Dover  However  due to previous overvaluation  3M Co has only returned to its pre recession high  Nevertheless  this once again illustrates that recessions will only hurt those that fear them As you saw with Dover  3M Co s dividends increased every year up to  through  and after the Great Recession  Consequently  level headed dividend growth investors focusing on their income stream experienced only a temporary effect on their portfolio s capital value  however  their dividend income continued to increase uninterrupted Our next subset contains mid cap companies with future earnings growth expected to be between 10    15   In theory  mid cap companies could be expected to grow earnings and dividends faster due to their smaller size Carlisle Companies  Inc   CSL Our faster growing mid cap sample is Carlisle Companies  Inc  an industrial conglomerate with an above average long term growth rate with moderate cyclicality in between  Here again we see a repeat of the lesson that recessionary price drops are temporary and capable of recovering as the economy recovers  Investors knowledgeable about this company could have avoided panic selling at the bottom  especially if they were focused on the ever increasing dividend  Precipitous stock drops are scary and painful to go through  but mostly temporary regarding blue chip dividend stalwarts As with our previous examples  Carlisle continued to raise their dividend every year  including the recessionary years  Therefore  the dividend growth investor whose goal was a rising income stream  was unaffected by the recession as long as they did not panic Our next subset contains mid cap companies with future earnings growth expected to be 10  or less  It is interesting to note that some of the higher yielding stocks in the group are contained in this subset WGL Holdings Inc  WGL WGL Holdings Inc is a gas utility that saw very little stress during the Great Recession  Earnings did flatten a little and the stock price fell only modestly  however  the dividend increased each year Utilities such as WGL Holdings Inc do not grow very fast  but typically offer a high starting yield  Consequently  they can be utilized to increase the overall yield of the entire portfolio but lack the growth characteristics of faster growing Dividend Champion counterparts Our next subset contains small cap companies with future earnings growth expected to be between 10    15   In theory  small cap companies could be expected to grow earnings and dividends even faster than mid caps due to their smaller size Our next subset contains small cap companies with future earnings growth expected to be 10  or less  As we saw with the slower growth mid cap subsets  Tompkins Financial Corp  TMP  offers an above average current yield Tompkins Financial Corp  TMP Interestingly  Tompkins Financial Corp saw very little operating stress during the Great Recession  However  their stock price did fall  but a lot of its drop can be attributed to overvaluation  Nevertheless  as with all other examples in this article  the company did continue to raise their dividend each year As it was with all of our previous examples  Tompkins Financial Corp continued to raise their dividend every year  including the recessionary years  Therefore  the dividend growth investor whose goal was a rising income stream  was once again unaffected by the recession as long as they did not panic and sell Dividend Champions Moderately OvervaluedIn addition to the 33 fairly valued Dividend Champions  I identified and selected an additional 17 that I consider moderately overvalued  To be clear  moderate overvaluation does not imply that a stock is not a good investment  And  in fact  some of the moderately overvalued candidates could produce greater returns at lower risk than some of its more fairly valued counterparts  In other words  moderate overvaluation implies that the stock is not excessively cheap  but it does not imply that it might be a poor investment  Instead  moderate overvaluation suggests that you are perhaps paying full value instead of a bargain valuation On the other hand  moderate overvaluation could also imply that with patience you might be able to invest in the candidate at a better price in the near future  Therefore  it might pay you to closely follow the moderately overvalued candidate in the event that market weakness may present a better entry point  But again  moderate overvaluation does not necessarily mean that it would be unwise to begin building a position if you really like the candidate  For example  moderate overvaluation may simply be indicating that the market is telling you that the company warrants a quality premium over other candidates that possess greater risk  These distinctions can only be made through research and judgment  and I argue only based on the individual merits of each company in question  I offer the following long term look at Kimberly Clark Corp   KMB  as a case in point Kimberly Clark CorpThe orange earnings justified valuation line represents the intrinsic value of Kimberly Clark  Clearly  the black monthly closing stock price line indicates that this high quality blue chip has often been awarded a quality premium by the marketplace  More simply stated  the black price line is most often above the orange fair valuation line  In the same vein  it should also be noted that the patient investor will from time to time be given opportunities to invest in Kimberly Clark at a bargain price  in other words  when the price is below fair value  the black price line below the orange earnings line   On the other hand  when you consider the company s excellent dividend record and above average yield  it begs the question of whether it s wise to be out of this investment or not  Kimberly Clark has a very low beta of  30    50 depending on what source you use The following long term performance table clearly illustrates that Kimberly Clark is more of an income investment than it is a growth investment  However  it should not be left unsaid that if you re patient enough to buy the stock when it is undervalued  your returns will be higher  and you re already low risk even lower The following represent the 17 moderately overvalued Dividend Champions that should be monitored for potential better entry points  However  as previously stated  I do not consider any of these candidates to be significantly overvalued  and in many cases  some of these names warrant a premium valuation  Therefore  buy  sell or hold decisions should be researched deeper and made one company at a time based on its own merit  history and valuation Summary   ConclusionsThis article was presented to express the fact that currently there are several blue chip Dividend Champion stalwarts that can be invested in at attractive values for long term growth and an increasing dividend income stream  In today s low interest rate environment  the opportunity to invest in blue chip Dividend Champions at sensible valuations provide a level of safety and performance that I believe is suitable for retirees  Normally I would suggest a blend of equities and fixed income where the fixed income was designed for maximum current income  and the equities designed to provide a raise in pay each year  However  with interest rates so low today  I feel that fixed income  bonds  is aberrantly risky  and therefore should temporarily be avoided The retiree does not need to be faced with the challenge of living out their retirement years on a fixed income or budget  Investing in quality dividend blue chip paying stocks is not as risky as some believe especially for those whose focus is more on the income stream than it is on price volatility  In truth  I only need to look to financials during the Great Recession to find examples where price drops and dividend cuts were more permanent than what was discussed in this article However  for those dividend growth investors practicing proper diversification  where any individual company only represented a small portion of their portfolio  2    5  invested in any one holding  would have only suffered minimal and temporary consequences  In other words  the price drops soon recovered  but there was never any major interruption in their dividends or the average growth of their dividends  My key point is that price volatility  even during a recession  is  as previously suggested  only a paper tiger for those with the foresight to intelligently ignore it  Finally  there are plenty of high quality reliable Dividend Champions that can be utilized by the retiree as safe and strong candidates that can be used to create an increasing dividend income stream  The list of companies presented in this article represent a list of attractive blue chip stalwarts currently available and worthy of a more comprehensive research effort  As Ben Graham intimated  companies that have a long legacy of paying a dividend  and in this case even increasing it  are indicative of healthy and strong profitable enterprises  Therefore  I recommend investors close to or already in retirement should take a closer look With my next article I will similarly cover fairly valued and moderately valued Dividend Contenders Disclosure   Long
